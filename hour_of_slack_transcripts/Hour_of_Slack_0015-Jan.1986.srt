1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
Ah, yes. Thank you, Robert.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,760
I get the little swivel chair myself.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,100
The Tower of Power.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,060
10,000 mighty watts.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:19,580
In the service of Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:25,840
Now, friends, if we can just figure out what the technical situation is on tonight's show.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,080
It's always different, see, in this studio.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,880
It's like an obstacle course when you get in here.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,160
And that makes it exciting.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,700
And if I push this.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,460
Aha! Nothing.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,180
How about this?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,600
No, nothing there either.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,660
See, friends, I've decided this time I'm going to stay on the air and fight this conspiracy of...

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,840
Let's just think.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,900
That's ridiculous.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,900
I need at least five tape decks to do this show properly.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,040
And I've...

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,040
I've got mine working.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,640
They all run at different speeds, too.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,400
That's another problem with this stuff.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
All the tapes are at different speeds.

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,940
All the subgeniuses out there hear everything at different speeds.

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,280
They all live at a completely different rate.

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,400
Weird.

26
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,660
Yeah, different time zones.

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,120
Okay.

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,260
There we go.

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,600
Praise Bob.

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,660
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
I have a bucket!

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,420
No trouble.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,880
Just get set and get going.

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,420
Amen.

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,040
Recording.

37
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,340
Everything's going fine.

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,260
No trouble.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,020
Welcome potential initiates.

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,040
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,900
Bob?

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,160
Bob?

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,740
The message is now part.

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,720
Part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,340
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

46
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,720
What about slack?

47
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,940
That's your key phrase.

48
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,120
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,060
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

50
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,580
Hour of Slack.

51
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,720
Sponsored by the Church of the Spirit.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,440
Subgenius.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:37,300
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megaphyst Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

54
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,580
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

55
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,780
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,960
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack, and saint of sales.

57
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
On planet.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,060
The

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:24,540
people try to listen to this show.

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:36,360
And we do not recommend using central nervous system depressants such as Downers, Valiums, Best Sellers, School, Work, or MTV.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,060
These are all forbidden for use with this show.

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:49,400
The incredible complexity of the recordings played here will be incomprehensible if even the most Dobbsly minds are featured in this way, friends.

63
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,520
And so, those sleepers and stumblers may be fine for listening to the radio.

64
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,160
But, it is a deadly mix with the media barrage cassettes that we are going to be playing here tonight.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,200
Oh, yes.

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,480
Stimulants are also self-defeating with this show.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,300
Your brain will attempt to somehow keep up with the show.

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,540
But, you will really just be hearing blistered echoes of your own subconscious wallowing in the egotistical delusion which these products induce.

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,520
There is also some danger of synaptic backfire in the brain pan caused by over-exercising.

70
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:24,520


71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:38,040
And, this dense packing of brain cells without proper organic coolants, such as FROP, accelerated to near fission point has been blamed for three recent cases of spontaneous human combustion.

72
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,740
So, do not play games with this show, friends.

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
You are playing with fire.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,740
Okay.

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,040
Let's get that insipid cosmic sweetness and light music off of there.

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,840
We have some...

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,700
guests here in the show.

78
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,680
One of the fabulous Smith's zombies that we had.

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,200
There, he's back there.

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,300
Look at him.

81
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,960
Pulling at those little electrodes on his neck.

82
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,500
It still itches a bit where the sutures are...

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,340
are loose or something.

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,840
We have to prepare these zombies just exactly right for use on any subgenius show.

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't know if...

86
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, look.

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
We've got a new microphone in here.

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
A new microphone?

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,880
Yeah. How's that? Stereo?

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,100
Is that stereo, I wonder?

91
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,640
Can you shut that door?

92
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,780
I don't know.

93
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,480
Oh, this is falling off.

94
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,700
Friends, everyone's falling off the edge.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,260
Just waiting to see what exciting things will be on the subgenius show next.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,400
And, well, our new guests...

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, so much for the zombies for Bob.

98
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:47,980
They snapped.

99
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,380
They all snap sooner or later.

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
You put them to work for the church and...

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,700
Sooner or later, they really see Bob.

102
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,620
They actually do.

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,420
So, let's see here.

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,140
I think...

105
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah, our new guest, Reverend Timothy Leary, I believe.

106
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,840
And he's on the...

107
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,520
He's on...

108
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,800
He's over in...

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,700
You can be anyone this time around.

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,480
You can be anything this time around.

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,820
You can be anything this time around.

112
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,800
You can be anything this time around.

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,960
You can do anything this time around.

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,960
You can be anyone this time around.

115
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,200
You're the first generation in human history to know how to control your own nervous system.

116
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,640
Change your own reality.

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,560
Change your own reality.

118
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,700
Blow your own mind.

119
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,080
Make up your own mind.

120
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,520
You can be anything this time around.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,360
You can be God this time around.

122
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,880
You've got to be God this time around.

123
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,480
You can be anything this time around.

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,500
You can be anyone this time around.

125
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,660
You can be Krishna.

126
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,400
You remember him?

127
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,460
Body paint, barefoot, flute.

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Yeah, you could be Bob.

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,060
You remember him?

130
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,960
Pipe smoking, idiot, crazy, made a lot of money, millions of bucks.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,080
You can be Porfo the dead worm this time around, folks.

132
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:40,700
Yeah.

133
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,220
Oh, duh.

134
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,320
Boy, you know, Tim, Tim, Larry, I don't know.

135
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Yeah, you can be anything this time around if you're rich.

136
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,040
Not you, Doug.

137
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,780
You can be anything this time around if you've got a paid-up visa card.

138
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,900
Right, you can be anything this time around.

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,280
Not you, Stuart.

140
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,860
Not this to you, Stuart.

141
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
You can have any date this time around.

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,380
Not you, Janer.

143
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,060
No.

144
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,000
You can, oh, that's sweetness.

145
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,220
And actually, actually, good old Tim.

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,840
I mean, what he's saying is right.

147
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,060
It's true.

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,480
You can be anything this time around if you want to pretend a whole bunch.

149
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,900
It's sickening.

150
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,760
I can't even say the title of the tape that came off of.

151
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:28,860
Mine.

152
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,080
Oh, let's lick it one time.

153
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,080
Lick it.

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,560
Lick it.

155
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Lick it.

156
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,860
Lick it.

157
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,440
Lick it.

158
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,040
Lick it.

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,600
Lick it.

160
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:45,740
Lick it.

161
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,140
Lick it.

162
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,500
Oh, let's smell it one time.

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,560
Smell it.

164
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,180
Smell it.

165
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,360
Smell it.

166
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,120
Smell it.

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,000
Smell it.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,800
Smell it.

169
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Smell it.

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Smell it.

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,160
Smell it.

172
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,240
Smell it.

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Oh, let's chew it one time.

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
Chew it.

175
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,940
Chew it.

176
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,440
Ch 봐r Empire

177
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,240
Let's bite one time

178
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,980
Bite, bite, bite

179
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,880
Bite, bite, bite

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Bite, bite, bite

181
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,620
Bite, bite, bite

182
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,760
Let's eat one time

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,160
Let's suck it one time

184
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,200
Suck it

185
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,000
Suck it

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,700
Suck it

187
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,320
Suck it

188
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,080
Suck the hella

189
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,980
Suck it

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,680
Suck it

191
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:24,740
Suck it

192
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,440
Suck it

193
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,200
Suck it

194
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,060
Suck it

195
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,220
Suck it

196
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,280
Don't suck lemons, suck sex

197
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,500
Praise Bob

198
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,540
Now see, that's

199
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,440
a

200
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,880
That's a different

201
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,600
That's the

202
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,760
Scalpel

203
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,040
Scalpel

204
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
It's a need to squirt in the universe, friends

205
00:10:59,440 --> 00:10:59,660
It is

206
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,680
It is squirt in the universe, friends

207
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,980
I really appreciate you taking time off

208
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
All right, there we go

209
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,460
That's the

210
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,360
That was the fabulous Billy Goons

211
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,260
And that was Dr. I know that band

212
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,140
I've had

213
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,300
I've been on stage having beer bottles thrown at me with that band as a matter of fact

214
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,220
The Reverend Cleve Duncan was

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,800
Is the

216
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,280
One of the main guys in the fabulous Billy Goons and now he's

217
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,140
The keyboard is for the Del Fuegos

218
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,500
The proof that the luck of Bob can work out for subgeniuses

219
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,100
That guy slaved away for the conspiracy on working in a bookstore for years

220
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,920
Doing this so-called novelty music of which I'm about to play a little bit more than he did for the church

221
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,440
Can't play much of it because it's nasty, nasty, nasty

222
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,260
Friends, this could be if it weren't for the FCC

223
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,260
If the FCC would let us speak the truth

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,580
The king's nasty English the way people talk

225
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,520
I wouldn't have to edit the subgenius tapes before we played them

226
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,220
90% of our stuff is

227
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,960
Really, really dirty and good

228
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
Yeah, it's illegal

229
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,880
It's illegally wonderful

230
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,060
So, but anyway

231
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,840
Oh, someone just called

232
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,220
We just got a call from a listener

233
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,520
And I'm gonna

234
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
He was asking where

235
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,820
How he could send us a tape

236
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,520
I'm gonna try talking to another listener here on the air

237
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,480
Let's see how this works

238
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,500
This is K-N-O-N

239
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,400
Hold on, let me put you on hold for a second

240
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,460
Would you guys talk to this guy?

241
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,100
Well, friends, it turns out

242
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
See, they have a button in here that says

243
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,300
If you push it, you're supposed to be able to get the phone on the air

244
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,620
And it

245
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,980
Wait a minute, let's try it this way

246
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,520
How's that?

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,620
Hear anything?

248
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,200
Say hello

249
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,360
Hello

250
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,360


251
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,320
No

252
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
Friends, see, now once again

253
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,460
That's some subgenius technical difficulties

254
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,820
I'll just get

255
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,240
Let's get back to Reverend Cleve

256
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh, dear

257
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,800
See, I tried to do call-ins, friends

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,860
But as I was saying

259
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,220
If you want to send a tape to this show

260
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,740
We play a lot of cassettes

261
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,760
And you can send that to the church of the subgenius

262
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,980
I'm gonna read that P.O. box

263
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,280
And I'm gonna give the P.O. box again at the end of the broadcast

264
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,180
For right now, just right now

265
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,920
Right to Bob

266
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,120
At one fo-

267
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,200
Post Office Box 140306

268
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,280
Dallas, Texas 75214

269
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,180
That's Box 140306

270
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,340
Zip code 75214

271
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
Anyway, welcome to the end times, folks

272
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,280
Welcome to the end times, boys and girls

273
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
We're gonna shock shock the house

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,460
Put your brain in a whirl

275
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,480
Bob is getting down with you here tonight

276
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,860
Bob is getting down to help your plight

277
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,120
Bob is coming here to ease your strife

278
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,380
Come on, suckers, let Bob into your life

279
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,400
When I'm MC Cleve, I'm a master of rap

280
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,980
Well, see, friends, I can't play

281
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,600
I can't play the rest of that song

282
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,860
Sad, sad, sad

283
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm gonna have to find something else here

284
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,380
Bastard

285
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,680
Oh, yes

286
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,340
Right now, with the

287
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
With the

288
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,960
We have these tiny mustaches

289
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,080
And I'm glad to have those

290
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,100
Oh, there goes a few more of those dissenters

291
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,140
We have some disbelievers out there

292
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,540
And we're glad you callers'll call up and support us

293
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,860
Because as you can see in the background on camera six here

294
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,620
We've had to eliminate a few of the dissenters

295
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,800
Small political problem

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,060
It's only after a phone call

297
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,500
That not pertinent to the relevance

298
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,940
Or convenience

299
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,340
Got no real reason to sentence the senior

300
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,280
Working for the Nazis

301
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,320
In 1985

302
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,120
How did those nasty Nazis ever stay alive?

303
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,740
Well, the government hired them and they brought them to the states.

304
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,620
They dressed them up in brand new suits and made them look pretty great.

305
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,700
Oh, yes, friends.

306
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,560
This is the least prepared hour of slack show in the world, I must say.

307
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,920
It's chaos, but feel that chaos hit, friends.

308
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,700
This show has got waves of chaos washing over it.

309
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,060
Swimming in chaos.

310
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,640
Friends, you're swimming in a sea of pills and you just can't see them.

311
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,680
Oh, get a good whiff of that church air while you got some purdy music here.

312
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,320
Mmm, punchy.

313
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,680
Makes you punchy to get a good big dose of that slack coming off the airwaves.

314
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,180
Go ahead, hug that radio speaker, friends.

315
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Mmm, good.

316
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,120
Mighty, mighty good.

317
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,500
Oh, thank you, Bob.

318
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,280
Put your socks on.

319
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you, Bob.

320
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,840
For cleansing my memory.

321
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you, Bob.

322
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,320
For helping me sleep.

323
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,320
And, Bob, I'll follow you always.

324
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,300
That's right, Bob.

325
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,680
Until that next day.

326
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,460
Thank you, Bob.

327
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,460
For sending them pills.

328
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Thank you, Bob.

329
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,840
For finding me willing.

330
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
Teenage girls.

331
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,480
And, Bob, I'll follow you always.

332
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,460
That's right, Bob.

333
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,600
For making sure that you have a good day.

334
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,540
How about that?

335
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:20,320
Boy, how estamos?

336
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,000
¶¶

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,480
That was Buck Naked and the Jaybirds, friends.

338
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,120
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

339
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,460
¶¶

340
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,220
of men many times.

341
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,960
But each time have I killed myself, for thy stench offendeth me.

342
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:13,620
Yea, thy stench of the spirit is like unto a million slaughtered swine, and in these

343
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,460
times thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of thine own making, which is of mine own

344
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,200
making, and where there was a sieve to catch the ill light of my glory of the sun, there

345
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,540
now is none, and the full glory cometh through the clouds, and thy children shall be bent

346
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,860
and changed, and shall bear the new plague for ever after.

347
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,140
Pretty depressing, huh, folks?

348
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,420
Yeah, well, that's the way some of these religions...

349
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,760
are, and we can't help it if Bob predicts terrible disasters for the future, and I

350
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,880
can't help it if only one of the cassette decks works in here, and I can't queue things

351
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,660
up ahead of time and see whether they're X-rated or not, so let's hope this one's not.

352
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,820
Reading the pamphlet, over and over again.

353
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,260
Friends, have you been reading that pamphlet?

354
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I mean, we literally demand that you read the subgenius.

355
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,360
We don't read the material until you memorize it.

356
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,240
And if you don't, then that's fine, I mean, you just don't get to board the escape vessels

357
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,160
in the end times.

358
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,060
Friends, we're gonna play that one at the very end of the broadcast, because that one

359
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:37,900
always gets requested, but we've got some strange times coming up.

360
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,800
Listen.

361
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,600
Listen carefully.

362
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Join me in knowing that the world is not mine.

363
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,600


364
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:43,600


365
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,880
I'm reading the headlines of tomorrow today.

366
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm not gonna judge you, but I'll see you, Julia, if I'm judging you.

367
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:01,540
I predict public executions will be shown on television, sponsored by your local gas

368
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,160
company.

369
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,360
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

370
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:13,500
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

371
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:13,580
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

372
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,340
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period.

373
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,760
School built on sweet potato pie.

374
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,220
Gee, that's a headline.

375
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:37,360
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into the air, people

376
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,500
would soon quieten and not be hurt.

377
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,940
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

378
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,540
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

379
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:43,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

380
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


381
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


382
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


383
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


384
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


385
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


386
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,560


387
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,160
She is a cutie, isn't she?

388
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,860
What a girl!

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Right on campus is part of getting high.

390
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,240
I mean, uh, getting higher.

391
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:50,780
Isn't she?

392
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,820
This is just wonderful in any language.

393
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,880
Here's Bobby.

394
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:03,620
LSD is running its mad course, with babies now being born hideously deformed from women

395
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,780
whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug, which was invented originally

396
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,360
by the Chemical Warfare Branch of the United States Army.

397
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,120
as a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy.

398
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,460
Here you see the heroic robots, the Lettys, who defended San Francisco against the dastardly attack.

399
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,700
Alright, I've seen enough.

400
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,840
Well, you know, who knows what could happen here.

401
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,500
Bob got to Reagan in time to save him, President Bush...

402
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,780
We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

403
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,980
And remember my friends, future events such as these will affect you in the future.

404
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,360
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

405
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,380
That is why you are here.

406
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:06,020
And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened on that fateful day.

407
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,780
We are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimonies.

408
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,340
The testimonies of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal.

409
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,220
The incidents, the places.

410
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,120
My friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer.

411
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,360
Let us punish the guilty.

412
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,880
Let us reward the innocent.

413
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,700
Let us give them a chance to live.

414
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,020
You can relax and enjoy this quality product.

415
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:55,260
Secure in the knowledge that it has been specially created for the lover of fine things and the man of good taste.

416
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,820
Oh, sorry, you can edit that out, can't you?

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,620
Yeah, no problem.

418
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,080
Well, I'm going to do my mystery call.

419
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,520
Get the bright this way.

420
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,460
Roll up to the mystery door.

421
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:14,600
BOOP!

422
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,860
Sound begins.

423
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,960
Sound begins.

424
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,000
Sound begins.

425
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,220
Sound begins.

426
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,260
See the light.

427
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,520
I'm not very happy.

428
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,560
Feel the heat.

429
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,840
We'll be in bombing in five minutes.

430
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,980
See the light.

431
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Feel the heat.

432
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,880
There's it.

433
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,600
Get, get, get.

434
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,360
Get down.

435
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,460
Get down.

436
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,760
Get, get, get, get down.

437
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,560
We're on.

438
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,160
Nancy!

439
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,320
Get down.

440
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,220
Get down.

441
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,960
Get down.

442
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,260
We're on.

443
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,620
We're on.

444
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,420
I'm not being pushed around.

445
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,860
I'm absolutely ridiculous.

446
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,100
Let's not kid ourselves.

447
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,280
I make the decisions.

448
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,220
Let's not kid ourselves.

449
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,020
We're going to try to give it to them.

450
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,880
We shouldn't delude ourselves.

451
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,760
See the light.

452
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,720
Those nuclear weapons.

453
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,040
Feel the heat.

454
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,600
We're not looking out.

455
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,420
See the light.

456
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,800
You're dealing with human beings.

457
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,760
Feel the heat.

458
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,860
Feel the heat.

459
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,860
Feel the heat.

460
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,320
And don't forget why we're doing this.

461
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,140
That is right.

462
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Why?

463
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,000
Why?

464
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,700
Geez.

465
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,100
Why?

466
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:59,180
I know all about you, but there's nothing you'll understand.

467
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,320
I don't know what's

468
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,920
Mm-hmm.

469
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:01,920


470
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,100


471
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,240
lives in public.

472
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,380
Yes.

473
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,420
Wickedly lives in public.

474
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,420


475
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,300
Okay, i我才

476
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,740
Yeah, that's right.

477
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,560
We want you to

478
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:09,980
Yes.

479
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:25,060
Bob either wants to be a county clerk or a over-God of all reality in 1984.

480
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,540
The two positions he's running for.

481
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,500
This ain't no video game church.

482
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,960
It ain't no church of bingo.

483
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
It's a church of Bob.

484
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,300
It's a Bob Rice's church.

485
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,580
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

486
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,400
What the hell?

487
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,040
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

488
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,440
Yes, the Christian heaven is hotter.

489
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,420
That's because there are seven sons.

490
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,340
Hell is fun.

491
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,440
Oh yeah, all your friends will be down there.

492
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,800
There's seven sons.

493
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,060
There's seven sons around the Christian heaven.

494
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,640
This is true.

495
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,240
You can find it in their own Bible.

496
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,860
They admit it.

497
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,480
And seven sons would make it much hotter than the gaseous multi-threshold of brimstone.

498
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,800
That means that heaven is hotter than hell.

499
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,720
They've been lying to you all this time.

500
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,540
Without a deal, then they lie about friends.

501
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,920
They lie that the world isn't coming to an end right away.

502
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,180
In 15 years.

503
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,240
Of course it's coming to an end in 15 years.

504
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,000
It can't last any longer.

505
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,720
It wasn't built to last.

506
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,120
It wasn't meant to last.

507
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,080
It's inferior.

508
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,660
Bob, it's a Spartan universe.

509
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:34,560
And I think the biomorphs out there will be pleased to find out that the third sex will be accepted by science.

510
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,280
People will finally accept the third sex.

511
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,760
That's not the one you think I'm talking about.

512
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,020
Yeah.

513
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:51,540
It like has, uh, the one hand is rough and hard like a man's and the other hand is soft like a woman's.

514
00:27:51,940 --> 00:28:04,820
But, uh, and the sexual organs, well we won't even go into that, but it will have half of one type of sexual organ.

515
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,620
Everyone has been told that they'reing'm going to have to leave for the next stage of their life.

516
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,400
And that they'll eventually cease the whole millenium, as somebody was adamant for what they were thought to be good.

517
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,560
But you're just seen with your hands off, crushed with fear, and receive to hard with calm.

518
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,200
Even at that time when the sun is stand IPS motion, people are afraid of that person.

519
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,280
Can you tell...

520
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,600
They're ready.

521
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,280
You have signed the application.

522
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,800
cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

523
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,420
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English,

524
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,060
but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language

525
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:54,060
when they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.

526
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,000
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living

527
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,180
than any other people in history.

528
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,440
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music,

529
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,100
and I might add a lot of its worst,

530
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,440
else the cultists would have no following.

531
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,120
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically, for more.

532
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,020
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

533
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,580
that I know that I know.

534
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,440
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,

535
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,020
the cruel and torturous executions,

536
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,400
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

537
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,360
There are little eyes.

538
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,260
There are little eyes upon you, and they're watching night and day.

539
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,560
With a vocal and activist minority ready, apparently, to burn the bomber steel of kill.

540
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,900
For more.

541
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,820
And most, incidentally, are in their teens or their twenties.

542
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,900
And that's Bosch and Pipple, I'll tell you that.

543
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,700
They dwelled in caves, not high-rise apartments.

544
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,940
They may not have found a key to affluence, but they found...

545
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,120
an endless supply of dope.

546
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,720
Uninhibited sex.

547
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,480
An endless supply of money.

548
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,220
Free access to a jewelry, I suppose.

549
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,620
Ah, yes, the harlot.

550
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,040
You can count on that.

551
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,000
Or kill.

552
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,360
For more.

553
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,980
Why, friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

554
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,920
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

555
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Is the church of the most subdued?

556
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,020
I don't know.

557
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,040
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

558
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,500
Bang.

559
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,860
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

560
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,380
Atomic warheads?

561
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,080
Don't. I don't know.

562
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,520
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

563
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,020
Why?

564
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,080
Bang. Bang. Bang.

565
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,900
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

566
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,080
Ah, yes, the harlot.

567
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,000
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

568
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,420
God scolded his people in the Old Testament.

569
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,820
The greatest people on Earth.

570
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,900
And you walk in with the Judas tribe, and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies I'd laid to make a socialist.

571
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,440
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism and the principle in me. Yes, best of you.

572
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,680
I knew that that's what I had to depend upon, not depend upon the arm of the flesh.

573
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,420
And never put all your eggs in one basket.

574
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,300
So, honey, I put my eggs in many places.

575
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,900
This is Jim Joss.

576
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,520
You can figure that out if you want to.

577
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,800
Some of you do.

578
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,100
You're naive. You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

579
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,960
You can't even follow him.

580
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,420
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet.

581
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Much less followed him.

582
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,400
You don't even know who he is, and you might miss him if you didn't have a real good look at him.

583
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,700
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

584
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,640
You really haven't got an x to him.

585
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,300
But I've got all kinds of things in store.

586
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,420
Ah, yes, friends.

587
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,240
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

588
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,880
FM.

589
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,480
That was Jim Jones.

590
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,600
From one of the subgenius cassettes we recorded.

591
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,300
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

592
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,240
That was Tim Leary.

593
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,680
It's so easy to get them mixed up, you know.

594
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,380
In Dallas, Texas.

595
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,020
FM.

596
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,680
That was Jim Jones.

597
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,760
From one of the subgenius cassettes we recorded.

598
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,540
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

599
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,440
That was Tim Leary.

600
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,960
It's so easy to get them mixed up, you know.

601
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,780
And before that was a little cut by puzzling evidence in Oakland, California.

602
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:31,780


603
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:40,760
And I just hope that this time, this show, we don't have those guys showing up into messing with our airwaves.

604
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,780
It's like, I don't know if you've been listening for very long.

605
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:56,380
We are actually having, literally having trouble keeping a California subgenius show, the KPFA show in Berkeley, more than an hour less than a show, out of our airspace.

606
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,920
They always seem to come in right at the worst time.

607
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,120
And, okay, I guess we could.

608
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,600
If you could bring the rags down here, we'll start that job right away.

609
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:17,660
It's a bit early in the morning, but we can clean up because these fabulous studios down here are equipped with showers and a full sports gymnasium right here next to the can.

610
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,260
That's right.

611
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,040
If you want a radio, hose out.

612
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,140
To a pastoral line here.

613
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,020
Nobody lives in South Dallas.

614
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,620
Hobo fam said hello, Dallas.

615
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,180
Hello, South Dallas.

616
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,900
Since that meltdown, nobody's been here.

617
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,900


618
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,900


619
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,900


620
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,900


621
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,900


622
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,880
I was talking about the incredible sports facilities.

623
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,740
Brewers and bunkins.

624
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,420
Bunkins, yeah.

625
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,680
The bunkins that are all here.

626
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,420
There's incredible everything here in Dallas.

627
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,400
There's incredible giant golden lights.

628
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,680
You should see the new thing in the Dallas skyline, Ivan.

629
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,700
I know as soon as we go downtown tonight, you'll see it.

630
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,780
They got that pretty, that's all right.

631
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,860
They got that pretty building all lit up now.

632
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,620
Yeah, I know.

633
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,160
There's one out here, too.

634
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,360
There are hotels. Look at the windows.

635
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,660
There's hotels out there.

636
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,620
Sittle tattle radio.

637
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,140
Oh, man.

638
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:09,340
All right, everybody, let's all get together and get naked and do something dirty.

639
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,060
Thank you.

640
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,260
Yeah, let's all get together and fuck.

641
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,700
That's right.

642
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah, let's all get together and buck in a big car.

643
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:18,780
And book.

644
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,740
Hey, man, I'm booking.

645
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,100
More book.

646
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah, we want more books.

647
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,660
So if you're, say, Paul Simon.

648
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,420
Or Art Washburn.

649
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,260
Or Irving Schuster.

650
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,540
Or any of those people.

651
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,220
This is what was playing.

652
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,840
This is what I was listening to the last time I saw Bob.

653
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Live.

654
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,960
Pretty incredible.

655
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,740
.

656
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:10,680
.

657
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,480

658
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,480


659
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,660
.

660
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:11,880
.

661
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:11,880


662
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,000
.

663
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,000


664
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,060
.

665
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,120

666
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,140

667
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,300

668
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:30,840
.

669
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,480

670
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280

671
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,140
.

672
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,660

673
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:46,700

674
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:46,720

675
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:46,740

676

677
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:48,840

678
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:49,760

679
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:49,760


680
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,600

681
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,880

. .

694
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,180
He is my true son and finger.

695
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:48,960
Don't just eat a hamburger.

696
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,720
Eat the hell out of it.

697
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,000
My kingdom is on the earth.

698
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Nothing I want is...

699
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,080
A good deal is in the wallet of the beholder.

700
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,520
You know you did.

701
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,080
All of you bright people deserve some of this.

702
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,620
Not a one in three.

703
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,880
That's fair.

704
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:18,920
All of you bright people deserve some of this.

705
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,420
or the church.

706
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,920
But not just any church,

707
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,520
for the church to which we belong

708
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,800
just happens to be,

709
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,580
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

710
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,060
the world's only bogus true religion.

711
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,380
Of course, I am referred to

712
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,900
the church of the subgenius.

713
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,540
This one's dedicated to Reverend Cleve Duncan.

714
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,940
Now the church of the subgenius,

715
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,800
as founded by

716
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

717
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,740
and his salesmaster Slack,

718
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,100
1953 is the prime religion of the future.

719
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,620
United,

720
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,200
superior,

721
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,440
mutants,

722
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,620
social renegades,

723
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,200
twisted geniuses,

724
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,980
and sci-fi sinners

725
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,640
in a worldwide rampage

726
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,040
of immorality

727
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,140
and profane

728
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,120
yucks and grins.

729
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,600
Yucks and grins,

730
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
which will hopefully,

731
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,140
inevitably,

732
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,800
lead us directly

733
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,360
to a commercialization

734
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


735
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


736
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


737
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


738
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


739
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


740
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


741
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:02,820
of society.

742
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't put us down to luck.

743
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,920
スパンテй

744
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,600
Today's Modern Jet Age

745
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,760
a global society.

746
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,800
And the commodity he's have

747
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,360
cream

748
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,360


749
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,220
gets beauty voted for.

750
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,220


751
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,220


752
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,220


753
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,220


754
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,240
gets voted

755
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,240


756
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,460
Face the

757
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,620
comments

758
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,380
and and

759
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,040
yeah but

760
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:47,560
...applying yourself, please apply the needless shift in the person or number which compares the degree of the parallel structures amplified by the capitalization which we employ in the first word of every sentence, which is otherwise pointed to the name.

761
00:39:47,560 --> 00:40:02,280
I don't understand the nature of these charges against me. These alleged, uh, these accusations have absolutely no basis in fact, Doctor, and I am thankful if you would dignify them with a remonstrance or two.

762
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,520
...pay strict attention...

763
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:16,000
Let me make one thing perfectly clear. Am I then accused of mental obesity? Of obfuscating? Of over-erudition?

764
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,540
It seems I am accused.

765
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:28,320
Accused of trying to choke the show, to choke the philosophical esophagus of the show with the roughage of knowledge, to bloat the entrails of the show with theophagous apophagems and quiddity.

766
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:37,580
Accused me of over-reading? Nay, rather say I gourmandize on the sacred vericundial throb of the ages.

767
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,420
...the final consonant before centricing it with the...

768
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,860
Now, are there any questions?

769
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,040
...the answer to them all is six, six, six...

770
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,600
...the answer to them all is six, six, six...

771
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:47,900
...the answer to them all is five...

772
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:58,260
So hold on just a moment while Doctor X reads you a list of the most valuable products found in your home or office which rub together to cause an enormous fire and even a nuclear explosion.

773
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,940
Ah ha ha ha, I wouldn't touch that one with the ten-foot...

774
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,800
...house or not.

775
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,280
Even a plastic free one?

776
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,220
Well, uh, that's a different matter.

777
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:17,160
You know, they don't have Cracker Jack prizes anymore and we've all had to grow up and lose a little of the starry-eyed, dew-dropping innocence that used to conflagrate our little world.

778
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,000
But now they're just a fossilized memory in the substratum of time.

779
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,820
You really think so, Doctor?

780
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,700
You really think so?

781
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,980
Well, in a sense, they live forever.

782
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,740
And proud of it.

783
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,360
Look at these rather tiny...

784
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,100
...organ which cannot even be imagined yet and...

785
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,080
The cult is full of superstition and mysticism. We're scientists.

786
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,760
You've got...

787
00:41:46,760 --> 00:42:04,340
As evangelist David Brothers of the Church of Jane Mansfield lays the groundwork of the new atomic age and instructs you on the essential precepts of the social gospel of Jane Mansfield as she spoke from the grave and appeared in a bizarre manifestation to the prophet princes.

788
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,500
Let us go forth now to Brother Brothers and this week's inspirational message in the name of her holiness, Jane Mansfield.

789
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,660
...sample of how she cuts the cheese.

790
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,520
Oh, I can't do it.

791
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,120
Oh, darn it.

792
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,360
Now you want to do it the other way?

793
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,480
Better this way.

794
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,660
Oh, God.

795
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,620
Can't you see that he's dead?

796
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,880
Yeah, the moon will be turning red any time.

797
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,540
I mean, the signs of the times are everywhere, friends.

798
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,560
You just look around you, these...

799
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,920
The econocataclysm should be hitting right around, what does it say here, in Scrooge's 1985.

800
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,660
Oh, I don't think...

801
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,460
Isn't that around the...

802
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,060
...toxic point?

803
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,240
Yeah, that's when the radio stations start having their own little earthquakes.

804
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:01,460
Well, dear friends, the lovely subgenius radio ministry hour of slack is still afloat, although just barely.

805
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,260
You can hear the zombies slumping around in the background here.

806
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,800
Let's see. There we go.

807
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,800
Slump, slump, slump.

808
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,700
You can hear them zombies.

809
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,000
Slump, slump.

810
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,420
Yeah, it's pathetic.

811
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,780
Pathetic, indeed.

812
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,680
Friends, Bob is dead.

813
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,100
Yes?

814
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,160
We hear nothing.

815
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,460
Bob is not dead.

816
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,480
We see nothing.

817
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,900
Bob is dead and smelling worse.

818
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,160
Bob is not dead like a fish-scale purse.

819
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,060
Bob is dead.

820
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,320
So what?

821
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,320
There's dead people in the White House.

822
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,060
Bob is not dead.

823
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,560
Neither is Corbett Monica.

824
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,000
Bob is dead.

825
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,060
I have to go to the bathroom.

826
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,860
Bob is not dead.

827
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,020
This isn't a urine test.

828
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:49,900
Bob is dead.

829
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,200
Long live what's left of Bob, dear friends.

830
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,440
Help me!

831
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,240
Help me!

832
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,040
The noise is heard.

833
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,020
Resident believes possibly M.M.A.s are...

834
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,340
...planetary systems.

835
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,820
When you sit down, you look deep into your soul and you say to yourself,

836
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,140
I'm not dead.

837
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,140


838
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,160
I'm not dead.

839
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


840
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


841
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


842
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


843
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


844
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


845
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


846
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


847
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


848
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,160


849
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,620
I can't take this anymore.

850
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,400
I gotta kill somebody.

851
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,220
Not just one person, but a whole lot of them.

852
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,380
And you gotta just keep killing.

853
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,180
Do you find that interesting?

854
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,180
Yeah, praise Bob.

855
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,160
Praise Corbett!

856
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:34,560


857
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,240
Kill.

858
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,160
Kill for the love of killing.

859
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,020
I don't know why I'm smiling, but I feel this urge to grin.

860
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:43,140
I'm not dead.

861
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,940
Time for the fourth.

862
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:59,200
Are you hooked on narcotics?

863
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,120
People that are once we've determined are not dead,

864
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:13,860
are not rehabilitative.

865
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,400
Okay?

866
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,980
What did you say, Bob?

867
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,200
I said, good Lord, what's to lose?

868
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,540
Hello, Tom.

869
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,740
2024.

870
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:26,740


871
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,840
When we were raised.

872
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,480
You're listening to UFO five

873
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:48,480


874
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,520
No, thank you.

875
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:52,520


876
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:52,920
You don't want to hurt me.

877
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:52,920


878
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,140
ed.

879
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,220
24 hours to go, I wanna be sedated.

880
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,540
Nothing to do, nowhere to go, I wanna be sedated.

881
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,760
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the shore.

882
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,660
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go cold.

883
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,900
Can't control my fingers, can't control my toes, oh no.

884
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,740
No, no, no.

885
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,640
No, no, no.

886
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,160
24 hours to go, I wanna be sedated.

887
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:27,300
Nothing to do, nowhere to go, I wanna be sedated.

888
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,400
Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the shore.

889
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,120
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go cold.

890
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,260
Can't control my fingers, can't control my toes, oh no.

891
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,080
Oh no, no.

892
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,820
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

893
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,520
I wanna be sedated.

894
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,600
I wanna be sedated.

895
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,920
Oh, yes, friends.

896
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,680
That was the swinging erudites.

897
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,020
That's actually the same Reverend Cleve Duncan,

898
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,420
a great preacher in the subgenius church,

899
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,760
whose stuff I can't usually play

900
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,100
because it's got too many four-letter words in it.

901
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,620
Like a skee-ball.

902
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,380
A skee-ball.

903
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,080
That's a...

904
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,480
Hey, we're not supposed to say skee-ball on the radio.

905
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,280
Oh, shoot!

906
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,220
Hey, okay.

907
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:45,800
Friends.

908
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,780
Backwards is a lot of eeks.

909
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,240
You know, it's so frustrating not to be able to mix cassettes.

910
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,360
See, I'm really geared up for...

911
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,820
Oh, Norm?

912
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,960
Norm, I'm warning you on the air ahead of time.

913
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,400
This deck is not plugged in again.

914
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,100
Nuke it.

915
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,140
Yeah, kill it.

916
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,860
Kill it.

917
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,040
Kill me.

918
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,400
Kill me.

919
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,520
Kill me.

920
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,320
Kill the traitor.

921
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,180
To the church.

922
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,560
All but one man died

923
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,860
There at Bittercree

924
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,600
And they say he ran away

925
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,740
Branded

926
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,940
Marked with a coward's shame

927
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,940
What do you do when you're branded?

928
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,800
Well, you fight for your name

929
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,920
He was innocent

930
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,740
Not a charge was true

931
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,100
But the world would never know

932
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,160
Branded

933
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,360
Scorned at the one who ran

934
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,340
What do you do when you're branded?

935
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,320
And you know you're a man

936
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,460
Wherever you are

937
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,620
You go for the rest of your life

938
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,940
You must prove

939
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,920
You're a man

940
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,200
Are you kidding?

941
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,440
Hey, now, wait a minute.

942
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,040
Hey, hey, we are the monkeys

943
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,380
You know we love to please

944
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,740
A manufactured image

945
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,040
With no philosophies

946
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,340
We hope you like our story

947
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,460
Although there isn't one

948
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,820
That is to say there's many

949
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,100
That way there is more fun

950
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,480
You've told us you like action

951
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,620
And games of many kinds

952
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,500
You like to dance

953
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,160
We like to sing

954
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,560
So let's all lose our minds

955
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,900
We know it doesn't matter

956
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,320
Because what you came to see

957
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,300
Is what we'd love to give you

958
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,780
And give it one, two, three

959
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,500
But it may come three, two, one, two

960
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,680
Or jump from nine to five

961
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,220
And when you see the end in sight

962
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,100
The beginning may arrive

963
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,520
For those who look for meanings

964
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,920
And form as they do fact

965
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,480
We might tell you one thing

966
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,060
But we'd only take it back

967
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,160
Not back like in a box pack

968
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,360
Not back like in a race

969
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,320
Not back so we can

970
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,760
Keep it but back in time and space

971
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,020
You say we're manufactured

972
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,440
To that we all agree

973
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,820
So make your choice

974
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,420
And we'll rejoice

975
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,500
In never being free

976
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,760
Hey, hey, we are the monkeys

977
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,120
We've said it all before

978
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,320
The money's in

979
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,220
We're made of tin

980
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,400
We're here to give you more

981
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,300
The money's in

982
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,020
We're made of tin

983
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,880
We're here to give you

984
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,160
Well, friends

985
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,220
Boy, yeah, I hadn't heard

986
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,700
Any of that stuff in a long time

987
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,120
See, when I put a cassette in

988
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,640
On this show

989
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,920
I don't know what it's gonna be

990
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,260
Oh, that feels good

991
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,060
Oh, here it comes again

992
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,000
Those heliops, it's that other show

993
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,800
Nope

994
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,540
I don't know what's going on here, friends

995
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,240
What's coming up next

996
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,540
This is Lord Buckley

997
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,680
Not too many people even know who he is

998
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,720
He's a sort of a pre-Lenny Bruce

999
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,540
Beatnik poet of the 60s

1000
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,420
He's a weirdo, you know, in other words

1001
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,140
But, um, uh, let's see

1002
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,300
Oh, he's a weirdo

1003
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,220
Oh, I ought to give some credit

1004
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,720
The last few tapes I got in

1005
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,820
Was playing in there

1006
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,680
It's negative land

1007
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,660
I'm using as a segue

1008
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,520
Of course

1009
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,460
Um, the branded

1010
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,500
And the monkeys thing

1011
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,880
Came from Pope Flores

1012
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,180
The Pope of Chicago

1013
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,000
I'm gonna praise the Pope there

1014
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,020
He sends a lot of great

1015
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,380
Japanese animation videotapes

1016
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:28,960
To the church

1017
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,520
So we have strange religious icons

1018
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,360
Some people might not get into it

1019
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,120
Four big hits

1020
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,320
And seven licks of gold

1021
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,300
Are before me

1022
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Before daddy swung false upon this sweet groovy land

1023
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:53,500
A swinging, stomping, jumping, blowing, wailing

1024
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,260
New nation

1025
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,160
Hip to the cool groove of liberty

1026
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,120
And solid scent

1027
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,420
With the eighth lick

1028
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,480
At all the studs, chicks, cats, and kitties

1029
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,780
Red, white, all blue

1030
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,240
Is created level in front

1031
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,580
You can straight talk the same

1032
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,340
Dig what I mean?

1033
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,520
Now we are hung

1034
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,940
With a king-sized

1035
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,280
Main day

1036
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,940
Civil drag

1037
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,220
Sounding of whether that nation

1038
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,820
Or any up there nation

1039
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,560
Dig so hip and so solid scent

1040
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,300
Can stay with us

1041
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,620
All the way

1042
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,420
We is here to dig this chop-beating session

1043
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,640
On the site of the voice jazz blown

1044
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,300
In the entire issue

1045
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,920
Get his mother boy

1046
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,660
We have stomped out here to turn on

1047
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,860
A small soil stash

1048
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,200
Of the before mentioned hassle

1049
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,660
Site

1050
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,820
As a finer sweet sod pad

1051
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,120
For those who laid it down and left it there

1052
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,900
So that this jumping happy beat

1053
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,140
Might blow forevermore

1054
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,800
And we all dig

1055
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,020
That this is the straightest lick

1056
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,340
There

1057
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,620
But digging it harder from afar

1058
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,180
Will be the best way to do it

1059
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,320
We cannot take no wailing bowels

1060
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,160
We cannot mellow

1061
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,400
We cannot put down the stamp of the nails

1062
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,760
On this sweet sod

1063
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,720
Cause the strong non-stop studs

1064
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,240
Both digging it and dug under it

1065
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,560
Who hassled here

1066
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:06,560
Have mellowed it with such a wild mad beat

1067
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,620
It not now slumbers

1068
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,820
What can it take?

1069
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:21,960


1070
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,020
Does not find its cheer

1071
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,020


1072
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,120
Way over it

1073
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,120


1074
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,120


1075
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,620
Ain't handsome

1076
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,820
So wouldn't take Aquí

1077
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,420
No t'em

1078
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:25,600
No plan

1079
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,240
No chance

1080
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,300
Three make it

1081
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,940
Damn good

1082
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,560
What do you sound?

1083
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,540
Cha-ching

1084
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,080
This is the time and this is the record of the time.

1085
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,320
This is the time and this is the record of the time.

1086
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,160
It's important.

1087
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:18,680
It's important.

1088
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,280
It's important.

1089
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,260
Oh, there we go.

1090
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,980
Well, anyway, folks.

1091
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:40,740
Yep.

1092
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,360
We're sitting here praising Bob to the beautiful sound effects that go on forever and ever.

1093
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:46,920
Listen to that.

1094
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,540
Hideous slack squishing and mushing around in there.

1095
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,180
Oh, Bob.

1096
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,680
Bob.

1097
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,360
There's absolutely no truth to the rumor that members of the church,

1098
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:13,360
need passes from Dobbs committee in order to urinate.

1099
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,720
We do have permission to urinate at any time.

1100
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:22,060
Not like asked in those other groups where you have to ask permission to go to the restroom.

1101
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,080
Some geniuses can go to the restroom.

1102
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,340
It's always that body of God.

1103
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,260
They don't even have to go to the restroom.

1104
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,820
That's not a message from Bob, is it?

1105
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,200
Well, in 1987,

1106
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:40,320
Orson Welles will come on the radio and tell people that the aliens are landing.

1107
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,920
But this time, no one will believe him, but it will be true.

1108
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,120
Laser beams shaped like vampires,

1109
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,300
with glow in the dark brains.

1110
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,320
I seen a vision, ma'am.

1111
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:04,420
So play your cards right.

1112
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,820
Yes.

1113
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,040
All you deaf ears down there.

1114
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,020
Heads up.

1115
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,880
Look out below.

1116
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:16,340
There will be plenty of distractions to take your minds off the real problem as the time of P draws to its violent close.

1117
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,920
For instance, beware.

1118
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,280
The fake God Junior, the anti-Bob, will come before long.

1119
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,760
Bullets cannot stop him.

1120
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:28,360
He's one of the deceptively human-looking advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

1121
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,000
Parasites of the elder gods.

1122
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,100
But most people will think he's the second coming.

1123
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,180
And his age.

1124
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:39,800
Alien hiney will be kissed all the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

1125
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,220
And if the true messiah were to show up at that time,

1126
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,500
everyone would just know in the bottom of their core programming that he's the antichrist.

1127
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:57,720
Because he'll cuss and spit and take the lord's name in vain and hang out with whores and bulldigers and dope addicts and cops.

1128
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,280
Another down-home sort.

1129
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,280
This is a warning.

1130
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,880
Danger.

1131
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,440
Danger, you poor devils.

1132
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,080
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed.

1133
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,240
What was up is down.

1134
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,180
The priorities are all screwy.

1135
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:16,680
You're fretting if your hair looks okay while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your designer jeans.

1136
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,540
Yes, this is bad talk.

1137
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,760
Nobody will listen to anything else.

1138
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:25,360
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

1139
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,400
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

1140
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,600
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

1141
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,160
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing.

1142
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:43,180
Until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured makes you stop.

1143
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,340
And you'll thank him for it.

1144
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:53,820
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight, you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

1145
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,400
Good God!

1146
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,060
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

1147
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,500
People bitch.

1148
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,560
People gripe.

1149
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,600
This is a sign of the end times.

1150
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,260
That's a sign of the end times.

1151
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:11,060
When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

1152
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:16,380
Two months ago, the observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

1153
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,700
Now that's the same story the cult of the book of Revelations had been preaching.

1154
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,040
Now when a scientist backs that up, it's news.

1155
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,040
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

1156
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,880
Well, today we deal with Bible prophecy.

1157
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:33,280
We have two free features we want you to write for right away.

1158
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,380
I wish my mommy did not smoke.

1159
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,120
How you can have the miracle you need in August of 1982.

1160
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:46,700
There may be a brief lull in the fighting between the Arabs and the Jews.

1161
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,680
That will be a temporary peace.

1162
01:00:50,060 --> 01:01:00,560
But the word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil in the Middle East until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

1163
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,760
Bob?

1164
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:09,440
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass extinctions.

1165
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,580
Clowns and ballerinas here and there.

1166
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,900
Clowns and ballerinas here and there.

1167
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,020
Once it's finally happened, so discuss it.

1168
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,020
Bob, the now victoriousantes glimpsed

1169
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,020


1170
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,020


1171
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,020


1172
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,200
I don't know that Gesichter anything.

1173
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,200


1174
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,200


1175
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,400
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1176
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,760
This music that's playing right now is by D.K. Jones,

1177
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:24,060
Reverend Dennis Kelly, great friend of the church.

1178
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,460
In fact, some of his music is on the background

1179
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,080
in a whole lot of the subgenius tapes,

1180
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,240
a lot of stuff we play, the slicker.

1181
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:33,780
A little bit.

1182
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:39,120
Anyway, friends, we're about to go off the air.

1183
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,320
Let me read the sacred P.O. box of the Church of the Subgenius.

1184
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,440
For those of you who are in need of written slack,

1185
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,640
we'll send you beaucoup information,

1186
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,600
truckloads about the church.

1187
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:55,760
If you'll just write, got that pencil ready, friends?

1188
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,500
Write for information.

1189
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,140
This is the Subgenius Hour of Slack signing off,

1190
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,180
and we want you to write to Bob.

1191
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:09,060
Bob at P.O. Box 140306,

1192
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,640
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1193
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:19,700
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306,

1194
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,520
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1195
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,340
Just send in that letter, that postcard,

1196
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,820
and you'll find out just what we mean by slack.

1197
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:29,920
Yes.

1198
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1199
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,020
Ha, ha, ha.

1200
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,440
Hang on for Norm and Monday morning,

1201
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,840
and it's going to be a hell of a deal.

1202
