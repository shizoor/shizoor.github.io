1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,480
Hello?

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,960
Hello, hello, Bob.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,720
This is The Self Genius Hour of Sack.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,360
I know all about it.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,560
I've been trying to get you.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,940
Have you any idea where they are?

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,220
Yeah, they're right here with me.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,420
Well, say, if you're going to do anything about it, you'd better hurry.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,620
Oh, thanks, Bob.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,720
And I remember the delight with which I devoured it.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,980
Now that I have been reading over all the letters which he wrote to me laboriously with his own hand after the fashion of those days,

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,080
I feel that I did not at the time appreciate how much he thought and cared for the

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,860
Self Genius Hour of Sack.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,400
Watch it!

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,660
You might sit over there on a Monday morning and talk about how Bob got the money,

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,240
but I guarantee you Bob's going to get it.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,700
Bob's going to pay his bill and then get you to go over and lick your sores on Bob.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,640
And I can guarantee you if we said that at one of our radio stations,

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,020
the FCC would come down and pull the plug.

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
So let's get to it.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,800
Okay, boys.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,460
Go and get up.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,500
Indian wolf call.

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,300
Freeze!

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
Everybody clap your hands.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,840
Come on, y'all.

28
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,320
How low can you go?

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,980
Warning.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,580
You are about to enter the

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,180
sex program.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,320
Warning.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,200
He is a serial killer.

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,100
Sex program.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,360
Sex program.

36
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,300
Serial killers and kidnappers and pedophiles.

37
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
He literally wrote the book.

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,200
The most confusing thing about a condom.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,860
Looking into the eyes of a serial killer.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,420
Serial killers and kidnappers and pedophiles.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
He literally wrote the book on

42
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,720
one serial killer by the name of

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,620
G. Gordon Liddy.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Mass murderers and pedophiles and kidnappers.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,200
G-Man.

46
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,260
Predators.

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,500
G. Gordon Liddy.

48
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,620
Murder and pedophilia.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,740
Oral, anal, and vaginal.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,540
And erect penis.

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,480
I get the same thing, by the way, because, you know,

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,700
on the penis.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,140
In the Catholic Church.

54
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,120
G. Gordon Liddy.

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,600
Pedophile.

56
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,480
There are bad people in many different organizations.

57
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,060
The Catholic Church is bad child.

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,120
G. Gordon Liddy.

59
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,900
Abuse.

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,460
Sex with Starbucks.

61
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,920
Uh, uh, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal, criminal.

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,020
Past, past, past, past.

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,940
Predators and predators and predators in the world of pedophilia.

64
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,060
I don't know, I don't know.

65
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
G. Gordon Liddy.

66
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,240
Serial killer and it actually gave me nightmares.

67
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
G. Gordon Liddy.

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,160
Does dig deep, does dig deep inside.

69
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,820
Thanks, I hope we can do it again.

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,640
And we'll do it again to everybody.

71
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,620
Only this time, we'll do it in Bob's Church.

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,780
And with G. Gordon Gordon instead of G. Gordon Liddy.

73
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,800
Anyway, dear friends, Norrell Preff, Reverend Norrell Preff did that.

74
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:17,220
Uh, and the openings were by Mr. Fernandinendi Lee Moore,

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
as well as the Department of Transmutation.

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,120
Uh, but you know, friends, not everybody hates it.

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Bob, they don't all even hate Bob out at KPFA Berkeley.

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,120
Uh, on the sub-genius show of puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond, Michael Pepe,

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,760
Gary the Broke Friend, and as you'll see here, the caller's son.

80
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,100
I love y'all, though.

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,180
No, y'all my poppers.

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,380
That would cost you, I should say.

83
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,140
Y'all my poppers.

84
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
Y'all my daddies.

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,880
Yeah, no, we don't do poppers, sir, on the show.

86
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,340
No.

87
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,360
Not anymore as much.

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,380
Thank God for y'all.

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,820
God bless.

90
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,080
Yeah, there were whippets and everything.

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,320
There was a lot of evidence in last night's show.

92
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,560
That's right.

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,460
Praise you.

94
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,080
Church air, you mean.

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,240
There was church air being passed about.

96
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,420
What kind of, what kind of a show business is this, you people doing San Francisco?

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,240
This is a show business fuel.

98
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeah, using those evil little soul-filled canisters.

99
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,460
I brought up my baby to be.

100
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,680
Oh, I wish we were sacred.

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,200
And giving away the little souls as if they meant nothing.

102
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,980
My little baby.

103
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,140
Something great about being in love with a carrot.

104
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,880
It's just.

105
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,740
Daddy gave her nitrous oxide.

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,060
Nitrous oxide.

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,080
Walrose wine.

108
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,920
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

109
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,080
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

110
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,360
Take a number.

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,040
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

112
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,040


113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,260
Hey, it's 17 degrees in Cleveland.

114
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,280
Wow.

115
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:28,980
Wow.

116
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,880
And there's, they're supposed to get 10 inches of snow today.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
What the hell you think we're out here, baby?

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,980
No kidding, daddy.

119
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,860
Does that mean you have to put your shoes on?

120
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,080
That's why.

121
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,960
Bob's promise rings true.

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,440
The second we set off for the airport, it started snowing for the first time this season.

123
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,280
It's now in the middle of a blizzard.

124
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,700
There you go.

125
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,220
The day we get back, it is prophesied to be 53 degrees and raining.

126
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,640
What further work do you need?

127
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:54,560
I don't know.

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,060
I don't know.

129
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,280
I don't know either.

130
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,360
Slack abides with those that send in their $30.

131
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,960
That's right.

132
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,700
Well, you know the-

133
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,220
Slack abides with-

134
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,440
I don't-

135
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,000
With two to five.

136
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,460
My money ain't right, but I'm gonna bring food to y'all.

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:05,860
I'm gonna be right.

138
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,980
Slack is my bride.

139
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm married to Slack.

140
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm gonna make it.

141
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,640
Slack is my bride.

142
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,000
Slack is my-

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,560
In the form of Princess We Are Doe, which is very Slack-

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,640
She is herself Slack.

145
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,840
She is.

146
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,760
She glows with the power of Slack.

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,900
But the Lord is not Slack concerning his-

148
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,180
No.

149
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,260
I'm a goat.

150
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,520
No.

151
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,300
I'm a goat.

152
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,300


153
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,300


154
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,340
Nay.

155
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,720
Nay.

156
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,240
The Lord is not Slack.

157
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,760
As men reckon Slackness.

158
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,980
Nay.

159
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,840
Nenoninana, nenoninana, nenoninana, nenoninana,

160
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,920
Sepolvaa and persuadevaa, sepovaa and persuadevaa.

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,320
Sepolvedaa, persuajaa, and manipulaa.

162
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

163
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,160


164
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,160


165
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,540
You're hurting me.

166
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,380
My sub-G

167
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,100

Hello.

183
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,460
Salut.

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,600
C'est Rob.

185
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,240
And it's good.

186
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,060
C'est Rob.

187
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,020
You'll be a man

188
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,300
who makes a

189
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,840
fair to Chile.

190
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
Allo.

191
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
Allo.

192
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
We'll soon yell

193
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,500
because all sound that

194
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,460
beep. She's so

195
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,560
unique. God says she

196
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,620
won't share the meat.

197
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Bob's a cums

198
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,240
but Connie goes away.

199
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,100
Connie goes away.

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,380
Connie goes away away.

201
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,320
Bob made fair to

202
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,480
Cheney all day.

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
We have to eat it all

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,080
today.

205
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,140
Face of dogs

206
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,060
don't ever go away.

207
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Never go away.

208
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,140
Never go or go away.

209
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,380
She'd rebel.

210
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
She'd rather fucking stay.

211
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,540
Now at best

212
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,600
we'll all be baying.

213
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,860
But soon,

214
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,780
sun's born.

215
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,680
Just eat

216
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,440
a comb.

217
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,940
And we'll be

218
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,960
like a

219
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,660
bunch of

220
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,300
genius

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
fettuccine.

222
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,740
Allo.

223
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,660
Allo.

224
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,460
Some parachute.

225
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,400
Big ass holes

226
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,000
on that beep.

227
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,020
She's so unique.

228
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
God says she

229
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,580
won't share the meat.

230
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,820
Bob's a cums

231
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,320
but Connie goes away.

232
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,180
Connie goes away.

233
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,440
Connie goes away away.

234
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,380
Bob made fair to

235
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,540
Cheney all day.

236
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,540
We have to eat it all

237
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,180
today.

238
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,300
Face of dogs

239
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,120
don't ever go away.

240
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,980
Never go away.

241
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,280
Never go or go away.

242
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,440
She'd rebel.

243
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
She'd rather fucking stay.

244
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,580
Now at best

245
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,600
we'll all be baying.

246
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
My sub G.

247
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
My sub hoo.

248
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,520
My sub ho.

249
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,920
My sub ha ha.

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,420
My sub ha ha.

251
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
My Sub G.

252
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
My Sub hoo.

253
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,960
My sub ho.

254
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
My Sub ha ha.

255
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,740
My Sub G.

256
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,740
My Sub hoo.

257
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,400
My sub ho.

258
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
My sub ha ha.

259
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,780
My sub

260
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,040
G.

261
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,840
Who My sub hoo.

262
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
My sub-ha ha.

263
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,860
Bob's a cums

264
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,460
but Connie goes away.

265
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,260
Connie goes away.

266
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,540
Connie goes away away.

267
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,420
Bob's a cums but Connie goes away. Connie goes away away.

268
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,780
Make fair to Jeannie all today.

269
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,280
We have to eat it all today.

270
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,120
Face of dogs, don't ever go away.

271
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,040
Never go away.

272
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Never go or go away.

273
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,640
She'd rebel, she'd rather fucking stay.

274
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,300
Now at best, we'll all keep paying.

275
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,760
You tell them, squirrely whirling.

276
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,860
This is the happiest moment of my life.

277
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:19,940
Signal Oil Company has asked me to remind you that there's an easy way we can all help to make this holiday season happier for ourselves and others.

278
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,120
Be courteous and obey the subscription of Slack.

279
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,320
It may save a life, possibly Bob.

280
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,140
The subscription of Slack is entirely fictional and all characters are coincidental.

281
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,620
Any similarity of names or resemblance to Bob is purely fictional.

282
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,860
Well, that was only a gag, officer.

283
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,240
You see, you got a queer sense of humor.

284
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,600
Yeah.

285
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,120
Yeah?

286
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,540
Yeah.

287
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,420
Hello?

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,600
Hello.

289
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,480
So I pick up the phone when it rang and I said,

290
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,540
Uh...

291
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,100
And she said,

292
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,700
Uh...

293
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,120
Uh...

294
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,940
And I said,

295
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,740
And I said,

296
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,860
And I said,

297
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,300
And I said,

298
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,300


299
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,460
And I said,

300
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:04,720
And I said,

301
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:04,740


302
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:04,840
And I said,

303
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,840


304
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,840


305
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,840


306
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,840


307
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:04,840


308
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,000
And that's why I love her, friends.

309
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,100
Those cut-ups were by...

310
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,040
Lee Murr.

311
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:19,940
And that song, that sweet, romantic, surrealist duet by Princess Wiardo and myself,

312
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:31,920
that's a cover, a perverse cover, sort of, inspired by the spasmutations of a Romanian pop song

313
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:41,280
widely known as the Numa Numa song, which became an internet fad when various nerds, fat guys, and gays,

314
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,340
started lip syncing to it.

315
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,740
In fact, you can look up the Numa Numa song.

316
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,840
Yes, that is the name of it.

317
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,240
The Numa Numa song on Google.

318
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,100
And you'll see.

319
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,520
Uh, Google Video.

320
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,060
Look at Google Videos of the Numa Numa song.

321
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,260
It's truly spasm-y-sy.

322
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
Uh, meanwhile, friends,

323
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:08,060
let us hie back to Berkeley for the ongoing live subgenius meeting.

324
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,180
You're like calling from, like, Santa.

325
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,900
Santa Cruz or something.

326
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Okay, is that a quorum?

327
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,560
You never go right through.

328
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,040
I would say that is a quorum.

329
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, it's a quorum.

330
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,900
Oh, man, that is not a quorum.

331
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
Let's just say it is and get...

332
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,760
We've only got a little while left to finish up all this business.

333
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,560
Okay, all in favor say,

334
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

335
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Pass.

336
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,520
Okay, that's it for the business.

337
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,760
Let's get on with the strippers.

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,920
No, no, no, that's just part one of the business.

339
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,420
Bring in the babes.

340
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,740
Where's the paint strippers?

341
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,160
Oh, now we have to...

342
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,380
We've got to redecorate the...

343
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,840
Yeah, we've got to fix this.

344
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,040
Oh, man, this is the part I hate.

345
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,160
Oh, my God.

346
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,920
Smoking jazz gun.

347
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,340
Fire up the grease gun.

348
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,720
And here we go.

349
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,900
We're whooping on the...

350
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,340
Oh, we're breaking the windows down.

351
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,660
So, we're going to decide.

352
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,860
We decide on anything.

353
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,960
It looks like Hal had too much show.

354
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,520
We didn't have any business.

355
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,060
No.

356
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,480
You know, Stan keeps all the money and that's it.

357
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,200
I know, and I think you should...

358
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,760
Yeah, but I got a seat at the children's table at Stan's giving,

359
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,360
so I'm moving on.

360
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,760
Oh.

361
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,000
Actually, technically, Ratnar keeps all the money.

362
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,920
Oh, Ratnar Corp?

363
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,040
Oh, no, is he the new secretary of the party?

364
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,140
Ratnar is the new treasurer.

365
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,380
He takes care of all the money.

366
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,260
Oh, okay.

367
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,380
We figured he works at a horse race track, betting track.

368
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh, good.

369
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,560
So, we figured he had a lot of experience with that sort of thing.

370
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah.

371
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,020
Hey, I'm looking at Revelation X, Reverend Stane.

372
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:32,660
He can count.

373
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,720
He's real good at counting.

374
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,260
Try to see if we can't...

375
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm looking at Amazon.com,

376
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,360
and I see that you have...

377
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,220
You can buy Revelation X for $51.39, the cheapest one.

378
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,040
Give me two.

379
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,320
How much?

380
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,360
$51.39.

381
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,400
You know, I bought one for 26 bucks about two months ago,

382
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,140
and the next time I looked, it was 49.

383
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,320
Oh.

384
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,820
So, friends...

385
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,740
Do you think that's okay?

386
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,940
You better buy your Revelation X while you still can.

387
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,860
Whatever that is.

388
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,360
It's $150 now that we've mentioned it on the radio.

389
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,360
There's two copies.

390
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,280
There's two copies out there right now.

391
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,720
One is $51.39, and the other is $82.

392
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,320
The like-new version is 82 bucks, Reverend Stane.

393
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,920
Those are chimpanzees.

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
Psalm 51.6, the book says,

395
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,420
More than all else, Lord, you desire a couple of CDs.

396
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,080
So, he was just drawn like iron filings into a belt.

397
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,580
He had been wanting my parts.

398
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,620
According to the Bible,

399
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,840
God created the Philippine islands.

400
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,800
Handmade, crude.

401
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,660
The hand belongs to New York City,

402
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,900
a tiny rural community in Maine.

403
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Gift of love to a son named Bob.

404
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,100
And he moved an entire community back into the Dark Ages,

405
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,200
just by using a bomb.

406
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,280
Find the duck with a wrench.

407
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,240
From PR News in Washington,

408
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm far broader than previously reported.

409
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,780
According to the American Automobile Association,

410
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,600
an unmanned Russian spaceship took its course

411
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,740
at the advantage of PR News to gouge customers in Washington.

412
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
Leaper did it, friends!

413
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,280
And now, the Roto-Rooter Good Time Christmas Band.

414
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,700
You called this momentặt

415
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:50,940
粉 dude

416
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,040
Of a franchise hit

417
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,280
What a surprise

418
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:52,860
To see him

419
00:15:52,860 --> 00:16:04,840
Go home

420
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Suntomed

421
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,280
5, 6, 7, 8

422
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:35,140
5, 6, 7, 8

423
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,320
Oh, that was the Roto-Rooter Good Time Christmas Band.

424
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,660
And now, back to the Subgenius Executive Conference.

425
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:48,980
Oh.

426
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,120
Ancient knowledge in modern times.

427
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,660
The Sasquatch in literature, myth, and fiction.

428
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,820
The experiments don't often work out for the best.

429
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,060
Sometimes it's sad.

430
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,260
A life of misery.

431
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,180
Are you talking about subgenius?

432
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,600
Yes, yes.

433
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,020
And victims.

434
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,920
Oh, right.

435
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,640
Trekkies.

436
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,220
Trekkies.

437
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,860
Sci-fi geeks.

438
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,720
Gamers.

439
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,960
Usenet geeks.

440
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,700
Michael Pepe.

441
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Charles Manson.

442
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Michael Pepe.

443
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,920
Lieutenant Calley.

444
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
Michael Pepe.

445
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,200
Minority.

446
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,620
Yeah.

447
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,980
Unspoken for.

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,680
60 new and used Book of the Subgenius, starting as low as $4.95.

449
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,500
Well, that's understandable.

450
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,420
You can get those from subgenius.com.

451
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,560
That's what mine cost.

452
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,440
Not for $4.95.

453
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,280
Not for $4.95.

454
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,780
Hell no.

455
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,440
No, there's 60.

456
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,480
It's $15.95.

457
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,980
But, they're autographed.

458
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,660
Oh.

459
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,380
Great.

460
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,420
You can't get a Philodrumon by a rubber stamp.

461
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,740
I just want to say.

462
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:15,860
Wow.

463
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,940
Philodrumon?

464
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,800
The Dr. Philodrumon.

465
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:27,600
In 1980, when I got my subgenius book of the subgenius, I think it was $9.95.

466
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,680
Yes.

467
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,100
Yeah.

468
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,060
Souls were cheaper.

469
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
Life was cheaper then.

470
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,280
So, now we're talking, it was $98.

471
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,580
Yeah.

472
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,580


473
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,580


474
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,140
$98.

475
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,800
Right.

476
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,440
Now, for a new copy.

477
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,360
Because of the year number.

478
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:40,800
Right.

479
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,120
And half an hour ago, it was only $56.

480
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,300
But, it's gone up because we mentioned it.

481
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,820
Because it's readers.

482
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:53,560
The second we mentioned that, RevelationX at Amazon.com, the price went up $100.

483
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,760
That's right.

484
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,780
Because people were listening on the net.

485
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,500
That's right.

486
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,060
Well, maybe we need to find it.

487
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,480
It just went up another $13.

488
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,140
That's on eBay.

489
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,560
The people are thirsting for the book.

490
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


491
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


492
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


493
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


494
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


495
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


496
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


497
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


498
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


499
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


500
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


501
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,560


502
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:05,800
$13.

503
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,880
That was on eBay.

504
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,420
Yeah.

505
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,900
It's about confidence.

506
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,600
You know, people had no more confidence.

507
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,140
If they didn't have confidence involved, the market would crash.

508
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,760
The readers demand the subgenius revealed wisdom.

509
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,780
They thirst for this knowledge.

510
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,440
Yes.

511
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,020
You have to have an informed population.

512
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,520
How are we going to satisfy this burning need for the subgenius gospel?

513
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,700
Well, you just have to constantly pump out information.

514
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,100
I guess we'll just have to pray for a miracle.

515
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,500
Even the parish people decided.

516
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,080
They're going to pray alive.

517
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,960
And stay alive.

518
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,640
And stay glued to their electronic devices.

519
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,120
Maybe somebody up there will make it possible for us to come out with a new edition of our

520
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:52,880
second book, the Descended New Testicle of the Church of the Subgenius, RevelationX,

521
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,340
the Bob Apocryphi.

522
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,200
Read the book.

523
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,760
Read the book.

524
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,160
Yeah, it's too bad you can't get it without just buying it used.

525
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,100
Of course, if the demand was to increase and we got enough, you know, requests, we could

526
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,540
probably buy it.

527
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,140
We could probably figure out some way to reprint it.

528
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:14,540
Actually, lads, you might be interested to know that in the last month we acquired a

529
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,280
new literary agent, as we call them nowadays.

530
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,460
Yes, the good Reverend Haight.

531
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,900
Unfortunately, he was also a subgenius.

532
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,540
Like the original sainted late Jane Brown, this new agent is likewise a true saint.

533
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,520
True subgenius.

534
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,200
One who gazed upon the face of Bob and instantly knew.

535
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:49,840
In fact, our new agent once played in a band in Houston behind the apostate, Janer, I can't

536
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,040
pronounce his name here.

537
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,160
Oh, I remember.

538
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah.

539
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,220
Our new agent once backed up Janer in Houston when he was a kid.

540
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,520
Is this the imputed inventor of the launching of the new movie?

541
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
The head of Arnold Palmer?

542
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,100
Well, actually, what I was talking about was our new agent, and I dare not say his name

543
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,360
or the name of the agency on this particular show or in public.

544
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,980
Because talk about shaking up the market.

545
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,300
This could devastate publishing as we know it if we were to allow insider trading or

546
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,360
something like that to start.

547
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,860
Oh, yeah.

548
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,360
The price of Revelation X, which is now up to $6,000.

549
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,420
Yeah, almost, not quite $6,000.

550
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,640
Now the real business.

551
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,480
Now the real business.

552
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,080
I gave away all my money.

553
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,340
I'm going to start a new church.

554
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,540
Friends, you can get in on the ground floor of a lucrative new cult now while rates are

555
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,580
moderately low compared to the next few minutes.

556
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm going to start a new church.

557
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,340


558
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,340


559
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,000
You are making such a mistake.

560
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,700
It's pretty bad, isn't it?

561
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
Oh, I know it's pretty bad.

562
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,340
It's pretty bad.

563
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,340


564
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,340


565
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,340


566
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,340


567
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,840
It's funny.

568
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,360
I never really wanted to be beautiful.

569
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,580
Thank you, nurse.

570
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,280
I'll be down later.

571
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,840
This happens to be the Twilight Zone.

572
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,660
King Kong now playing.

573
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,440
Now what, doctor?

574
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,620
Move into a special area.

575
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,900
You're talking about a ghetto, aren't you?

576
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,640
A ghetto designed for freaks.

577
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,780
Now you know you can't expect to live any kind of a life among normal people.

578
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,380
This fate is not God.

579
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,320
I feel the night out there.

580
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,620
I feel the air.

581
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,780
I can smell the flowers.

582
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,260
They got me!

583
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,560
Let me go.

584
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,340
Let me go.

585
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,840
Please.

586
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,720
Please let me go.

587
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,340
Let me go.

588
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,600
Please.

589
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,140
Oh, please.

590
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,180
Please let me go.

591
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,500
Please, please, let me go.

592
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,060
Big trouble.

593
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,420
Yeah.

594
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,500
There is an affordable solution.

595
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,060
Listen very carefully.

596
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,680
Call now.

597
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,220
A twisted lump of flesh.

598
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,520
Why must we feel that way?

599
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,220
Why shouldn't people be allowed to be different?

600
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,520
Why?

601
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
Well, under certain circumstances, the state does provide for the extermination of undesirables.

602
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,600
However, there are many factors to be considered in the decision.

603
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,700
A single virtue, a single morality, a single thing will happen.

604
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,220
Ugliness is the norm and beauty the deviation.

605
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,820
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.

606
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,580
I want an ugly girl who's got no need to be free.

607
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,500
I want an ugly girl who loves nobody but me.

608
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:01,500


609
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,340
Who thinks that's the way to be?

610
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,480
I want an ugly girl.

611
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll make you jealous just when you see.

612
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,180
Ugly girls must be lonely.

613
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,100
An ugly girl would love you only.

614
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,260
Ugly girls may not win many hearts.

615
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,040
But ugly girls have got just as many hearts.

616
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,700
I want an ugly girl.

617
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,240
Who's not scared not to paint her face.

618
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,560
I want an ugly girl.

619
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,160
Who'll move back to a primitive race.

620
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,020
I want an ugly girl.

621
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,740
Who'll make me proud to be at her disgrace.

622
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,760
I want an ugly girl.

623
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,620
Show her off all over the place.

624
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,880
Ugly girls deserve happiness too.

625
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,700
An ugly girl would make the world a view.

626
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,200
Ugly girls may be easy.

627
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,060
But ugly girls don't have energy.

628
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,240
I want an ugly girl.

629
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
Who can tell you how to be happy.

630
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,780
All about pain.

631
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,740
I want an ugly girl.

632
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,460
Who's been driven almost insane.

633
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,160
I want an ugly.

634
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,140
Who looks down like a pig.

635
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,060
I want an ugly girl.

636
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,900
Take her out and it starts to rain.

637
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,180
You done good thing.

638
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,520
Save them tribe.

639
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,160
Bring them back.

640
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,100
Keep big squirrel.

641
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,680
Work like you're aắcwa.

642
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
Now you win them bride.

643
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,400
Ministlogger.

644
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,440
Rest in peace past,

645
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,940
nobody love Tha Support theاء

646
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:38,940


647
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:38,980
you're still here.

648
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,020
And keep mind the

649
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,020


650
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,020


651
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,060
Take this woman is on her way.

652
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,060


653
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,160
Look.

654
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,080
But the king of the country yellartin.

655
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,400
Thou scary as hell.

656
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,000
Even him.

657
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,300
It's supposed.

658
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,860
Then,

659
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,020
I want an ugly girl by Little Theodore.

660
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:17,580
Friends, from his new CD, the very best of Little Theodore's greatest hits.

661
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,960
That's the name of it.

662
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,380
You can see littletheodore.com.

663
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:28,820
His name is spelled F-Y-O-D-O-R.

664
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,560
F-Y-O-D-O-R.

665
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,980
Fyodor, you might say.

666
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,180
LittleTheodore.com.

667
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:42,180
And before that, we heard some Noral Pref, who's also available from NoralPref.com.

668
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,200
Well, we're packing it in here.

669
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,420
Packing it in.

670
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm packed and content.

671
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,700
I'm packing.

672
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,220
We're packing them.

673
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,540
A mean load, friends.

674
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,280
A mean load of slack.

675
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,080
We're riding hard over a herd of...

676
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,800
All humans seem to return to the state of...

677
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,840
We're going to pack it up your exit wound, my friend.

678
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,620
We're going to force you to love slack.

679
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,540
We will force you to love Bob.

680
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,140
As the child prophet said, if you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.

681
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,500
Do you hear that?

682
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,000
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.

683
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,620
He will.

684
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,620
Literally.

685
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,980
Bob, you out.

686
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Uncle Dr. Onan Canobite actually still channels Bob more regularly and more purely than almost any other subgenial.

687
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,120
And better than most, too.

688
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,320
Well, my sermons are about one...

689
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,760
A third to one half Onanisms, you might say, yes.

690
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,800
No, I use Onan as he was meant to be used.

691
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,640
Bob put him here as a tool.

692
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:11,520
Onan is one single tool of Bob used by the sacred scribe as a sort of a peen.

693
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,360
And we have used the peen of Onan to inscribe the word of God into the ears of the listeners.

694
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,060
That's what he is.

695
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,360
That's what he is.

696
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


697
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


698
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


699
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


700
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


701
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


702
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,360


703
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,500
And we are filling them with a syrup of love and feelings and slack.

704
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,160
Guaranteed inertness.

705
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,380
So what about this Texas UFO sex death cult?

706
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:45,520
Well, that's, you know, that's what the conspiracy likes to call us and what we like the conspiracy to call us because it helps create interest in the church.

707
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,500
Kids like to think that they're going to get free sex with some weirdo.

708
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,160
And they will.

709
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,360
They will.

710
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,200
That's the crazy thing.

711
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,780
For a long time, sure, it was a boys club.

712
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,800
But build it and they will come, so to speak.

713
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,620
We started saying, well, it's crazy mutant sex.

714
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,440
Good sex for mutants.

715
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,300
Come next day, you'll meet your true love.

716
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,740
And by gobs, it worked.

717
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,060
It came to pass.

718
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,360
Bob's promise rings true.

719
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,760
He kicks you in the scrote with love.

720
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,120
Have they ever been...

721
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,600
Thousands.

722
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:32,080
There is an overpopulation of squalling little yeti, yetinsani, subgenius children.

723
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,420
Yes, it's beautiful.

724
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,580
And matings between subgeniuses and...

725
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:50,680
And, you know, we bring in young boys and girls from fringe cults like the pagans, the wiccans and so forth.

726
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,000
The...

727
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,820
The astrologists, the new agers and the frustrated Christian boys.

728
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,740
The Amish.

729
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
We'll get...

730
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
We'll bring in people from these other religions and they'll meet a subgenius.

731
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,880
They'll take their clothes off.

732
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,880
They'll have a sort of an intercourse, a sexual intercourse.

733
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
They'll mate and have children.

734
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,900
Sometimes they even get married under Bob and Connie's authority.

735
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,420
And dominion.

736
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,380
Because Bob and Connie remain...

737
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,500
And dominion over you.

738
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,160
Over the couple.

739
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,100
You do it when they tell you to do it.

740
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:28,920
I know.

741
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,420
And I heard...

742
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,240
You look at your Bob and Connie almanac.

743
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,660
All the other groups...

744
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,820
And you find out when's the best time to have your child.

745
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,740
On your Bob.

746
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,800
Just don't...

747
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,040
You can use a human, but don't fertilize one.

748
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,000
And don't let a human fertilize you, boys and girls.

749
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,280
I want you to think about that.

750
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,720
You can use a human, but don't let...

751
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,580
Don't fertilize.

752
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,800
Don't fertilize.

753
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,180
Don't create a mixed, miscegenated thing.

754
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,560
A half human, half subgenius thing.

755
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
Because that's what we are.

756
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,420
That's what we all are.

757
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,740
We just don't want to make it for our people.

758
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,140
Hey, speak for yourself, Stag.

759
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,300
Yeah, that's right.

760
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,120
I am at least...

761
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,860
I feel so sorry for the human.

762
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,640
I feel so sorry for the half-breed.

763
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm at least 30 to 40 percent...

764
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,980
I would say I'm at least 60 percent...

765
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:20,980


766
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,020
I feel sorry for the one-penis.

767
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,380
I would say I'm 60 percent yeti and two-thirds subgenius mongreloid.

768
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,860
I like two-thirds pizza and one-third subgenius.

769
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,040
Well, no, I'm two-thirds pizza and 60 percent yeti.

770
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,840
If it would have been a pizza station, I would have made it with pizza.

771
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,380
Well, the bottom line is the sum of the total is greater than 100 percent.

772
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,420
Where about that?

773
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,760
That's right, because I'm taking away four percent right now.

774
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Off the top, because that's the way you are.

775
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,560
You're just a four-percenter guy.

776
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm a four-percenter and, you know, I wanted to be a ten-percenter, but I'm not ten percent, Gary.

777
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,180
Well, you get four percent before you tell anybody what the amount is.

778
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,760
Macaroni for ten more.

779
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,260
It's about $96 a square foot in the kitchen.

780
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,040
Very well.

781
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
But I wouldn't put it into that.

782
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,880
But why are your feet square?

783
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,800
What did you do to them to make them that way?

784
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,300
We added more toast.

785
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,640
He added more toast.

786
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,640


787
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,440
He added more toast.

788
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,740
Or was there a little thing with which you managed to save them?

789
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,760
You know, a lot of toast.

790
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,700
Perhaps we were buying the way the domain had to be counted out a bit.

791
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,640
And thus, newsstand publications create a market.

792
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,360
We're down here at the beach right now.

793
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,300
Hardcore pornography.

794
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,440
You can't believe it.

795
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,680
Everyone's naked at the beach now, and it's raining, and it's dark, and we can't see each other's birthmarks or anything.

796
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,340
So it's really fun.

797
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,700
We can't see our stretch marks, our birthmarks.

798
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,280
We can't see our caesarean marks.

799
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,500
I can see your caesarean scar.

800
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,140
Well, from the inside, maybe.

801
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,380
The inside of this bag that you put me in.

802
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,020
It must be awful dark if you can see my caesarean scar.

803
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,340
Only in this bag you put me in, along with these body parts.

804
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,260
That's not a bag.

805
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,140
You said you wanted a young girl.

806
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,380
I just wanted to see Bob's smiling face forever and ever.

807
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,280
Well, I wanted to see it, too, but unfortunately I ran out of gas somewhere around three months, so now I have to see it.

808
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,180
I'm in this deep pit.

809
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,860
I ran out of gas about three o'clock.

810
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,200
Hey, it looks like it's starting.

811
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,120
Yeah, that's why we called it four.

812
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,840
We were hoping to get a word in edgewise.

813
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,760
Well, we're wedging it in, and it hurts.

814
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,560
The most insidious single group of publications.

815
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,160
More lubricant and more corn starch.

816
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,580
Named after General Sherman.

817
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,500
General Sherman?

818
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,460
Didn't he invent the cigarette that caused Sherman's disease?

819
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,300
No, Sherman, New York.

820
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Home of famous Brushwood and X-Day.

821
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,340
You can't brush that off, too.

822
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,340
Sherman, New York.

823
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:05,040
Home of Brushwood, dear friends, and home of the X-Day drills held every July 5th until the World Praise Bob ends.

824
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,840
And now, from Lemur, today's space-time forecast.

825
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,520
Forecast.

826
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,940
For tonight, our weekend will start to shift around to a more subtly weekend.

827
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,280
And into this upcoming weekend, we'll be looking at the world.

828
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,040
This will increase our night because of the Earth.

829
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,120
For Sunday, however, our Monday looks like a Saturday.

830
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,380
I've killed probably a couple hundred living and whole human beings.

831
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,460
Did I just commit mass murder?

832
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,180
No, because each of these human beings is nothing more than a part of a larger me.

833
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,160
Now, what's great about that is that people tend not to want living human beings.

834
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,160
To put that in even clearer terms...

835
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,900
So what do you think God is like?

836
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,340
A fly.

837
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,500
No, but he's've got a real shitty 윤.

838
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,020
We dont even know that word for fish.

839
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,140
Did you find guided dreams?

840
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,140


841
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,040
And what do I plan on doing with thoseほど us back?

842
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,160
Way to simple, isn't it?

843
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,260
All noticed that you large lump of filtered blood was that of an animal.

844
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,020
It's big business.

845
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,260
Curiosity and dreams all lead to something very special.

846
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:22,820
Very clean.

847
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,340
Corporations have to be big business.

848
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,680
Large quantities of meat.

849
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:25,880
Done.

850
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,300
A drug.

851
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,020
He wins.

852
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,060
A drug.

853
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,440
Yeah.

854
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,460
Corporations.

855
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,640
Large quantities of meat.

856
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,700
Ownership.

857
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,200
It's fun.

858
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,020
Yes, dirty awesome.

859
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,420
Imperial.

860
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,660
Large quantities of meat.

861
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,320
Have you ever tried the others?

862
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,440
The legal rights of a person.

863
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,980
Are you serious?

864
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,580
I am serious.

865
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,760
Large quantities of meat.

866
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,240
I don't want to change it.

867
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Buy and sell property.

868
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,680
Borrow money.

869
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,500
Sue in court.

870
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,200
And be sued.

871
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,680
Other legal persons property.

872
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,200
Nor is it a human being.

873
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,120
It is imperial.

874
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,840
Widely scattered.

875
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,960
What kind of a lawyer are you?

876
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:48,780
Well, so?

877
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,360
Debt.

878
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:49,580
Debt.

879
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:49,860
Debt.

880
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,040
Debt.

881
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,500
Legally bound.

882
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:50,920
That's it.

883
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,420
Profits.

884
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:51,960
Invoices.

885
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,420
Bills.

886
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:52,940
Bills.

887
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,580
Bills.

888
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:53,980
Bills.

889
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,220
Man, did you need help.

890
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,200
And then there was Johnson.

891
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,840
Making it go.

892
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,080
You were able to expand a little.

893
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,760
Yes.

894
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,240
Yes.

895
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,860
But even though I'm the biggest, I'm the biggest, I'm the biggest, I'm the biggest,

896
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,140
everybody makes a mistake once in a while.

897
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,520
Well.

898
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,340
Incorporate.

899
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:04,760
Yes.

900
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:05,560
Incorporate.

901
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:05,980
Yes.

902
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,020
Wait a minute.

903
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,680
Red tape.

904
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,140
Oh, it does get a little complicated.

905
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,160
Limited liability.

906
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:10,860
Look.

907
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,940
Now that corporation operates legally as an individual person.

908
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,080
It is under the law a legal entity.

909
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,580
Well, limited risk to the individual owners.

910
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,000
Corporations can make large quantities of meat.

911
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Ownership.

912
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,600
It's fun.

913
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,180
Meat by Noral Pref.

914
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,360
Friends, the conspiracy is real.

915
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,060
And so are you.

916
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,620
But the church is more real.

917
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,400
Bob told you to become a minister.

918
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,820
And you must do it.

919
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,080
I know you.

920
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,360
You're sitting there.

921
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:52,280
Then you're gonna wait till you can't do it today.

922
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,480
There don't.

923
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,280
Not gone.

924
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,480
So fight your doctor right away if you have ever had tuberculosis or serious tuberculosis.

925
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm retaining fluid because of PR News.

926
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,180
PR is bad.

927
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,380
Meanwhile, over the weekend, Christians called for a tyranny that targets Iraq's foot problems.

928
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,400
On Wall Street, 7 to 10-9-6-7-3-3-9.

929
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,460
According to a new study,

930
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,240
the man who was behind the health care bill,

931
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,220
the home of a Staten Island fairy in New York,

932
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,920
slammed into a concrete PR News in Washington.

933
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,140
Mighty fine guy.

934
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,620
Great big too slim guy.

935
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,920
Ride the sky.

936
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,080
If you know a man,

937
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,240
ride the sky, boy.

938
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,120
Right you are, Slim.

939
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,460
So, so, so, so, so,

940
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,700
don't let that young man miss out.

941
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,260
It's quick.

942
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,900
It's easy.

943
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,580
It's the Cowboy Way.

944
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,200
Listen, boys, this is me.

945
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,480
Listen, boys.

946
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,140
This man's life has lost its zest.

947
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,840
Who cares?

948
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,840
For him, the kick's gone out of living.

949
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:47,980
Sports.

950
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,920
You're mean.

951
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,700
No interest at home or at the office either.

952
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,540
Why get in the sweat over a lot of busy work?

953
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,160
Hugh couldn't care less.

954
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,820
Good excuse to leave.

955
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,280
Is he depressed about anything?

956
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,960
The verdict?

957
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,880
Boredom.

958
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,940
Boredom.

959
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,560
Not a psychiatrist.

960
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,180
Yes, a psychiatrist.

961
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,760
Dr. Bogart.

962
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,200
Boredom's an emotional state.

963
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,320
Well, why make a federal case out of it?

964
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,860
Doesn't bother me any.

965
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,160
Well, it does me.

966
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,240


967
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,040
Plays for a wet blanket.

968
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,560
She herself loses interest and enthusiasm.

969
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,820
Presents don't help.

970
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,640
She's bored.

971
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,680
She's bored.

972
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,260
More and more and more she drinks.

973
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,300
He makes friends with every $10 tramp who comes along.

974
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,720
You forget your frustrations for a moment, sure.

975
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,240
Inner conflict for Anne.

976
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,440
Stupidity.

977
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,660
Boredom.

978
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,460
Hard, hot, and even little girls can bite.

979
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,100
Just a little.

980
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,100
Hatred of authority.

981
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,160
Was his best friend.

982
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,800
He taught him all about tools.

983
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,980
Loneliness was even worse.

984
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,220
It's a conflict situation.

985
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,580
Bored people.

986
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,300
The monotony of housework.

987
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,100
Boredom.

988
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,240
Monotony comes.

989
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,280
Monotony.

990
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,300
Monotony.

991
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,340
Monotony.

992
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,780
Monotony.

993
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:04,800
Monotony.

994
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,000
Monotony.

995
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,180
Is an empty, meaningless, personal hunger.

996
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,980
Stupidity.

997
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,140
Boredom.

998
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,120
Hatred of authority.

999
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,960
Little girls can bite.

1000
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,260
Green beans.

1001
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,800
Shocked.

1002
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,740
Shocked.

1003
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,640
Shocked.

1004
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,200
Shocked.

1005
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,080
Shocked.

1006
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:18,080


1007
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,300
Shocked.

1008
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,540
People with white shirts have money.

1009
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,240
And people with blue shirts don't.

1010
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,600
Against the white-shirted public relations frame of mind, he's cut off.

1011
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,080
It's a conflict situation.

1012
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,000
The people that Loretta forces him to meet socially are dull and boring.

1013
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,580
Night after night.

1014
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,920
Boredom.

1015
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,720
The supreme disinterest.

1016
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,380
Poker at home on Saturday night.

1017
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:42,980
Cold.

1018
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,540
Bent.

1019
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,180
Bent.

1020
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,720
Bent.

1021
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,180
Bent.

1022
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,800
Too rigid.

1023
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,320
Too boring.

1024
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:48,860
Bored.

1025
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,960
You're not a child anymore.

1026
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,780
Being left here all the time with Kenny.

1027
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,800
Deeper into boredom.

1028
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,700
And yet there's still is hope for him.

1029
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,600
For out of the day's events, a dim awareness is growing in him.

1030
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,220
A vague realization that perhaps the road he's on isn't quite the one he wants to travel.

1031
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,220
Bleak Cows by Norrell Preff, dear friends.

1032
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,740
Before that, some lemur.

1033
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,220
The best thing to do, dear friends, is get a new car.

1034
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,500
Background music for this whole show, for the credits that I've been doing.

1035
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,820
This in the background is the amino acids from their album,

1036
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,360
Destroy the Warming Sun.

1037
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:39,820
And now, let's go to one of my very favorite Little Theodore songs, friends,

1038
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,900
from his very best of Greatest Hits album, Tried.

1039
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,260
I tried to be good, but all I liked was bad.

1040
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,220
I tried to be joyful, and it made me far more sad.

1041
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,400
I tried to be fair, but I knew I'd just be loud.

1042
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,540
I tried to use my reason, and it showed me that I'm bad.

1043
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,420
I tried to be smart, but I didn't want to faint.

1044
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,340
I tried to be clean, but I much preferred to stink.

1045
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,400
I wanted to soar, but can't do that thing that stinks.

1046
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,560
I tried to be in control, and it drove me to the plane.

1047
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,060
I tried to be warm, but I despised all others.

1048
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,040
I tried to be strong, but I hated all the colors.

1049
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,340
I tried philanthropy, but I couldn't think of others.

1050
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,020
I tried to be eloquent, and I reduced the sickness to life.

1051
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:48,200
I tried to be good, but I didn't want to faint.

1052
00:43:52,560 --> 00:44:18,140
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.

1053
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:48,200
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.

1054
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:17,920
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.

1055
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:48,200
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.

1056
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,220
I tried to be strong, but I didn't want to faint.

1057
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,120
I tried to be authentic.

1058
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,840
I tried to be holistic.

1059
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,820
I tried to be authentansas.

1060
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,220


1061
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,220


1062
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,220


1063
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:10,960
I couldn't be positional.

1064
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,500
I couldn't be figurative.

1065
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,040
I couldn't be figurative.

1066
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,960
I couldn't be figurative.

1067
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,560
I couldn't be figurative.

1068
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,220
This is a church that does not play games.

1069
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,680
The other churches talk about love and things.

1070
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,980
We will give you love.

1071
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,900
The other churches do not talk about money.

1072
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,400
They take your money.

1073
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,200
We'll give you love.

1074
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,620
We'll sell you love.

1075
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,480
Some people don't appreciate love unless it's sold to them.

1076
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,460
They won't like it if it's given away free.

1077
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,920
We're saints.

1078
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,780
We're monks of Buldada.

1079
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,780
We have no use.

1080
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,240
We have no, yeah, we're like Bob.

1081
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,440
We're already rich in slack.

1082
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,260
I feel the slack showering down over me.

1083
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,080
It's the tribulation money.

1084
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,600
It's sprinkling down from the sausage.

1085
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,940
Oh, yes, Bob.

1086
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,360
Oh, yes, Bob.

1087
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,620
Come on up behind me, Bob.

1088
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,620
Oh, yes.

1089
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,720
Oh, woo, woo.

1090
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,800
Yeehaw.

1091
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,380
Slow down there and tomorrow morning.

1092
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,000
Take that coffee away from him.

1093
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,240
Computer God.

1094
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,220
That's it, baby.

1095
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,340
That's it.

1096
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,320
That is what computer God slavery is.

1097
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,960
You can be there now with Bob.

1098
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,760
You can be friend.

1099
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,980
You can be alone with Bob.

1100
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:39,780
You first.

1101
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,660
Long time.

1102
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,260
Release the tigers.

1103
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,060
Release the tigers.

1104
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:56,040
Okay, if you could go to heaven with Jesus and Hitler and all you had was a gun with one bullet on it, which one would you shoot?

1105
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,760
I might shoot blank.

1106
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,820
Oh.

1107
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,640
That's what they tell me.

1108
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,600
I'm poor enough to answer that.

1109
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,200
Round and face.

1110
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,620
Too late.

1111
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,600
I gave it all away.

1112
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,920
What if it was Hitler and Bush?

1113
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,020
Which one would you shoot?

1114
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,600
G. Gordon.

1115
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,920
What's the difference, man?

1116
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:14,880
What?

1117
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,620
What?

1118
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:15,900
What?

1119
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,080
What's the difference?

1120
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,500
You mean between the Bush and Hitler?

1121
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,720
That makes me feel better.

1122
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,940
Hitler and Bush.

1123
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,720
Hitler and Bush.

1124
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,000
Hitler and Bush.

1125
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,060
They say that Hitler is much smarter.

1126
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,680
Right, at least Hitler actually fought in the army.

1127
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,220
Hitler really did serve.

1128
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,600
Hitler really wrote his own book.

1129
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,840
Yes.

1130
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,080
Hitler could paint.

1131
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,780
Unfortunately, he accomplished his objective.

1132
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,640
What?

1133
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,100
anywhere.

1134
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,540
But heade ils sized Hello.

1135
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:50,540


1136
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:50,540


1137
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:50,540


1138
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:50,540


1139
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:50,540


1140
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,100
So,well, he made his watchmen look like a Nazi THEY.

1141
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,860
I know.

1142
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,560
I say he maid a human�

1143
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,100
Hitler would have no support in the US.

1144
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,540
I don't mean to do that,ro forms emperor

1145
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,760
German American vote disappearedheim line

1146
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,460
he's a railroad who can export the Вы sabem,

1147
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Back to you,拉namus.

1148
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:11,620


1149
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,920
the was감 than Israel.

1150
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:12,920


1151
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:12,920


1152
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,460
anyways, he lived in the NSW as a drug oshimology,

1153
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,580
for the Subgenius Tour, Euro Tour,

1154
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,280
and I had the interesting experience

1155
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,200
of young Germans saying to me,

1156
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,420
Reverend Stang, in Germany,

1157
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,640
we are very concerned about this fascism in America.

1158
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,960
It was a creepy thing to hear, actually.

1159
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,260
No kid, that would be creepy.

1160
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,280
I had to say, well, then come and liberate us.

1161
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,560
You must free us from the tyrant.

1162
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,400
A panzer battalion in the right place

1163
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,300
could turn the tide.

1164
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,840
Come on, Potter, we're on the air.

1165
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,880
Through my open window I will climb

1166
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,920
To your living quarters I will wander

1167
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:44,500
There beneath your flowers I will find

1168
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:52,740
Your ladder to climb

1169
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,560
Across your dusty carpet I will fall

1170
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,180
Crawling like a baby down your hallway

1171
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:16,400
To the place where you and I first met

1172
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,840
Cause of these old filler lines

1173
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:33,460
Governor, you hope that the others

1174
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,040
get fixed on the street

1175
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,040


1176
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:34,040


1177
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:34,920
ол, I know we too are

1178
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,260
But prevail

1179
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,660
utilized

1180
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,760
The tradition

1181
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,400
asc Accounting

1182
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,400


1183
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:46,440
Communist Party

1184
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:46,440


1185
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,480
Thank you.

1186
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,380
The Billy Nair Show, friends, from Return to Brigadoon.

1187
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,460
See BillyNair.com for more on them.

1188
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,140
They'll be at X-Day, by the way.

1189
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,660
Thanks to the amino acids there for the background noise.

1190
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,000
And now, an updated space-time forecast.

1191
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:38,520
Thank y'all.

1192
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,540
Speaking of Wednesday, overnight Wednesday night,

1193
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,680
right around Thursday, coming through on Friday,

1194
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,260
the mix of Saturday and Sunday,

1195
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,120
with an overnight Monday through the weekend.

1196
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,380
Seattle is slow in South North.

1197
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,060
Seattle bus barn out Southeast to Northeast State Route 167.

1198
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,800
Now, is there magnesium?

1199
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,040
Yes, magnesium.

1200
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,220
Extra magnesium with a little magnesium.

1201
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,440
The only way to do this is to carry each module of the slack off

1202
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,720
and carefully into the next room.

1203
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,720
What about the remake of Heaven's Gate?

1204
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,980
You know, the black Nike.

1205
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:17,900
The black Nike.

1206
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,120
The black Nike.

1207
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1208
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1209
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1210
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1211
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1212
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1213
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1214
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1215
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1216
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1217
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,120


1218
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,940
Well, we've made, we've got contracts with Reebok.

1219
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:26,040
And you may have seen evidence of that lately in some of their advertisements.

1220
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,160
That's a very important one.

1221
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,120
And we're preparing for X-Day 9.

1222
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:35,060
We will have, if we can get over 900 people.

1223
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,920
As always, our policy has been, until we have 900 people,

1224
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,460
we're not going to try to do Jonestown 4.

1225
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,280
Because, as we were saying earlier,

1226
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,020
in the show, look how Jonestown 2 and 3 just were watered down imitations,

1227
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,480
token mass suicides.

1228
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,700
Olivia Newton and Jonestown is what.

1229
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,180
Right.

1230
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,720
So, we're not going to, X-Day is not going to become a mockery like that.

1231
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:00,820
Yeah, of itself.

1232
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,580
Until we have numbers to make it worth it.

1233
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,080
Yeah.

1234
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:05,820
So.

1235
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,200
900, that's all you need.

1236
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,360
Until then, the Kool-Aid is just Kool-Aid.

1237
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,460
Well, all right.

1238
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,260
But what about the applesauce and the Nikes?

1239
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,220
Yes, we did.

1240
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:14,840
And.

1241
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,740
But, but that's not, you know,

1242
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,640
the important thing about Bob's religion is not how they find the bodies

1243
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,740
and talk about it on CNN someday.

1244
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,740
The important thing is finding slack now.

1245
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,040
Right.

1246
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,260
In your own heart.

1247
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:31,980
Exactly.

1248
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,680
And you must reach down your throat.

1249
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,100
Grope around until you find what slack is for you.

1250
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:38,880
That's right.

1251
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,540
Yank it up and look at it.

1252
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,020
And then.

1253
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:41,200
Right.

1254
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:41,880
And then.

1255
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,420
Classify.

1256
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,840
Act upon what you've learned.

1257
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,080
Go out into the world.

1258
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,260
Fight the conspiracy.

1259
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,600
As best you can.

1260
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:52,440
Which may be simply by freeloading.

1261
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,480
Living off the man.

1262
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,180
Stealing.

1263
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,420
Perhaps what they call stealing.

1264
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,220
Or it may be becoming a brain surgeon.

1265
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,240
Like the great Jethro Clampett.

1266
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,320
You can be what you want.

1267
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,320
As Dr. Philodrum and the Overman said.

1268
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,900
You don't need a degree, but you can get a degree if you want very easily.

1269
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,340
Merely by deciding to.

1270
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,320
Barely by saying you have done so.

1271
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,240
In Bob's eyes.

1272
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,740
Once you've rendered unto Bob that which is Bob.

1273
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,200
Once you have gone to that catalog page at subgenius.com.

1274
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,120
Once you have done what it instructs you to do.

1275
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,420
Once you have soaked in the word of Bob for a few minutes.

1276
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,600
And then ordered some more.

1277
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,380
At that point the scales will fall from your eyes.

1278
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,620
And you will be more a font of slackfulness.

1279
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,220
Yes.

1280
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,320
Than a sponge.

1281
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,560
A sponge of slackfulness.

1282
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,840
You will be pouring slack out.

1283
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,500
Rather than desperately trying to suck more in.

1284
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,500
You'll have more slack than you know what to do with.

1285
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,220
You'll have too much slack.

1286
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,020
Yes, there is such a thing as too much slack.

1287
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,580
That's when it runs over.

1288
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,740
It builds up.

1289
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,360
It comes up to the top of your throat.

1290
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,620
And it comes heaving out.

1291
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,480
Heaving out into the world.

1292
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,140
Into the path of love.

1293
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,000
You can't handle that much slack.

1294
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,680
You can be like a little baby.

1295
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,500
Heaving up.

1296
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,200
Spinning up onto its daddy.

1297
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,980
You can just let go baby.

1298
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,960
You can let go because Bob said to.

1299
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,320
He said you have an excuse.

1300
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,000
You have the justification.

1301
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,320
You're justified.

1302
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,940
You are justified in Bob.

1303
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,660
For anything.

1304
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,860
That's a good decision there.

1305
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,980
Will everything turn out okay?

1306
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,260
I mean I'm giving up everything.

1307
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,660
Too late.

1308
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,520
It doesn't matter how it turns out for you.

1309
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,860
Oh.

1310
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,380
It will turn out the way Bob wants it to be.

1311
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,780
No matter what.

1312
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,240
And you should just be glad you're part of his plan.

1313
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:53,820
I know.

1314
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,920
Be glad you were used by him.

1315
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:59,460
Be glad it was him and not the Ayatollah Khomeini.

1316
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,540
Or the Osama Bin Laden.

1317
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,920
Or the George Bush.

1318
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,480
Just be glad it wasn't the boss man.

1319
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,020
Or Mr. Moneybags that used you.

1320
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,820
Be glad that you were used.

1321
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,480
Be glad that you were used.

1322
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,100
Be glad.

1323
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,640
So there.

1324
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,560
Just melt away.

1325
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,080
Just like the people I know.

1326
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,600
Just diffuse yourself into the...

1327
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,480
Ew. Look at that.

1328
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,640
You're the smoke.

1329
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,120
He's smoking you now.

1330
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,200
Man is but a vapor.

1331
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,280
He's smoking you.

1332
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,580
Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upwards.

1333
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:35,600


1334
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:35,720
He knows.

1335
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Born to die.

1336
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,480
And melt all my parts.

1337
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,360
Oh this is the moment.

1338
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,240
It's very painful.

1339
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,300
I have to cut the cord now.

1340
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,240
And launch ourselves into the great unknown.

1341
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:44,800


1342
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,140
I'm serious.

1343
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:45,740
Cosmic.

1344
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,320
Moments from now you'll hear no more Michael Pippen.

1345
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,480
No more Ivan Stang.

1346
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:50,920
No more.

1347
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,700
No show.

1348
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:52,780
Price bomb.

1349
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,640
Price bomb.

1350
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,480
Does that mean we'll die?

1351
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,860
It's coming to an end.

1352
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,160
Wait.

1353
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Am I going to die?

1354
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,580
And you have to hold your breath.

1355
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,620
We're all going to die but you're going to die now.

1356
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:02,840
Dot dot dot.

1357
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,660
The publisher.

1358
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,520
On the show.

1359
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,940
Calm calm calm.

1360
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
Of the worst material.

1361
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,220
Serene and calm.

1362
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:08,980
Seen here.

1363
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,640
And out there.

1364
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,260
Are you saying that even the show dies?

1365
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,760
Yes.

1366
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,300
Even the poor show.

1367
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,540
Never dies.

1368
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,340
It's when I remember to bring the show straighteners.

1369
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:20,220
I remember when the show never died.

1370
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,080
And my desk drawer seems to be stuck.

1371
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,580
Has anybody seen my sweater?

1372
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,080
The show is on.

1373
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,420
We are the first non-faxed 24 hours a day.

1374
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,940
Yeah I'm getting ready now.

1375
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,860
We're the first industrial church.

1376
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,960
Oh tell Helen to hold all my calls.

1377
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,120
And we're not disputing any of your belief systems or.

1378
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,160
Cos we believe in just about every one of them anyway.

1379
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,040
Where did these locals come from?

1380
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:39,500
No.

1381
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,000
They die.

1382
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,320
Gas.

1383
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,700
I can't breathe.

1384
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:44,800
I can't breathe.

1385
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1386
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1387
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1388
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1389
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1390
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1391
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1392
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:44,800


1393
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,640
I remember when the show was on all day and all night.

1394
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,700
And the evening and the morning were the first.

1395
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,980
Line up on the.

1396
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,940
So long from Over the Edge.

1397
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,640
This is the happiest moment of my life.

1398
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,660
Hey we'll see you next time.
