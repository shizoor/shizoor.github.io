1
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,380
Slack, slack, slack.

3
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,420
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,520
Praise Bob.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
And we'll be orbiting your area for the next hour,

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,560
carrying the message, the seed word of the faith of Bob,

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,260
the faith in Bob, F-I-B, we call it.

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,000
Can you keep up the F-I-B, friend?

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,440
You want to dump the main shots?

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,220
Thank you.

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,220
All right.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:57,420


13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,600
Somewhere over there.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,140
The show's right up on the green lines, doctor.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,740
The show is fully on the line.

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,580
We will be landing on another show.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,620
We will be docking with another show tonight.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,280
Pardon me.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,140
You can't land on another show because of nuclear explosion.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,720
We'll be docking with show four from San Francisco tonight.

21
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,540
And hold on to your seats.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,320
Oh!

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,520
Oh!

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,220
Are you okay?

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
This material?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
This material contains information affecting the national defense of the United States

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,680
within the meaning of the espionage law,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,720
Title 18, U.S.C., sections 7098 and 74,

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,600
a transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,460
is indefinitely prohibited by law.

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,380
Bob?

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Bob?

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,680
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,980
Every time you say, see, hear, or think,

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bob?

36
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,480
Bob?

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,780
That's your key phrase.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,720
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,100
We are controlling transmission.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520
And what exactly does this do for them?

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,060
Oh, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and it prepares their mind for the

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,480
slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,400
It's time to be manipulated.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,740
Brother, I want to tell you something.

45
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,260
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers.

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,980
Dead preachers.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,960
Creatures preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,660
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,160
This world is hungry for reality.

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,940
They've had enough of Hollywood.

51
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,840
They've had enough of Nashville.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,940
They've had enough of show business.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,140
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise goddamn Bob!

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Oh, yes!

56
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Ah!

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,780
The sound itself.

58
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,880
It has a stink to it.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,820
It's bad!

60
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,180
Ah, yes, dear friends.

61
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,940
It's your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang, treading around Stang Ranch.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,840
I was in my office today and realized that I've got to crank a show out.

63
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,340
And we're busy.

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
We're real busy with all this other stuff involving this documentary.

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,260
And I'm not sure if you've heard of the documentary movie.

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,620
And other things.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,820
And picking a rerun is agonizing.

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,880
And I thought, why don't we just do one of our albums that we used to sell.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,920
Well, we do, but nobody buys them.

70
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,980
This one is called Bob's Hour of Slack Classics.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,360
And it's really some of my favorite cuts from the old Media Barrage tapes.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,540
As well as bits of Arise and video things that we did in the past.

73
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,060
I think this was assembled around 2000.

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,200
We were doing ESO Swamp Radio by then.

75
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,460
There was a little bit of that in there.

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,580
But it's mostly old-timer stuff.

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,100
You heard G. Gordon Gordon and St. Byron Werner and Pope David N. Meyer and Puzzling Evidence.

78
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,020
Brother Cleve.

79
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,900
Well, I bet I'll have to cut that for the radio broadcast.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Mm-hmm.

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,760
On Encounter Byte, Dr. Philo Drummond.

82
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,620
Gary Brokfan.

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,320
Lies.

84
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
Pope Sternodocs.

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,260
Bleepo Abernathy.

86
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Bill T. Miller.

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,100
The King of Slack.

88
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,420
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,660
Dr. Hal Robbins.

90
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,300
Sister Melodious Chops.

91
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,740
DK Jones.

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,920
Lost Souls Incorporated.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,440
The Walk-Ins.

94
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,920
And Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

95
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,960
So, with names like that, you know it's got to be good or at least weird.

96
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,440
Praise Bob.

97
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,640
What the hell do you think you're doing?

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,940
Dragging your butt through the day, selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

99
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,320
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

100
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,200
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex?

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,280
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

102
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,020
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

103
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,240
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subgenus.

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,260
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

105
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,440
For Bob comes to justify our sins.

106
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,800
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us back the slack they stole away.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,620
It's us versus them.

108
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,760
Are you going to fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

109
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,720
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

110
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,480
Repent.

111
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Quit your job.

112
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,660
Slack off.

113
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,500
And praise Bob.

114
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,260
Church of the Subgenus.

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,060
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

116
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,620
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne.

117
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,760
And reach out for the good book that will save my soul.

118
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,660
Save me from the clutches of conspiracy.

119
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,760
Save me from the chains of time.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,580
Save me from the men in black.

121
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,380
And the black who's never subgenius.

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,860
Black, South, Black.

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,940
Praise Bob.

124
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,140
Praise Bob.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,160
Praise Bob.

126
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,020
Praise Bob.

127
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,740
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely because of your ministry.

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,020
Now what?

129
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:14,820
Do you believe this?

130
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,560
And do I share everything with you of your

131
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,560


132
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,940
I was getting messages in the back of my brain.

133
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,120
And I just kept hearing the word Bob, Bob, Bob.

134
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,860
They said your mind is in this jar and then they poured it down the sink.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,960
Subgeniuses are the class of people who can't be classified.

136
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,380
Subgeniuses come from a better world and they're going to a better world.

137
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,080
They descended from abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late 1998 into over men and over women.

138
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:04,300
It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last million years or so.

139
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,400
I guess some of those people that complained about the so-called failure of X-Day last year,

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,360
maybe they just happened to miss that very first sentence at the top.

141
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,800
I mean, at the top of the very first pamphlet that was published in 1979, and I don't mean the phrase one dollar.

142
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,340
Friends, at the top of that pamphlet, what does it say? It says the world ends tomorrow.

143
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,200
The world ends tomorrow and you may die. Not the day after tomorrow, not on July 5th, 1998.

144
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,340
Tomorrow. How many of you have been living your lives as if the world ends tomorrow?

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,360
Or else as if you had all day?

146
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,660
Or else as if you had all the time in the world?

147
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,560
Because if you like doing one or the other, you're wasting it all.

148
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,280
But who cares anyway, friends? God damn it, we're religious nuts.

149
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses stop coming to your door just because their world didn't end those five or six times in a row? Hell no!

150
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,920
Are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-coup us? Say no!

151
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,900
No!

152
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,080
No, friends, we'll be the ultimate.

153
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:25,180
Superstitious religious nuts. Besides, when you get right down to it, isn't reality itself a superstition?

154
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,620
No, really, we're a fun crowd. You'd like us to move in next door to you.

155
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,940
To you, we'd be indistinguishable from the others you might see in your town.

156
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:42,980
Oh, maybe we'd have a wink in our twinkling eye, a smile or a leer on our lips, but otherwise we'd look like everyday Joe Lunchpail.

157
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,360
A good, solid, honest, cream-colored woman.

158
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,800
And a working man, ready to move in next to you and send the property values soaring. How about it, America? Get in step.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,300
Well, let's try it out, huh?

160
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,140
Are we controlled by secret forces?

161
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,600
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

162
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,040
Do people think you're strange?

163
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Do you?

164
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,340
Then you may be on the right track!

165
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Are you abnormal?

166
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,360
Then you are probably better than most people.

167
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,400
Yes, your kind shall triumph!

168
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,740
Disobedient to parents, a subgenius.

169
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,700
Steals, a subgenius.

170
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,240
Lies, a subgenius.

171
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,220
Hater of God, a subgenius.

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,000
Whisperer, a subgenius.

173
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,300
Whoremonger, a subgenius.

174
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,820
Envious, a subgenius.

175
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,480
Pride, a subgenius.

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,260
A backbiter, a subgenius.

177
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,160
A deceitful person, a subgenius.

178
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,080
A hypocrite, a subgenius.

179
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,800
Unmerciful, a subplenius.

180
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,500
A false accuser, a subbenius.

181
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,740
Well, I guess that about wraps it up. That's your typical subgenius now.

182
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,000
Monk, I don't need Dobbs. There's nothing wrong with me. I'll make it my way.

183
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,420
Oh, good.

184
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,820
I must have been insane.

185
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,960
What can I say? I'm lost without Dobbs. Without Bob. I'm guilty. Guilty.

186
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,480
Twenty-seven sheets.

187
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,440
Be not deceived. Dobbs is not mocked. For whosoever a man soeth, him also shall he reap.

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,420
For it is my shepherd, I shall not want.

189
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,420
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

190
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,860
Any abnormal sound?

191
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,940
Normal.

192
00:11:42,480 --> 00:12:12,480


193
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:42,480


194
00:12:42,480 --> 00:13:12,480


195
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:42,480


196
00:13:42,480 --> 00:14:12,480


197
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:42,480


198
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,840
The conspiracy mania ought to be normal.

199
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,900
Normal.

200
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,760
Normal.

201
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,720
Normal.

202
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,340
Happily, delightfully, constantly normal.

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,420
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

204
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,060
It's not normal.

205
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,260
Make more noise! Let's hear it! Come on, let's hear it!

206
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,360
Orchid.

207
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,840
Tonom!

208
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,000
Tonom!

209
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,820
T cherry!

210
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,020
unft.

211
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
T malt!

212
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
M.

213
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,220
At last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

214
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,340
This is it.

215
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,160
The only fate that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

216
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,800
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.

217
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,360
But you tried everything.

218
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,400
You ain't seen nothing yet.

219
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,200
Learn to think big.

220
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,440
Develop the tricks of length extension.

221
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,620
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

222
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,700
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

223
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,340
Mom is a way of life to millions.

224
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,980
Yet half of them don't even know it.

225
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,860
He's the one true living slack master.

226
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,260
Master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

227
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,160
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

228
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,480
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

229
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,780
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

230
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,020
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

231
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,840
And coming right back.

232
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,260
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

233
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,620
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

234
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,660
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

235
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,180
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

236
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,120
That will fool normals and get you sex.

237
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,020
And stop, make useless, fatal, tocar cats and kill normal.

238
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
Bob'siefando is ready to groundspar.

239
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,900
While a six-million-year cycle will end in 1998.

240
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,900
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon.

241
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,740
Which, in a few years, will bring more wondrous and miraculous change.

242
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,560
And carnage, insanity and destruction, than all of mankind's history and pre-history before it.

243
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,320
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

244
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,980
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know.

245
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,100
While billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on earth.

246
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,980
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebirth.

247
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,320
And a cascade of astounding mysteries.

248
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,400
Three supernatural bridges and a restoration of lost psychic abilities.

249
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,060
That will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

250
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,720
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

251
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,300
Here's more money, Bob!

252
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,000
When I used to be a sinner.

253
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,840
Cause I truly did believe.

254
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,360
That the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and me were thick as thieves.

255
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,660
And I used to give my daughter a evangelistic snob.

256
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,040
But then the light had shone upon me.

257
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,100
And I found J.R. Bob Dobbs.

258
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,660
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

259
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,180
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

260
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,300
Well, my heart is for my honey.

261
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,320
And my brain is for my job.

262
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,660
But my wallet.

263
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,280
Belongs to Bob.

264
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,220
I was a slave.

265
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,560
Well, Bobby goes to propping every chance that he can get.

266
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,860
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

267
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,220
So I gave him all my money.

268
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Reverend Stanks said it was right.

269
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,560
And for only $20, he did save my soul tonight.

270
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,080
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

271
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

272
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,820
No more can look conspiracy.

273
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,900
My lonely wages rob.

274
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,920
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

275
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,160
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie.

276
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,360
And Connie is her name.

277
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,660
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

278
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,300
She's a little bit of a wimp.

279
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,940
But she reaches in Bob's pocket.

280
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,980
Fuels around for something hard.

281
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,400
Then pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card.

282
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,860
And now my wallet belongs to Bob.

283
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,260
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
And I never have to fear.

285
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,320
Because I know Connie's on the job.

286
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,480
And my wallet belongs to Bob.

287
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,880
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too.

288
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,240
Their existential energy may be what's right for you.

289
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,520
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cubs.

290
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,820
And give away your money to the one that gets results.

291
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,280
And then your wallet will be for Bob.

292
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

293
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
And you will be subgenius.

294
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,880
Not another stupid slob.

295
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,800
And your wallet will be for Bob.

296
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,780
Well, I believe I am much calmer.

297
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,480
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer sitting on the dashboard of my car.

298
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,080
Crazy.

299
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:51,760
Here he has my bag.

300
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:01,200
Man sir, don't try to tell me I will be the lefty.

301
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,200


302
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,200


303
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,840
I will tell you, dear, that I will smile the die and I am not a coward.

304
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,140
Well, I try to have you calm down because there is a new car.

305
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,140


306
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,140


307
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,140


308
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,160
Come say hi.

309
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,380
Yeah.

310
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,040
In Dobbs Town,

311
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,300
when Bodhisattva Dobbs sits under the open sky,

312
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,800
unraveling small business parables

313
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,340
to the devout zombies gathered around him,

314
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,020
birds flock overhead to give him shade.

315
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,920
They let their droppings fall only on his followers.

316
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
In his dharma, or teaching,

317
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,760
the master Dobbs demands absolute self-deification,

318
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,380
the retainting and depurification of the ego,

319
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
and the achievement of all selfish desires.

320
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,860
The only way to handle temptation, he admonishes,

321
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,060
is to go at it until it hurts.

322
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,780
Then it will be finished with you and will leave you alone.

323
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,620
Unless you get hooked.

324
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,020
Then, only larger donations to the church can save you.

325
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,080
Bob will protect you.

326
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,140
Bob is protecting the genetic future.

327
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,100
Let him. Let him into your life.

328
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,740
Let Bob protect you. He wants to protect you.

329
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,520
He must protect you. He has to protect you.

330
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,240
Jehovah One says Bob will protect you.

331
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,900
If you send a dollar to Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 1-800-544-7000.

332
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,380
1-800-544-7000.

333
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,300
1 dollar for salvation. 1 dollar.

334
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,160
Not 30 dollars to Bob Poo's that you consider your life to be worth 30 dollars.

335
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,120
You'll spend that much on Prince and rock stars anyway.

336
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,260
He gave life to you and to me.

337
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,720
Pray to him, Antillius. He will listen to your prayers.

338
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,800
Wise up! They're out to get you.

339
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,900
The different are being saved.

340
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,140
Silenced by a global conspiracy.

341
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,000
Weird men arise! Find out who they are and how to smash them!

342
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,560
You probably already knew that the U.S. government is a sham.

343
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,120
Something propped up there for you to blame.

344
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,420
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

345
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,800
That they are actually shambling?

346
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,940
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

347
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,920
Yes!

348
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,740
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!

349
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,980
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.

350
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,440
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.

351
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,400
God has been misquoted all this time.

352
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:04,520
His actual words may disturb you, but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety.

353
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,940
The society tormenting mankind.

354
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,020
It's not just the wars and the awards that win them.

355
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:19,400
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

356
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,000
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

357
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:31,040
It's not just the child zombies that murder their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

358
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:41,260
It's not just those starry old vecks on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

359
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,020
It's not just the anesthesiologist for needy.

360
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,460
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

361
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,940
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

362
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,020
It's not just the broken headlights of the police.

363
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,020


364
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,020


365
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,000
It's not just the high snapped antenna and human excrement on your car hood.

366
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,840
It's not just that the old ways were best.

367
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,260
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

368
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,080
It's not just the killer shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

369
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,300
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

370
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,020
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain that is defending the

371
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
entire planet.

372
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,160
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

373
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,660
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

374
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,540
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a bitch who thinks workers are property.

375
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,240
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

376
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,020
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature.

377
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,100
It's not just the

378
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,720
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

379
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,200
It's not just the doorway to doom.

380
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,940
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

381
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,160
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

382
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,220
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

383
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,020
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

384
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,200
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

385
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,780
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

386
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,880
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

387
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,060
Not off.

388
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,800
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

389
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,360
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

390
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,520
There's no prob with Bob.

391
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,260
Bob is a sex god.

392
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,500
Bob is a sex god.

393
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,160
Unbelievable.

394
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,480
Unspeakable.

395
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Unbelievable.

396
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,400
Unbelievable.

397
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,900
Unbelievable.

398
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,840
Friends, how would you like to get laid with impunity?

399
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,780
He's here tonight!

400
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,340
How would you? He is here?

401
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,120
He ain't got no other place to go, man. He's lonely as hell.

402
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:48,580
The imp of punity has finally come, and I am an ordained minister.

403
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,720
I am an officially approved holy man by the government's orders

404
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,800
and by virtue of the Universal Life Church and of J.R. Bob Dobbs and Connie Dobbs.

405
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,980
Hail Connie, praise Bob.

406
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:14,960
And friends, there's a tradition in our church that says, that's, that says, that's, well, you know, we're outnumbered by conspiracy pinks,

407
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,340
Barbies and Kins, caged men, box dwellers, mediocritans, and so forth.

408
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:29,740
And that means, friends, that we have to overpopulate the planet with as many little subgeniuses as we possibly can

409
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,960
until the whole planet is so overpopulated with them that it practically tips over.

410
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,680
And you know what that means, friends, to repopulate the planet with subgeniuses?

411
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,040
That means simply that you have to love more.

412
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,980
Well, love doesn't have anything to do with it. It just means you have to reproduce.

413
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:57,100
Like animals, it's a natural thing, but it's not natural unless it's approved by God and the state.

414
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:07,660
And that's why you're in luck. Whether your idea of great sex is with that babe or stud or animal sitting next to you,

415
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,600
or with just your right hand or your left hand if it's sort of a kinky night.

416
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,860
Why, friends, all you need, just as all the, the scarecrow needed,

417
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,500
was his diploma, and just as all the tin man needed was his, uh, certificate,

418
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,500
all you need is a short duration subgenius marriage.

419
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,580
And, uh, I know you are gonna probably sin or not sin tonight, whether, no matter whether we officially did it or not,

420
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:48,480
but this way you won't go to hell. So, friends, oh, yes, dear friends, do you voyeurs and weirdos here,

421
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,240
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so I'll be bald and Connie say, I do, I do, okay?

422
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:06,740
Friend, are there any here who, any jealous losers and uptight puritanical idiots who think that these couples and triples

423
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:16,600
and a whole damn room shouldn't be united in some disgusting way of sexual love and wedding official matrimony racing?

424
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,820
Speak now or, well, fuck you, we don't care.

425
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:18,960
Speak now or, well, fuck you, we don't care.

426
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,620
Are there any?

427
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:34,780
Oh, well, do you, insert name here, male and or female or whatever type of subgenius,

428
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:48,540
swear upon the eyes of Dobbs' sainted dead mother, Jane, to take this other subgenius or pet at home or favorite porno star

429
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,240
or fantasy, your shoe, your wedding ring, your condom in your wallet,

430
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,760
do you swear to take this mate, this right hand, this left hand, whatever,

431
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:10,120
as your permanent will for the next 24 hours to have and to hold for richer or poorer in sickness and in kinkiness,

432
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,000
ah, forever and, well, for the next 24 hours starting now, 1 a.m., say, I do.

433
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,520
I do.

434
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:18,660
I do.

435
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,080
I do.

436
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,760
I do.

437
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,460
Okay.

438
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,480
Shake hands on it and say, it's a deal.

439
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,920
It's a deal.

440
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,820
It's a deal.

441
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,000
It's a deal.

442
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,880
We're all married now, so we're all friends here, you can go ahead and start farting and…

443
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,400
and…

444
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,720
Actually, to tell the truth, friends, the very first time I came to this Starwood thing…

445
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,500
Oh, you must now kiss the bride and consummate the peace.

446
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,020
or else you make a mockery of the sacred institution of marriage.

447
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,360
Oh, my God.

448
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,700
Is this for real?

449
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,780
No, no, no.

450
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,780
This is just a tape.

451
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,260
Relax.

452
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,520
It is not the day before or the week between.

453
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,720
It's just the show.

454
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,320
Hey, that new church air is just great.

455
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,960
It's fun.

456
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:36,300
Well, son, if you'll just keep breathing an equal portion of church air with all of the bad air, too, you'll get like me.

457
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,680
Your head will begin to expand.

458
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,120
The inside will eventually become larger than the outside.

459
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,440
I don't know quite how to explain this.

460
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,160
But I've put my trust in Bob.

461
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:58,920
Thanks to Bob, the inside of my head is much larger than the outside ever was.

462
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,340
But doesn't that make it hard to get through doorways?

463
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,640
Sometimes I do get lost inside my head.

464
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,440
And I've had trouble finding my way out, especially early in the morning.

465
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:17,600
But thanks to Bob, I'll be a much more productive employee on the job.

466
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'll be able to do my job.

467
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:25,020
And I've had a great time at parties with this new big head that came with my glandscaping.

468
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,440
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man, too?

469
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,100
Yes, son.

470
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,420
You'll go through the operations, too.

471
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,140
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments.

472
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:43,660
And you'll be able to whiff-read the stenches of all the normals and pinks around you.

473
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,840
You'll be able to sell them anything, son.

474
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
Just like me.

475
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,720
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend.

476
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,720
Oh, look out, son. Here it comes now.

477
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,300
It's frightening, isn't it?

478
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,140
It's unbelievably scary.

479
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,780
It's not wrenching.

480
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,500
It's not wrenching.

481
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,320
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

482
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,860
Your doorbell rings.

483
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,480
And you're gone.

484
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,320
And there's a chaplain standing quietly.

485
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,180
He tells you,

486
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,480
We're splashing liberation right around the world.

487
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,200
And we'll die to do it.

488
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,380
And a mastery of the art of mass hypnotism are their stock in trade.

489
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,720
You see, Bobby, old Bob Dobbs, he's the sucker that's reborn every minute.

490
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,420
And yet he's the money which that sucker spendeth.

491
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,960
And he is the bank in which that money is locked.

492
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,940
He's companionship for the lonely when no one is there.

493
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,040
He's your best friend and he'll never let you down.

494
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,040
He's the dad you never knew you had.

495
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,180
He's the son every mom knows she gave birth to.

496
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,920
Bob is the uncle who told you what the dirty words mean.

497
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,360
And he's the little sister you'll fight any bully to protect.

498
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,880
Bob, my friend, is your big brother.

499
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,080
Bob is a rock.

500
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,120
Bob is a tree.

501
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,520
Bob is you and her.

502
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,380
Bob ah, ah, ah.

503
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:30,220
Okay, you'll start here.

504
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,120
All right, then.

505
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,980
There won't be no rainy days

506
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,640
If I will sell you all the sun

507
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,540
He's unlike with Jehovah

508
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,960
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

509
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,680
I don't wanna walk the path I've trod

510
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,280
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

511
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,240
I don't wanna walk the path I've trod

512
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,080
At his desk in Dallas

513
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,720
Well, Dread Dab sits smoking

514
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,420
Behind his mirrored windows

515
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,040
Well, Dread Dab sits smoking

516
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,400
Light up your pipe, let go the smoke

517
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,140
This is slack, it ain't no joke

518
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,780
Brace me to barb, lift up your chain

519
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,100
Let's go!

520
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,500
And you will pay to know what you think

521
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,360
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

522
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,060
I don't wanna walk the path I've trod

523
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,640
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

524
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,560
I don't wanna walk the path I've trod

525
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:44,500
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

526
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,700
mob as it spreads from town to town.

527
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,980
It's indestructible.

528
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,140
It's indescribable.

529
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,700
Nothing can stop it.

530
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,220
This town is in danger.

531
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,680
How can it be stopped?

532
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,840
Mob hysteria sweeps one city.

533
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,740
Before long, the nation and then the world can lean flat on the mob.

534
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,360
Starring speeding and a cast of exciting people.

535
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,280
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival

536
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,780
chanting the name of a modern-day prophet, Bob.

537
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,860
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church

538
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,960
that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

539
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,500
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

540
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
Tom Vitale has this report.

541
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,840
You will pay to know what you really think.

542
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,640
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think

543
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,480
and not on the inside.

544
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,200
We will tell you what you really think.

545
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,280
For once, you will get value for your dollars.

546
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,160
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

547
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,260
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius,

548
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,180
as delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.

549
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,980
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack,

550
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,800
how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

551
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,520
For they shall see God.

552
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,140
It's still true.

553
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,240
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

554
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,640
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

555
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,180
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care anymore.

556
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,840
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

557
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,220
I can't tolerate it.

558
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,320
I can't live with it.

559
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:35,880
I can't.

560
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,800
And that's how I became a subgenius.

561
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,860
Children of the great St. Lenny Bruce said,

562
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,200
American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

563
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,000
Here in the church of the subgenius we say,

564
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,320
cast off those crutches and crawl with pride.

565
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,660
You can crawl again.

566
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,080
You can crawl again, children.

567
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,420
I may sound like a Bible beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

568
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,600
but that don't change the truth, no.

569
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm tired of this new age gobbledygook mumbo jumbo

570
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,800
replacing Dobbs revealed.

571
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,260
I'm tired of the threat of the new age supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

572
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm tired of undead preachers preaching undead sermons to undead congregations.

573
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:35,360
But old Bobby, he ain't quite so forgiving as some of these higher ranking, better connected deities.

574
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,100
So you just be watching out.

575
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,360
Bob is being blamed for at least two deaths and 20 injuries.

576
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,100
Not even President Bush's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine was spared Bob's winds and waves.

577
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,200
One person, though, died near New York City when Bob threw a tree into a commuter train.

578
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,260
Like any other church, like any other church of genius,

579
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,120
the church has divine tenets, divine rules, divine orders.

580
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,700
The fourth rule of the subgenius church is,

581
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,600
it's always better than not enough.

582
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,980
Can I get it too much?

583
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,320
Can I get it too much?

584
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,780
Why is it always better than?

585
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,300
Why is it always better than?

586
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,620
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

587
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,680
The fourth rule of the church of the subgenius, thank you, Buck,

588
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,920
and one of the most important rules that supersedes all other rules,

589
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,160
the I.

590
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,560
Fuck them!

591
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,180
If they can't take a joke, fuck them!

592
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,240
Hello?

593
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,160
Hi.

594
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,400
Hi.

595
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,840
I'm tuned into your station.

596
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,220
I'm just wondering what the hell's going on.

597
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,020
Well, us too.

598
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,020
So you help us out.

599
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,260
I am the Pope of New York, flown out here especially to preach the gospel of Bob and the church of the subgenius.

600
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,680
To you, young lady, do you have enough slack in your life?

601
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,660
Do I have a what?

602
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,820
Do you have enough slack in your life?

603
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,920
Enough what?

604
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,660
Slack.

605
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,040
Slack.

606
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,940
Half of the dolphins...

607
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,140
Half of the dolphins' sexual drive is released through their blowhole.

608
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,240
And the other half is released through the church of the subgenius.

609
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,680
Thank you for that testimonial.

610
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,580
And clean your own blowhole, would you please?

611
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,600
Yes.

612
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,700
We have a special brush here available at the church, the brush and soap department of the church here.

613
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,460
I can't lay hands on you and drive.

614
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,980
So far, all of the dolphins in the marina have body brush.

615
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,220
You slap with the very touching of the tentacles of the Pope.

616
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:38,840
That's right.

617
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,820
Andy's using one of those brushes on Channel 5 right now.

618
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,100
Yes, it's tuned up in color.

619
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,560
Andy, if you don't believe I can heal with my mere hands, just ask Andy about the hands of the Pope.

620
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh, yes.

621
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,600
Oh.

622
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,260
Oh.

623
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,200
It's all around me.

624
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,480
And yet, God asks that we worship him by holy living.

625
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,220
Today?

626
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,200
Can he really mean that?

627
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,540
And slack is something so hard for people to understand, especially in this country.

628
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,020
In a great deal of the rest of the world, it's very simple.

629
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,820
Slack is having a hard time.

630
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,980
You're not eating enough food in your stomach.

631
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:18,320
But in America, we are plagued with false slack and false money, false sex, false everything.

632
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:18,960
False drugs.

633
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,200
Bob delivers the real thing.

634
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,760
The next rule of the church of the subgenius is if you act like a dumb shit, they'll treat you like an equal.

635
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,540
Like a what?

636
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,360
Like a what?

637
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,900
Like a what?

638
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,320
If you act like a what?

639
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,260
A dumb shit.

640
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,180
They'll treat you like an equal.

641
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,480
They will.

642
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,560
They will.

643
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:39,660
They will.

644
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:39,700


645
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,320
They will.

646
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:40,720
They will.

647
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:40,720


648
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:40,720


649
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:40,720


650
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:40,720


651
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,660
They will force you to kneel to their level.

652
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,300
But you will fight them.

653
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,980
You will not be alone, but you will fight them, children.

654
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:54,060
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out, we'll go for Sex Day.

655
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,060
We want you people to dance into the new century.

656
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,520
Screw into the new century.

657
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,560
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

658
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,800
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnip.

659
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:14,160
over, because what you'll be doing forever, so make sure you're not asleep, make sure

660
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,260
you're not watching TV, make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone, make sure you're not

661
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,280
reaching for an itch you'll never be able to scratch.

662
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:29,460
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills, a sea of Bob's pills, but you're just too

663
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,840
blind yet to see them.

664
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:44,020
Oh, friends, I know you're not the dumb-asticated type, I know you're the smart-asticated type.

665
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:50,240
Oh, but people say, Reverend Stagg, what is slack?

666
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,780
I want you to tell me what slack is.

667
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:00,260
No, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you.

668
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,820
As long as you're watching TV.

669
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:01,820


670
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,420
As long as you are watching the television.

671
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,420
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slack is that Miller Beer commercial

672
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,340
where everybody's good-looking, and you're rich, and your team just won the game, and

673
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,240
you're drinking Miller Beer, and your favorite show is on.

674
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,320
And you know that's bullshit, because slack is not laziness, friends.

675
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:30,300
Slack is getting into the zone, is being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do

676
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,820
until you're on it.

677
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:40,060
And you're smart enough to realize that you are God, life is worth living, and everything

678
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:45,260
is just as psychedelic as an old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

679
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:52,800
Now, hold that thought, hold it in your head, because that is what slack is all about, friends.

680
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,120
Slack is something for nothing.

681
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,240
After he said that, then he said, arise.

682
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,620
Take up your bed, and go your way to your house.

683
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,000
Take up your bed and walk.

684
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,540
Then he stretched out on the floor.

685
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,660
True slack is by definition indefinable.

686
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,820
It is a kind of direct perception, unfettered by common sense.

687
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,440
It is not merely laziness.

688
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,220
It is rather a kind of active sloth.

689
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,580
Slack in its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison.

690
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,380
Next to slack, the nirvana known to mystics and saints is like endless torment.

691
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,580
The difference between slack and no slack was the time you were 14 and finally called

692
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:48,420
that girl up, and when she knew who you were, when you identified yourself on the phone,

693
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,740
that was the beginning of slack.

694
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,800
But then again, getting the date or anything like that was not slack.

695
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:00,320
It was that moment when suddenly something went the way you wanted it to go without you

696
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,260
thinking about it.

697
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,200
It was something that was totally not involved when your feet were involved rather than your

698
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,460
head.

699
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,460
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.

700
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,520
Without trying.

701
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,420
You give up and you get everything.

702
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,680
It's like a submission of the self to the white over light in Buddhism.

703
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,280
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.

704
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,700
It's not give to get, it's give up and get anyone.

705
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,820
Now, holy men have pointed out that brains are like wood.

706
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,620
They're radios that can be tuned and the will is like a gun that can be aimed.

707
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,240
Some aim better than others.

708
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,660
Pinks usually aren't aware that their gun will even fire.

709
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,440
They use it to pound things to death.

710
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:53,240
Then when they finally realize they can fire it, the barrel is so clogged with dirt and

711
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,320
gore that bam, the thing splits down the middle or in their face and misses everything.

712
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,420
What takes away your slack?

713
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,680
What takes away your slack?

714
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:01,800
What takes away your slack?

715
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,740
Pussy waitresses!

716
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,740
Pussy waitresses!

717
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,460
Take away your slack!

718
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,820
Take away your slack!

719
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,200
Arrogant cashiers!

720
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,820
Arrogant cashiers!

721
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,500
Take away your slack!

722
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,160
Take away your slack!

723
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,300
Insensitive employers!

724
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,180
Take away your slack!

725
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:12,340
Insensitive employers!

726
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,740
Take away your slack!

727
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,040
Withholding tax!

728
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,380
Withholding tax!

729
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,720
Takes away your slack!

730
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,320
Hey, boy, tomorrow you're gonna get paid.

731
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,280
Yeah, life sucks.

732
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:22,880
Yeah.

733
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,160
Life sucks.

734
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:23,220
Yeah, life sucks.

735
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,960
I've had it up to here.

736
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,500
Shut up.

737
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,640
I hate myself and I hate everyone else.

738
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,080
I hate don'ts.

739
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,400
Can you hear me?

740
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,480
What the heck is going on here anyway?

741
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:31,800
I'm not that bad.

742
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:31,800


743
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:37,000
need to talk to Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob. Bob, Bob. There are weapons that are simply thoughts,

744
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:44,080
attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in the minds of men. There is no typical subgenius.

745
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:49,260
There's no profile subgenius. The subgenius is the person who is an outsider, who has

746
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,740
been different some way or another since birth. A person who is born with slack. And we're

747
00:49:54,740 --> 00:50:00,240
all born with slack. Original slack. Original slack. But the conspiracy, the conspiracy

748
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,320
of normalcy, really, is what it is. It takes it away from the minute you are born. They

749
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,800
give you that first whack on your behind to make you cry. From that moment on, they're

750
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,100
taking away your slack.

751
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,180
Some make rules, some obey, but the rules are for the fools, is what I say.

752
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,300
We have the figure of a race infused with aliens spending their lives.

753
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,220
Yes, friends, building a new race is hard. And nothing gets it quite as hard as an alien

754
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,440
smegmaplot. Made from the real genital material for actual aliens, it will infuse your old

755
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:43,580
mankind accordion with the jism it needs to make it go. Now a new golf ball and honey

756
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,040
mustard flavor. Oh, I'm sorry.

757
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:55,020
Uh, friends, you know, this is a rainbow church of unity. I was telling my redneck brother-in-law

758
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,900
not long ago about our little ex-day gathering.

759
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,480
He had two weeks. Well, we have every year here, unfortunately, until the world ends.

760
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:11,620
And I was explaining to him about our friend Pope S. Lilith, who's a great subgenius preacher.

761
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,720
And I actually started out life as a guy in Dallas, Texas, and now as a lovely woman in

762
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,520
Seattle. And Pope S. Lilith was elected both king and queen of the mutant prom two weeks

763
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,080
ago. I was telling this redneck brother-in-law of mine about Pope S.

764
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:36,740
Lilith and the redneck brother-in-law said, we know Reverend Stang. I don't think that

765
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:45,560
I'd like most of the people in your church. And I said, well, Cliff, that's why they go

766
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:51,920
to my church and not your Baptist church. And you know, it's a sign of the end times

767
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,560
when the wretched and the perverted and the drunkards and publicans have to come to Bob

768
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,140
because Jesus is.

769
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:06,400
Most people won't give him the time of day. Even Jesus has to come to Bob because he doesn't

770
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,940
want to get nailed again. And that's why we have this little hymn that you can sing along

771
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,520
with us.

772
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,620
And all our friends are so fucked up.

773
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,620
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

774
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,380
That's it. You got it.

775
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,700
Simple song.

776
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,220
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

777
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,620
Us and all our friends are so fucked us.

778
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:41,060
Us and all our friends are so fucked.

779
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:45,240
Us and all our friends are so fucked us.

780
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,220
Us and all our friends are so fucked us.

781
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,180
Us and all our friends are so fucked us.

782
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,780
Us and all our friends are so fucked.

783
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,040
Us and all our friends are so fucked.

784
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,160
Us and all our friends are so fucked.

785
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,160


786
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,160


787
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,220
Us and all our friends are so fucked us.

788
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,140
So fuck us and all our friends are so fucked up

789
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,740
The neighbors complain about us.

790
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:47,740
I thank God our dreams are so far gone.

791
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:18,420
I thank God our dreams are so far gone.

792
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,800
The rest will be turned in.

793
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,000
What about the us-a-pod?

794
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,760
It's the them-a-pod.

795
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,060
The them-a-pod.

796
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,160
They scared me in the elevator last week, but I'm trying to find out about our side now.

797
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:47,380
It's the foundation, the undergarment of the false messiah, the falsy messiah, which has been prophesied by the book of...

798
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,300
But which side was the false messiah on? Was he a them-a-pod or an us-a-pod?

799
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,220
It was a them-a-pod at the beginning, but then, yea and lo, it became an if-a-pod.

800
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,440
Right, Bob?

801
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,100
Bob?

802
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:00,420
Bob?

803
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,080
Bob?

804
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,860
You know, everybody thinks that Church of the Subgenius started about 1953 or so, but that's not true.

805
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:17,100
It's a lot older than that, and it dates back to the first time a couple of kids cut up in church.

806
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,020
Amen.

807
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,540
You know, we're here in Dallas.

808
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,040
It's pretty normal.

809
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,380
Yeah.

810
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,420
Here in North Dallas.

811
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,940
I don't know.

812
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,760
I woke up yesterday morning, and the world was in a lot of trouble.

813
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,940
And I opened up the refrigerator, and there were starving children inside.

814
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:44,380
And I walked down the street, and there was no education, and the people of different ethnic backgrounds were back at each other's throats after 20 years of progress.

815
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,000
I hate that old conspiracy as much as it hates me.

816
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,560
But me and Bob will get them, just you wait and see.

817
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,520
For as long as they have run things, they have turned them into shit.

818
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,220
The time has come.

819
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,500
I'm going to get them back.

820
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,260
Here's how I look at it.

821
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,120
I am a soft cheese.

822
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:15,000
And by that, that you would touch would fall to the grave of the man.

823
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,020
My power wasn't given to me in exchange for prayer or meditation.

824
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,140
I paid for it in cold, hard American dollars.

825
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,280
Salvation you get for free is worth just that.

826
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,100
Doesn't you?

827
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:30,740
Queer.

828
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,280
Of course, your money ain't worth jack shit anyway.

829
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:47,900
The conspiracy says to that, but a very important element of your soul adheres to those otherwise worthless greenbacks that Bob needs in order to pursue his plan for world domination.

830
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:57,160
I say, Bob guides my hand in all things and pays me off in pure slack.

831
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,020
So I say to you.

832
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,500
Whips.

833
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,380
You fools.

834
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,440
You dupes.

835
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,240
You pigs.

836
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,000
Give me your money.

837
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,140
You won't need it in the future.

838
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,540
The future offers you naught but destruction.

839
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,120
You know what I mean?

840
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:21,800
I mean, I dare you to kill me.

841
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,440
I need to be?

842
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,620
I mean, fuck.

843
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,660
I'm one of the good guys.

844
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,760
My cards shall prevail.

845
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,960
Let out the crazy man inside you.

846
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,180
He knows what's what.

847
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,660
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

848
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,080
Oh, you say, me primate.

849
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,300
Me over man.

850
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:50,400
You think I'm dumb, but you are blind to the conspiracy that runs your life.

851
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:58,440
And you have your geniuses running things for you and you think they're going to make things safe and simple and easy and all that freeze-dry.

852
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:58,600
You're wrong.

853
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,660
You're calling me the bullshit.

854
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,240
Well, I'm a fucking subgenius.

855
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:08,660
And I'm going to make things safe and simple and easy for me and the entire subgenius race.

856
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:15,980
Even if it means wiping out your sick society in total with no more sentiment involved and swatting the fly.

857
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,040
All this so we might survive the end.

858
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,920
You know why?

859
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,220
Because I am.

860
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,220
I am.

861
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,140
I am.

862
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,000
I am a subgenius.

863
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,580
I am a subgenius.

864
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:35,720
Fuck all you blow-dried white-guided sippin' designer jean-clad French-kewn watch and walkman totin' hipwimp.

865
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:45,020
And fuck you house-coated inquirer ridden trailer and catball shoppin' head, curled motorheads, cockholsters, all you dupes.

866
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,980
Fuck the corporate big-money oil explorer tree-killer land raper.

867
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,480
Food freezer, death warmer, tri-naturalist asshole.

868
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,560
Fuck the establishment-carrying foes, huntin' backstabbing polyphonic.

869
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,760
Spreading, bomb-wielding, meringue-headed, pussy-licking, pencil-necked, eraser-headed

870
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,100
politicals.

871
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,600
Kill the conspiracy.

872
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,900
Kill them and eat them.

873
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,240
Kill them and eat them and fuck their wives.

874
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,700
Who do you think you are?

875
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,740
What do you think you're doing?

876
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,840
Do you think you got it good?

877
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,120
Well, dispose of those illusions.

878
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,980
Dispose of them all right now, motherfuckers.

879
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:31,360
Because on July 5th, 1998, 7.30 in the morning, you shall be judged.

880
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,840
But it doesn't matter, friends, because we're out of here.

881
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,560
We're out of here before the Y2K month.

882
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,700
We're out of here on the Y1.9999.

883
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,640
That's what Bob really meant.

884
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,160
Before any of those YKs arrive, we're KY'd up.

885
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,900
We're going to.

886
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,180
Slide home free.

887
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,860
Day after tomorrow, we're going to slide home free, baby.

888
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,460
On XXA.

889
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,600
XYZ.

890
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,720
X year zero.

891
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,800
Ah, yes.

892
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,040
Spread wide for the final ride.

893
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,160
Because the Xs are coming, friends.

894
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,200
And you are too.

895
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,780
They didn't take us seriously last time.

896
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,960
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

897
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,200
Didn't take God's prophecy seriously.

898
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,300
But this time, we've learned.

899
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,120
Listen.

900
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,640
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

901
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,660
We can't even rely on Bob.

902
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:40,100
We have to learn how to escape Earth without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials

903
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,920
or salesmen.

904
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:47,040
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but build your own ship.

905
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,400
You may not have to.

906
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,960
Just recover your ass.

907
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,160
Build your own ship.

908
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,840
Even better, go buy hangar containers.

909
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,100
Area 51 or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54.

910
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,200
And steal your own ship.

911
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,400
Ah, yes.

912
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,140
And scrape your own fuel.

913
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:15,480
And while you're at it, friends, let's swab the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.

914
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,540
We're already riding on the spaceship.

915
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,280
And it's in bad shape.

916
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,280
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

917
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,100
Yeah!

918
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,220
Earth, we must get off.

919
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,660
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

920
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,420
Whether we blow it off or blow it up.

921
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,340
Just don't blow it, friends.

922
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,400
So relax in your own delusion.

923
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:49,880
Find a place to hide and reach your confusion.

924
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,060
Save me.

925
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,220
From the barges of conspiracy.

926
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,960
Save me.

927
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,300
From the change of time.

928
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,060
Save me.

929
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,140
From the men that you like.

930
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,500
Zero sub-genius.

931
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,200
Just tap, clap, break bar.

932
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,280
Break bar.

933
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,300
Break bar.

934
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,580
Break bar.

935
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:19,860
Break bar.

936
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:19,860


937
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,280
Break bar.

938
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,940
Break bar.

939
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,120
You have signed the application.

940
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,320
Welcome aboard.

941
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

942
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,340
Welcome aboard, Bob.

943
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:30,500
Ha ha ha ha ha.

944
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:30,520
Welcome aboard, Bob.

945
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,660
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

946
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:32,760


947
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:32,800
Welcome aboard.

948
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,080
You are listening to the sub-genius radio ministry hour of slack.

949
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:46,700
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to gotyourpencilreadyBob.p...

950
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:48,700
807.

951
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Glen Rose, Texas 76043

952
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,580
That's Bob Beobox.

953
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,200
807

954
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,280
Glen Rose, Texas 76043

955
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,800
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

956
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:36,740
Thank you, Bob.

957
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,940
...as an alien smuggler.

958
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,520
And by U.S. Force Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

959
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,980
Some of the mini-mag, the pocket thunder, the baby neutrino,

960
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,420
and many other fine pocket-sized nuclear weapons

961
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,780
that fit in your pants pocket stand.

962
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,600
Any questions?

963
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Any rags, any bones, any bottles today?

964
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,260
Oh, yes, the little girl there in the back.

965
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,620
Are we going to have a quiz on this?

966
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,880
Oh, the quiz that they'll give on this

967
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,360
will come on Judgment Day, my friend.

968
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,200
They'll say,

969
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,940
Did you not attend the subgenius devival in July of 1999?

970
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:27,220
Well, yeah, Lord, but I was just, I mean, it was just a show, that's all.

971
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:28,800
Playback the tape.

972
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,920
He laughed at the jokes made at the expense of me,

973
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,260
the Lord God Almighty.

974
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,680
What shall we do with him?

975
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,240
Throw him into the lake of fire.

976
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,280
Oh, yes, Lord, please, throw me into the lake of fire.

977
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,960
Just whatever you do,

978
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:47,980
don't throw me into subgenius hell

979
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,200
with all those naked people

980
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,300
and that party going on down there.

981
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,800
Oh, so that is his greatest fear, subgenius hell.

982
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,420
Throw him into the blackest pit of subgenius hell.

983
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,020
Yes, Master, yes, Master.

984
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,380
Praise God!

985
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:06,500
Yeah!

986
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:06,940
Yeah!

987
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,180
Yeah!

988
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:07,680
Yeah!

989
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:07,920
Yeah!

990
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,360
And I'll grant you this much.

991
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:16,960
If I die and find myself going through this tunnel opening up into a vast light

992
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,880
and this new awareness that I was just too good to even believe

993
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,760
that just solves everything and is perfect,

994
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,600
well, great!

995
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,760
I'll be pleasantly surprised.

996
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,940
And by the same token, if I die and I'm just dead and that's all there is to it,

997
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,600
well, likewise, you won't hear me complaining then either, now will you?

998
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:45,580
And, you know, actually, friends, there probably is a side two to this tape we call life.

999
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:53,800
If Bob remembers to flip the tape, so you better make your tape a good one so that he wants to flip it,

1000
01:05:53,840 --> 01:06:00,360
he might just decide to erase over it, record something new over it.

1001
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,420
And if I die and I go to hell,

1002
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:06,580
I'll be like,

1003
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:06,580


1004
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:06,580


1005
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,780
well, that'll prove to me the existence of Satan.

1006
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,840
But not God, dear friends.

1007
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,000
God, I think, can do just fine without my help or yours.

1008
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,960
Now, many people don't think so highly of God.

1009
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,600
They think God is like some little child who needs the help of those illiterate human believers

1010
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,940
or else he'll just try up and blow away like Tinker Bell

1011
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:33,380
if the kids don't applaud loud enough and believe enough.

1012
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,580
Oh, God's gonna die if I don't believe enough.

1013
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:36,580


1014
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:41,100
Well, I'm sorry, friends, but is God really like Tinker Bell?

1015
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:45,180
Is God such a wuss that he's more scared than I am?

1016
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:52,260
If I was God, I'd be a lot more impressed with the ones who take responsibility for their own fuck-ups

1017
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,700
and build their own ships.

1018
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,560
Are we then to understand that when Bob says we must learn to pull the wool over our own eyes,

1019
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,580
that he's merely omitting an insidious form of God,

1020
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,500
an insidious form of self-delusion?

1021
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,860
Is he saying that we shouldn't even look for the truth?

1022
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,820
Is Bob saying, like Heisenberg did forty-odd years ago,

1023
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:18,060
that we can never know what the hell is really going on?

1024
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,700
I think not.

1025
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:26,760
Bob, however, is cognizant of the fact that besides the shabby little lies we feed ourselves from day to day

1026
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,520
as we struggle to cope with technoboredom,

1027
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,760
we're all being force-fed a gross pablum of half-truths,

1028
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,500
sensationalized statistics,

1029
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:42,960
and propaganda by a vast monolithic network operated by and for the conspiracy.

1030
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,980
Through such deception, the conspiracy is daily cheating us all out of our life essence,

1031
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:54,960
our money, our health, and most important of all, our slack.

1032
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,280
That's right, our slack.

1033
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,540
They draw it off like vampires in the night.

1034
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:05,340
They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Constantly.

1035
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,820
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

1036
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,400
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

1037
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,120
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

1038
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,480
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

1039
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,280
Some ways are fun.

1040
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,560
For many of us, there is no physical escape from their clutches,

1041
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,220
or any hope of it until the exes come and the followers of Yahweh One prevail.

1042
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,360
But until that day,

1043
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,500
the power and wisdom of Bob

1044
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,420
can help us break their mind control

1045
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:41,340
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

1046
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,300
This allows us to control our own reality,

1047
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:48,940
gives us the clarity of perspective to be able to sit back and look at it all,

1048
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,100
and I mean all,

1049
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,500
and simply say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1050
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:59,900
Then and only then will slack begin to drop gently like a soothing dew into our tortured lives.

1051
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,480
After all, it should be every person's choice to curse God and die

1052
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,680
if that is what they wish.

1053
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:09,960
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods, did we not create them?

1054
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:14,280
Where indeed would Yahweh One be without the human race to torment and pester?

1055
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:18,940
I'll put it to you, the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

1056
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,780
if there was nothing more entertaining than cherubims and seraphims

1057
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,560
and numby-pumby flaming angels sitting around up there on damp clouds

1058
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,480
and arcing and trumpeting all 24 hours a bloody day,

1059
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:30,640
and you can bank on that.

1060
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,120
Why should we be any different to that?

1061
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,600
Why shouldn't our lives be more entertaining and more real

1062
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,820
than any glowing three-color phosphor image on the television screen?

1063
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:46,660
Why shouldn't we grab reality by the throat and shake it until it does what we want it to,

1064
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,340
until once again we find slack?

1065
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:55,540
Just as the primitive firewalkers of Solon can deny a reality in which fire burns

1066
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,820
and thus paths unscathed across white-hot stones,

1067
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:03,300
so can the subgenius deny the existence of a world without slack,

1068
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,160
without the false prophets and the pink boys.

1069
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:10,760
All it requires is faith, faith in Bob and faith in ourselves.

1070
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:17,240
Are we not the dreamers of the dream, and is all that is within that dream not ourselves?

1071
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:23,840
Life is no more than a brief illusion, a flickering real-time movie in the theater of our minds,

1072
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,200
and if you don't like the way your movie is going, perhaps you better ask yourself why not.

1073
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:34,460
After all, it is your movie, and despite what anyone else may have told you,

1074
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,520
you are the director as well as the protagonist.

1075
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,420
So, don't come up to me saying,

1076
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,300
Oh Reverend Stang, I spent my thirty dollars, I went to the subgenius show,

1077
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,360
I saw all the preachers, heard all the bands, but I didn't get slack.

1078
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,680
Where's my slack? Give me my slack.

1079
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:58,160
My friend, if that's the way you're thinking, then you never heard anything Bob said.

1080
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,220
You never understood a word he wrote in the book of the subgenius,

1081
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,060
because the day that we can sell you slack,

1082
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
is the day the conspiracy has won.

1083
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,560
You make your own slack.

1084
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:15,080
Bob is not the answer, but neither is anything else.

1085
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,940
You must learn to think for yourself,

1086
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,000
but only Bob can show you how.

1087
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:29,740
Question authority, or else, and fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1088
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,480
Praise Bob.

1089
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,880
Tell me somebody.

1090
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,940
Good night.

1091
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,380
Einstein, secret architrains.

1092
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,620
Mildred, chef.

1093
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,420
Be on the soft side.

1094
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,980
If I don't get you on more of this world, I'll see you on the next one.

1095
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,660
And don't be late.

1096
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:55,540
Praise Bob.

1097
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,500
Oh shit!

1098
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,180
Remember the I as in the X.

1099
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,460
Let's hear it one more time!

1100
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,560
I, I, I, I, I.

1101
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,380
I'll do it!

1102
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,820
But one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says,

1103
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,340
Watch out.

1104
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,940
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error,

1105
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:36,440
but the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

1106
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,040
Something says, look out, this guy is fishy,

1107
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,800
cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

1108
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,240
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English

1109
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,780
but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language

1110
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:54,660
when they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.

1111
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:59,380
We eat more, drink more, play more and do less to earn a good living

1112
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,460
than any other people in history.

1113
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,600
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music

1114
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,160
and I might add a lot of its worst

1115
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,400
else the cultists would have no following.

1116
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:13,900
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically for more.

1117
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,660
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

1118
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,120
that I know that I know.

1119
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,400
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,

1120
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,300
the cruel and torturous executions,

1121
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,360
it would be more consistent to call it the word of the devil.

1122
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:29,720
Demons.

1123
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,240
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

1124
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:42,400
With a vocal and activist minority ready apparently to burn a bomber's seal of kills.

1125
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,520
For more.

1126
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,300
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.

1127
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,240
And that's Bosch and Piffle, I'll tell you that.

1128
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,920
They dwelled in caves, not high-rise apartments.

1129
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,980
They may not have found a key to affluence, but they found...

1130
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:06,240
an endless supply of dope, uninhibited sex, an endless supply of money.

1131
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,760
Free access to the distillery, I suppose.

1132
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,060
Ah, yes, the harvest.

1133
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,400
You can count on that.

1134
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,600
Or kill for more.

1135
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,080
Why, friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

1136
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:26,880
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

1137
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,620
Is the church of...

1138
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:28,900
A-pfft.

1139
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:29,120
Sub-

1140
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:29,180
Sub-

1141
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:29,760
Sub-

1142
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1143
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1144
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1145
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1146
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1147
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1148
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1149
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1150
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1151
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,280


1152
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:30,820
I don't know.

1153
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,700
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

1154
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,120
Bang.

1155
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,420
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

1156
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,820
Atomic warheads?

1157
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,460
Don't.

1158
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:42,500
I don't know.

1159
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,760
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

1160
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:46,260
Why?

1161
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:47,900
Bang.

1162
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:48,840
Bang.

1163
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,240
Bang.

1164
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,920
The past blotted out.

1165
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,880
And the future assured.

1166
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,880
Ah, yes, the harvest.

1167
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,160
Don't listen to it.

1168
01:14:59,160 --> 01:14:59,880
Don't listen to it.

1169
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,840
The Earth, yes, you can find help.

1170
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,980
You can be deprogrammed.

1171
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,260
You can find out the truth.

1172
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:04,640
Bang.

1173
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,080
It's a deep meaning thing.

1174
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,360
It's a hell in it.

1175
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:07,700
Bang.

1176
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,840
I know you're a dumbass.

1177
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,160
You don't have to go to bed.

1178
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,300
They force you to sleep on boards.

1179
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,980
You must get the device.

1180
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:13,420
No.

1181
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,080
No, you don't.

1182
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,720
They put me in a damn class.

1183
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,080
And it's no witness going on.

1184
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:18,780
No.

1185
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,560
I'm the mom fucker.

1186
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,060
I listen to the power.

1187
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,860
Since I won't write, now you stay in the house.

1188
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,120
But you and your self-geniuses came in.

1189
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,160
They took all my furniture.

1190
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,080
I'm going to get out of here.

1191
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,680
I'm one of those people who sold it to buy me this neck brace

1192
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,340
that I can't take off now.

1193
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,240
And they said it was a living being.

1194
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,920
And that's what happened.

1195
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,060
And I just think people should know.

1196
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:42,760
They're trying to shut us up.

1197
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,760
But there are some genius dissiners.

1198
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,580
There are .

1199
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,160
Don't leave me here.

1200
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,680
You've got to believe me.

1201
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,140
They make me say it.

1202
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,320
Don't leave me here.

1203
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,920
They torture me.

1204
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,060
They murder me.

1205
01:15:59,080 --> 01:15:59,880
They make me say it.

1206
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,640
Don't leave me here.

1207
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:04,500
They torture me.

1208
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,280
They kill me.

1209
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,200
They make me say it.

1210
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,060
They make me say it.

1211
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:09,120
They torture me.

1212
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,980
Don't leave me here.

1213
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:10,200


1214
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,860
I walked back up to the grassy knoll again

1215
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,340
and started heading back down.

1216
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:22,800
I left that group of wacky xenos and the gazebo

1217
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,740
and the sod busters museum and that wing ding nut flanger

1218
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,380
on the accordion.

1219
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,320
Well, I just didn't know what to think, you know.

1220
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,280
Coming up here, hanging around with the grass and the trees,

1221
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,220
it's just natural.

1222
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:42,040
But these people were talking different,

1223
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,100
and I don't know.

1224
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,100
I'm just interested in sitting around

1225
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,180
and picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that.

1226
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,520
Well, it just made me think an awful lot.

1227
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,620
I thought, golly, my head got big,

1228
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,380
and, well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

1229
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,140
I began to think about writing them down

1230
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,500
or taking some pictures or getting a tape recorder

1231
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,080
or something in them things,

1232
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,960
but I know I didn't want to mess with them.

1233
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,200
I just wanted to be natural, you know,

1234
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,940
sitting out here with the old rocks

1235
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,640
and watching the clouds roll by.

1236
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:30,420
But that old stranger with the accordion,

1237
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:34,220
why, he made me feel a little different.

1238
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,100
I kind of got excited.

1239
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,640
Well, I liked it a little bit.

1240
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,360
It never happened like that before.

1241
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:48,620
Suddenly, I began to reflect on my whole life,

1242
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,040
why it was like a rock or...

1243
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:54,620
or a rock.

1244
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:54,620


1245
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:54,620


1246
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:54,620


1247
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:54,620


1248
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,000
A polka.

1249
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,340
No, my life wasn't like a polka.

1250
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,880
But here it was again, and God almighty...

1251
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,320
Hiya, mister!

1252
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,680
How are you, little fella?
