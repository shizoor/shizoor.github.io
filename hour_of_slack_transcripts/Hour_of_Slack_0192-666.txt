Stay tuned please for the American Hour of Slap.
No, here it comes.
Do we dare to do it?
Do we dare to turn on to Farm Road 666?
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's the bad road.
This is the bad road, Doug.
I can tell because there's a Michelob truck in front of us.
And this is Dead Man's Pass.
It says you must pass here to die.
And 24 miles to Sanders.
And Sanders, the home of the chicken man, will be safe.
We'll be back on the interstate.
If we can just make it this far across 666.
You'll make it.
Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.
Is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension?
You see, we can move in the other three.
As the doctor said, up, down, forwards, backwards, sideways.
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.
The human race lulled into a false sense of security except for one scientist.
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan?
Reverend Ivan Stang.
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan?
Going to destroy us.
He'll kill everyone we've got to stop now!
Easy, Doug, easy.
They're here, they're here, they're...
The Subgenius.
Hour of Swatch.
Impossible.
Unbelievable.
Fantastic.
But I tell you, it could happen.
It could happen.
It could happen.
It could happen.
Yes, it could happen.
THE SUBJECT OF A FALSE STORY
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne
I reach out for the good book that will save my soul
Save me from the lodges of conspiracy
Save me from the chains of time
Save me from the men in black
Never subgenius
The sass like praise boss

The soft boys read it though, he said it was really scary.
Good.
You have to scare some people just to get their attention.
Should we allow these people to find themselves in the tribulation period scared to death?
Or get their attention now while something can be done?
You know, unless you gals open your minds and your hearts
I'm afraid one of these days you're going to be in for a rude awakening.
Yes, no kidding.
A rude awakening indeed.
And you can have that rude awakening.
Please, please do.
By continuing to listen to the word of Bob here coming up.
Oh, it's okay honey.
No problem.
Just call Will here.

Father turned against son.
People changed into strange weird animals.
Capturing humans at will for their own sinister purposes.
Turning them into diabolical instruments of destruction.
We're fantastic beings of a super intelligence.
Ruling a race of synthetic humans.
And pitting them against mankind's dream to conquer the universe.

Do you wish to renounce your faith in your God?
And receive your identification?
Either on your right hand or in your forehead.

If so, answer I do.
And you will be returned to your rightful place in society.

That the image of the beast should both speak

Because of all.
Both small and great.

Free and enslaved.
To receive a mark.
In their right hand.
Or in their foreheads.
And that no man might buy or sell except he that has the mark.
Or the name of the beast.
Or the number of his name.
Mark.
Name of the beast.
Or the number.
Of his name.
Here is wisdom.
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man.
The number of a man.
His number is six hundred three score and six.
I want the mark.

Why, if he'll give you a rabbit punch,
if you make a graven image,

He'll short sheet your bed

He'll rack you up and string you out.
He'll break your jaw and give you gout.
He'll visit you with locusts.
He'll visit you with plague.
He'll visit your apartment,
steal your spoons and break your legs.
He'll cover you with cooking oil
and burn you on a spit.
He'll loosen up your bowels
and then rub your nose in it.
He'll fill your heart with hope
and then he'll take it all away.
He'll stop and crush your testicles
while you try to pray.
Put glass under your tire,
put some sugar in your tank,
make you stand in long lines.
He'll have to mark you at the bank.
He'll fill you with diseases
and make your teeth turn brown.
He'll be eaten up by maggots

He does all these things
cause he loves everybody.
If you disagree,

But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
Oh, yes, praise Bob, friend.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.
Come to tell you the truth, the truth about the path to slack
through hyperventilation.
Yes, my friend, you can get high from hyperventilation.
And it's legal, and it's an exercise we're preaching.
And if you can learn to talk like me and talk this way all the time,
then everybody you meet will be your friend.
And you will get so high, you will get so high, you will meet Bob.
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob
because you will have so much slack in your brain
there won't be any more room for thoughts.
And when your mind is free of free thoughts,
you will be free.
Then you will have the slack, the slack you need in your life.
Praise Bob. Help me, somebody.
Do I hear a praise Bob?
Let there be slack.
Not some high music all over America,

people. Pray for these people. Pray for these people.
See, Bob is a salesman, and Bob is going to try to prevent the planet Earth from being sold.
So when Bob goes to talk to these men from Planet X, he has to have a representative constituency here on Earth.
Because the men from Planet X, well, they're businessmen. Pure and simple businessmen.
And they're going to say, Bob, your proposal sounds good, but I've got to see numbers.
I've got to see hard data. Show me the numbers of subgenius on this Earth, and it's your planet.
And we'll know it's worth saving. See, that's Bob's job, is to...
Someone's got to explain to those aliens, in ways they can understand, why the human race is the way it is,
so that they don't put us out of our midst.
And they understand the bottom line.
Which is why we're the world's first industrial church, the church of love and money.
It certainly is.
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.
Bob, where have you trained?
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation.
And then back to Houston for advanced computer technology.
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
The message is now part of and registered in every U.C.G.
Ahhhh.
And, uh, yes, dear friends, well, ye, uh, uh, regular listeners may be wondering
why we're not continuing the, uh, story of how we spent our lives in the Earth.
family vacation last time. This time. And well, I don't know. I got home from last week's show
and thought to myself, that was a pretty crummy show. And I said to my wife, you know, I don't
know if that show was all that good. And wives, of course, are supposed to say, oh, it was perfectly
good. It was great. But no, a subgenius wife says, you're right. It wasn't that good. It was okay.
Okay. So I'm going to blow off the endless travelogue. We're obviously working on the
theme of 666 or 999 for those of you who are more optimistic. The number of the beast versus
the number of Bobby. And, uh, oh, oh, I, now I remember why I came on the show.
I've got to flip a tape. It's funny. You could just get on the air and just continue talking and
talking, but, uh, and you can, you can too, friends, you can too. You can call the Willa Dobbs here
and find out just what in the hell we're talking about. I bet you started to wonder about now,
if this is the first time you happen to tune into this show going, what, what's that show?
Well, it's the subgenius radio ministry hour.
We're of Slack here on KNON and affiliated stations.
In the meantime, I'm sure I could probably think of something important, significant,
something with socially redeeming value to say, but you know, even if I could, I don't,
I don't know if I'd want to, are you worth it? Well, you'll have to prove that friend.
You're going to have to write to Bob. You're going to have to tell him exactly what you think.
We want to know.
Don't call.
Don't tell the station when, uh, we're not here and cuss about us. Call us and cuss about us.
Don't tell the station manager what we've been doing, whatever you do. Okay.
And, uh, Oh, welcome to our, our guest here, uh, who you're not hearing, uh, Reverend Gazecki from
Los Angeles, who has come into, um, uh, uh, take notes on just, uh, what we're doing,
why we're doing it and, uh, possibly, I guess, give it to the, uh,
the great finger in the sky, which rules us all, but probably not.
That's an inside joke friends. And, and I know that you want to know what all those inside jokes are about.
Don't you? Well, just stay tuned and, uh, you'll be more confused than ever. Thank y'all.
.
.


I get it.
You leave it up to, uh, friends. I want to explain to you why they call it subgenius.
Um, this guy's helping to tell me, tell you and me both, uh, subgenius by definition, of course,
means just below a genius or anything below a genius could be an amoeba.
You know, anybody can qualify, obviously.
And I have, um, by, actually by miscuing this tape.
Let's see.
I had, funny to hear all that Chinese.

I don't sleep.
64 years into the terrifying future, a beautiful, horrible cave world you've never dreamed of.

cosmic plague. A new Adam and Eve are the only male and female left to repopulate the world.
I value my freedom more than this. The jealousy of a she-devil frees the bloodthirsty killer slaves.
Follow me, soldiers of revenge! The last survivors of the human race are doomed to murder
in a killer orgy by vicious subhuman retents. Will you die 64 years from today?
After the Christians disappeared, life just went on. There wasn't much different at first.
But then, I'm afraid. I don't know why we're here. I know how you feel. The same thing happened to me.
But you want to know something? I'm not afraid anymore.
Well, I was walking down the street, looking for a job.
I ran to the grocery store. I was looking for a job. I was looking for a job.

I ran into a man. Called himself Bob. Well, I forgot. I forgot I even needed a job.
It's all happened to me when I ran into a guy named Bob.
I was fresh in town. Didn't have a dollar. I was so poor, I was starting to holler.
Then I ran into a man. Called himself Bob.
And I plumb forgot about the fact I had no money and no time.
Well, Bob is hot. Bob is cold. Bob is young. Bob is old.
But I forgot. I forgot I needed to know anything else.
I just took my own personality and put it up on the shelf.
I just took my own personality and put it up on the shelf.
Dad for real now?



Kept set?

got no legs, pull the lever and down you go. Preacher, my legs are on fire and each
man needs to have praise jobs.
Jesus said in John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life. And no man cometh to
the Father but by me.
He weighed 20 pounds and was hairy as a monkey. When he was 10 years old, he was big as I
was. Accidents were happening all the time. Dogs falling in the well. I even found chickens
with their heads bit off. I knew he'd done it. I hit him with a tire and I split his
face wide open. I thought I'd killed him.
Bob's brain, so damn big. He'll make you look like a greasy little pig. Oh, you'll forget
about your whole personality.
As soon as you give your entire brain to Bob and me. If you're young and you're looking
for a job, just look for a guy whose name is Bob and you won't have to worry about getting
a job. You won't have no money, but you'll have Bob. Yes, you'll have Bob.
It would be
beautiful.
If it was neutral to fight them with military power, it would lead to defeat. The end of
civilization.
And once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play, none of you
want to deal with reality because you're all hooked up into that other thing. Well, you're
fixing to lose all that mess.
They use their tongues to deceive. The venom of snakes is under their lips. Their mouths
are full of bitterness and curses. And in their paths, nothing but rage.
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. They have recruited the rich and
the powerful. And they have blinded us to the truth. Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed? Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched
on top of us from bed to bed, we are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the
frightening.
They prey on us, not us. I'm telling you, the rebellion is at the top, not us.
Yet at the very top, they devour us.

Ginny thinks that she has the key to popularity. Parking in cars with the boys at night.
When Jerry brags about taking Ginny out, he learns that she dates all the boys.
And he feels less important.
What about Ginny?
Bill.
Does that make her really popular?
Here, Ginny.
No. Girls who park in cars are not really popular. Not even with the boys they park with.
Is it because they like the way she looks and dresses? Because she seems as interested in girls as in boys?
Because they've heard no scandal about her? Perhaps they'll bring another couple home with them. That would be fun.
But what about the rich guy who does nothing while I do the work?

and had a large pineapple cheers, two eggs over, easy toast,
and a side order of french fries with white gravy.
Damn good grub.
When I left, I noticed the fry cook was talking to the waitress.
He was kind of a tall, distinguished-looking guy for a fry cook
and was smoking a pint.
Pleasant-looking fellow.
I noticed his name, Bob, in a stitched monogram on his white fry cook shirt.
Well, I went out into the cool Texas night and drove off into the future.
I never caught Doc Burrows.
I missed Jack Kerouac.
Before I knew it, I was too old to wear my hair long
without feeling self-conscious about it.
So I was pretty much of an outcast.
I couldn't find my social niche.
Where was my peer group?
I was irrevocably trapped between hipster and hippie.
The new-age mutants were trying to out-punk me,
snapping at my heels.
My life came apart.
I turned to drugs and it all went downhill.
And then one day I saw that face again, looking at me from a page.
Hey, I said, I've seen that guy before.
Maybe I'm just having an acid flashback.
I found out it was a man named Bob.
Bob Dobbs from Dallas, Texas.
And suddenly the complex pieces of the puzzle
that I'd been accumulating for 25 years in the back of my head
all dropped into place.
I sent them all my money.
They sent me the word Bob.
And now I know exactly what I am
and how I came to be that way.
And now I work only for Bob and the church.
And now I can tell people what I do for a living
without being ashamed.
And that's how this song came into being.

Oh yes, friends, it's the Bob Rogers revival in downtown Dallas, Texas tonight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, Buck.
We've got these traditions and we do these things and we have these revivals regularly and irregularly as possible.
Yeah, irregularly is right.
Thanks, that was Buck naked in the Jaybirds, the very last little thing there.
I think before we, we're running into our last 15 minutes of slack.
And I should give some credits before I forget.
We've been hearing a lot of media barrage tonight.
Like I say, I wasn't going to spout.
It didn't work last time.
So I chickened out, man.
I chickened out.
I ain't going to do it again.
Nancy Regalia sent a new media barrage called Signs of the End Times.
Which I've been using a lot of here.
Nancy, by the way, has a book out this week called Sunglasses After Dark.
An erotic horror novel, dear friends.
Which you'll probably enjoy.
I haven't actually read it yet, but no doubt, no doubt at all.
It's a wonderful, sick thing.
Something to read the kids.
It's under her fake human name of Nancy.
Look for Sunglasses After Dark by Nancy Collins.
I have a dead cat on the line.
I have a dead cat on the line.
The society is moving like it's hot.
And there's a dead cat on the line.
They tell me that once upon a time,
they had some chump trying to get a message over the telegram box.
The company sent a man out to inspect the line.
In making his report, he said that he found that a cat had gone up the telegraph pole
and died on the line.
And that was the reason why they couldn't get the message over the line.
What we don't see is so.
They didn't have the cursive for it to envie the
people to go to the station, right?
Listen to what's under her fake human name name after that.
They tell me that you are her father?
Listen to what they tell you.
Anytime you are here, you get the same thing.


What pelo?
Yeah.
It doesn't matter whether your child's famous, your mother or not.
She knows that it's her child.
I suppose then you know your children's father?
Well, yes, I think I know my last children's father.
Yeah, you think you know.
Well, you may not know.
But if you don't know, you've got the last word on the plate.
I am one man that thinks all children.
Just feel the left palm.
All right.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I think that's enough.
Well, don't say that.
I got one child on the field me and so.
Hmm?
No, sir, don't say that.
And don't talk like it.
No, sir.
And don't talk like it.
No, sir.
Have that color like it.
No, sir.
But there's a dead cat on the line.
That's right.
I agree.
That's right.
Absolutely.
That was DK Jones.
And this is Glass Madness, dear friends.
You've been hearing him singing all along here.
Well, I just got a little shirt to me sent to me by Bob.
Bob sent me a subgenius T-shirt, and I'm so damn proud I'm wearing it.
And I just got to sing a song.
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
It came to me in the mail.
When I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
Nothing I do is going to fail.
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
It came.
It came to me in the mail.
Ow.
And when I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
Oh, yes.
I know I'll never land in jail.
Don't you wish, Jimmy.
Oh, yeah.
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
It came to me in the mail.
And you can get one, too, dear friends.
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
But you've got to know where to look.
Me, me, me sent me.
Nothing that I do can fail.
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
Nothing that I do can fail.
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.
What is that red button over there, dear?
Go ahead, please.
Hmm.
.
Kill me or kill me.
Or kill me.
We don't care if you kill us or not kill us or...
We can kill you or not you.
Yeah, yeah.
That's the other side of it.
We don't want to look at it that way, too.
You can kill me, Sarge, and I just want you to know that that'll be dammit fine.
See, if you wish you like to kill, you told us that's all.
Kill, kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kylie.
We kill to be free.
We kill for fun.
We kill for fun.








We kill to be men. We make America free.
We kill for profit.
Well, that's a real nice, sentimental story, but personally, I think it's a lie.
We kill. Kill for the love of killing. Kill for the love of Kali.
Kill for fun. Kill to stay free. We make America great.
You're still making them Doctors for Wotan tapes, and they ain't killed you yet?
My God, haven't we strayed so far from the Bible
that Doctors for Wotan can make tapes day in and day out without anybody killing them?
My God, what depths have we sunk. What depths have we sunk to in this nation?
No, sir. As a matter of fact, in the Bible it says that I come as a sword, not as a...
I read it. I read it.
...tickle-weezy-lick flower, and I'm gonna kill the hell out of everybody I can get my hands on.
I read it. I read it.
I hear they cast some money changers out of the temple and took over the damn record album.
Mr. Graham, is it true that Doctors for Wotan...
Fine. Fine.
...are still making tapes?
Oh, we're with the...
Dear Billy Graham, is Doctors for Wotan still making tapes?
Because if they are, they have to follow our work.
Well, we can get our followers to do whatever we want anyway.
Well, I sent my money to Doctors for Wotan.
They're kind of...
Billy Graham.
...could I still go to heaven?
You're still...
...gotten a father...
You're still...
...the message has been brought to you by the...
You're still preaching that Dobbs dogma...
...now we shall pray.
...and they ain't killed you yet?
Oh, my God.
...we gave you...
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Do it.
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.
Hold it...
Well, Daddy, that has been...
...Roger, well done, then.

...in this case.
Yeah
...とても遺失物 escape easy.
Good luck, Wotan Hood.
Good luck, Wotan Hood.
I just want to die
Oh, please kill me
I just want to feel the veil of broken glass in my veins
Oh, I just want to die for a new best
Oh, I just want to kill for a new best
I don't want to hear another word about Bob
I just want to die
Oh, I just want to die
Oh, I just want to die
Die, die, die, die
Oh, I just want to die
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want to die
I just want to be dead like John Baez and Bobby Dylan
Oh, I just want to die
Like David Crosby
Oh, I just want to die
Yeah, yeah
Just want to die and be cool
One last time
Just want to die
Die, die
And he says, no matter what you guys do
No matter how many of you people you get in the spaceship
There ain't no way you're gonna get rid of me
You just want to stop us
And laugh and try to stays you
And show our boy
Take a look at the可是
It's no way to cross a boundary
But we're Canals


Peranakan
Yeah, it's butt perder
But we're in the city
In his Tylenol
Up here at Hills-N gamers
And it's perfect

Yeah, yeah, ooo
Look and see
Andessa
My song is broken
My kid pawned a video
For drugs
My wife passed out on Darbon
And wrecked a new car
I got the white man
Blues again
I got the white man
Blues again
Working on a chain gang for Bob
Say we're working on that chain gang for Bob
Bob don't pay but he'll let you stay
You gotta kneel and pray
Working on that chain gang for Bob
Working on that chain gang for Bob
Working, working, working
Working on that chain gang for Bob
What's the matter?
Doesn't that sound exciting to you?
They're dead, they're all messed up
They're dead, they're all messed up
They're dead, they're all messed up
Genuinely glad to see you
Genuinely glad to see you
Genuinely glad to see you
As though they had really missed being away from him during the day
And are anxious to talk to him
This is the time for pleasant discussion
In a thoroughly relaxed mood
They don't pick this time of the day
To spring unpleasant surprises on Dad
They're here, they're here
They're going to destroy us
Families throughout the country
Observe the custom of saying grace at mealtime
It is always treated with reverence and respect
Converse pleasantly while talking to your dad and dad's wife
While dad serves
I said pleasantly for that is the keynote at dinnertime
It is not only good manners, but good sense
Pleasant unemotional conversation helps digestion
Pleasant unemotional conversation helps digestion
Let father and mother guide the conversational trend if they desire
After all, they made all this possible
And may want to talk over their days
And may want to talk over their days
And may want to talk over their days
Tell mother how good the food is
Maybe Cis rates a compliment too
It makes them want to continue pleasing you
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound
Charm and relaxation remember
The dinner table is no place for discontent
The dinner table is no place for discontent
It makes dad and mother uncomfortable and unhappy
This does not mean you should be stiff or formal
With your own family you can relax
Be yourself
Just be sure it's your best self
This is fun, isn't it?
Yeah
You sure you like to do things like this?
Sure
I thought all girls wanted fellas to take them to fancy places
Spend lots of money
Not this girl
Not this girl
Not this girl
You know? Not this girl
Not this girl
I sort of like things like this too
You won't laugh
I like to go on bicycle trips too
Do you?
And miniature golf, do you like that?
Yeah and weenie rolls and square dancing
And baseball games and taffy poles
I think they're swell
Say, you like to do lots of things, don't you?
Mother, wouldn't it be slick if we had an electric ironer?
Like Sally's mother has
Of course it would
And I'm looking forward to having one too, Mom!
I'm having an electric dryer too
Axylaim

Oxyóm
And toilet paper





It's my favorite place


We're gonna be welcoming
but wait, this ain't cool
Your jetpack's like smoking
Piss your money away
There won't be no rainy day
If I will sell you all the sun
He's unlike with your boy
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
He ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
At his desk in Dallas
When jetpack sits smoking
Behind his mirrored windows
When jetpack sits smoking
Let up your pipe, let go the smoke
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

This is psych, it ain't no joke
Brace me to pop, lift up your chain
And you will pay to know what you think
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
He ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
He ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna dance, hair and hair
I don't wanna dance, hair and hair

I don't wanna die an ま C
I don't wanna die an totalement
I don't wanna die an attached sentence
That ain't the right word for him
It ain't the right word for my heart
Excuse, bye for me and bye for you
No matter what, a little love's all new
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path of my child
He ain't no man, he ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path of my child
I don't wanna walk the path of my child
For in a world of darkness, danger and despair
We can go on smiling
Cause we know that Bob Dobbs is always there
And I know that Bob's on my side
I know it as sure as I'm born
He will make the proper deal with the exes' whore
Then we'll come to meet him
Then we'll greet him and rule forevermore
Bob is my one true savior
You can't hurt him
Can't keep all of the rest
Looking at his smiling face
Helps me when I'm depressed
For the pinks, I sure feel sorry
For tomorrow, they'll fry with all the rest
Bob has got no real brain to speak of
Though his luck has seen him through the lack
For all the geniuses
Led us down the wrong track
Least we know a subgenius
Won't turn around and stab us
In the back
The con thinks they have us suckered
But I know that that is a lie
They're due for a big surprise
From demons from the sky
Makes me so glad I wised up
Got it sized up
Hell, I'm a lucky guy
Bob brought me slack
And that's lots more
Than I ever got from the con
Though I know it's only
Cause of all those pills he's on
Heck, I know he ain't too clever
But whatever he says
I'm gonna do it for him
So he'll say it once more
How I'm palling, as I do, try
I can even claim the color
That he left in my old tales

He's all I've got
Just to find out
That his lands has cried
I can hear it
I got a big old bob.
I got a big old bob.
He's right inside my pocket.
Got my big old bob.
Just reach inside my pocket.
I just washed him off.
He ain't too stinky this time.
You got to try my bob.
He really wants to meet you.
It will open up to bob.
You'll know that he's a love god.
And once he gets inside, he's never going to leave you.
The bunny seat of bob is leaking out of my pocket.
Just open under him.
He'll crawl inside your socket.
He'll crawl inside your socket.
