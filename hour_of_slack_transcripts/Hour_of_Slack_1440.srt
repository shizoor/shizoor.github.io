1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,020
there's no god there is evolution my savior cut me off you cut me off on the second day

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:18,060
bob appeared yeah what about him why did you tell me this story because your name's not bob

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,240
bob will come as sure as you're born just close your eyes a minute and imagine that you have all

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,320
the bob buttons you could possibly want brilliant four colored bob buttons wouldn't that make your

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,480
eyes pop yes gang they're really something you know kids everywhere are writing me saying what

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,400
a great kick they get out of these bob buttons they like the way the red black blue and yellow

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,740
colors stand out against the pure white enameled cap sweaters or jackets there's no question about

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,500
it gang these buttons are getting more popular every day but as i told you before you can't buy

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,580
these snazzy bob buttons anywhere nope

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,220
all you do is to see to it that mom puts in a good supply of bob buttons at your house

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,580
then you'll find the button in the inner wax bag it's a prize for you

12
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,720
the following is completely secret and absolutely serious it is the story of the universe

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:19,200
the everlasting infinite universal this is a tribute to bob and who am i i am just a nobody

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,140
for you are the infinite anti-infinity of matter anti-matter hello friends this is

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:34,700
bob vibrate oscillate modulate homogenization etc third dimension always think big pure love

16
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:42,080
i love you that's all folks for now two of your bobs will be coming coming mother the first will

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,080
be bob and his quips and comments and by the way bob's guest editor this coming week will be bob

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,980
the second will be that master of the easy style bob bob now it's bob through subversive measures

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,460
devo passes on the word of bob by uh we if you take a look at our last album cover his name's

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,640
been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines of each of the band members right next to the word sex

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:18,000
do bob and sex go hand in hand well bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex about the

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
only slack that i get anymore is worshiping at the holy temple of the yoni

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:43,060
oh yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes that's right hour of slack number what

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,580
is it one thousand four hundred and uh forty one four four zero that's a nice

25
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,180
meaningless number and uh

26
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,860
and tonight's show i'm gonna start off with a long

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:09,000
uh a sort of a sociological uh lecture from negative land as far as i know what i'm about

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,480
to play is um not it's from their tour of last year i don't think any of this is on an album yet

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:24,980
puzzling evidence handed me this cd the last time i saw him and um it explains everything

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,380
about music now i think

31
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,820
and now crosley bendix cultural reviewer and director of stylistic premonitions

32
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,940
for the universal media net web with today's arts review

33
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,700
good hello

34
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:54,680
good hello i'm crosley bendix and tonight's review

35
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,660
is about

36
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,740
feedback

37
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,700
tonight's review is about music

38
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,860
not this music or that music that's now all beside the musical point i want to make

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,840
no i'm talking about all music the whole shebang the entire kit and caboodle

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,300
whatever that is

41
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,220
yes every stitch in time every note and rhyme every type and kind

42
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,740
all the music that's ever been made by anyone anywhere

43
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:36,500
and what could i possibly say about all varieties of music that would apply to all those varieties

44
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,180
equally

45
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,480
well not much actually except for the one no longer avoidable fact that it's all been

46
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,260
done

47
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:53,400
and that's my pointless point here at the beginning of the 21st century it has finally

48
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
come to pass the time of the world's first musical record of the century and it's been

49
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:06,880
said that why a major matter nothing but the were not recapitalized

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,980
in exertion

51
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:23,060
of course things were done at the full brink of oblivion

52
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,520
some lacklusterоров the negotiation of the remix which i found very win!.

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,520


54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,520


55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,520


56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,800
fathers

57
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,800


58
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,800


59
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,800


60
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:23,800


61
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,180
thanks for halloween

62
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,120
and dearly loved band

63
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,180
that. That would be impossible. To begin with, just how many newly interesting or moving

64
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,980
combinations of the same available notes everyone must work with do you think are still out

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:46,680
there untried? We have always been accustomed to assuming that there must be plenty of untried

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,760
note combinations left to discover, but actually this is no longer true. Decent musical possibilities

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:02,380
for combinations of available notes were never infinite, not when being quote good is still

68
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:09,440
a guiding principle for composers and musicians. I'm suggesting we're now past the point of

69
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,600
discovering anything good in music that has not already been tried. After so many centuries

70
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,660
of research and research and research and research and research and research and research and

71
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,660
centuries of manipulating and remanipulating the same scales up and down of a finite number

72
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:29,280
of notes, we have actually reached the end of all even slightly useful combinations.

73
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,140
While there's plenty of note combinations left that don't sound good, that's why they're

74
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:42,360
left. But all the great, good, sort of good, and hesitantly acceptable note combinations

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,660
have been used up long ago. Why do you think we're using them? Because they're not

76
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,260
useful. It's all about the melody, and the melody itself is not. Music is so boring now.

77
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,740
Just try to write any melody whatsoever that does not sound like a melody that already

78
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:03,440
exists. That's been difficult for some time, and now it's finally impossible. Why do you

79
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,680
think punk rock emerged, drenched in desperation? Do you think there was some kind of socio-musical

80
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,640
politics involved? No, vote again. All that angry angst was actually a result of false

81
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,880
about evading this melody problem,

82
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,940
if only for under one minute in musical history,

83
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,940
by eliminating melody altogether.

84
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,680
But so what?

85
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,820
Like every other kind of so-called new music,

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,720
that had been done before, too.

87
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,300
It's kind of sad, really,

88
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,300
to see how every avant branch of music

89
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,260
just continues on and on,

90
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,980
grasping at blind hope,

91
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,680
so delusional beyond repair,

92
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,760
in complete denial of the now simply obvious fact

93
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,320
that it's all been done before,

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
and nothing categorically new

95
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
will ever be possible in music again.

96
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,880
Get used to it.

97
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,660
The fact is, all possible types of musical concepts,

98
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,080
compositional approaches,

99
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,020
times, tempos, tones, timbres, arrangements,

100
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,980
instrumental combinations, ambiences,

101
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,960
and even extra musical additions,

102
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,960
have already been tried and successfully accomplished

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,020
somewhere from the classical to today's pure noise.

104
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,680
Oh sure, you can just keep rehashing many of this stuff

105
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,840
over and over again,

106
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,580
but it only displays a convenient loss of musical memory,

107
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
and nobody likes a copycat.

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,640
We are in a unique position in the history of music,

109
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,100
which should be clear to anyone who can get beyond

110
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,960
the typical mindset of music,

111
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,140
and the musical wannity which preoccupies

112
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,220
most musicians and composers.

113
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,060
Think about it categorically,

114
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,240
which is the only valid way to determine

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,440
whether something is truly new in practice.

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,500
Is it actually a brand new sprout of unique innovation,

117
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,320
or just another familiar twig on another familiar branch

118
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
of an old familiar tree?

119
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,900
To put it simply,

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
all the sprouts that can sprout have already sprouted.

121
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,760
Or, to put it another way,

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:14,960
all the sprouts that can sprout have already sprouted.

123
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,980
The musical tree is now so stuffed with birds

124
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,880
that there are no new perches available.

125
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,780
And by the woodsy way,

126
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,480
down here underneath it all,

127
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,260
we listeners are being splattered and smothered

128
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,380
with all this bird turd called music.

129
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,940
Tonal to atonal,

130
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,260
harmonious to dissonant,

131
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,880
simple minimalism to complex orchestrations,

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,100
naive to cerebral,

133
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,160
very pretty to pretty ugly,

134
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,880
acoustic to electro,

135
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,420
electronic,

136
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,560
indigenous to world influence,

137
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,620
one-note drones to polyphonic cacophony,

138
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,360
romantic to bitter,

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,260
pure noise to barely audible,

140
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,100
and even cage's silence.

141
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,520
Shockey to sophisticated,

142
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,900
serious to funny,

143
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,460
danceable to undanceable,

144
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,140
composed to improvised,

145
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,680
expensive instruments to household utensils,

146
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
folk to industrial speed metal,

147
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Dada's anti-music to sing-along jingles,

148
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,630
computer functions to computer dysfunctions,

149
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,110
synthesizing and recombining all existing musical threads

150
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,150
in all possible combinations,

151
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,630
and not last nor least,

152
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,550
every conceivable sort of vocalizing.

153
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,690
Singing, yelling, shrieking, rapping, talking,

154
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,670
humming, yodeling, whistling, whispering, grunting,

155
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,410
lip, tongue, and teeth noises,

156
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,170
and heavy breathing have all been established

157
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,470
and reiterated in vocal music.

158
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,670
Yes, every possible musical practice has been done

159
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,870
and perfected, and more importantly,

160
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,750
every possible conceptual extreme,

161
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,810
the birthplace of new sprouts,

162
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,130
has already been tried,

163
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,730
successfully articulated,

164
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,470
and used up.

165
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,290
And most of all of this happened

166
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,290
for the first time a long time ago.

167
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,010
Yes, categorically or specifically,

168
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,110
it's all been done before,

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,530
and probably done better than you can do it again.

170
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,590
At this point in time,

171
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,310
there is no original kind of music at all.

172
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,450
Only barely disguised backtracking down

173
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,170
well-worn paths on the trail of music.

174
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,670
Right in front of us,

175
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,130
a kind of sound barrier blocks any forward movement,

176
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,330
beyond which only dogs can hear.

177
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,450
The human ear has been exploited in every possible way

178
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,290
and to every possible extreme.

179
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,710
There is nowhere new to go.

180
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,490
Oh sure, we all like to think that surely something new

181
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,710
will come along like it always used to before.

182
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,310
Eventually there will be gas music from Jupiter

183
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,270
or something.

184
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,330
But believe me, it's not going to happen.

185
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,510
There is no possible future sound in music

186
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,730
that will not remind us thoroughly

187
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,410
of similar sounds in the history of music.

188
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,310
If you can create one,

189
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,890
I'd like to hear it.

190
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,530
I can make you famous.

191
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,410
So, what's left?

192
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,390
Nothing new, that's what.

193
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,030
No use getting angry about it,

194
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,010
that's been done too.

195
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,650
Anyway, we did it to ourselves.

196
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,130
You can't spread out musically

197
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,650
to the degree we have done during the 20th century in particular

198
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,850
and expect new possibilities

199
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,350
to just continue appearing endlessly.

200
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,950
I repeat, music is a craft

201
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,530
of finite possibilities

202
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,110
and we have now used them all.

203
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,850
Beyond this, it is only possible

204
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,990
to regurgitate redundancies.

205
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,410
Music is now 100% in the business of reinterpretation.

206
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,490
The also funny thing is,

207
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,730
for most people, this is not so bad.

208
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,350
In fact, they hardly notice this is true.

209
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,490
Most music has always been about

210
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,370
reinterpreting something familiar.

211
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,350
Most pop...

212
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,810
Most music, pop or not,

213
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,770
has always been utterly familiar,

214
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,590
completely reminiscent of preceding music

215
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,170
and is repeating itself over and over, over time.

216
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,270
This is what most people seem to like about it.

217
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,830
Endless variations within well-established styles.

218
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,730
Talented personalities

219
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,170
who are able to create refurbished feelings of new

220
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,810
through their individual performance approaches

221
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,070
as they apply themselves

222
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,730
to their completely familiar,

223
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,390
unified and true musical forms and structures.

224
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,710
Now, now, now, please,

225
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,930
don't get angry.

226
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,550
I don't expect any kind of music crash anytime soon.

227
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,790
But for those among us who have always been interested

228
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,590
in the assumed potential to actually arrive

229
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,430
at categorically new musical structures

230
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,370
or categorically new kinds of sound,

231
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,590
we can now give up.

232
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,590
That potential...

233
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,710
I give up!

234
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,590
...no longer exists.

235
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,990
I give up!

236
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,210
Hold on there, Mr. B, you may say.

237
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,850
Why is it even important to have the possibility

238
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,650
for categorically new forms in music?

239
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,590
Well, I don't even want to hear that song.

240
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,590
Because if you don't have new forms,

241
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,250
music is relegated to being just a craft forever.

242
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,350
You squeeze the possibility of music being an art

243
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,490
right out of it.

244
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,350
Like a parking lot with no spaces.

245
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,050
You just drive around and around the same place,

246
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,030
listening to the same music on your putt-putt pod.

247
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,610
But before long,

248
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,990
before you unfortunately run out of gas,

249
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,750
you'll probably realize that in modern art,

250
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,070
as opposed to craft,

251
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,250
advancing is crucial.

252
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,450
The invention of new forms that contradict

253
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,170
and or supersede their own traditions.

254
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,470
New forms that allow it to be

255
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,650
designated art, not craft,

256
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,830
by some of our most advanced music critics.

257
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,170
Without any new forms left to invent,

258
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,130
music finds itself with only already known

259
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,070
and previously exploited tactics

260
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,110
with which to fool you into thinking

261
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,470
you never heard it before.

262
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,610
Our only solace may be that we can say

263
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,550
we were there when new musical invention

264
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,450
finally ended for good,

265
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,470
even as all the recombinant musical clones continue to die.

266
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,630
And one more thing,

267
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,530
for those modern music connoisseurs out there

268
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,170
who may be gesturing wildly

269
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,490
about the most recent categorical innovation in music,

270
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,050
the incorporation of found sound

271
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,350
in sampling and cut-up collage works

272
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,190
as if that was something new,

273
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,610
forget it.

274
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,650
All that began in the 20s

275
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,710
with electrical recording technologies

276
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,310
was already old when it reappeared

277
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,450
in digital technology.

278
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,450


279
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,450


280
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,450


281
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:09,450


282
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,350
And is now thoroughly entrenched in musical practice.

283
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,670
Collage, too, has nowhere new to go.

284
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,350
And already always sounds more or less the same,

285
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,010
no matter who is doing it.

286
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,070
Collage in music was simply the very last refuge

287
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,550
of the musically bored.

288
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,150
A desperate half-in, half-out musical stance

289
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,190
in a world filled with too many sounds already.

290
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,430
And that's why we're here today

291
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,430


292
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,430


293
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,430


294
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,650
to talk about the future of music.

295
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,950
A world in which the only new logic

296
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,890
was to be honestly unoriginal

297
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,190
and actually compose new works

298
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,310
out of old ones.

299
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,170
Recycling the now disposable plethora

300
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,530
of existing music

301
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,270
into slightly newer disposable music

302
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,710
and let it go at that.

303
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,650
Just temporary titillations

304
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,010
that unpredictably suck up the past

305
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,610
and reposition it into the present.

306
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,350
That's the future of music

307
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,310
and that's the end of music.

308
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,590
Thank you.

309
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,630
Oh, thank you,

310
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,230
Crosley Bendix of Negative Land.

311
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,430
Uh...

312
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,110
There we go.

313
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,530
Well, we're not going to listen

314
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,170
to the rest of their concert,

315
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,590
which is on this disc here, I believe.

316
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,650
Let's see.

317
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,850
Uh, yeah, Negative Land live at the Uptown,

318
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,330
December 17th.

319
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,470
December 29th, 2012.

320
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,370
Huh.

321
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,590
Just about a year ago.

322
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,250
That's an unheard Negative Land intro.

323
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,670
Um, the rest of it actually sounds

324
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,170
kind of familiar to me.

325
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,770
Like, somehow I...

326
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,330
I shouldn't recognize it,

327
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,010
but yet I did.

328
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,190
And I shall.

329
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,910
And, uh, it's cold here in the station.

330
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,490
Actually, a little bit.

331
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,110
It's very cold outside.

332
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,070
Tonight, as we record this,

333
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,410
the world is obviously ending,

334
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,250
freezing up.

335
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,170
Global forwarming.

336
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,310
And I'm all messed up.

337
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,990
The time...

338
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,870
Time is out of joint.

339
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,010
And, uh, time control has gone out of control

340
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,490
because Sunday came on Friday.

341
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,450
There was an open house here at WCSB Cleveland

342
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,570
on, uh, Friday, last Friday and today, Sunday.

343
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,570
Normally, we're always having dinar on Friday

344
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,250
with our friend, uh, I...

345
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,890
Reverend I. Doctor, Mr. Sister, and his son.

346
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,030
And we're always at the station on Sunday.

347
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,830
And yet, on Friday, we did not have dinar,

348
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,010
and yet we were at the station.

349
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,510
And I got so flabbergasted and time spun

350
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,110
that I ended up not...

351
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,770
I don't think I posted last week's live show

352
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,830
until about five minutes ago, uh,

353
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,690
in the middle of this live show.

354
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,670
So, isn't that...

355
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,350
It's like I say, it's time control going out of control.

356
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,810
Time control going out of control.

357
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,790
Princess We is here,

358
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,450
and she's, uh, preparing to...

359
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,390
to do a rant.

360
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,730
Uh, she's going to read a rant by someone else.

361
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,930
Uh, Reverend Chocolate Velvet posted her first rant.

362
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,730
I bet it wasn't really her first.

363
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,390
On, uh, our... our members-only forum, Scrub Genius.

364
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,010
Uh, accessible only to people who have the...

365
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,730
who know the secret handshake,

366
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,490
which happens on PayPal, actually.

367
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,810
So, um...

368
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,450
But I was expecting Lonesome Cowboy Dave to call in.

369
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,250
In fact, I... I went out of... I actually...

370
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,170
We... we dug up a big, uh, mess of extra phone time

371
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,130
for... for Dave, just to have him...

372
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,810
So I guess perhaps what we should do then

373
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,810
is, uh...

374
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:05,990
Um...

375
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,330
Forget about poor Dave for now.

376
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,290
And we will, uh...

377
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:14,870
What else can we do? I know what we'll do.

378
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,070
We'll do this.

379
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:16,750


380
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,190
Praise God!

381
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:21,730
Yeah!

382
00:20:35,810 --> 00:21:05,810


383
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,270
佮

384
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,070
If everything looks crappy to you,

385
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,330
it's probably because you have your head up in your nether parts

386
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,030
or someone else's nether parts.

387
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,830
Pull it out and take a look around, you cynical bastards.

388
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,890
Screw your cynicism, okay?

389
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,270
Your precious boredom and indifference.

390
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,910
Your world weariness that inures you to the wonders and beauty of the world.

391
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,630
Screw your gravitas and your insistence on meaning and purpose and depth.

392
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,650
That heady bull stuff that takes you away from the things right in front of you,

393
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:31,530
waiting to be savored, lingered over, breathed in deeply over and over.

394
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,970
Screw your bitterness and contempt and hopelessness too.

395
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,450
The storming dark cloud, the crappiness you wrap around your head

396
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:49,550
to shield yourself from the excruciating sensation of unmitigated pure beauty

397
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,610
and the aching fullness of your own heart.

398
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,550
The light of Venus burns your eyes so you cower from it

399
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,510
and call it a day.

400
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,110
You call yourself tough and streetwise for doing so.

401
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,570
Believe that if you want to.

402
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,730
If you can ignore the fact that your pants are damp

403
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,530
because you just wet yourself a little in fear of that searing light.

404
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,070
The force of it crushes your stupid cynical poses.

405
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,590
But you cling to them anyway.

406
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,430
You are sad and weak because you feed on ugliness and resignation.

407
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,510
You're starving and still fatuous and self-satisfied.

408
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,970
What the crap is the point of that?

409
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:41,050
Oh yes, effing blind fools.

410
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,690
I scream in the face of your hard-heartedness.

411
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,870
In the name of love and beauty.

412
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,710
In defense of Venus, who's been beaten and raped

413
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,770
and whored out to the lowest common denominator.

414
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,270
In a world that reveres cynicism and doubt,

415
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,250
Venus,

416
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,830
has been reduced to a vapid bimbo.

417
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,130
An opportunity for distraction and decadence.

418
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,870
One to be dismissed or desired.

419
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,310
Something found only in a pair of implants and a pole dance.

420
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:19,510
An empty sweet to be consumed when we crave her comforts.

421
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,470
Perhaps in shame and without reciprocation.

422
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,610
Oh, I see you.

423
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,250
I hear your arrogant loser talk.

424
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,930
Tearing down what's been created and cultivated

425
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,330
by others with more courage than you.

426
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,750
Oh, that pretty stuff is merely decorative.

427
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,770
Eye candy, fluff and nonsense.

428
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,590
The implication being that beauty and sweetness

429
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,430
have no value in and of themselves.

430
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,390
Merely an opportunity for vanity or decadence.

431
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,350
Pretty young women are not to be taken seriously.

432
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,470
Handsome lads are probably douchebags.

433
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,890
Sweetie pies get screwed and they deserve it.

434
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,410
The world sucks.

435
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,790
Only idiots are distracted by the pretty stuff.

436
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,470
Wrong!

437
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,170
Screw that.

438
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,210
No!

439
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,290
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

440
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,150
Beauty is an emanation of the divine, whatever that is.

441
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,050
It is slack made visible, made tangible.

442
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,730
Glamour and decoration are invocations.

443
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,710
It is foreplay, stroking that special place of the goddess

444
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,710
to get those juices flowing.

445
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,370
And she's always there.

446
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:30,390
She's always there.

447
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,670
She's always ready for us.

448
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,250
If we call out to Venus, she comes over and over again.

449
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,870
When beauty comes, it must be honoured.

450
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,710
And it must be answered with an orgasmic spasm of yes!

451
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,810
Yes!

452
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,610
Yes!

453
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,370
Yes!

454
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,010
Oh, God, yes!

455
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,530
Again!

456
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,690
Harder.

457
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,630
Deeper.

458
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,010
Drive that beauty, that aching sweetness so deep inside me.

459
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,710
Oh, God, it's so beautiful.

460
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,710
Don't stop.

461
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,370
Fill me up with the seeds of inspiration.

462
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:00,990
Inspired creativity.

463
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,610
Let me swell with the fruit of the goddess.

464
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:11,350
I will nurture and deliver it and raise it up to full flower as a form of service to

465
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,810
her.

466
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:20,110
As a healing act for myself and others, propagating the burning, transformative fever of the beautiful.

467
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,210
Inviting one and all to come and come again.

468
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,350
Beauty calls to beauty and it touches us to cull us into what is beautiful.

469
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,350


470
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,350


471
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,350


472
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,350


473
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,390
It is beautiful in ourselves.

474
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,010
You are so beautiful.

475
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,010
Don't you see?

476
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:41,950
Beauty is literally in the eye of the beholder and she is dying for lack of a home in our

477
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,370
way of seeing the world.

478
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,110
Don't you care?

479
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,150
You cynical schmucks.

480
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,210
Will you just watch her die?

481
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,110
Well, I guess that's all right if everyone understands that you knew that would happen.

482
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,550
You're so stinkin' smart.

483
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,830
You saw it coming.

484
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,530
Congratulations.

485
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,330
You're so smart.

486
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,690
What did you win?

487
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,910
Is your world a better place without her?

488
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:07,630
No.

489
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:15,710
If you pull your head out of that crappy place, it is obvious that Venus, or whatever name

490
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:21,030
you give her, is the great harmonizer of this cacophony of pink bull stuff.

491
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:27,650
She is calling us into accord with her voice as she sings out from every moment of our

492
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,850
encounters with the beautiful.

493
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,310
In the end, she is beautiful.

494
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,350
And I have to say, I'm not the only one who thinks that.

495
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,350


496
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,350


497
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,350


498
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:30,950
But you will find yourself in the presence of the beautiful in those moments.

499
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,870
When you find yourself in the presence of what is beautiful to you, answer her.

500
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,950
Reach out from the place in yourself that is the beholder of beauty.

501
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,830
Show gratitude for the love and harmony that you've known by offering replenishment to the

502
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,550
sources of that place in your life, be they people, places, things, whatever.

503
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,410
Stop being a cynical schmuck.

504
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,910
Let the pinks do that.

505
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,010
They're built for it.

506
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,290
Love what you find beautiful unabashedly and without any prejudice.

507
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,290


508
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,370
conservation of energy, for that way lies slack.

509
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:12,210
Love what you find beautiful, oh my yeti kin, or kill me.

510
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:21,190
That was the words of Reverend Chocolate Velvet, read by Princess Wee, and this is Lonesome

511
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,010
Cowboy Dave.

512
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:29,270
I'm sorry it took so long to adversely react to everything, but I had an enormous

513
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,190
debt to pay upstairs where my bathroom is.

514
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,990
Oh no.

515
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,730
Really enormous?

516
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,750
Did it hurt?

517
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,590
Oh yes, of course.

518
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,610
It has to hurt to feel good.

519
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,450
I see.

520
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,170
I didn't catch that.

521
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,110
Something happened up in Dave's bathroom that hurt and felt good.

522
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,990
He had to pay to his fixture up above.

523
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,070
Oh.

524
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,110
You may call it an accumulation.

525
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,450
He had to give up.

526
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:01,910
Oh.

527
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:02,950
Carrots.

528
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,090
I thought so.

529
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,110
Many islands from places far beyond our reckoning.

530
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,510
You can't get there easy.

531
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,770
I forgot what the stumble bum was.

532
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,410
Have you been arguing about the political circus or have you been a part of it?

533
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,290
Neither one.

534
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:28,670
We were transcending it, or rather Princess Wee, when you were a light to the...

535
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,330
Potty.

536
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,710
The show potty.

537
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:38,870
Princess Wee read the rant by Reverend Chocolate Velvet, which was not a very, what you would

538
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:41,570
call a typical subgenius hate rant.

539
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,750
It was more of a Connie-ite love rant.

540
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:52,010
Oh, the music in the background on that was the Flying, no, the Fly-In Ryan Brothers.

541
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,210
It's not Fly-ing if you try to Google them.

542
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,710
It's Fly-In Ryan Brothers.

543
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,590
That's Ryanetics.

544
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,050
The Fly-In Ryans.

545
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,250
Fierce heterosexuals.

546
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,450
Fierce.

547
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:06,710
We argue.

548
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,590
Airstwhile.

549
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,010
Fierce.

550
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,230
Fierce.

551
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,330
Fierce and Airst...

552
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,030
Firstwhile.

553
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,870
Thirstwhile.

554
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,530
And Faustian.

555
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,450
Don't forget Faustian, another famous word that you can use whenever you want to feel

556
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,750
a little bleak, like your muscles in your legs.

557
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,370
And Airstwhile.

558
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,330
I sold my soul to...

559
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,030
Actually...

560
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,630
It was a peanut vendor.

561
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,270
Monee, Monee.

562
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,510
Monee, Monee?

563
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,070
How could you do that?

564
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,130
I always had trouble with Monee.

565
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,350
It's killing me.

566
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,010
Monee.

567
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,150
Goobers.

568
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,070
Goobers, what?

569
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,170
Goobers, what?

570
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,570
You sold your soul to the peanut vendor?

571
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:49,990
Yeah.

572
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,970
How could you do that, Dave?

573
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,830
It was hot and fresh and salted, just like this reality is.

574
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,290
Goodness.

575
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,330
Overcooked.

576
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,070
It's crisp.

577
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,250
Yeah.

578
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


579
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


580
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


581
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


582
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


583
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


584
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


585
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,250


586
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,410
I mean, it's...

587
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,970
It's caused you to live longer, some people say.

588
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,450
Ah.

589
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,030
Most people...

590
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,110
Well, if it causes you to live longer, then I approve.

591
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:08,690
Yeah.

592
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,710
What if you had more...

593
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,290
What if you had more than one foreskin?

594
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,230
You had a five skin or something like that.

595
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,650
Then you'd really be...

596
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,570
You'll bleep better if you were wearing the right equipment.

597
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,290
Are you making fun of me again, Dave?

598
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,190
I was trying to, but...

599
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,110
The five skins.

600
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,650
It's more elliptical.

601
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,970
I forget which part of you I was making fun of.

602
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,250
Well, we're all...

603
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


604
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


605
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


606
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


607
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


608
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


609
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


610
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


611
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,250


612
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,610
We're all confused.

613
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,430
This has been one of those confusing days and weekends.

614
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,070
I don't know if I mentioned to you, Dave, that I had...

615
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,810
We had so much fun doing the show last week that I forgot to post it on the internet until

616
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,490
just a little while ago.

617
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,850
Can you imagine?

618
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,790
Yeah.

619
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,050
Yeah.

620
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,170
I think I sent you a...

621
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,350
You got a copy of it before the internet did.

622
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,070
So much for modern technology.

623
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:59,170
At least I don't have a false ovary on my head like some of your listeners.

624
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,330
Hey, hey, hey.

625
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,690
Don't talk...

626
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,710
Those listeners were the ones who donated.

627
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,230
The ones with the false ovaries.

628
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,690
The ones with the real ovaries on their heads didn't pledge a dime.

629
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,610
Not a thin, thin dime.

630
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,030
Yeah, but they were promised just the same as they pledged.

631
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,350
And some of them were let down because they were not fertile.

632
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,430
If you know what I mean.

633
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,250
We're talking about the gifts of...

634
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,910
Not Artemis.

635
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,230
What's the one with really ample booty?

636
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,230


637
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,270
There's Fatima, Georgette.

638
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:32,950
Kardashian.

639
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,390
Kardashian.

640
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:34,970
Yeah.

641
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,830
Or...

642
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,710
Kardashians.

643
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,510
The dim.

644
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,310
The news.

645
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,390
The news.

646
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,830
Kardashian out.

647
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,290
Yeah.

648
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:48,170
The news is Kardashian out and have not been doing their offerings, I suppose, or their

649
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,530
leavings, droppings, whichever you might call them.

650
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,230
Oh, it's sad.

651
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,070
It is sad.

652
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:56,510
It's sad.

653
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,410
It's very depressing.

654
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,230
It's very depressing.

655
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,230


656
00:32:59,230 --> 00:32:59,230


657
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,630
One minute the universe is expanding, the next minute it's like a...

658
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,230
And then the next thing you know, it's just praise Bob all the way down.

659
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,090
Praise Bob.

660
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,630
Nice Bob.

661
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:11,070
Yeah.

662
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:19,330
I want to know, I want to know if there's any possibility that I can relate one incident

663
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:25,450
or two incidents of real realness which will brand me forever as being totally insane.

664
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,150
I want to hear.

665
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,630
I want to hear.

666
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:49,610
Aren't some people crazy.

667
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,850
Yeah, some people are.

668
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,170
Uh-

669
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,450
I don't know.

670
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:58,610
Who were you just selling watches at?

671
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:58,610


672
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:58,610


673
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,130
They're usually chupacabras, aren't they?

674
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:08,370
They gave some sort of credence, in my mind, to the thing that I laughed at of chupacabras,

675
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,550
that there are no such...

676
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,890
We know every kind of animal there is around.

677
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,210
There's been no evolution because of scum or...

678
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,110
Or radiation.

679
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,690
Is there a lot of fallout there in Ashtabula?

680
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,790
Yes, there certainly is.

681
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:22,970
Yeah, it's the Perry...

682
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,150
Perry Mason Nuclear Power Plant or something like that?

683
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,110
Some of these morphed animals are probably quite legit.

684
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:37,570
Plus, they used to warp plutonium here by the factories and so forth.

685
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,050
It's quite a hot locale.

686
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,810
Well, didn't you write a novel about the hotness of that locale at one point?

687
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,090
Whatever happened to that thing?

688
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,550
Weren't we going to self-publish it?

689
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:57,630
Lonesome Cowboy Dave wrote this novel called Infomercial or something like that

690
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,130
that was...

691
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,410
It was great.

692
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,690
It's called Neighbor World.

693
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,290
Right.

694
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:09,170
It was called InfoScan originally, but apparently a whole lot more companies are calling themselves InfoScans.

695
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:09,410
Right.

696
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,170
Thought Neighbor World would be tastier.

697
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,590
And I've been editing it for more than a year now.

698
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,090
Gary, a friend, said he would do it.

699
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,730
And since I've gone insane recently, I'm...

700
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,190
But it has more to do with social media.

701
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,710
It's just the same way you have, like...

702
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:33,570
Friendly things that tell you to go faster or it'll kick you or make fun of you and stuff like that.

703
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,290
Yeah, my exercise machine.

704
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:35,790
Yeah.

705
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,890
You're not supposed to be friends with your furniture, man.

706
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,230
Well, we're not exactly friends.

707
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,370
Our furniture is bossing us around is what's happening.

708
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,030
Yeah.

709
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:47,410
Yeah.

710
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,230
It's calling us names, usually involving our weight.

711
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,190
Yeah.

712
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,430
Yeah.

713
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,910
Yeah.

714
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,330
It says, Step...

715
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,670
We have this doohickey.

716
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,670
Somebody gave us.

717
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,310
It's called a Wii.

718
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,990
Has no connection to Princess Wii.

719
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,210
Spelled differently.

720
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,510
And...

721
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,750
It's themed exercise machines.

722
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,690
It comes on your computer or your TV monitor, actually.

723
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,570
And it tells you a little person appears and starts bossing you around.

724
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:18,530
It says, Stand on me.

725
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,290
Okay, you weigh too much.

726
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:21,750
Get to work.

727
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,030
Jerk.

728
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,150
You've been staying up too late.

729
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,650
Have you been drinking?

730
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:27,930
You know...

731
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,930
You have to breathalyze it.

732
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,190
It's got this little...

733
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,770
A G-jaw, it's called.

734
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,770
A doohickey.

735
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,070
Yeah.

736
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,110
That you put...

737
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:40,070
It can see you and it can weigh you and it can feel you.

738
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,010
And it gets right up in your grill and bosses you around.

739
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:43,630
Yeah.

740
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,330
Yeah.

741
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:44,690
Yeah.

742
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,350
And that comes with this.

743
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:46,970
It's called...

744
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,410
It's supposedly like a game.

745
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,130
But it...

746
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,530
First, it programs you to lose weight.

747
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,270
And then it programs you to just do whatever it says.

748
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,890
And I don't know what it's going to do next.

749
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,410
That's dangerous.

750
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:58,810
It's the part we've been worried about.

751
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,890
It's the part we've been worried about.

752
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,330
Indeed.

753
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,190
See, at least in my novel there, you can fire those guys.

754
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,090
You can delete them.

755
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,230
You can say, at some point in time, you can say,

756
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:08,790
Okay, that's enough abuse.

757
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,970
Stop giving this to me or I'm going to delete you.

758
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,510
And they stop.

759
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,610
Ah.

760
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,530
Well, we have...

761
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,190
I don't know if they have...

762
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:15,750
We have...

763
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,190
We can turn it off and turn it on.

764
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,970
But the problem is, after we turn it off, we turn it on.

765
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,790
And once you turn it on, it's got you again.

766
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,570
You know?

767
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,090
It's like you're going to have to wait through the whole load in.

768
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,490
Then you have to load yourself in.

769
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,090
Then you're in there.

770
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,390
It's like that movie Tron.

771
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,370
You can't...

772
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,110
You know, you get...

773
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,790
You thought you were the programmer.

774
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,490
And you get sucked in.

775
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,490
And you're just another one of the sprites going,

776
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,450
I don't believe there's such a thing as a user.

777
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,390
I think that's just...

778
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,350
I'm a skeptic.

779
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,350
I don't believe in the user.

780
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,510
Exactly.

781
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,350
Exactly.

782
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,610
What kind of world do they have planned for us?

783
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:53,830
Indeed.

784
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,370
And who is the user?

785
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,390
And when is the user?

786
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,750
Ultimately, it all...

787
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,890
All become sampled up into one big, gigantic weave of insanity

788
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,930
where human beings lose their very humanity.

789
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,970
And this is also written in books by regular anthropologist-type guys

790
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,750
and scientists like Bill McKibben and stuff like that.

791
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:18,050
Not just us or you or me or they or we.

792
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,070
I mean, literally we.

793
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,070
Yeah.

794
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,170
Yeah.

795
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,490
But him and them.

796
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:26,110
Well, but the thing...

797
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,090
What I'm...

798
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,290
What I'm concerned about is that Tron actually had it backwards.

799
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:38,290
That we were, in fact, created by the computer robot minds a long time ago.

800
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,230
We don't know it.

801
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,010
We're just programmed.

802
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,470
So to us, this is the real world.

803
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,810
The computer beings have just lately started to let us know.

804
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,430
They're easing us in on the fact that we're just in the Matrix.

805
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,130
And I mean, not like in the movie, The Matrix.

806
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,950
I mean, we never had a...

807
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:57,650
We never had a physical body.

808
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,650
And they're just slowly letting...

809
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,490
They've introduced the concept of computers to us.

810
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,250
And then the concept of video games bossing us around.

811
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,290
I mean, how often does your computer really do something for you?

812
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,930
No, you're doing stuff for it.

813
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,370
You're the one who's sitting there working and slaving away.

814
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,950
It's just kind of coming along.

815
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,410
Stroping it gently.

816
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,630
Arguing with what little...

817
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,930
What false deities there may be for it to continue to operate.

818
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:30,710
Or else you won't be able to breathe normally.

819
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,950
You won't be able to have a sandwich and enjoy it.

820
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,050
You look down at your little handset and text somebody

821
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,170
while you're flying as fast as you can through the robot...

822
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,030
The robot Vista you've created yourself.

823
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,870
No, what I'm saying is we've been doing this all along.

824
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,970
This isn't something new.

825
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:56,030
The machines are just now kind of easing us in to the idea that maybe...

826
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,990
We were the ones that were serving them.

827
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,550
And we're the programs that go wacky.

828
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,150
And that's why my shoulder hurts.

829
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,290
And that's why God is in the machine.

830
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,890
And none of us want to be atheists yet.

831
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,170
And so that's why we get down on our hands and knees and thank our own selves.

832
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:23,250
There's things and people, if you could call them people, like Bob.

833
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,770
Bob?

834
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:25,790
Bob?

835
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:26,870
Bob?

836
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,950
Bob?

837
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,350
Bob?

838
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:27,950
He's out there.

839
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,250
We've got Bob.

840
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,290
We've got Bob.

841
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,810
We've got Bob.

842
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:31,510
We've got Bob.

843
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,010
We've got Bob.

844
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,490
Yeah, we've got Bob all right.

845
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,550
Bob, Bob today.

846
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,030
Hi, Bob.

847
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,450
Bob.

848
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,750
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

849
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:38,750
It's hard to get rid of him.

850
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,910
Bob, Bob.

851
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,290
It's like when you pull the chicken beak off of a tiny little baby chicken

852
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,170
when you're in a real bad mood or something and you live in a rural area.

853
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,190
And say maybe you've just wandered into somebody maybe 20 miles away's chicken coop area

854
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,070
and you're just looking for...

855
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,690
I have Bob Dobbs.

856
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,210
Well, believe me, it's a lot.

857
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,890
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

858
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,170
And I believe, and I believe Bob Dobbs.

859
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,430
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

860
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,450
High in the sky.

861
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,350
High in the sky.

862
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:11,550
Mr. Dobbs, I'm afraid I'm losing you.

863
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,630
And I thank you very much, very much.

864
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,810
Morphed animals.

865
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:15,870
Well, that was it.

866
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,790
That was a morphed animal.

867
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:24,270
We thought we had Bob on the phone, but he ducked out.

868
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,050
He bobbed out, you might say.

869
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:26,210
Right?

870
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,310
He'll bob you out.

871
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,890
If you don't love Bob, he'll bob you out.

872
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:38,010
That is the massive plank of superstition and self-controlled inequity

873
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,330
that the Uber mentioned and the smaller mentioned,

874
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:44,370
and any other mentions and stuff like that you want to mention.

875
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,670
This is the flack.

876
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,070
The Uber mention.

877
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,350
The flackism that Bob throws up whenever he's attempting to be clear.

878
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,810
You, one, attempt to communicate.

879
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,450
You, one, attempt to communicate with him.

880
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:04,750
Because when the brain cells become really, really, really, really, really fine and fuzzy,

881
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:11,770
they resemble a kind of dander on the skull, under the skull, kind of an interior dander.

882
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,390
Ew, dander under the skull?

883
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,830
Ew.

884
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,530
Where you can't get it with blue goose regimen.

885
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,750
It's the kind of place you never want to be.

886
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,290
It's full of flock or whatnot.

887
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,010
Not slack, indeed.

888
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,310
Of course it's not slack.

889
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:33,670
It's schlock or whatever they call that stuff that the radio planes drift into your forehead.

890
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,210
Schlock can come when you throw good money at it.

891
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,650
Oh, no.

892
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,330
Not another homily by that guy.

893
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,150
No.

894
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:47,370
In fact, I realized I better fade that down because there's one with two X's coming up right after it,

895
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,170
and I know what that means.

896
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,670
Boing, boing.

897
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,770
Yep.

898
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:51,190
Yep.

899
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,850
That means the...

900
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,930
That means I would have to...

901
00:42:54,930 --> 00:43:00,230
I'd have to have my thing on the delay dump so that nothing nasty happened.

902
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,230
You have to whack the delay dump button with your thing.

903
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,390
And once you do that, you take a lot of risks.

904
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,730
Y'all vote, our common dog.

905
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,550
Y'all vote.

906
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,530
Your digits could be consumed.

907
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,090
I like hearing that from my alter ego.

908
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:20,830
What?

909
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,810
I don't even know if that sounded like a word.

910
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,730
Hey, listen.

911
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:25,610
You don't need one.

912
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,890
Oh, that's the sound I love to hear.

913
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,730
Our fighting force is in action.

914
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,970
Yeah, it sounds like your old phone.

915
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,930
Oh, yeah.

916
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,970
Well, it's a coarse thermometer kind of feeling.

917
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:48,010
The kind of inconsequential pain we have to endure just to continue suffering.

918
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:53,990
I don't want to say it's elliptical, but it all gets back to really flabby center.

919
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:54,910
The name...

920
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,810
The evil of the universe, you might call it.

921
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:57,930
Your own...

922
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,070
Right, the flabby center does not hold.

923
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:00,490
Yeah.

924
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:00,750
Right.

925
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,670
Flabby midsection of...

926
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:06,090
And the good old UXAs we used to say in compadre land.

927
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,670
Because they sure beaten up enough of the beezers around here.

928
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,190
Righto.

929
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:23,310
So I guess I was wondering if you accept mom or if mom accepts you, can you be...

930
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,910
Do you get to go...

931
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:24,910


932
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:24,910


933
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:24,910


934
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,570
Go to the party or are you an...

935
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,250
An alien?

936
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,250
If you accept Bob, you are the party.

937
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,050
You become the party.

938
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,050
Well, I don't want to join the party.

939
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:47,990
My great uncle was a communist back in the early days and I guess that wasn't so bad.

940
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:54,450
And he said that he went to a meeting one time and they made him eat cheese dip.

941
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:57,250
Which he completely deplored.

942
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,850
And he said, from this day on, I'll never...

943
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,270
I'll never go to one of those damn communist meetings again.

944
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,470
Well, forcible cheese dip eating can do that to a person.

945
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,930
Well, I guess it's time.

946
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,490
Honey, could you come and tuck me in and tell me a little twinkle before?

947
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,810
Oh, sure, darling.

948
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,650
I can come in here.

949
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,050
Here, just lay down here.

950
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,410
Let me pull this cover up around your neck.

951
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:36,290
Oh, it feels like one of those rubber ducks.

952
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,130
The Reverend Ivan Stang is always waving at the Dob's head.

953
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,950
If it isn't one thing...

954
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,350
Is your blanket woven of pure woven ducks?

955
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:51,030
Yeah.

956
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:51,330


957
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:51,770
Yeah.

958
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,330
Yeah.

959
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:52,990
Yeah.

960
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:53,070
Yeah.

961
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:53,530
Yeah.

962
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:53,730


963
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,010
Yeah.

964
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:54,050
Yeah.

965
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,090
Yeah.

966
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:54,170
Yeah.

967
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:54,290


968
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:00,790
You have gone too far in trying to convert this man to your wicked, wicked ways.

969
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:07,490
As you can see, he has turned bright green from the lack of floral devices.

970
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,930
Also, he could use a new pavement around the derriere.

971
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,270
And it's a sweet, deplorable situation.

972
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,230
Just another derriere touch-up?

973
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,270
Huh?

974
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:19,750
Just a derriere touch-up?

975
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,850
No, no, no, not yet.

976
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,510
Because it would be too late for him.

977
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:32,850
Plus $256 to P-Box Bob contains over 40 step-by-step detailed written instructions for each box.

978
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:41,890
Bob had been blazing on their vests, the funny suits with the big shoes.

979
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:50,990
Someone called them a bunch of damn bozo clowns going around from door to door, you know,

980
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,010
talking about Bob Dobbs.

981
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,370
Hey, I'll give you, you give me a couple bucks or a sandwich and I'll kill you.

982
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,870
Or give me this brochure, this leaflet.

983
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,590
So they figured he was worse than the Mormons.

984
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,390
Mormonism.

985
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:10,330
They probably figured right.

986
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,550
And set him home.

987
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,190
Yeah.

988
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,790
And let him go out.

989
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,930
You have the right to remain silent.

990
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,850
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

991
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,970
You have the right at this time to talk to Bob.

992
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:20,690
Bob?

993
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,770
That's obscene.

994
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,970
I've never heard anything like that before in my life.

995
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,390
Haven't either.

996
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,810
I hope I get to hear something like that again sometime in the near future.

997
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,810
Especially with the big deal going through.

998
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,590
You know what I mean, honey?

999
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:41,410
I do.

1000
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,130
It's quite befuddling, isn't it?

1001
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,070
It certainly is.

1002
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,950
But in the meantime, could you squeeze my leg gently?

1003
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,830
I guess I could.

1004
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,650
Is it hurting?

1005
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,430
You need the squeezing?

1006
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:54,910
Well, it's...

1007
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,090
Some relief from pain?

1008
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,810
Yeah, well, I could always feel better, if you know what I mean.

1009
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:00,250
Sure.

1010
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:01,250
Put it right there.

1011
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:01,870
Mm-hmm.

1012
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,530
Bob, hey.

1013
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:03,990
A little bit higher.

1014
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,450
How's that?

1015
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:04,910
Okay.

1016
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:06,210
A little bit higher.

1017
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:07,350
Okay.

1018
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:08,130
Oh!

1019
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:09,450
What?

1020
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,350
What's that?

1021
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:12,630
What's that?

1022
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,330
What?

1023
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,450
Oh, it's a little...

1024
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:15,070
Does that tickle?

1025
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:15,670
...Bob's head.

1026
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,770
No, it's not a gherkin.

1027
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,770
It's a little Bob's head.

1028
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,630
Look at that witch come from.

1029
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,430
She took the potato salad.

1030
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,110
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1031
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,170
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1032
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,990
3.15 p.m.

1033
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,670
Frank and I went back to stage two.

1034
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,990
We talked to Bob and got the same story from him.

1035
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,290
Bob's fingers were taken and they matched those found on the map.

1036
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,270
At this point, there's a possibility that Bob is not a gherkin.

1037
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,070
Bob's fingers were taken by Sergeant Fireday.

1038
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,730
Did you know that Fireday was a gherkin?

1039
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:54,890
Did you know that Fireday was a gherkin?

1040
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,350
And so is his man, Saturday?

1041
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:57,990
No.

1042
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,210
His friend, Frank?

1043
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,030
No.

1044
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:00,850
I think...

1045
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:02,550
He had a big head.

1046
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:03,690
Nine.

1047
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,430
He was much bigger than me.

1048
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,210
I did not know.

1049
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,810
Yeah, you could see parts of his brain were exposed and he liked it that way.

1050
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,290
Oh, my.

1051
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,570
Yeah, he knew he'd have to come sooner or later and he would do that again.

1052
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,570
Hey, listen.

1053
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:23,850
Oh, this is Timothy Larry reminding you that just as you need slack...

1054
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,830
Bob needs your help.

1055
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,190
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

1056
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,890
A malignant cancerous growth eating at the spiritual health of the American...

1057
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,070
That was the real Tim Larry.

1058
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,910
Oh, my God.

1059
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,130
Yep, he loved us.

1060
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,390
He loved Bob.

1061
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,190
Tim did.

1062
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,830
He loved Bob almost as much as he loved LSD.

1063
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,830
What year did he pass into the great beyond or whatever you call it?

1064
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,930
I don't know.

1065
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,150
We were just reading a book by him in Are You Serious?

1066
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,610
called...

1067
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:55,090
Design for Dying.

1068
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,290
Right?

1069
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:56,710
Yes.

1070
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,150
Isn't that the name?

1071
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,070
Design for Dying.

1072
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,810
But we only got as far as reading all the information about prostate cancer and then

1073
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,010
we weren't interested in anything else.

1074
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,990
Like the dying part.

1075
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,350
We were just interested in the prostate cancer part.

1076
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,450
So as to avoid dying, if you know what I'm saying.

1077
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,330
It's easier to digest.

1078
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,210
Harder to swallow, but easier to digest, I suppose.

1079
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,030
If you like those oriental vegetables.

1080
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:24,410
Like some people do.

1081
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:30,510
But his asking for pledges gives us another chance to thank all the people who pledged money.

1082
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,390
That's true.

1083
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,310
Thank you, everyone who pledged.

1084
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:37,150
If we didn't give you a shout out before, this isn't one either.

1085
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:41,410
Because we can't remember which ones we shouted out and who and what.

1086
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,470
No, we just think all of them.

1087
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,890
Thanks, Reverend Molotov-Kovka.

1088
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,330
That's one.

1089
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:46,890
That's one.

1090
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:49,250
That we didn't shout out earlier.

1091
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,190
Dr. Doc.

1092
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,570
Dr. Doc.

1093
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,570
Probably, yeah, we mentioned Dr. Doc.

1094
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:53,830
Dr. Doc.

1095
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,510
Yeah, anyway, yeah, well, we really appreciate all that.

1096
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,070
A snout out?

1097
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:00,730
A Dr. Doc.

1098
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,650
A snout out to Dr. Doc.

1099
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:07,650
Being such a wonderful subgenius and a wonderful human being in some oblique way, once again,

1100
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,510
like the Dorsus Latimus, you know.

1101
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,230
The Dorsus Latimus?

1102
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,850
This Dorsus Latimus.

1103
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,490
Oh, yes, and there was all about the apostasy I remember now.

1104
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,610
The great apostasy.

1105
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:22,590
Yes, the great apostasy.

1106
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,170
The hell is it?

1107
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:24,590
Dumb.

1108
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:24,890
Dumb.

1109
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,950
What would you do without him?

1110
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,030
I'll tell him.

1111
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,330
You're going to tell him?

1112
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:28,590
What?

1113
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:29,850
Silent breathing.

1114
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:30,610
Bob?

1115
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,750
Oh, man, that was one by Ivan and the Bartelons.

1116
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,270
Or Ivan Switch-Noise.

1117
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,690
It was I-I-I-I-Ivan Stagg.

1118
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:42,710
I-I-I-I-Ivan Stagg.

1119
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,190
I got that from you, Dave.

1120
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:49,690
You said that on a show about a month ago, and I heard you say it, and I copied it, and

1121
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,750
he went, I-I-I-Ivan Stagg.

1122
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:52,270
We learned it from you.

1123
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:53,110
We learned it.

1124
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:54,310
From you, Dave.

1125
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,150
Yeah, it's only silly because it's translingual.

1126
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:00,970
If you were at the barbecue right now, you'd know better.

1127
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,690
You'd know that Bob is never going to help us.

1128
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,210
Yes, he will.

1129
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:13,950
He will help us if we join the Church of the Subgenius, using subgenius.com to do that.

1130
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:20,350
Oh, by the way, the collages in the background that have been burbling up were mostly by

1131
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:21,890
Fernanda Nandalee Murr.

1132
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,110
The music.

1133
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:30,910
This has all been by the Flying Ryan Brothers, who now do play out in the Chicago area, I

1134
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:31,390
understand.

1135
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,270
Those lucky Chicagoans.

1136
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,230
So, and Dr. Sinister has just slid in.

1137
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,170
Yes!

1138
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,050
At the last second.

1139
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,770
And I have a grudge against Chicago.

1140
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,750
Why?

1141
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,070
I blame Chicago for the Asian carp in Lake Erie.

1142
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:50,730
They found them here?

1143
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,630
But can you really hold that against Chicago?

1144
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:52,750
I mean, it was...

1145
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,590
I thought I...

1146
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,030
I saw one.

1147
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:54,750
Yeah.

1148
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:01,650
The sanitary canal that they have connected the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River.

1149
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,550
Two watersheds that never mixed before.

1150
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:06,930
I see.

1151
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,790
Oh, and so that's where the soylent carp are coming from?

1152
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,870
Yes, the soylent carp.

1153
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:13,410
The invasive species?

1154
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,610
The zebra mussels and the lion bones?

1155
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,190
Actually, the zebra mussels did a lot to clean up the lake.

1156
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:21,470
Really?

1157
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:22,790
Yeah.

1158
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,030
Yeah.

1159
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,190
They're...

1160
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,350
They're a shellfish, Joe.

1161
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:25,450
Yes, except for they were irradiated, but...

1162
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,270
Yeah.

1163
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:32,650
Are the zebra mussels the shells that piled up on the beach like snow?

1164
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,690
I think so.

1165
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:34,150
Yes.

1166
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:37,130
You know, white shells piled up like snow.

1167
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,050
Are they striped like zebras?

1168
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,690
Are they striped like zebras?

1169
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,190
Yes.

1170
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,150
Maybe that's where the name came from.

1171
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:46,950
Zebra mussels.

1172
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:47,570
And they're...

1173
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:48,270
Yeah, and they're strong.

1174
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,130
They're real strong.

1175
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:49,890
They...

1176
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,230
Yeah.

1177
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:53,030
They gather on our intake valves.

1178
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,890
We're going to change the name of the city to Zebra Mussel Shoals.

1179
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,030
Whoa.

1180
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,390
Sweet home, Ohio.

1181
00:53:59,610 --> 00:53:59,650
This is a good one.

1182
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,410
Hi.

1183
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,010
Hi.

1184
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,170
I hope Neil Young can remember.

1185
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,190
Ohio man doesn't need him around.

1186
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,730
No, that doesn't work at all.

1187
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,750
That just doesn't work at all.

1188
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,910
Oh, well.

1189
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:13,830
And I...

1190
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,990
And many of our friends don't work at all.

1191
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,130
And...

1192
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,230
Many of them hardly work.

1193
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,670
And many of them are consumed with work.

1194
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,110
They're such a...

1195
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,470
We're some form of...

1196
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,550
As if it were consumption.

1197
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,290
Yes.

1198
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,290
Consumed as if it were consumption.

1199
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,890
You want to hear the...

1200
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,890
You want to hear the saddest thing of all?

1201
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,070
I'm at work right now.

1202
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,850
This is actually...

1203
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,290
I'm on the job.

1204
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:43,230
Boo hoo.

1205
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:47,030
And I do not feel like giving myself a raise tonight.

1206
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,750
It's a moment of perpendicular joy.

1207
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,750
I've been working the same job...

1208
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,850
Big old fat one.

1209
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,170
...for almost seven years.

1210
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:53,630
Seven years now.

1211
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,210
And I've gotten one 50-cent-an-hour raise in the last seven years.

1212
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,190
Good God.

1213
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,910
I've been working the same job for 30-something years.

1214
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,630
And I've...

1215
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,170
I'm making less now than I ever did just about.

1216
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,710
Well, talk about universal...

1217
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,110
But at least you don't have anyone else to blame but yourself.

1218
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:11,190
We almost forgot.

1219
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,150
Slack Friday.

1220
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,530
I can't...

1221
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,970
There's some things I can't talk about on the radio.

1222
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,030
But on subgenius.com, I'm going to explain Slack Friday.

1223
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,150
Which happens this week.

1224
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:24,130
This week after the Thanksgiving.

1225
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,830
Is this a shopping-related event?

1226
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,230
Yeah.

1227
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,170
So that's why I've got to be careful about it.

1228
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:33,570
You're just vaguely hinting at the fact that people might be able to purchase things at subgenius.com.

1229
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,670
If they were so inclined.

1230
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,010
One and a half for one kind of a thing.

1231
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,110
And a certain person may or may not stand a profit from it.

1232
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,630
A fraction of the cost.

1233
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,790
Just a mere fraction.

1234
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,050
Well, you could save your loved ones.

1235
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:51,890
Whether they know you're saving them or not.

1236
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:52,850
Even if they're dead.

1237
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,010
If they've been dead for years.

1238
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:55,170
In fact...

1239
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,590
The Mormons will baptize dead people.

1240
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:04,630
Reverend Just John baptized Brigham Young and Joseph Smith in the Church of the Subgenius.

1241
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:05,410
Praise God.

1242
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,170
Posthumously.

1243
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:07,150
He actually...

1244
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:08,090
That's brilliant.

1245
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,550
He paid for it, too.

1246
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,110
That's the important thing.

1247
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,510
He actually paid for it.

1248
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,290
So, friends, are you as rich as Just John?

1249
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,690
Who, by the way, I think is still trying to get work.

1250
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:20,790
Sound familiar?

1251
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:21,350
Huh?

1252
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:21,990
Heh heh.

1253
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:22,750
Heh heh.

1254
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,490
Yeah, another guy didn't have any work.

1255
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,130
Joseph Stalin, once again.

1256
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,250
Now, wait.

1257
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,170
How did he get in there?

1258
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:32,050
We haven't bought him a posthumous Subgenius membership.

1259
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:32,770
No, sir.

1260
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:33,410
I thought you said somebody baptized him.

1261
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,010
From subgenius.com.

1262
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,470
No, that was Joseph Smith.

1263
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,050
My great, great, great uncle.

1264
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,150
Well, that was his phony name.

1265
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,790
His real name was Joseph Stalin.

1266
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:48,670
But his real name was Grigory Gorzovich Andraslavian or something like that.

1267
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,170
It wasn't even Stalin originally.

1268
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,350
It was Stalino.

1269
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:51,530
Stalino.

1270
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,670
But, you know, because of anti-Italian prejudice around the turn of the 20th century,

1271
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,390
he dropped the O off the end of his name.

1272
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,450
Turn of the 20th?

1273
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,110
How about turn of the 21st century?

1274
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,930
He was just like another great people.

1275
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,450
Anti-Italian prejudice?

1276
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,010
That happens every day somewhere.

1277
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:07,930
I've been told.

1278
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,690
Well, mainly it's just directed at Silvio Berlusconi.

1279
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:11,410
Hmm.

1280
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:12,250
Hmm.

1281
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:12,890
Yes.

1282
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,050
He had too many boners or too many times during too many.

1283
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,950
He was a very bad man.

1284
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:20,190
Well, speaking of bad people.

1285
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,330
Well, no one cares about that.

1286
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,410
I have to say, this is WCSB Cleveland.

1287
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,190
And Bob loves you.

1288
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:29,650
There.

1289
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,650
There was my cut point.

1290
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,810
I have to say, Bob loves you.

1291
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,890
When you say WCSB Cleveland, you've said it all.

1292
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,410
Wow.

1293
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:38,430
Yeah.

1294
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:41,270
He's the king of weirds.

1295
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,110
Bob is the baddest man of all.

1296
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,050
He loves you.

1297
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,910
He gloves you.

1298
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:47,610
He gloves you.

1299
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,070
My friend.

1300
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,070
He gloves you.

1301
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:49,390
Gently.

1302
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:50,170
Gently.

1303
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:51,310
Pulling back the line.

1304
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:52,550
Your cheeks and your nostrils.

1305
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:55,030
Peering deep inside.

1306
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:59,430
Snipping the excess hairs with his little tiny scissors.

1307
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,030
Cheat love and hollandaise sauce.

1308
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:06,530
Bob is a great barber who will clip even the homeless.

1309
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,470
A cosmic barber.

1310
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,910
He shaves everything down as it should be.

1311
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,790
All uniform length so that things may regrow in their proper order.

1312
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:20,590
And given the proper circumstances under the neutral positive conditions,

1313
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,570
Bob gave you a haircut down on Skid Row, didn't he, Dave?

1314
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:25,630
That one time.

1315
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:25,890
Yeah.

1316
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:31,410
I learned how to shave my head with a soup can, the top of a soup can.

1317
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,130
We did have can openers.

1318
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:38,110
And you could get them sharp enough that you could rip the shards, the fronds of your hair

1319
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,950
right off the side of your head and throw them down on the ground and say,

1320
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:46,870
I spit upon urban society and the commercialism that is rampant around us.

1321
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:50,470
And I spit upon this inferiority complex.

1322
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,750
That's a waste of spit.

1323
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:55,270
And then you say, and how come I can't get a job anywhere?

1324
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,250
I spit upon the society.

1325
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:58,850
I carve my face up.

1326
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,930
Hire me.

1327
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:08,230
I say, poo-poo on nine to five works and you quit your day job and slack off and you may die and stuff like that.

1328
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:13,030
Well, I say, that's my job in between my job as a greeter at Costco.

1329
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,430
Just don't carve up your scalp with a can, okay, man?

1330
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,910
Yes, but you've never been a grumpy old woman with a can.

1331
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:20,490
At least sharpen the can.

1332
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:20,570
Yeah.

1333
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,470
And stack up the tears around your neck.

1334
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:27,690
All day long at work, I say, welcome to Costco.

1335
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,530
I love you.

1336
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:33,230
And then at night at work, I say, welcome to Church of the Subgenius.

1337
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:33,770
I love you.

1338
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,730
Or actually, it's more like, welcome to Church of the Subgenius.

1339
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,310
I hate you.

1340
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,650
But it's said with as much feeling on either one.

1341
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,890
I really don't care in either case.

1342
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,690
This is all wish fulfillment, dear.

1343
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,230
You know?

1344
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:47,570
Yeah.

1345
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,470
It's like I retroactively guard the emotions.

1346
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:52,950
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

1347
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,950


1348
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:54,490
I smile tenderly.

1349
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:57,090
And then I go, I go, what do they look like?

1350
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:59,190
You better not stop this when you're in here.

1351
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:01,050
And I say, have a nice day.

1352
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,270
And I turn around.

1353
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,750
And I look in a real direction.

1354
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:07,950
Oh, that didn't work.

1355
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:08,890
Oh, well.

1356
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,430
Well, he didn't actually say what it sounded like you said.

1357
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:11,810
Oh.

1358
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:13,450
Oh, good.

1359
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,950
That's one of the advantages of preserving your hair.

1360
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:19,890
God, that hurt my arm to hit that delay that wasn't turned on anyway.

1361
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:20,270
Yeah.

1362
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:23,170
Isn't it great to have your itchy trigger finger on the big red button, though?

1363
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:23,830
I've never had.

1364
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,550
That's the first time I ever even reached for it.

1365
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,970
But didn't you just get a total high right there?

1366
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:30,470
Like, wasn't that like better than your first orgasm?

1367
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:33,490
No, Dr. Stimester, not at all.

1368
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,590
Partly because I have an impenis...

1369
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:35,690
You mean you don't fantasize?

1370
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,270
...shoulder rotator cuff, and it hurts to push buttons like that.

1371
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,230
It actually hurts.

1372
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,050
You mean you don't constantly fantasize about nuking everybody?

1373
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:43,630
No.

1374
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,470
I don't do that kind of show.

1375
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,130
Oh.

1376
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:49,250
Your show's about to begin, and I must fade out my show.

1377
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,150
I'm sorry.

1378
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,710
I can't identify with people who don't think like me.

1379
01:00:56,150 --> 01:01:03,470
Well, friends, enough of all of this fun.

1380
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,930
I have to fade these voices out and leave the music up.

1381
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,310
Dr. Stimester has to take over and do his show.

1382
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,330
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1383
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:16,690
Friends.

1384
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:24,350
We're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have

1385
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,010
donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1386
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:33,010
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1387
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:40,990
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1388
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:46,490
go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog.

1389
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:50,950
And help out financially as best you can.

1390
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:57,310
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1391
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,950
to make their own situations worse.

1392
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,890
But some of you still have jobs.

1393
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:08,750
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1394
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,230
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1395
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,110
All we're saying is that glow jobs.

1396
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,010
You could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1397
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:25,470
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1398
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,190
P.O.

1399
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:37,950
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1400
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:43,150
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
