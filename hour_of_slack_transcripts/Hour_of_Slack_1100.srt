1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm Upside Down.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,800
The government says Bob increased slightly last month.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,960
The good news, corrections officials in California have disclosed a new protocol for executing Bob.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,500
The plan calls for the careful selection of a team to administer lethal injections to Bob.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,800
State officials hope the new plan meets with Bob's approval and he allows executions to resume.

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,560
On Wall Street, 5-4-3-5-9.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,780
The good news, PR is down 25% from the level it set a year ago.

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,820
PR's bad. This is PR.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,560
The voice you hear is a voice of a half-alive poet trying to sell you a world of his own.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,020
And so it is that we are proud to welcome to our show tonight...

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,300
The Self-Genius Power of Self-Work.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,960
This man is speaking to you now. So listen, it might be important.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,340
But Daddy, I can't do that.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:54,980
What?

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,760
But Daddy, please, Daddy.

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,160
It won't do you any good to scream.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,820
Gee, Daddy, please don't make me...

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,140
Well then, go watch comic books or something.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,560
All right, but I'm gonna have mommy to eat.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,400
All right, dear.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,700
The story of man.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,600
Specimen for scientists to take apart piece by piece, to study, to analyze.

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,840
Call it...

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
Why shouldn't I call it a book dangle? Why? There have to be so many different words.

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,500
Words, words, words!

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm the Mad Hatter.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,040
We're going to free all the people enslaved.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,640
You may join our conspiracy.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,660
Go on. Go on!

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,220
What are you doing?

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,920
When the civilization began to spread over the Earth, they were learning so much.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,220
Oh, baby babbling is very important.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,620
Very well put, but hardly scientific.

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,620
For a long time, scientists have been curious.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,380
Buh, buh, buh.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,940
Eeeeee.

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,600
Ooooooo.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,380
Hmm.

39
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,800
Eh, eee, zzz, eh, er.

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,280
Ah, eee, zzz, eh, er.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,580
Never kill a snake with your bare hands.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm beginning to feel it.

43
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,700
Immortality.

44
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,260
Through entertainment.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,820
Rhythm abnormality.

46
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,820
Oh, well.

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,680
Rhythm abnormality.

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,640
Uh, Reverend.

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,180
Oh, well.

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,560
Rhythm abnormality.

51
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,400
Oh, well.

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,600
Became the politician.

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
Think, think, think, think.

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,980
Hustler Magazine.

55
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,240
Should be protected.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,060
We should abandon the Judeo-Christian heritage.

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,140
Oh, well.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,940
Oh, well.

59
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,340
Oh, well.

60
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,840
Oh, well.

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,440
Oh, well, well.

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,240
We should not abandon gay marriage, abortion.

63
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,980
We have a, we have a rhythm abnormality.

64
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,720
Oh, well, well, well.

65
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,460
Mold, mold, mold, mold.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,000
Jerry.

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,400
Think Teletubbies.

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,140
Think, think.

69
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,460
Jerry.

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,500
Was gay.

71
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,140
Think, think.

72
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,260
History of problems.

73
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,100
An incestuous drunkard.

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,760
Jerry.

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,740
Oh, well, oh, well.

76
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,020
Jerry.

77
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,240
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.

78
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,500
Jerry.

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh, well, oh, well.

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,560
Think, think, think, think, think.

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,380
Oh, well, oh, well.

82
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,480
Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well, to make a point.

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,000
Jerry.

84
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,480
Jerry.

85
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,180
Oh, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, reverend.

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,760
Well, well.

87
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,240
It's time now for the old time.

88
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:10,820
Jerry.

89
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,300
Jerry.

90
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:11,800
Jerry.

91
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,360
An incestuous drunkard.

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Oh, well.

93
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:14,540
OLD.

94
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:14,760
OLD.

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,320
feminist.

96
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,220
gays.

97
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,920
Lesbians.

98
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,500
Jerry.

99
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,020
Jerry.

100
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,420
Jerry, Jerry, Genie, Genie. He was sold.

101
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,380
Bush is primed and ready for failure.

102
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,140
Bush said, Bush said, and now it is time for fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.

103
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,700
Chaos. Deaths follow the war. Sets the stage for a fresh round of deaths.

104
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,900
Chaos. U.S. deaths follow failure. Death. Failure. Death. Failure. Death. Failure. Death. Failure. Death. Deaths. Mission accomplished.

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,520
The conspiracy of the normal people, by the way, is what we're talking about.

106
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:54,280
I should clarify that. A lot of folks, when we say conspiracy, you start thinking along the lines of standard conspiracy theorists.

107
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,180
You know, oh, you mean the guys that really pulled off the 9-11 thing.

108
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,020
Oh, you mean the crashed saucers at Groom Lake.

109
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh, you mean the Kennedy assassination guys.

110
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Well, sure, those are all wonderful little conspiracies, but they are dwarfed by the uber conspiracy of conspiracy.

111
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:22,060
The garden variety average ordinary human beings, which may even include some of us.

112
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,760
Don't, don't be too ashamed. You know, we can't all have the blood of the Yeti, full-blood Yeti coursing through us.

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,980
George Bush is in the studio with me, and I'll be talking with him next.

114
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,700
Recreation of a 19th century world.

115
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,580
For you.

116
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,340
14-inch 69 cuts wood get cut fire fire force of a sledgehammer.

117
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,160
Blackhawk, Blackhawk, this comes first.

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,460
Good evening, George Bush.

119
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,260
Mr. Bush landed a short time ago.

120
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,620
He has no brain waves.

121
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,420
Thank you for stopping.

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
You see, what I think has happened is that I failed.

123
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,440
Unemployment, inflation, trying to attack our economic program.

124
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,240
And I've got to trying to attack our economic program.

125
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,660
And I've got to cutting, stimulating and do this.

126
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Desperate.

127
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,120
Failed the working man in this country.

128
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,880
I don't think, I don't think, I don't think raid come out soon.

129
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,500
I hope.

130
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,680
Who cloaks Klan?

131
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,560
Number two.

132
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,520
Can you see?

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,100
See totalitarian government.

134
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,940
Felony conviction.

135
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,980
No brain waves.

136
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,540
Some fun.

137
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,180
Check, check.

138
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,960
The weather's next.

139
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,300
Keep the umbrellas handy.

140
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Weather's next.

141
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,840
50, 50.

142
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,360
Steady now.

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,400
72%.

144
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
Three, zero.

145
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,300
And that's not bad.

146
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
12 inches of hello, ho, ho.

147
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,300
Way up.

148
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,080
Another gloomy one.

149
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,360
An emotional moment Monday.

150
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,700
President Bush.

151
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,820
He broke, broke, he broke, broke down, down.

152
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,480
An emotional moment Monday.

153
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,820
Monday.

154
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,700
President Bush.

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,540
He broke.

156
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,960
He broke.

157
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,280
Broke.

158
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,520
Broke.

159
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,620
Broke.

160
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,820
Broke.

161
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,140
Broke.

162
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,360
Broke.

163
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,020
Broke.

164
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,120
Broke.

165
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


166
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


167
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


168
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


169
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


170
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


171
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,120


172
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,840
True measure of a man, man, man.

173
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,580
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya.

174
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Annal, annal victory.

175
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,800
kwik, kwik.

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,880
De-fit, de-fit.

177
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,500
Kwik, kwik.

178
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,980
Re-hit, re-hit.

179
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,180
Ha.

180
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,940
Sure measure of a man.

181
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
Hi-ya, hi-ya.

182
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,640
Interest rates and inflation.

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,020
Interest rates and inflation.

184
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,020
Why would we want to return to where we were less than four short years ago?

185
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,680
Sure measure of a man.

186
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,520
De-fit, de-fit.

187
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,180
De-fit.

188
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,160
I could dance.

189
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,160
An emotional moment Monday.

190
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,000
Wave of panic through Washington.

191
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,740
It's a fun one.

192
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,400
It's a fun one.

193
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,060
It's a fun one.

194
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,460
It's a fun one.

195
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,780
Wow.

196
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,500
Wow.

197
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,220
Wow.

198
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,700
Wow.

199
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,140
Wow.

200
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,480
The titillation of the who's who's list.

201
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
Disturbing genesis.

202
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Confounding evolution.

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,500
Are we going to see more?

204
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,940
There was something illegal.

205
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,320
There was something illegal.

206
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
There are lonely people in this world.

207
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,380
Smear them.

208
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Smear them.

209
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,900
Disturbing genesis.

210
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,640
Confounding evolution.

211
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,460
The titillation of the who's who's list.

212
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,320
Wow.

213
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,620
Wow.

214
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
You're talking to brainwashed people.

215
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,640
Today's distraction from all the real problems in the world.

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
It's Reverend Ivan, Dr. Stanko.

217
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,660
Stanko.

218
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,460
Our 12.

219
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,720
And not too close to the witching end.

220
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,120
Soon we'll all be blossoming in hell.

221
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,180
Eyes parted with little needles stuck into our skulls.

222
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,200
Twisting the right parts of our brains.

223
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,020
Putting us in the kind of shape we need to get put into.

224
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
Because our bodies are going to change, aren't they, Stanko?

225
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,380
We're going to change and become greater.

226
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,220
Stronger.

227
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,180
Hairier.

228
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,120
More.

229
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,120


230
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,120


231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,120


232
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,320
More manful.

233
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,080
And that's just the girls I'm talking about.

234
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,820
And here comes one now.

235
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,160
Ah, she is indeed hairy.

236
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,320
Look at those armpits.

237
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,380
Wait, don't look at them.

238
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,300
Wait, don't...

239
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,940
That tickles.

240
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,480
Stop it.

241
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,820
Any perceptual gloss of these armpits will cause immediate pierogi damage in the brain or other organ.

242
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,240
Is this a real island we're stuck on or are we just stuck on our own gummy sheets?

243
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,000
No.

244
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,160
It's the island of misfit toys, Prince Dave.

245
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,500
But what if the exards come and let us off the island of retarded toys?

246
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,780
No, no, no.

247
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,800
We're the misfit toys.

248
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,540
Oh, okay.

249
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,860
We are the...

250
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,640
Think about it, Dave.

251
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah.

252
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,200
Right.

253
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,680
Well, no, I got that at first.

254
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,080
I did.

255
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
I understood that.

256
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,260
It seems like Princess Wee's mic is always light and little.

257
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,380
What is with that?

258
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,420
I don't know.

259
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,740
Mine was too, but I...

260
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,600
But I jumped right on it like a pig.

261
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah, you hit me.

262
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm on it.

263
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,180
I'm on it.

264
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,960
I have no control over...

265
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Those two, both are like Siamese twins that go into the same pot.

266
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,200
Wouldn't you say they're more like your misshapen third leg which you brandish at the little kids in the street?

267
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,000
That's the sad...

268
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,520
Another one of those warnings you got from the local authorians?

269
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,640
That's what's so sad about it.

270
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,160
That's why the police are after us all the time.

271
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,460
Why there's a conspiracy of normal people.

272
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,500
People always after us because of what we are.

273
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,220
Sometimes good normals hide us in the basement when the conspiracy guys storm troop on by.

274
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah.

275
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,980
Give us bread and donuts or water, something.

276
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Some nice people have a special subgenius hiding spot in their house where you hide your subgeniuses in there.

277
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,900
We even hear the...

278
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,280
The trapdoor things and so forth.

279
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,000
If we ride the underground railway...

280
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:08,960
Right.

281
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,940
We might actually get off this planet.

282
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:19,960
But then there's other rumors going around that somebody has a whole lot of weapons concealed in some basement somewhere and we're all going to grab them at once and go and smack the masters.

283
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,660
We don't know.

284
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,300
We just don't know.

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:38,040
We don't know whether we're going to have to stay on the planet and then be suppressed and persecuted and prosecuted and executed and or whether we will escape as Bob promised.

286
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,660
Whether we...

287
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,840
We know that we will eventually.

288
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,540
Well, Bob...

289
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,740
Bob breaks his promises.

290
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,000
Frequently, in fact.

291
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,020
But X is the reason why, isn't it?

292
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,900
Well, he always lies and he's always right, was the way he put it.

293
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,440
But then, you know, he did say he always lied.

294
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,340
He was a drunk.

295
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,360
That's why he said that.

296
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,560
That's what drunks say.

297
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,380
They believe everything about their...

298
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,660
They believe their own press kits, as they used to say.

299
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,240
I...

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Really?

301
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,460
I think.

302
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm not sure, but...

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
No wonder I had so many...

304
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,640


305
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,640


306
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,640


307
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,840
I had so much fun when I was a drunk.

308
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,100
I think I'm going to go back to being a drunk again.

309
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,700
Even though...

310
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,440
I believed in myself.

311
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,800
Even though I was a failure.

312
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,820
Yeah, I was all wrong, but...

313
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,620
I believed the lies that I told myself.

314
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,060
Now I tell myself the truth and I believe it and it's just depressing.

315
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,980
It is depressing now.

316
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,660
When we think about the equipment we could have used back in the early days.

317
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,820
You know, the self-sprouting genetic material that we can just charge up like the way...

318
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,140
Like when Princess Wee snaps her fingers and another mutation grows.

319
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah.

320
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,600
I'd like to be able to do that myself and I'm hoping I can.

321
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,680
Like we used to.

322
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,060
Yeah.

323
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,940
You think you're going to get younger, Dave?

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,740
No, I think it's like this.

325
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,380
It's the same as the secret powers.

326
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,740
It's a lost art that's going to dwindle and diminish and atrophy as I continue to atrophy.

327
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,320
And like all things, it'll go the way of Mother Westwind or fade to black, you know?

328
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,200
But are we bringing hope to the listeners or are we just bringing them down?

329
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,460
Both.

330
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,300
Like you said.

331
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,920
It's like we...

332
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,120
It's Bob's pro...

333
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,040
Because the hope doesn't mean anything if it's a lie, I guess.

334
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,620
You have to know the truth first and then the hope means something.

335
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,260
The hope that you won't die too painfully.

336
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,160
The will to recreate, the will to live over and over when there is no will to live left.

337
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,280
Speaking of will to live, in the background, the music here is from Dr. Onan Canobite.

338
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,040
Something called Not Different But Better.

339
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,740
What is it called?

340
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,940
Not Different But Better, I think.

341
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,060
And before that, of course, the cut-ups and things that we heard were by...

342
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,080
Actually, I think they were all by Reverend Norell Preff.

343
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,660
And there's so much more of that and also music at norellpreff.com.

344
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,340
What there's not more of there is the Fernand and Andy Lee Murr collage.

345
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,340


346
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,280
Oh.

347
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


348
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


349
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


350
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


351
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


352
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


353
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


354
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


355
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


356
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


357
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,280


358
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,140
Begin every hour of slack.

359
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,920
So wholly.

360
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,920
Oh, yes.

361
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,220
Oh, yes.

362
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,720
Let us rise up.

363
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,820
With a reverent dive and stand.

364
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,080
Let us erect our minds.

365
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,760
To a higher plane.

366
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,960
Of slack.

367
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,200
And rock, baby, rock.

368
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,780
Yes, yes.

369
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,900
Bob's a swinging god.

370
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,180
This is the church.

371
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,080
This is the subgenius.

372
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,180
We worship this guy named Bob.

373
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,060
J.R. Bob Dunn.

374
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,000
The slickest, smoothest, personal savior you ever saw.

375
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,900
The James Bond of religious leaders.

376
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,100
Actually, I think he's the Doc Savage of holy men.

377
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:06,120
I think as I grew to become a larger individual, I discovered Bob and it worked out for me just...

378
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,740
Wow.

379
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:16,120
These and many other testaments brought to you in vast approach by the following concerned authors for decency.

380
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,300
The Reverend O'Rarian Stinks.

381
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,080
That's me.

382
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,800
Clarice Hungadunga.

383
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,560
That's me.

384
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,860
And Marshall Spax as the interpreter.

385
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,180
C'est moi.

386
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,380
Whoa.

387
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,020
It's quite a crew tonight.

388
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Yes, kids, it's...

389
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,360
It's me.

390
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,800
And you're in for a big, big show.

391
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,940
Oh, yeah.

392
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,340
We guess.

393
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,900
Because we don't actually have any idea what kind of a show you're in for.

394
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,900
We're just hoping and guessing.

395
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,360
Because that's what this is all about.

396
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,780
The guesswork of hope.

397
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,180
And those are the hopefulness of guesswork.

398
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,260
The fact that because the angels won't let us know for sure if there's an afterlife or not,

399
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,860
that's why we don't go jump off a bridge right now since the bills are stacking up.

400
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,560
Well, that and the hot pastrami sandwich.

401
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,580
That and the hot pastrami sandwich.

402
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,800
I'll buy that.

403
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,440
For a dollar.

404
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,260
Oh, friend.

405
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,400
Dear friend.

406
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,500
And this uplifting music in the background is from the Kirkendall void.

407
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,300
From their new album, Stung.

408
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,420
No relation.

409
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,980
And they're from right around here.

410
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,540
Are they?

411
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,420
Oh, yes, of course.

412
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,960
I'd love to get them to X Day sometime.

413
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,300
We'd probably have to pay them, though.

414
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,280
And that's always been a problem with X Day.

415
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,040
Well, if you listen carefully,

416
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Kirkendall void might actually be like one half of a person.

417
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,580
No, actually.

418
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,920
I think it's one person and four half persons.

419
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,760
An avoided executioner.

420
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,500
No, there's actually four halflings in this?

421
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah.

422
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:54,840
Oh, well.

423
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,020
That accounts for something.

424
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,140
Four full halflings along with the fulllings.

425
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,580
That's a far thing.

426
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,180
Princess, I can't hear you in it, so I don't know if it's because I'm deaf.

427
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,760
I can't hear you either.

428
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,240
I can't hear you at all.

429
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:06,460
I can't hear you at all.

430
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,440
That means you have to yell in that microphone.

431
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,580
I'm yelling as much as I can, though.

432
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,380
That's better.

433
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,380
You weren't yelling that loud before.

434
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,440
Is that true?

435
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,620
What you could do is trade with Dave.

436
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,800
No, that's my button there.

437
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Don't you touch my button.

438
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,260
This is...

439
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,280
I can do that.

440
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,660
Dave.

441
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,780
Oh, yeah.

442
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,300
Now, that's much louder.

443
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,640
But then when Dave gets on, you see...

444
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:26,900
See?

445
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,160
Oh, we're all loud.

446
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,920
There's something weird about these microphones, Stemple.

447
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,840
Why don't you come over here?

448
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,280
Why don't we all go in...

449
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,840
That's not the only thing that's weird.

450
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,240
That's...

451
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,300
Now, let's...

452
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,160
See, now I'm off.

453
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,780
Yeah, see, now Dave's off.

454
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,380
Dave's mind is off.

455
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,160
Oh, man.

456
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,020
And Princess Weave.

457
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,740
But Princess Weave sounds so pretty.

458
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,100
That is totally unfair.

459
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,360
Hey, while we have you on the good mic,

460
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,300
why don't you read the new food fatwa,

461
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,480
Sifu Sodi posted after, I guess,

462
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,560
doing some in-depth research into the religious...

463
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
What is it called?

464
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,340
You go ahead.

465
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,720
It is the People's Committee for Good Taste Issues

466
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,880
Food Fatwas.

467
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,320
Number one, ketchup shall never be used on hot dogs.

468
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,200
Number two, pineapple is an abomination unto pizza.

469
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,100
Number three, there are no edible substances

470
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,060
known as cheese food product.

471
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,320
Number four, likewise, the particulate matter

472
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,580
known as bake-o-bits.

473
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,120
Number five, mayonnaise shall not be spread.

474
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,400
Upon fine Italian preserved meats.

475
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,380
And Princess Weave adds, nor corned beef.

476
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,720
Number six, alcohol is not a food group.

477
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,120
Number seven, fat-free half-and-half is self-contradictory.

478
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,780
It shall be known as fluid.

479
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,320
Thank you, Princess Weave, Ardo, and Sifu Sodi.

480
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,220
That's pretty serious.

481
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,860
We don't have rules there.

482
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,900
We don't normally have rules in the Church of the Subgenius.

483
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
And of course, they are made to be shattered.

484
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,120
There's no rules.

485
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,640
Ignored and totally disavoid.

486
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,540
But why must we have rules to begin with?

487
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,440
I hate to pose a question like that.

488
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,200
I know it's a stupid question to pose.

489
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,480
It sets you to glib and continue to follow.

490
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:35,100
But what is the purpose of regulating others' behaviors, thoughts, actions, and so forth?

491
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,100


492
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,100


493
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,960
What? I mean...

494
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,540
Oh, never mind.

495
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,840
That's a dumb question.

496
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,300
Yeah, it is.

497
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,820
Princess Weave, would you care to demonstrate to...

498
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,900
No, that means she's going to kick me in the blue area.

499
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,340
Right.

500
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
No, that's not...

501
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,660
She can go ahead and...

502
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,820
Dave's all blue down there.

503
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,940
Because he lies.

504
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,040
And he lies, he turns blue.

505
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
That's new comeback hip talk on the...

506
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,680
...Dave's Blue member.

507
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,080
You should move that mic over to right next to Dave's mic.

508
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,080
And that'll trick you into using Dave's mic.

509
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't know how can I do that?

510
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,160
Why is this mic almost evenly dead?

511
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,620
Like this?

512
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,260
There you go.

513
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,080
Now both of you make...

514
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,300
Both of you use both of these mics and be nice and, you know, try...

515
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,040
We have to mic well and nice together?

516
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,180
Nice works, yup.

517
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,000
God almighty.

518
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
We have to mic well together.

519
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,140
Tarzan's radio station.

520
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,640
I think staying just doesn't know how to...

521
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,420
No, this is very uncomfortable, especially since we're both females.

522
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,660
Oh, God.

523
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
Oh, oh.

524
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm alluding to the fact that we're having a lot of fun.

525
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,080


526
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,840
I think we should use one microphone, I mean two microphones as one, intertwined in some sort of a...

527
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,040
It's like Twisted, man.

528
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,800
It works for me.

529
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,860
Really?

530
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,500
Are you like able to hear me now?

531
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,320
Can you hear me now?

532
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,420
And then talk a lot and stuff.

533
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,280
See, it's nearly impossible.

534
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,560
Oh, because you have to bend down.

535
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,440
And she has to stand on two toes.

536
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,880
It's impossible like this.

537
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
You see, friends, Princess Wee is only...

538
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:01,780
How could you not understand...

539
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,840
She's very wee.

540
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,580
She's only about three feet tall.

541
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,940
Dave is like six, nine.

542
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,780
More like three inches.

543
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,140
Now can you hear me?

544
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,340
Yeah, that's good.

545
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,740
I like the way you use that ladder.

546
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,920
It's the ladder of my toes.

547
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,500
No, now I can.

548
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,300
Because my mic is dead.

549
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,460
It only works like this.

550
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,880
Let's not subject the listeners to that.

551
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,500
Let's subject them to this.

552
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,940
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.

553
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,180
Welcome.

554
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,500
This morning I have the honor of signing a breast.

555
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,820
This breast authorizes the National Breast Detection Act.

556
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,740
I want to touch this breast.

557
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,420
I appreciate you all coming down to witness the signing.

558
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,340
Jenna Welch was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of eight.

559
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,460
She is a fortunate person.

560
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,020
I want to thank the Pink Campaign.

561
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,260
I'm a fortunate person about to wear pink.

562
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,800
And we are thankful for that.

563
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,220
Pink.

564
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,300
Pink.

565
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,380


566
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,180
Pink.

567
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,200
Pink.

568
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,260
Pink.

569
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,320


570
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:58,420


571
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,460
Pink.

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,520
Pink.

573
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:01,920
Pink.

574
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,800
Pink.

575
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:02,800


576
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:03,800
Pink.

577
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


578
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


579
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


580
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


581
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


582
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


583
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


584
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


585
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,360


586
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,540
I look good.

587
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,600
I look good.

588
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,460
Um.

589
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,600
And yes!

590
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,240
I need...

591
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,800
ills.

592
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:11,960
I look good.

593
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,740
I look good.

594
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,520
Yeah, you look good!

595
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:13,520


596
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,820
I was wearing pink, IH.

597
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,320
Uhm.

598
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,840
I can't do this.

599
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
And the TV.

600
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,400
effective program. Since its creation, the program has touched nearly seven pink breasts.

601
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,300
We expect 90 percent will continue to life-saving work.

602
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,280
In the span of my administration, we have spent, along with Congress, $6.7. I appreciate

603
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:50,080
dollars. A budget for 2008 includes another $7, a chance to spread breast activities,

604
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,780
detect the breasts, beat them. Again, I want to thank the members for their hard pink members,

605
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,500
and it is now my honor to sign the National Breast Detection Program Reauthorization.

606
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,820
Thank you all for coming.

607
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,120
Thank you.

608
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:24,800
Brother Godwin, I am with child, not Edmonds. The child is that of the Viking, Ragnar.

609
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,940
I suppose you've all seen newsreel and newspaper pictures of a little curly-headed boy who wears

610
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,680
steel braces on his legs and a jolly smile on his bright face.

611
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,900
Throw some water on him.

612
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,260
Well, that little fellow is a sneak thief and strikes suddenly without warning.

613
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,580
Sneaky little rabbit.

614
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,160
And when he doesn't succeed in taking his victim's life, he usually robs like normal

615
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,780
children do.

616
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,600
I like work my razor fast, but light and easy.

617
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,760
I like work my razor fast, but light and easy.

618
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:55,760


619
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,040
And we've got to do our share in the war against curly-headed boys.

620
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,340
And the most important thing you and I can do is to lend financial support to the organization

621
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,840
that makes it possible for science to develop weapons against the normal children

622
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,140
by making contributions to the

623
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,800
So Genius Power of Swag.

624
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,060
Tomorrow, before you leave for school, take what you get from your parents

625
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,740
and turn it into your local office of the campaign in your city.

626
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,740
Don't forget, it's for your own protection.

627
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,200
Yeah.

628
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,140
Rush Limbaugh is irrelevant.

629
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,960
Chum, chum, rush, rush.

630
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,700
Irrelevant.

631
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,720
It was a shot, it was a shot.

632
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,480
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

633
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,620
Loaded, loaded, loaded.

634
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,520
It's a dacus.

635
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,420
It's a dacus.

636
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,360
Yep, yep.

637
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,040
Irrelevant.

638
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,880
Limbaugh's power has always been a myth.

639
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:48,940
Closet.

640
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,500
Yeah.

641
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:49,980
Dacus.

642
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,160
It's, it's.

643
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,980
I happen to be a...

644
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,520
Irrelevant.

645
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,560
Rush Limbaugh is an elephant.

646
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,960
He's also a form of dental disease in parts of Eurasia.

647
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,740
Or neural prep.

648
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,460
This is not a public forum.

649
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,240
This is just a stupid radio show.

650
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,620
There's nobody really listening.

651
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
This is college radio.

652
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,220
Independent radio.

653
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:27,480
Well, no.

654
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,000
Internet radio.

655
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,520
It's everything but...

656
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,080
I just can't.

657
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,020
You know, if this was real radio, there'd be real commercials.

658
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,300
Not public service announcements.

659
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:46,840
If this was real radio, we'd be playing the latest logo bands, you know, and flop-drop tunes of the coolest new thing.

660
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,960
The new happening logo bands.

661
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,740
Like the Kirkendall Void.

662
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,400
Heard in the background.

663
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,340
But instead, we can only play unreleased material like the Kirkendall Void.

664
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,060
Heard in the background.

665
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,180
Yeah, man.

666
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,840
Although I think this is a Link Wray song.

667
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,260
Yeah, this is Sloughter on what you call it?

668
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,560
Rumble.

669
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,600
Rumble? Oh, it was very similar to Sloughter on...

670
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,520
I like going into the Kirkendall Void.

671
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,720
You've been accepted.

672
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,400
Please take a seat near the window marked X.

673
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,040
Place your hand on the fondulator.

674
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,400
There you go.

675
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,900
Now, peer directly at your feet.

676
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,060
Within five seconds, you will be elevated and recumbrated.

677
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,800
Stand clear of the snack doors.

678
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,140
Snacks will be served soon.

679
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,220
Mmm, snacks.

680
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,380
Brains.

681
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,520
I have a Kirkendall Void song that is queued up next.

682
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,140
That's about what Princess Wee and I...

683
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,920
refer to as Loshon Hara, which I think is a Hebrew term.

684
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,120
Yes.

685
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,840
Sort of for gossip.

686
00:25:59,640 --> 00:25:59,980
Yes.

687
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,740
Gossip is akin to using your words coming out of your mouth as bullets.

688
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,520
Right, so when you turn your mouth into a machine gun to shoot people down by talking bad about them.

689
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,760
Because, yes, if you say something bad about a person, it could defame them and ruin their character.

690
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,000
And it could take their life.

691
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,460
Is it okay to say bad things about President Bush, though?

692
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,460
We wonder about this stuff.

693
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,740
This is a chronic ailment.

694
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,460
A malaise that's taken over the entire country.

695
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,580
Is it right?

696
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,140
Does it hurt my body?

697
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,060
Am I doing the right thing by wishing Mr. Bush would jump out of some convenient windows nearby?

698
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,960
Will sticks and stones break his bones, or is it only words that are allowed to hurt?

699
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,900
Well, in the old yoga principles, they are saying what is coming out of your mouth could be very well what is coming out from the other side.

700
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,620
From up and over.

701
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,600
Well, and it almost always is.

702
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,200
Aetheric bevel.

703
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,840
If it's humans talking, then it probably is a bunch of garbage.

704
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,000
And it's probably self-inflicted torchoir.

705
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,360
Filthy slobos.

706
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,400
Slobos.

707
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,800
Slobos with two N's or three Z's?

708
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,180
Or, no, S-L-O-B-O.

709
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,360
No, that'd be slobos.

710
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,360
Isn't it slobos?

711
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,380
No, I said slobos. Filthy slobos coming from your filthy penis.

712
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,140
That's salvos, like you're thinking of machine guns firing out into the distant winds.

713
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,240
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

714
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,760
It's okay, Dave.

715
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,860
Okay, I'm sorry.

716
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,300
I was talking clockwork orange talk, because I got stuck in that.

717
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,900
Oh, slobos.

718
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,600
Like the vodkas.

719
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,440
Gaurav eating their filthy slobos out of their filthy rots.

720
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Their big rots blabbering away.

721
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,380
Yes.

722
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,380
They're gobs.

723
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,600
But that's all, too.

724
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,060
But the vodkas is Russian.

725
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,540
And so is...

726
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,260
Here.

727
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,280
Ha!

728
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:04,560
Did you know that Burgess was not only a highly sexed animal, he was originally a BBC writer.

729
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,820
Anthony Burgess, the author of Clockwork Orange?

730
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,100
Yeah.

731
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,640
He was not a professional author until after that successfulness.

732
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,880
He was a writer of strange background music for BBC.

733
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,880
And that's the truth.

734
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,480
As far as I remember.

735
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,480
I had heard that he was just some English...

736
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,520
Now, this is all just stuff I heard.

737
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,180
I haven't looked it up on Wikipedia or anything.

738
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,460
Just some dude down at the...

739
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,660
I heard he was just some English teacher dude who always wanted to write a novel.

740
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,380
But then one day some young droogies came in and beat the hell out of him and almost killed him and his wife.

741
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,280
And when he got...

742
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,220
Oh, no, no.

743
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,780
It wasn't that.

744
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,780
It was that he got...

745
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,100
He was told he was gonna die of cancer or he was gonna die of something.

746
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,880
So he wrote two or three novels real fast.

747
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,860
And then they said,

748
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,420
Oh, sorry, we were wrong.

749
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,400
You're not really gonna die.

750
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,260
And he couldn't think...

751
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,280
And he went,

752
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,480
Ah, but I must keep writing.

753
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
Good old Tony Burgess.

754
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,060
Yes, I remember frolicking with him down at the Bohemian Grove.

755
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,340
He was just a kid then.

756
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,520
He was one of the tapped?

757
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,340
Oh, we were all into that.

758
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,940
You know, I got...

759
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,900
It got old for me.

760
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,880
I got tired of that.

761
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,700
So what was the next step for you?

762
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,500
All about Satanic Masonics.

763
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,740
Oh, I thought you meant...

764
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,440
Well, I've been at the top.

765
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,120
You know, I had actually run the conspiracy for a while.

766
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,620
They let everybody in the club run it for 15 minutes or so.

767
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,760
Okay, your turn.

768
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,100
You're running the whole world now.

769
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
They're all drunk and you see...

770
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,120
Basically, you can...

771
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,420
During that time, you could start a world war if you wanted to.

772
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,840
But, you know, one of the other guys would be sure to kick your butt afterwards.

773
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,460
Kind of broke some precedents, didn't he?

774
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,140
The old precedent.

775
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,680
Because even in the yoga sandals, they say that, you know, certain gods are...

776
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,380
That gods are elected to these...

777
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,940
These high offices until the point they achieve absolute, you know, whatever.

778
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,620
Here's one of the gods playing in the background.

779
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,660
Yeah.

780
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,220
That's Reverend Angry Larry, the god of DNA.

781
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,820
Oh, of Gorgon.

782
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,360
I remember when he snapped.

783
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,020
The first time.

784
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,680
Well, not...

785
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
I remember...

786
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,240
I think it was the 15th time he snapped.

787
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,260
Remember that?

788
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,220
No.

789
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,560
They all merged together in my mind.

790
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,760
He's so angry.

791
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,560
The rings are...

792
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:13,960
You can tell.

793
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,900
He gets...

794
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,460
He works it out on stage, though.

795
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,920
It's not like a drain of venom on me.

796
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,820
This is from X day.

797
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,720
This is from last...

798
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,980
Two X days ago, I think.

799
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Or maybe last X day.

800
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,900
Burn it, Angry Larry.

801
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,260
Burn it.

802
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,340
Well, he's kind of in a holding pattern now, probably waiting for...

803
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,320
Well, that last lick there, I remember was one of the...

804
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,840
I think it was the third time he snapped.

805
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,740
For all I know, this is Dave.

806
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,280
Dave playing.

807
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,140
No.

808
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,280
Well, it could be.

809
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,680
Is this two X days ago?

810
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,160
Is this a jam last X day?

811
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,260
Last X day, I think.

812
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,240
Oh, it might be me.

813
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,380
No, that's not a little too frantic.

814
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,060
They're all going...

815
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,120
Once you go...

816
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,200
You're not well-differentiated from the other musicians.

817
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,480
It's called 1-4-5, and it means you smell badly.

818
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,140
Oh, the other musicians.

819
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,140


820
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,140


821
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,140


822
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,480
Oh, my God!

823
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,720
You're all doing the same thing.

824
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:14,720


825
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:14,720


826
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:14,720


827
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,240
This is actually an Amish hymn.

828
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,360
It is.

829
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,680
If they used it with the octagordion or whatever those little small boxes that sound like an accordion,

830
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,300
like a concertina or something like that.

831
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,840
Have you ever heard of the psaltery?

832
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
P.S. you know it's like psaltery.

833
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:41,180
And they play the psaltery and that's like an electric psaltery.

834
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,200
And the Amish invented the boogie you're saying?

835
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,680
No, they invented the electric psaltery.

836
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,580
Which is their, you know, congregational, convocational music.

837
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,160
It's played on this.

838
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Ah, Tavachkos.

839
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,260
Das Vidania.

840
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,680
Spasibo.

841
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,700
Those are from your old country, Dave.

842
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,160
Those are DeLukians.

843
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,460
Ah, Italiani.

844
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,060
Devo ascoltare.

845
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,540
Devo ascoltare.

846
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,620
Chi è?

847
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,880
Chi è?

848
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,040
Cosa?

849
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,100
Chi è Giudice?

850
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,380
Giudice.

851
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,240
Giudice.

852
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,940
Giudice?

853
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,740
Che è il Cina?

854
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,060
Otto e mezzo, no?

855
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
Is this eight and a half?

856
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,940
No, it's The Clowns.

857
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,620
The Clowns from eight and a half?

858
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,340
The Clowns by Federico Fellini.

859
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,520
I love this movie.

860
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,460
He's the crazy movie director.

861
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,740
I didn't see The Clowns.

862
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,320
Dave, you weren't meant to see The Clowns.

863
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,300
They were hiding from you.

864
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,660
These were evil clowns.

865
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,440
I remember that word.

866
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,020
It means you're a shameful person.

867
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,320
That's Graziata.

868
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,080
The Clowns is a weird Fellini movie that's like a fake documentary.

869
00:32:53,580 --> 00:33:03,480
He stages in a Hollywood way the idea that he is leading a little camera crew around making a documentary about clowns.

870
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:09,120
But it's a takeoff on pompous documentary filmmakers at the same time.

871
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,360
I might have known that.

872
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,200
With himself placed in the pompous...

873
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,920
most pompous-est role.

874
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,480
There's a little jig.

875
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,000
What is... who is... who's responsible for this?

876
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,320
Not me, chicken.

877
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,080
This little jig in the background I think is Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz project.

878
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,020
Tell Rudy that although I love his music, this sounds a bit like a fried chicken shack commercial.

879
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Come on down to...

880
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,660
We're going to...

881
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,300
It's only $7.75.

882
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,020
That wouldn't be the exact...

883
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,180
I'm going to...

884
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,180


885
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,420
I'm going to push over.

886
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,080
But you know what I'm saying?

887
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,920
It's too zany.

888
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:04,260
The message for you is learn to close the third nostril without causing damage to the cerebral cortex.

889
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Number one.

890
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,300
Number two.

891
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,160
And of course number seven.

892
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,460
Okay?

893
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,160
Follow the ritual...

894
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,980
Z campaigns...

895
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,120
Follow the ritual...

896
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,460
Z...

897
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:25,640
Follow the ritual devoutly every morning, every evening, and every afternoon before

898
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,820
rising for retirement.

899
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,760
Remove detritus from the third nostril with a handy swab.

900
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,640
Remove piece of flotsam from the ear canal with this...

901
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,660
Watch it!

902
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,180
Here's to...

903
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,160
What is this?

904
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


905
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


906
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


907
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


908
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


909
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


910
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


911
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


912
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


913
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


914
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,160


915
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:53,620
Oh, we were going to play the song, the Kirkendall song, Void, about the bullets coming out of your mouth like a gun.

916
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,340
Yeah, Los Chanhara.

917
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,600
Los Chanhara?

918
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,120
The Los Chanhara song.

919
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,640
Los Chanhara.

920
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Yeah, we can play that.

921
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,460
Let's go.

922
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,640
Let's go.

923
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,040
Let's go.

924
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,100
Hello, I'm Mr. A.

925
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,340
Let's cross the tomb as you prepare to say.

926
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,040
Wear a script and tattooed on the count of them.

927
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,600
Life ain't worth a f*** and it's all because of him.

928
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,060
Yeah.

929
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,440
Put it to the heart.

930
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,640
Put it in the rain.

931
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,980
Everything you say is like a.

932
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,400
Bullet to the brain.

933
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,220
Everything is lousy as you try to explain.

934
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,000
Your face dazed and amazed as you face all of the strain.

935
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,380
I don't quite agree.

936
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,060
And much to your disdain.

937
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,320
I say words from your mouth are like a bullet to the brain.

938
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,660
Bullet in the heart.

939
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,980
Bullet in the brain.

940
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,740
Everything you say is like a bullet to the brain.

941
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,060
Yeah.

942
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,320
I say words from your mouth are like a bullet to the brain.

943
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,040
Yeah.

944
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,640
Yeah.

945
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,600
Yeah.

946
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:20,860


947
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,660
Yeah.

948
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,240


949
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:22,760
Yeah.

950
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


951
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


952
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


953
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


954
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


955
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


956
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


957
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


958
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


959
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


960
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,040


961
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,440
Hey, everything you do.

962
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,580
And everything you say.

963
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,280
Yeah.

964
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:36,840
Yeah.

965
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,980
Everything you do.

966
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:37,980


967
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,960
Is a bullet from your mouth embedded in my brain.

968
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,860
Hello, I'm Mr. A.

969
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,080
I'm Mr. P.

970
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,140
I'm Mr. A.

971
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm Mr. A.

972
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:50,900
I'm Mr. P.

973
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,220
I'm Mr. P.

974
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,020
Hello.

975
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,020


976
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,340
Bullet to the heart

977
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,600
Bullet in the rain

978
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,860
Everything you say

979
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,300
Is like a bullet to the brain

980
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,620
The Kirkendall Void

981
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,560
is this band.

982
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,200
That's what we're hearing.

983
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,360
Um,

984
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,000
you can hear

985
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,860
You can find their website.

986
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,780
It's kirkendallvoid.com

987
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,980
and I'm gonna spell

988
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,580
Kirkendall Void

989
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,760
because it's spelled

990
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,460
K-I-R-K-E-N-D-A-H-L

991
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,300
and void

992
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,320
V-O-Y-D

993
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,600
not V-O-I-D

994
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,780
kirkendallvoid.com

995
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,980
Kirkendall Void

996
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,760
and, um,

997
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,640
I need to

998
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,860
I need to email those guys

999
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,660
and see if they can

1000
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,900
you know,

1001
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,020
play their CDs

1002
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,860
at X Day

1003
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,280
and pretend they're playing it live

1004
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,900
or something.

1005
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
They make you say things like

1006
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,180
hey man,

1007
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,700
is everything

1008
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:37,960
corpacetic?

1009
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,160
No, that didn't work.

1010
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,860
I thought that might make sense.

1011
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,540
It has a little macabre

1012
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,340
twinge to it.

1013
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,420
Tinge, tinge.

1014
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,540
Or maybe it's a tincture.

1015
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,300
As does much of the

1016
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,920
Kirkendall Void stuff

1017
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,500
so it really does fit.

1018
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,320
Yeah.

1019
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,220
I remember when Johnny

1020
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,680
was five years old.

1021
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,800
He was bald at birth

1022
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
and stayed that way

1023
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,600
for a long time.

1024
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,900
But when he was five

1025
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,820
we noticed the little shape

1026
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,900
above his eye.

1027
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,480
Eyes.

1028
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,920
It grew and grew.

1029
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,160
When he was seven years old

1030
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,900
one of his ears

1031
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,800
became long and distended

1032
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,620
and the other one

1033
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,860
stained perfectly still

1034
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,020
like the boxes

1035
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,980
or a johnny.

1036
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,520
Or a ditch rat.

1037
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,420
Rottweilers often

1038
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,140
take to the spoon this way.

1039
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,040
And so we taught little Johnny

1040
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,700
to learn the tricks of a dog.

1041
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
By the time he was seventeen

1042
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,800
he was working for the circuses.

1043
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,300
Lots of work.

1044
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,400
Lots of money.

1045
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,880
And lots of

1046
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,100
sycophant.

1047
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,840
Little Johnny.

1048
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,440
Sycophant.

1049
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:42,800
Sycophant.

1050
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,660
Hard working little Johnny.

1051
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,720
A sycophant?

1052
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,640
I was a hard working

1053
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,500
little Johnny

1054
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,840
when I was little.

1055
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,240
And you were exploited.

1056
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,180
A shovel dog

1057
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,220
dog poo for

1058
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,140
my

1059
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,400
keep.

1060
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,580
Wow.

1061
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,260
I didn't know that

1062
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,000
Reverend Stang.

1063
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,040
Well actually I didn't

1064
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,440
shovel dog poo for my keep.

1065
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I shoveled dog food

1066
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,580
dog poo

1067
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,780
and food

1068
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,340
for

1069
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,480
eight millimeter

1070
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,040
film processing money

1071
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,600
actually.

1072
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,500
That was what my

1073
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,480
I spent my

1074
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,080
money.

1075
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,740
When I was a little

1076
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,140
barefoot

1077
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,120
scamp

1078
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,740
of a little redneck

1079
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,780
running around Fort Worth

1080
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,220
I spent my spare money

1081
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,400
on eight millimeter

1082
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,640
film and processing.

1083
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,600
Honest.

1084
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,980
Tell us Dr.

1085
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,640
Forster what is it like

1086
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,720
to be a scamp?

1087
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,820
You have different parts

1088
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,720
by the parts

1089
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,920
and the rest of us?

1090
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,120
Scampishness

1091
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,060
in those days

1092
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,020
was so different

1093
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,580
from today.

1094
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,300
We didn't know

1095
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,380
of glue sniffing

1096
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,220
or tattoos

1097
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,400
or shoplifting

1098
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,800
or any

1099
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,520
well we didn't know

1100
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,240
shoplifting.

1101
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,360
And we did know

1102
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,160
glue sniffing

1103
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
come to think of it.

1104
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,880
And I guess actually

1105
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,560
we did know

1106
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,920
so I guess it was

1107
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,160
just like being a scamp

1108
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,520
nowadays.

1109
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,300
That you don't understand.

1110
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
Just one step ahead

1111
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,060
of the law

1112
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,960
in mom and dad.

1113
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,560
Ah now you explain yourself.

1114
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,520
But what you fail to realize

1115
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,860
is there are no more

1116
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,960
scamps today.

1117
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,620
What killed them off

1118
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,460
the fire ants

1119
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,000
or pollution?

1120
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,080
No the word itself

1121
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,120
scamp.

1122
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,940
It eluded

1123
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,360
the public's memory

1124
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,320
for long enough

1125
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,420
for you to bring it back

1126
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,840
and be confused by it.

1127
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,400
There is no more scamps.

1128
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,160
Well what

1129
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,360
there are no more scamps.

1130
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,200
What do they call rag

1131
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,640
well then

1132
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,160
what else do you call

1133
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,100
ragamuffins?

1134
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,060
Peter Pocky.

1135
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,500
The Linden Squeezers.

1136
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,320
Hum Bacchus.

1137
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,180
Have you never heard

1138
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,000
of these words?

1139
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,320
You are from the past

1140
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,880
my friend.

1141
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,140
Where have you been?

1142
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,580
I am from the past.

1143
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,540
Your arms are covered

1144
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,080
with dust.

1145
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,820
Or the future.

1146
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm not sure which.

1147
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,720
Oh well

1148
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,660
could be either

1149
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,380
the way you've been

1150
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,080
crawling around

1151
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,720
on your belly

1152
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,440
like a snack.

1153
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,560
I think

1154
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,740
maybe the thing

1155
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,220
in the middle

1156
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,060
of your forehead

1157
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,440
needs to be twisted a bit.

1158
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,600
Oh no

1159
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,100
they already did that.

1160
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,580
It keeps growing back.

1161
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,120
Who's they?

1162
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:48,960
Who's they?

1163
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,700
The doctors.

1164
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,120
The doctors.

1165
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,800
The doctors.

1166
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,160
They cut that thing

1167
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:53,380
off.

1168
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:53,840
The doctors.

1169
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,320
They removed it

1170
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
but it keeps growing back.

1171
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,060
What doctors?

1172
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,780
And every time

1173
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,640
it grows back

1174
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,440
it's thicker

1175
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,980
and uglier

1176
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,020
and stiffer.

1177
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,180
Ah yes

1178
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,340
that will happen

1179
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,200
you'll have lots

1180
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,040
of that with him.

1181
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,940
And discolored

1182
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,840
it's a different color

1183
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,980
from the rest of me.

1184
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,520
Every time

1185
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,180
it grows back

1186
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,160
it's a little bit

1187
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,500
more

1188
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,740
off

1189
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,300
different

1190
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,480
from the original.

1191
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,060
So it's

1192
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,100
continuing

1193
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,760
to replicate

1194
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,200
itself

1195
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,140
with a bit

1196
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,660
Well I keep

1197
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,640
getting it

1198
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,480
we get it removed

1199
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,140
which is not

1200
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,940
fun

1201
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,800
believe me.

1202
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,760
They freeze it

1203
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,640
and then they burn it

1204
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,640
and then they cut it off

1205
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,880
and then

1206
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,740
it just grows back

1207
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,500
and it grows back

1208
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,520
and I have to wear

1209
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,960
this mask

1210
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,980
all the time

1211
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,200
because of the others.

1212
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,220
It's hideous.

1213
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,220
There's nothing

1214
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,400
I can do about it.

1215
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,440
So I just keep

1216
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
getting it cut off.

1217
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,780
I've got a whole

1218
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,280
collection

1219
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,920
I've got jars

1220
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,560
of them

1221
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,880
in my

1222
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,560
in the

1223
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,140
basement.

1224
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,980
That's absolutely

1225
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,960
disgusting.

1226
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,500
Yeah I pickle

1227
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,120
them in

1228
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,880
vinegar.

1229
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,620
Oh my god.

1230
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,460
I can't

1231
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:01,760
No.

1232
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,940
Do you pickle

1233
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,400
them in

1234
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,800
virtue

1235
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,000
or in vinegar?

1236
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,620
And a sideshow

1237
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,500
wanted to buy

1238
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,240
them from me

1239
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,760
so they could

1240
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,320
show off

1241
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,940
what happens

1242
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:12,600
when you do

1243
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,340
too much.

1244
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,340
But I

1245
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,280
I really

1246
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,660
you know

1247
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,700
they grew on me.

1248
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,500
I don't want to

1249
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,140
give up my

1250
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,820
third eyes

1251
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,580
that easily.

1252
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,140
And fourth eyes

1253
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,160
and fifth eyes

1254
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:23,720
but it's really

1255
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,560
a third eye.

1256
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,500
Each one

1257
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,760
it's just kind of

1258
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,720
a joke to call it.

1259
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,380
That's my

1260
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,700
tenth third eye

1261
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,600
that grew in

1262
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,220
and they had to

1263
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,740
cut off.

1264
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,720
God.

1265
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,800
And it's always

1266
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,520
warty.

1267
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,560
Oh god.

1268
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,840
I usually

1269
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
wait until

1270
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,740
it gets so

1271
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,360
big that

1272
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,000
people are

1273
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,800
looking at it

1274
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,720
instead of my

1275
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,700
face when I'm

1276
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,640
talking to them

1277
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,240
and that's when

1278
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,100
I go to the

1279
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:49,960
doctor and get

1280
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,440
it removed.

1281
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,120
I know

1282
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,100
that's like

1283
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,440
women stare

1284
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,580
at me all the

1285
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,340
time because

1286
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,760
of my

1287
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,080
growth and stuff.

1288
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:58,800
And each time

1289
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,660
the crater is

1290
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,420
a little bigger.

1291
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,540
And you just

1292
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,140
want to like

1293
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:02,740
wear a button

1294
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,140
that says

1295
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,240
stop looking

1296
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,020
at my

1297
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,700
eye.

1298
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,480
Right.

1299
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,260
But how are

1300
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:09,720
they going to

1301
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:09,980
not?

1302
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,060
You know

1303
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,560
when you've

1304
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,040
got something

1305
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:13,560
like that

1306
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,720
and they

1307
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,640
laugh at me

1308
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,400
and they

1309
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,480
mock me

1310
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,240
and they

1311
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,800
drove me

1312
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,820
out of there.

1313
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,120
They made

1314
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,940
me feel

1315
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,700
insecure.

1316
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,220
And I'm

1317
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:28,740
sensitive.

1318
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,120
So I had

1319
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,780
to get back

1320
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,280
at them

1321
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,780
somehow.

1322
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,940
Who could

1323
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,580
blame me

1324
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,180
for what I

1325
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,380
did?

1326
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,900
It was

1327
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,160
in the way

1328
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,140
of a blow

1329
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,880
for freedom.

1330
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,960
That's the way

1331
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,900
I look at it.

1332
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,100
They said

1333
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,840
it was wrong.

1334
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,720
They said

1335
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,360
I did wrong.

1336
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,780
But to me

1337
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,940
it was

1338
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,980
the only thing

1339
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,740
I could do.

1340
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,780
What else

1341
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,360
could I do

1342
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,780
when they

1343
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,800
laughed at me?

1344
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,940
They mocked

1345
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,040
me.

1346
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,540
They called

1347
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,840
me

1348
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,040
stump face.

1349
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,600
Why there

1350
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,220
was nothing

1351
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,000
you could do

1352
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,280
dear.

1353
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,520
Nothing at

1354
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:01,780
all.

1355
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,700
You did

1356
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,160
the only

1357
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:03,760
thing you

1358
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,500
could do.

1359
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:04,980
All right

1360
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,300

1361
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,820

1363
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:06,820
to the boy.

1364
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,220
You've been

1365
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,040
having a bad

1366
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,060
dream Ravel Rush.

1367
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,000
You see

1368
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,940

1369
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,400

1378
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,400
it.

1379
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:16,960
Yes yes

1380
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,140

1381
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:18,880

be all right

1390
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,960

1393
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,320
it causes

1394
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,300
hallucinations.

1395
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,740
There's no

1396
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,460
reason for

1397
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:28,700
you to

1398
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,340

00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:29,960
that machete

1400
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,480
like that.

1401
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,040
Sit down

1402
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,440
and have

1403
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:31,820

1405
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,460

00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:32,820

1408
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:33,920
things out.

1409
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:34,600
Just take

1410
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,020

1411
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,300
breath.

1412
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:35,740
Put your

1413
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,220
feet up.

1414
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:36,580
You know

00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:37,840
be all

1417
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,240
right.

1418
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,280
They make

1419
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,840
fun of

1420
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,040
me.

1421
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,480
They call

1422
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,360
me names.

1423
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,000
Lad

1424
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,720
sit down.

1425
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,600
Go home

1426
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,500

1427
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,300
they say.

1428
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,520
Die ugly

1429
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,020
normal.

1430
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:47,680
Come on

1431
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,160

1432
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,520
and sit

1433
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:48,820
on my

1434
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,400
foot son.

1435
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,600
Take this

1436
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,180
bag and

1437
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,420
just breathe

1438
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,780
slowly into

1439
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,280
the bag.

1440
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,000
Watch the

1441
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,300
bag.

1442
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,840
Inflate and

1443
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,360
deflate.

1444
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,320
Just relax

1445
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,000
darling.

1446
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:58,660
It'll all

1447
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,020
be all

1448
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,440
right.

1449
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:00,780
That's

1450
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:00,900
right.

1451
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:01,760
We can

1452
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,240

1453
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,900

1454
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,460
bag now

1455
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:03,720
son.

1456
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,260
It's just

1457
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:04,720
a matter

1458
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,220
of moments

1459
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,960
before you're

1460
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,400
free,

1461
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,140
erect and

1462
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:07,940
singing them

1463
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,700
damn songs

1464
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,160
again.

1465
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,420
Just hang

1466
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:10,900

1467
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,360
little while

1468
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,960
longer.

1469
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,540
I don't

1470
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:14,800
know if

1471
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,020
we can

1472
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,520
really work

1473
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
these things

1474
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,080
out.

1475
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,500
Oh my

00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,040

1479
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:21,940

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,640
derogatory

1481
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,660
terms for

1482
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,420
humans and

1483
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,040
normals.

1484
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,580
Yeah we

1485
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,460

1486
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,440
like them

1487
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,240
can't we

1488
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,620
if we

1489
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,000
want to

1490
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,520

1491
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,600

00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,680
names for

1493
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,360

1494
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,780
people.

1495

1497
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:35,920
names for

1498
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,380
anybody they

1499
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,220
consider weird

1500
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,000

1501
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,680
slurs and

1502
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,100
all that kind

1503
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,620
of stuff.

1504
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,440
What we

1505
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:40,800
could do

1506
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,180
I've got a

1507
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:41,680

no brood 12

1588
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,360
it sounds like

1589
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,480
a bad horror movie

1590
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,040
but actually

1591
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,080
it's brood 13

1592
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,360

two eyes there

1595
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,140
no there's three eyes

1596
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,680
we've been talking

1597
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,440
about the third eye

1598
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,200
this whole time

1599
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,980
oh that's what

1600
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,560
confused me

1601
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:08,940

1602
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,820

1603
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,100

1604
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,580
brood 13

1605
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,680

00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,600

1607
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,140
brood 9

1608
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,640

1609
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,940

00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,320

00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,080

1612
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,640
brood 13

1613
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,000
it sounds like

1614
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,840
a bad horror movie

1615
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,020
but it's actually

1616
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,580
the name of

1617
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,240
billions of

1618
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,000

1619
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,940
expect to emerge

1620
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,700
this month

1621
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,840

1623
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,380
after spending

1624
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,600
17 years

1625
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,140
underground

1626
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,100
I imagine

1627
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,000
they would get

1628
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,720
sick after

1629
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,880
17 years

1630
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,260
underground

1631
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:37,860
these are

1632
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,400
al-qaeda

1633
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,920

1634
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,660
who've been

1635
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,440
sickened

1636
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,060
by being

1637
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,440
underground

1638
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,060
they're sick

1639
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,640
chidas

1640
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,160
right

1641
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,540
sick chidas

1642
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,420
they became

1643
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,320
sick yes

1644
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,900
after their

1645
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,420

1646

00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,160
there's going to

1649
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:49,760
be an epidemic

1650
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,700
of these things

1651
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,340
I'm saying

1652
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:51,720
that they're

1653
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,280
going to probably

1654
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,340
underground terrorists

1655
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,040
let me see that

1656
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,400
news report

1657
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,660
here I better

1658
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,380
read this as the

1659
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:55,860
news reader

1660
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,300
the red eyed

1661
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:58,980
shrimp sized

1662
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:59,820
flying terrorists

1663
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,620
don't bite or

1664
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:00,900
sting

1665
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,600
but they're

1666
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,100
known for

1667
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,040
causing calls

1668
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,600
and mating

1669
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,180
calls that

1670
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,660
can produce

1671
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,340
a din that

1672
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:05,940
can overpower

1673
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,020
ringing telephones

1674
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,760
lawnmowers

1675
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,680
or power tools

1676
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,600
these al-qidas

1677
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,500
are real loud

1678
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,280
right

1679
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:12,980
they're not only

1680
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,660
they're very

1681
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:14,240
disruptive

1682
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,500
is the main

1683
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:15,740
thing

1684
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,540
you can't really

1685
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,000
get them for

1686
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,840
most things

1687
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,340
you'd want to

1688
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:18,740
get them for

1689
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,220
like that thing

1690
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,800
growing out of

1691
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,120
your head

1692
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
but you can

1693
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,840
get them for

1694
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,240
what do they

1695
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,560
call that

1696
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,760
d-o-d-r-d

1697
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,500
drunken

1698
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,920
disturbance call

1699
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,760
noise

1700
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,440
d-n-o-d

1701
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,040
they are

1702
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,940
really loud

1703
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,940
in fact

1704
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,020
when I

1705
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,580
moved to

1706
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:31,860
Ohio

1707
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,720
I didn't

1708
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,360
realize that

1709
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:35,720
I had

1710
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,320
tinnitus

1711
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:36,860
because

1712
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,260
I always

1713
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:38,740
heard the

1714
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,280
al-qidas

1715
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,120
the shrieking

1716
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:40,480
of the

1717
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,040
al-qidas

1718
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,700
the sick

1719
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,540
chidas

1720
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,000
in the

1721
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,300
background

1722
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,920
that was

1723
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,200
their

1724
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,520
lamented

1725
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:45,860
calls

1726
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,380
of their

1727
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:46,720
strange

1728
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,080
bizarre

1729
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,500
religion

1730
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,820
they

1731
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,240
worshipped

1732
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,380
the

1733
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:48,620
moth

1734
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,040
but there

1735
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,320
weren't

1736
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:49,800
any up

1737
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:49,980
here

1738
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,360
I thought

1739
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,700
I was

1740
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:50,980
hearing

1741
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,280
them

1742
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,760
but it

1743
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,240
turned out

1744
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:52,520
that it

1745
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:52,940
was just

1746
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:53,940
an ear

1747
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,400
disease

1748
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,120
tinnitus

1749
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,560
or something

1750
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,180
no no no

1751
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:56,800
it was not

1752
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,240
an ear

1753
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:57,580
disease

1754
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,000
you've

1755
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,520
imagined

1756
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,760
so these

1757
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,360
terrorists

1758
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,960
have been

1759
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,280
hovering

1760
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,660
underground

1761
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,320
in the

1762
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,760
larval

1763
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,240
state

1764
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,600
yes

1765
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
burrowing

1766
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:05,900
underground

1767
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,720
you can't

1768
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,040
hover

1769
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,600
underground

1770
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,100
they've

1771
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,380
been

1772
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:09,860
delayed

1773
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,520
and

1774
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,220
hibernating

1775
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,400
and

1776
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,360
cowering

1777
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,120
I think

1778
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,580
is what

1779
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,620
a terrorist

1780
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,180
the sick

1781
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,740
black

1782
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,620
they will

1783
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,120
emerge

1784
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,360
into

1785
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,060
the following

1786
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,640
states

1787
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,300
will be

1788
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:21,700
affected

1789
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,600
brood

1790
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,160
13 is

1791
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,420
expected

1792
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,060
to cross

1793
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,320
northern

1794
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,420
British

republics

1798
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:28,620
and many

1799
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,240
parts of

1800
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,600
Iowa

1801
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,080
Wisconsin

1802

Michigan

1803
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,720
and Indiana

1804
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,480
sick

1805
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:32,780
kites

1806
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,380
live only

1807
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:33,620
about

1808
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,400
30 to

1809
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,340
95 days

1810
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,580
as adults

1811
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,980
and then

1812
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,200
their

1813
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:37,980
main goal

1814
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,680
is feeding

1815
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,140
of course

1816
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,020
upon each

1817
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:40,280
other

1818
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,220

1819
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,840
non

1820
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,860

1821
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,160
kites

1822
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,580
nearby

1823
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,580
what about

1824
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,020
mating

1825
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,620

00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,000
does this

1829
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,460
release

1830
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,180
to get

1831
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:50,460
to that

1832
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:50,720

1834
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:51,480
a deep

1835
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:51,780
breath

1836
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,060

1838
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:52,960
um

1839
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,820
they don't

1840
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,400
harm humans

1841
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,600
although they

1842
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,140
are clumsy

1843
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,660
and might

1844
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,180
fly into

1845
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:57,460
people

1846
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:57,860
birds

1847
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,420
squirrels

1848
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,680
and pets

1849
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,100
especially

1850
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,560
dogs

1851
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,600
love to

1852
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:00,900
eat them

1853
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,400
because they're

1854
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,960
very high

1855
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,500
in protein

1856
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,140
now

1857
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:03,720
these

1858
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:04,860
terrorists

1859
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,340
right

1860
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:05,740
does that

1861
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,080
have to do

1862
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,420
with sex

1863
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,480
yet

1864
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,660
I don't

1865
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:08,760
know

1866
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,320
okay

1867
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,760
well

1868
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,320
look

1869
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:10,620
should I

1870
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:10,900
look for

1871
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,160
the part

1872
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,560
where they're

1873
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:11,940
no no

1874
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,460
that's okay

1875
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:12,880
okay

1876
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,960
well yeah

1877
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,740
of course

1878
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,360
they they

1879
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:15,980
try to

1880
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,380
meet people

1881
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:16,600
but they're

1882
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,020
so small

1883
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,320
you see

1884
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:17,960
the size

1885
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,580
of a flying

1886
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:18,900
shrimp

1887
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,460
which in

1888
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:19,780
the first

1889
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,260
place is

1890
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,560
ridiculous

1891
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,060
there are

1892
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,560
no flying

1893
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:21,940
shrimp

1894
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,580
but as

1895
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:22,780
long as

1896
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,360
there are

1897
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,180
every 17

1898
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,680
years

1899
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,100
they come

1900
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,400
out of the

1901
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,720
ground

1902
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,020
sick

1903
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,620
al-qaeda

1904
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,280
dr.

1905
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:31,860
dark

1906
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,380
wrote that

1907
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:32,600
up

1908
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:32,980
so if

00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,680
get

1911
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,060
