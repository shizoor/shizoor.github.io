00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
About seven years ago, I started dating Bob.

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,020
You look like a Bobby.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,660
I'm Bobby.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,120
Have you ever smoked pot?

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,280
Every day.

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,180
Every day?

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,820
Every other day.

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,560
Not all the time.

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,140
Texas, what's on your almost perfect mind this evening?

10
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,980
I just had triple bypass open heart surgery and I want you to know it's people like you that made me want to get out of that hospital.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,400
Hey, ask him to do that. Listen to this crowd.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,040
For her recent divorce, shot and killed her three children aged seven. Shot right between a heinous .

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,040
A local judge praised defendant John Roy but was dismayed to learn that Roy had had sex with the corpse.

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,240
What?

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,920
Roy's lawyer was quoted as saying,

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:51,040
State authorities last October released 500 turtles into the Ganges to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floating corpses.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,220
Holy shit!

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,380
There's not a limit for human pollution.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,380


20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,360
The Utah Proudest State of...

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,840
What's up, peanut?

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,420
I can't take no more of this radio. I never heard so much dee shh in all my life.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,260
You give me some music on that radio, this is Hampton. I made it!

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,780
Well at least I got my friends. I got life when you ain't got the love.

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,120
And when you hit the surface, I'm gonna show you what I've got for you.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,840
Even though I got a straight to heart. At least I got my friends.

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,140
Got my friends.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,400
Got my friends.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,340
Got my friends.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,300
Got my friends.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,880
Got my friends.

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:27,880

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:27,880


36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,340
Well at least I got my friends.

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,600
The Soul Genius.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,700
Power of...

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,480
Swag.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Fifteen pounds.

41
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,900
Twenty euros.

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,760
Thirty dollars.

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,400
Ah!

44
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,120
Cut me some slack.

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,720
Slack?

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Mmhmm.

47
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,280
Didn't you say slack?

48
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,760
Mmhmm.

49
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,760
Captain, sit.

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,280
It's safe.

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,440
You want to talk about slack?

52
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,980
Yeah.

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,340
I think it's safe.

54
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,340


55
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,380
It's safe.

Boom, Bob's your uncle.

71
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,560
All right, here's the question that somebody wanted to ask me.

72
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
And Dildo Valerie, they said,

73
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,100
Dear Bunny Day and Dildo Valerie,

74
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,840
Will I be able to avoid having sex my whole life?

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,760
I am 17, I'm straight,

76
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,280
and many girls think I'm attractive.

77
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,980
One of my female friends gave me a list of reasons why I'm attractive.

78
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,240
I know that I'm good looking, but I don't want to have sex.

79
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
I think it is just weird getting naked with a girl, and I view the whole act of sex as weird and primitive.

80
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,860
Plus, she would probably laugh at me when she sees me naked because I have a penis and it is large.

81
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,820
Bob was there to watch each dropping of each coprolite from each dinosaur sphincter.

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,600
Bob saw.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,300
Bob sees now.

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,060
Bob always will see.

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,220
Bob.

86
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,120
Bob.

87
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,020
Bob.

88
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:58,480
Please.

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,160
Bob.

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,760
Bob.

91
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,180
Please.

92
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,660
Please.

93
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,980
Please.

94
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,280
Please.

95
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:05,880
Please.

96
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,080
Bob.

97
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,700
She's been living in her.

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:09,920
Bob.

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
Town world.

100
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,400
I bet she never had a.

101
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,660
Bob.

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,180
She's been living in her.

103
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,400
Bob.

104
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,240
Town world.

105
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,900
I bet she never had a.

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,440
Once.

107
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,980
From her time.

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,540
Yeah.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,320
Thoughts.

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,700
From her time.

111
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,140
Yeah.

112
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,740
Yeah.

113
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Thoughts.

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,440
From her time.

115
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:30,860
Yeah.

116
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,440
Yeah.

117
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,740
Thoughts.

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,120
From her time.

119
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,580
Yeah.

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,020
Yeah.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,440
Yeah.

122
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,160
Bob was a boxer, a hoofer, a vaudeville performer, and a Broadway headliner.

123
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,820
Before his work in radio.

124
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm Bobby.

125
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,060
I'm Bobby.

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,940
I know.

127
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,720
I know.

128
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,280
Bobby.

129
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,760
Bobby.

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,240
Bobby.

131
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,860
I know.

132
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,580
I know.

133
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,200
Bobby.

134
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,940
Yeah.

135
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,440
You think I'm what I'm thinking?

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,600
I think I'm thinking.

137
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,640
Already there.

138
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,860
So many things going on there.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,880
Bob did the right thing.

140
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,240
He folds and tuckers.

141
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060
And he's easy as.

142
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,360
Oh, what's going on?

143
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,840
They've recently had babies.

144
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,400
Now Bob's a fine family man.

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,660
Every, you know, anything.

146
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,200
So they're a little.

147
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,660
Yeah.

148
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:10,960
Yes.

149
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,240
A little stretched at the moment, darlings, aren't you?

150
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:13,940
Yeah.

151
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,140
Yeah.

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,620
A little slack.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,320
Mm-hmm.

154
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,700
Take your finger.

155
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,960
You know I will, Bob.

156
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,620
Oh my goodness.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,440
And.

158
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Ooh.

159
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,420
Oh, my goodness.

160
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,420


161
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,420


162
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,420


163
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,420


164
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah.

165
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,200
Just take a break like that.

166
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh, it's like a.

167
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,980
That's you can tell.

168
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,620
Like a milk jelly.

169
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,100
This is ready.

170
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,940
.

171
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,280
We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house proving

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,140
that the people inside are not cultists after all.

173
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,080
Attention everyone.

174
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,740
This has only been.

175
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,580
The subgenius hour of sweat.

176
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Hey, Bob?

177
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,520
What's your name?

178
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,520


179
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,520


180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,520


181
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,180
J-Bob Dubs.

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,220
J-Bob Dubs.

183
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,620
Sorry, Bob.

184
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,500
Everything's being recorded.

185
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
And cut up.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,040
And cut up.

187
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,400
Collage.

188
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,320
People are hearing me.

189
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,140
Large.

190
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,520
Large.

191
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,160

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
People are hearing me.

198
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,140
Bob.

199
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:54,720


200
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,060
Bob.

201
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,900
Bob.

202
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,040
Bob.

203
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,500
Bob.

204
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,020
Bob.

205
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,240
Bob.

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,080
Bob.

207
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,160
Bob.

208
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,380
Bob.

209
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,880
Bob.

210
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,240
Bob.

211
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,960
Bob.

212
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Bob.

213
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,240
Bob.

214
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,040
Bob.

215
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,680
Bob.

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,900
Bob.

217
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,080
Well, you don't know that they're having a party.

218
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,220
Bob's out of work.

219
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,600
The two of them might be starting some weirdo church.

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,500
The kind of church where you, uh...

221
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,180
Get out the slack.

222
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,640
Get out the slack.

223
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,160
Get out the slack.

224
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,620
Get out the slack.

225
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,220
No sirree, Bob.

226
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,280
Bob.

227
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,120
Bob.

228
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:26,840
Bob.

229
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
One of Gaddafi's sons has apparently been Barack Obama.

230
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm, uh, Bobby.

231
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,080
I know, I know.

232
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,300
Listening to the same sounds over and over and over again.

233
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,380
Well, no, sometimes you hear it backwards.

234
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,240
Hi.

235
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,060
And how we're watching.

236
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm theme.

237
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm theme.

238
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm theme.

239
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm theme.

240
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,400


241
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,400


242
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,400


243
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,320
I'm theme.

244
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,320


245
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,320


246
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,320


247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,320


248
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,320


249
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,060
Drunk as Lemur.

250
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,500
Lurched out of the darkness.

251
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:58,880
The.

252
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,060
The.

253
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,880
Season.

254
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,500
Is.

255
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,720
So.

256
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,460
Long.

257
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,240
Out.

258
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,160
Ah!

259
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,160
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

260
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm alone!

261
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,180
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

262
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm Obama Gaddafi's son, sentenced to life in prison by Thursday.

263
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,840
NATO says the situation in Japan is very serious and very dangerous.

264
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,400
A change in tone from...

265
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,540
Monday when rebels hit the U.S. mainland. One reason, the unexpected appearance of Vice President

266
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,200
Biden as he rallied his father's dangerous supporter. Praising the people of Tripoli,

267
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,340
fighting two Somali men with the National Piracy Center, both admitted helping take over

268
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,180
PR News in Washington. All right, let's just assume the killer is repeating Whistler.

269
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,880
Yes, I have Bob calling. I'll have to call you back. What? Tell Bob I'll call him back.

270
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,760
Big Ripper in full old age, had sex on screen and had a blowjob. What?

271
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,820
I miss Berge. The whole thing. Oh, yeah.

272
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,940
Stacks, cats, nuts, and ears. I had a blowjob. Oh, yeah.

273
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
I miss. What?

274
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
Blowjob. A blow and had green suns. Sex. Hats.

275
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,480
They blow in full. But Big Ripper. Oh.

276
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,320
I had a blowjob. I had a nose. I had a stash. Yeah.

277
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,980
The whole thing. The whole thing.

278
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,900
He caused people to have heart attacks in movie theaters. It was the last movie he ever made.

279
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,040
I don't know the name of it.

280
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,540
But.

281
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,660
People just did not want to see that. They didn't want to see it so much.

282
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,380
Randy Griffin.

283
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,480
Andy Griffith.

284
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,300
Randy.

285
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,860
People just did not want to see that. People just did not want to see that so much because of..

286
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,460
Randy Griffith.

287
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,420
Andy Griffith.

288
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Randy.

289
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,660
People just did not want to see that. They didn't want to see it so much because.

290
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,440
Randy Griffith.

291
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:37,780
Mhm.

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,020
Andy's last movie.

293
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,860
Did advertising ок стоп

294
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,000
sanding

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,920
everything is under control

296
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,440
did

297
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,340
Every, every hundred hundred who show

298
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,860
Moonsay Glamorous

299
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,740
This is perfect

300
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,880
Moonsay Glamorous

301
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,000
This is perfect though

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
You know I'm always thinking pink

303
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,840
No

304
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,780
You know I'm thinking pink

305
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,800
Always thinking pink

306
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,700
Not from now on anyway

307
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,020
Surrender to the power of the pink?

308
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,460
Phew!

309
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,420
I ran into Bob out in the driveway and he told me you weren't at church

310
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,760
God, I hate Bob!

311
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,920
They went to church, Richard, and said can you...

312
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,180
Here's the $120

313
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,420
And they found us a place up front

314
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,020
Alright, that's it

315
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,140
I'm kicking Bob's ass

316
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:56,940
Kevin!

317
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


318
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


319
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


320
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


321
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


322
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:56,940


323
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,860
Yes, dear friends

324
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,900
Okay, let's get real Aul

325
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:58,940
Somec carefully now

326
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,060
Are you guys in this, uh Cold business just for the bucks?

327
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
I don't really want to

328
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,220
Yes friends, the amino acids

329
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,500
New, uhh LP

330
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,420
An EP from the amino acids called Theme from the Slack Hole.

331
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,520
EP. An EP.

332
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,960
An EP. Yeah.

333
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,360
EP.

334
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:28,820
EP.

335
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,320
Phone Home.

336
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,080
Anyway, what we've been listening to is, well, that was Fat Man B right at the end.

337
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,640
But I think The Large did something to her.

338
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,440
The Large sent us a huge amount of stuff for tonight.

339
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,460
In fact, it says, I got a letter from him.

340
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,920
Greetings and salutations, my friend.

341
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,780
Here's a mighty long collage slash remux of my greatest musical clips, mashups, and whatnots.

342
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,280
A sort of best of, worst of compilation.

343
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,020
It could pull off almost as a full episode, eh?

344
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,340
It also includes puzzling evidence, October 20th, 2013.

345
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,520
Commercials by Lymph Note Institute.

346
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,680
Girl Talk and Sultan of Ping, but I cut that part out because...

347
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,240
What?

348
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:19,500
What?

349
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,480
This is the actual theme from the Slack Hole here, which is only 19 seconds long.

350
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,340
They named their EP after the 19 second song.

351
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,580
Anyway, back to...

352
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,520
Martians are coming this way.

353
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,240
We must evacuate the city.

354
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,320
Oh, they must be talking about the WCSB Halloween masquerade ball coming up.

355
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,120
Must be. They must be.

356
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,100
That's the exciting stuff around here.

357
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,380
But I'm going to go back.

358
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,200
Back to this collage by The Large, although the part that's coming up happens to be from the puzzling evidence show.

359
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,760
And I suspect The Large is one of the callers in the background.

360
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,440
With Philodrum and puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell and so forth, the callers and, um...

362
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,420
I was at a board of potty in Utah that didn't have a roof.

363
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,800
It was built without a roof.

364
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,280
Oh, nice.

365
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,820
So, it was awesome.

366
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,900
So, you're open to the free air of heaven.

367
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,460
It was open to the free air.

368
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,780
And...

369
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:18,800
And...

370
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,000
And...

371
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,660
Smaller foe.

372
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,800
It was not the wellest thing.

373
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,460
Still had a door and everything.

374
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,200
Sleipanel, the niche with open doors.

375
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,720
What park was that?

376
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,620
That was in Arches National Park.

377
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,900
Which is excellent.

378
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,520
Excellent National Park.

379
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,180
Which National Park is that then?

380
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:38,680
Arches.

381
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,460
Yes.

382
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,860
Also, they actually...

383
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,980
Veronica and Betty National Park.

384
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,520
This was at the Slick Rock Recreation Area.

385
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,480
But my favorite, of course, is Mr. Weatherby National Park.

386
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,540
And you made it to the...

387
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,520
Where they shot Galaxy Quest, you know, the Vulcan.

388
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,060
The Goblin.

389
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,940
The Goblin Valley.

390
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,860
Goblin Valley, yeah.

391
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,860
And down, down to Goblin Town.

392
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,220
Yeah.

393
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,500
Go.

394
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,160
I mean, they made it look huge.

395
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,180
Because I looked around at pictures of it after I saw the credits, because I immediately thought, where is that?

396
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,460
It's a little bitty state park.

397
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,640
They used the good parts.

398
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,360
It's right there near Capitol Reef.

399
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,500
That's what I figured.

400
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,140
And a lot of really awesome, unbelievable formations and stuff.

401
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,680
Let's go.

402
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
Yeah, right now.

403
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,500
Put the radio on automatic pilot and we'll get in the car.

404
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,040
Let's leave in 16 minutes.

405
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,320
A whole little old bottle of 3% hydrogen peroxide.

406
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,720
You use it to wash your hair.

407
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,380
Is that what you said?

408
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,200
Yes, it's the 3%.

409
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,840
I'm not sure how it was used, but when I was a kid in Hawaii, all of the dark-haired kids,

410
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,220
it was very, very cool to have blonde hair then.

411
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,340
So they somehow did a little.

412
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,180
Yes, exactly.

413
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,800
And they somehow did a, I'm not sure how,

414
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,540
but they,

415
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,140
all the girls especially, would lighten their hair with, yeah, some weak solution of hydrogen peroxide.

416
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,400
It just bleeps the hell out of it.

417
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,920
You can also use it to soak your toothbrush in and keep your toothbrushes germ-free.

418
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,420
Anything.

419
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,940
It just, nothing can live in this.

420
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,240
You can actually put a capful of it in your mouth and just hold it in your mouth for about 10 minutes,

421
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,280
and it'll whiten your teeth better than those teeth whitens do.

422
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,700
But what about the repulsive taste that persists in your mouth?

423
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,720
And you can't spit it, wash it out, because that obviates the,

424
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,280
the good of it.

425
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,320
Well you get used to that awful.

426
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,080
Oh you get used to it.

427
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,880
You learn to love that flavor.

428
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,980
Okay, all right.

429
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,640
Just learn to, quit hatin' Dr. Howell, don't be a hater.

430
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,660
It's just that I was in that state.

431
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,060
Be a playa, not a hata.

432
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,580
I, my teeth went bad just at the time I had to go down to Hollywood to work on a project,

433
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:45,200
and so I had to, you know, to arrest the problem by swishing with the damn hydrogen peroxide at night,

434
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,840
and bearing that unpleasant taste just so I wouldn't be overcome with dental pain during the day.

435
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,320
You can also use it to kill your athlete's foot, a 50-50 mixture on your feet every night.

436
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,900
Oh great, now I've got my foot in there.

437
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,800
This is terrible.

438
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,060
Then you can reuse that in the morning to do your teeth.

439
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,220
How did I get to be such a yogin?

440
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,800
How did I get to be such a yogin?

441
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,360
How did I get to be such a yogin?

442
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
How did I get to be such a yogin?

443
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
How did I get to be such a yogin?

444
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,180
How did I get to be such a yogin?

445
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,500
No, the lemur!

446
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,920
It's just Bob is what it is.

447
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,800
It's just, it's literally Bob.

448
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,860
Genie gotta Bob.

449
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,260
Hurt dog plus sea fire.

450
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,160
Some genius hour of slur.

451
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
Float with the ghost.

452
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,140
Have fun with the phantom.

453
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Soar with the spirit.

454
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,180
Have fun with the phantom.

455
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,220
Float with the ghost.

456
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,820
Have fun with the phantoms.

457
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,580
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

458
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,900
Woooooooooooooooooo bad plane.....

459
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,540
Good evening, Bill.

460
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,160
Bob.

461
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,460
Bob.

462
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,120
Now then, what can I get you, Bill?

463
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,940
It's Bob.

464
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,020
Right then, you go me a tenner, Bill.

465
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,500
No, it's Bob.

466
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,160
Bob.

467
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,160


468
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,020
Yeah.

469
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,680
Hey.

470
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,260
Yeah.

471
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,620
Hey.

472
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,080
Yeah.

473
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,460
Yeah.

474
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,140
Hey.

475
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,140


476
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,140


477
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,140


478
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,140


479
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,140


480
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,640
Hey.

481
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,400
Yeah.

482
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,160
Yeah.

483
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,360
Hey.

484
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:32,680


485
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,020
Yeah.

486
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,280
Hey.

487
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,540
Yeah.

488
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:33,780
Yeah.

489
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,980
Take this.

490
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Bob.

491
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,460
Take this.

492
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,740
Bob.

493
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,020
Take this.

494
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,260
Bob.

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,620
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only ten minutes away.

496
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:44,880
Okay, bye.

497
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,460
Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby is only 10 minutes away

498
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,480
I just wanna like it

499
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,440
I just wanna like it

500
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,320
I just wanna like it

501
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,200
I just wanna like it

502
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,080
Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

503
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,180
The reason I'm not at the PR news is because I'm in a...

504
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,220
Some genius.

505
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,180
Power of...

506
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,580
Now, turn the dial.

507
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,300
This is clearly a photograph of Bob.

508
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,320
And what's really sad is it's actual size.

509
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,740
He is not large.

510
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,540
Big Bob.

511
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,060
It's time to meet Big Bob.

512
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,300
Oh, what's up, kid?

513
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,000
What's up, kid?

514
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,220
It's Big Bob.

515
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,420
Dude, what?

516
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,140
It's Big Bob.

517
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,420
What?

518
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,600
What?

519
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:58,940


520
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,180
Dude, what?

521
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,260
What?

522
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,320
You're talking with Big Bob right now?

523
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,420
Why are you fucking with Big Bob right now?

524
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
You're fucking with Big Bob right now?

525
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,740
He will do something.

526
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,340
Why are you talking shit on Big Bob?

527
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,880
Big Bob will eat you up.

528
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,980
You smell like rubber and you're really sketchy right now.

529
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,020
Dude, look at me.

530
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,960
What is that?

531
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,600
You got punked by Big Bob.

532
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,120
It's like a weird dream.

533
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh, shit.

534
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,800
Big Bob will smack you up so hard.

535
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,340
And I said Big Bob's the truth.

536
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:26,800
Okay.

537
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,900
And I said Big Bob's the truth.

538
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,320
Okay.

539
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:30,940
Okay.

540
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,760
Okay.

541
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,060
Okay.

542
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,060


543
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,060


544
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,060


545
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,060


546
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,680
Here he is.

547
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,260
Big Bob.

548
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,080
He's in the streets.

549
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,420
Hey.

550
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,360
Oh, here he is.

551
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,860
Big Bob.

552
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,660
He's in the streets.

553
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,440
Okay.

554
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,320
Okay.

555
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,300
Got a little car.

556
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,600
Yeah.

557
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,020
Big Bob.

558
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,120
Big Bob.

559
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,560
Welcome to the Big Bob.

560
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Bigness.

561
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,880
Yeah, yo.

562
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,680
Welcome to the bigness.

563
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah, yo.

564
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,340
It's going down, Bob.

565
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,020
Big Bob has been here.

566
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Big Bob has been here.

567
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,740
Big Bob.

568
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,680
Yeah, yeah.

569
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,160
What?

570
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:21,840
What?

571
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,540
What?

572
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:22,780
What?

573
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:22,820
What?

574
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,080
What?

575
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,520
What?

576
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,520
Dude, you look like a high school sinner.

577
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,140
Do you think you are Mr. Big Star?

578
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,480
Big Bob is no joke.

579
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,520
Oh, yeah.

580
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,660
I'm so used to this.

581
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,020
Big Bob, it's a prog.

582
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,440
Big Bob, it's a prog.

583
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,840
Big Bob, it's a prog.

584
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,140
Big Bob, it's a prog.

585
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,440
Bob!

586
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,060
Bob!

587
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,520
Bob!

588
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:07,920
Bob!

589
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,260
My name's not Bob.

590
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,080
Not a prop, Bob.

591
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,480
Good drugs?

592
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,780
Hey, Bob.

593
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,160
Where are you?

594
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,680
Another cell.

595
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,660
Maybe.

596
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,160
What do you mean, maybe?

597
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,220
What's that supposed to mean?

598
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,300
Maybe.

599
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,340
Means maybe I'm in the next cell.

600
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,860
Another volunteer like you.

601
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:38,920
Or maybe I'm in the central office, spying on you for all those science bozos.

602
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,040
Maybe I'm not even here.

603
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,940
Maybe I'm just in your...

604
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,040
So genius.

605
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,620
Powerful.

606
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,740
What?

607
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,180
Bob!

608
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,640
Bob!

609
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,280
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

610
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
This is America.

611
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,760
You can do it.

612
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,740
We can do it.

613
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:56,980
Whoa.

614
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,220
Whoa.

615
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:58,780
Whoa.

616
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,200
Whoa.

617
00:25:59,720 --> 00:25:59,720


618
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,180
Whoa.

619
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:00,620


620
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:00,720
Whoa.

621
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:00,740
Whoa.

622
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:00,740


623
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:00,820
Whoa.

624
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:00,840
Whoa.

625
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


626
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


627
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


628
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


629
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


630
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


631
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


632
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


633
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


634
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


635
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,480


636
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,940
Whoa.

637
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,700
Thank you.

638
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,820
Bob here.

639
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,320
Yeah, Bob spelled backwards.

640
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,140
It's still Bob.

641
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,900
Hey, for every stang, I got a new joke for you.

642
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,080
It's just Bob is what it is.

643
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,580
It's just...

644
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,100
It's literally Bob.

645
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
Hey, Bob's the truth.

646
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:31,480
Okay.

647
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,260
That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob. That's Big Bob.

648
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:48,380
I'm in some hot soup here, Bob. Some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. I think they could start slacking at any moment.

649
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm Shlack.

650
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,660
The National Guard is airlifting washed-out anti-government activists in Canada,

651
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:02,200
visiting rebel leaders in New Jersey blamed for more than billions of deaths and nearly a dozen child sexual assaults.

652
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,160
A 13-year-old boy is also vowing that its armed rebels will be merged into water in Washington.

653
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,520
Far out. A major hit.

654
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Dear Ben Laden, please take me now.

655
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,920
I hate the curse of that car.

656
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:25,640
But you can never have what's inside my perverted, sick, demented head.

657
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,160
I hate it!

658
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,680
Ah, the commercial break.

659
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,920
You know, commercials are now woven into the tapestry of our lives, answering the questions we first posed to ourselves.

660
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,540
Who am I? What do I believe? What is my worth?

661
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,020
Before commercials, these questions were merely rhetorical and thus unanswerable.

662
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,380
But when viewed through the magnifying lens of commercials, these questions, like all others, yield answers.

663
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,680
Imagine no more wondering about identity, self, or beauty.

664
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,360
If you allow your life to reflect images in commercials, the nagging doubts and feelings of inadequacy will fall away.

665
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:05,540
Leaving the person you've always dreamed of, confident, assured, bold, or beautiful, sexy, loved.

666
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,540
Yes, America, you love your commercials, and why shouldn't you?

667
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
Commercials are themselves lovers.

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,240
Gentle are their words.

669
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,580
Tender their caress.

670
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,200
Commercials know what you like, and they want to give it to you.

671
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,900
Attuned only to your wants and needs, commercials stir the passions and arouse desire.

672
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,160
Commercials give and give.

673
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,640
Reaching lovingly.

674
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,980
Deep inside of you.

675
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,620
Creeping.

676
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,800
Tentatively at first, and then relenting.

677
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
Into a singly focused writhing.

678
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,080
Searching out the source of your ache.

679
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,520
Pushing fiercely into your loneliness, and into a spot you never knew existed.

680
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,880
Commercials fill you up with hopes and dreams.

681
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,780
With new desires and new possibilities.

682
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,620
Delivering you into an eerily delirious ecstasy.

683
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,160
Afterward, you'll sleep as only someone who's been completely satisfied can.

684
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,620
Only vaguely sensing the arm of commercials.

685
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
Draped over your body.

686
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,520
Holding you.

687
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,340
Keeping you.

688
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
Safe and secure.

689
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,500
And you'll dream.

690
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,280
Of ballroom dancing.

691
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,120
Of game winning home runs.

692
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,660
Of first kisses.

693
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,340
And of commercials.

694
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,240
The man, whenever she saw him.

695
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,640
Carried away by a moonlight.

696
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,260
Bob.

697
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,240
You could just...

698
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,700
You could just...

699
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,380
I don't...

700
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,480
I just don't even...

701
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:25,840
I don't even know.

702
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,140
I don't know either.

703
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,200
I don't know.

704
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,740
And I don't know where or when we go from there.

705
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,980
Would Dave know?

706
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:43,940
And Dave would probably know, but he's lonesome tonight.

707
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
He's lonesome, lonesome tonight.

708
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,420
This is the Flying Ryan Brothers in the background.

709
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,700
By the way, Princess, we, the band, the Flying Ryan Brothers has started to play out.

710
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:04,040
They're probably the best sounding, most commercial sounding subgenius band, but they were only

711
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,880
a studio band.

712
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,660
Yes, indeed.

713
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,980
I'm amazed that they're gonna play out.

714
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,240
That's great.

715
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,300
No, they've been doing it a lot in Chicago.

716
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,060
I think that's kind of where they're at.

717
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
Somewhere thereabouts.

718
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,920
Well, I wish the cowboy wouldn't be so lonesome, but...

719
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
Those lucky Chicagoans.

720
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,220
And we...

721
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,980
That...

722
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,280
That...

723
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,640
That's right.

724
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,220
All that collageery was by the large, except that it was...

725
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,580
He was piecing together hundreds of pieces by other folks, like the commercial at the

726
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:44,500
end for commercials was by Lymphnode Institute, which was Suzy the Flusie's co-host or show

727
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,720
partners on Bob's Slack Time Fun House in Atlanta, WREK Atlanta.

728
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,760
And we congratulate Suzy on her very...

729
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,560
First 1000th show.

730
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,480
She's done 1000 episodes of Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

731
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,680
We'll be playing that soon.

732
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,160
Yes.

733
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,340
And also with Dave, I hope.

734
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,520
So he would, he would hope.

735
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,660
Oh, he is.

736
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,760
It is the hope.

737
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,060
It's Dave.

738
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,560
That we have hope and change.

739
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,540
Well, hope.

740
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,840
Well, change.

741
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,800
Well, wait.

742
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,780
Well, Dave.

743
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,560
We have Dave.

744
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,760
Does it sound like some sort of tube or something?

745
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,260
You sound a little tubular more than normal.

746
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:24,740
Slightly tubular.

747
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:24,740


748
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:24,740


749
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:24,740


750
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:24,740


751
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:24,740


752
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,100
Slightly tubular, Vinnie.

753
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,000
You sound like you're going to a satellite and bouncing back, but that's normal.

754
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,840
Are you trying to tell us that you're not speaking through a paper cup?

755
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,800
Not this time.

756
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,660
No, I'm actually speaking through the controlled innards of an old flashlight.

757
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,120
The battery's taken out and everything.

758
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:46,660
Wow.

759
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,600
That's steampunk.

760
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,180
That is steampunk.

761
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:49,560
Well, yeah.

762
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,120
Well, that's since the government shut down.

763
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,080
What else can you do?

764
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,300
If you don't have government, where are you going to get your tube?

765
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,080
Right.

766
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,520
Yeah.

767
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,000
Where are you going to get your hairnets and your poo-poo and stuff?

768
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,800
And all those other incongruous elements that you would go shopping on one day for.

769
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:08,960
Yes.

770
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,980
Well, now they're saying that I have to have car insurance, right?

771
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:14,900
Yeah.

772
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,760
All of a sudden, if I don't have car insurance, I'm going to get fined if I'm stopped and

773
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
I can't prove I have insurance?

774
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,300
Well, you know what I'm going to do?

775
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm going to wreck my car.

776
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,700
Just to show them what for.

777
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,580
That's what I'm going to do.

778
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,060
And wreck every other car.

779
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,700
I'm going to key every other car I find.

780
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,720
How's that?

781
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,600
If I go for it, I have to have car insurance.

782
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,860
That's communism.

783
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,580
And when the adjuster comes out, you're going to pee your pants and cry.

784
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,120
Well, I'm so butthurt about the whole thing, I've decided to announce a subgenius

785
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,700
shutdown.

786
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,280
Or rather, well, why just subgenius?

787
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,920
Let's have a whole religion shutdown.

788
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,620
Yes.

789
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,980
Let's go all the way.

790
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,120
You know, why should church and state be separate?

791
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,460
You're going to have to do your reason.

792
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:52,460


793
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,560
Yeah, but factions need to fight, though.

794
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,520
You need to have people that think that the reason you need to shut down a church is because,

795
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,040
you know, you didn't pass stangle care or something like that.

796
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,400
Well, no, because we didn't have enough Muslimics or we had too many Muslimics.

797
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,080
Yeah, that'll work.

798
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,680
That sounds good.

799
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,140
Why don't we just do what the onions said and have a hoedown instead of a shutdown?

800
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,380
Yeah, let's have a hoedown.

801
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,620
Well, the state can have a shutdown and church can have a hoedown.

802
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,300
Yeah.

803
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,140
Do you know any hoes?

804
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,480
Watch that talk.

805
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,020
Watch that talk.

806
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,100
People wearing snowshoes in the middle of summertime.

807
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,000
I said that just to bother Princess Wee.

808
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,700
She doesn't like me to use that word.

809
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,180
Well, as the new papal envoy, I think you should at least treat her with a minor amount

810
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,920
of respect.

811
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,200
Papal envoy?

812
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,800
Yeah.

813
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,440
Can we get, like, toilet paper?

814
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,860
Yeah.

815
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,660
It's part of the new plan from the new oblong forces.

816
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,280
Those guys are going to be in trouble.

817
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,280


818
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:52,280


819
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
They just know everything about everything.

820
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,940
And actually, the world's coming to them even quicker than you did when you screwed up.

821
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,180
Praise oblong.

822
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,680
Yeah.

823
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,000
Do more than that.

824
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,140
He demands more.

825
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,520
But, get him Bob.

826
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,120
Now, I heard something about, yeah, thanks oblong.

827
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,480
Thanks oblonga.

828
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
Thanks blagonga.

829
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:22,260
Actually, that reminds me, I have some blagongas I need to kill if I'm going to get this.

830
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,260


831
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,260


832
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,260


833
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:22,260


834
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
That blagonga armor.

835
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,520
But that's neither here nor there.

836
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,520
Especially since it pinches the nipples, so to speak.

837
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,460
So what?

838
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,300
That's in his dream game.

839
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,560
Pay no mind.

840
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,820
Well, yeah.

841
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,240
But I didn't know that, you know, the soft porn was a part of it.

842
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,220
Real soft.

843
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah, that's the way it left me.

844
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,260
Sad.

845
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,860
It's not all its fault, though.

846
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,240
After an evacuation, it's not.

847
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,300
After an evacuation drill, you need to stand tall and say, thank God, America.

848
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,500
After an evacuation drill, some of us have to take a shower.

849
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,720
And if a shower's not nearby, do like that one lady and go to the nearest car wash and

850
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,220
beg them to hose you down.

851
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,440
I saw a video of that, a little security video.

852
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,540
Yep.

853
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,860
One lady's only got one good eye.

854
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,160
That was beyond comprehension that that actually happened.

855
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,340
Dr. Sinister has entered the studio.

856
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,000
But I saw the video of it, so I've...

857
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,560
I have.

858
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,400
I know it's happened.

859
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:24,860
Yes.

860
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,520
Yeah, the videos of it, I always tell the truth on YouTube and stuff.

861
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,000
You can always count on a non-staged event.

862
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,200
Well, I can't tell.

863
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,820
Can you really?

864
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,420
No, I can't tell the fake from the real.

865
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,660
You know, there are people out there who spend their entire lives just waiting for the big

866
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:48,460
real moment, and they have acted out in their heads how something is going to go when something

867
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,200
big happens.

868
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,220
They've got some kind of words that they know they're going to want to say.

869
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,220


870
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,500
Or they've got some gesture.

871
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,780
Some people.

872
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,500
They buy lots of canned food.

873
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,700
Some people can make the re...

874
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,340
Duck masks.

875
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,220
I think that when the rapture, the Christian rapture happens, there's going to be a lot

876
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,720
of people like in that movie, This Is The End, saying, hey, what about me?

877
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:13,780
Except for we'll all be adrift in the middle of Pacific Ocean with a tiger.

878
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,120
That'll be the escape vessel.

879
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,780
And we go, oh, man, am I going to do some serious digging into my brain and get rid

880
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,960
of all these useless thoughts?

881
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,780
He's making me hungry for tiger pie.

882
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,860
I haven't had a good tiger pie in so long.

883
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,480
Dang.

884
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,100
Mm-hmm.

885
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,480
Mm-hmm.

886
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,700
You've been pieing out in Ashtabula, Dave.

887
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,440
Have I been pieing out?

888
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,460
Yeah, pieing out.

889
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, yeah.

890
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,640
There was a big pie festival this weekend in an adjacent town.

891
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,360
Oh, there really was?

892
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,820
There actually was.

893
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,340
So that is a synchronistic mesh.

894
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,680
A serious pie festival?

895
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,620
Like pie as in the mathematic...

896
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:51,940
Yeah.

897
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,880
Pie or pie to eat?

898
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,680
You're supposed to do that on March 14th.

899
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,840
It was in an old, some old, you know, double century home or something, making some big

900
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,400
deal about history things.

901
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh, because 314.

902
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,040
I get it.

903
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,740
It's also Einstein's birthday.

904
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,620
Oh.

905
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,880
Oh, 314.

906
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,680
I thought that was Hitler's birthday, only in backwards.

907
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,320
No, that's 420.

908
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,740
420.

909
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,680
Oh, so then that's not an allusion to let's go to school.

910
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,320
And let's not forget in Sudan, of course, they had the brutal militia called the Janja

911
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,860
Weed, and someone should get the Janja Weed some ganja weed.

912
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:21,940
That's a good idea.

913
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


914
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


915
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


916
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


917
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


918
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


919
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:21,940


920
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,620
That'll chill them out.

921
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,600
That'll stop killing people.

922
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,260
That was really the name?

923
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,220
Janja Weed?

924
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,440
Yeah.

925
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,300
Janja Weed, yes.

926
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,400
I bet it was spelled in a way that I would have mispronounced.

927
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,980
Well, it's an Arabic word, so there are multiple romanizations of Arabic words, depending on

928
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,560
what sounds are contained in the word.

929
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,000
And we must always take the worst one to mean that Boston and Baltimore, anything else starting

930
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,940
with a B will suddenly come under...

931
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,420
Never mind.

932
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,040
I was having one in my ear.

933
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,860
One of your alphabets?

934
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,020
Yeah.

935
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,320
That's what that attacks?

936
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,900
Yeah, I guess that's what they do.

937
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,800
You know, when they control you.

938
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:55,920
An attack by bees?

939
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,920
You know, Dave, you're not the only one who gets weird things about certain letters in

940
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,540
the alphabet popping up in certain places.

941
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,640
You're not the only one.

942
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,100
Well, I didn't say I was the only one.

943
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,520
I certainly welcome any company if you need, you know, if you can tell me how to help us.

944
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,600
Like last week or something, like on Arsenio Hall, all of the guests had an O-R in their

945
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,960
name at some place.

946
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,660
Like even the first name or last name had an O-R in it somewhere.

947
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,420
See, but whenever I visit the language...

948
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,920
It's a conspiracy.

949
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,640
It is.

950
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,580
It's a single mission.

951
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,720
Everything is a conspiracy.

952
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,700
Everything is a conspiracy.

953
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,320
Be dark, ugly, full of smoke.

954
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,320
We're all in at least one conspiracy.

955
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,500
There is not light for love to live.

956
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,980
I'm very suspicious of the Greek letter chi or chi.

957
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,560
Chi?

958
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,540
Yeah, you know, it looks like an X. I'm very suspicious of that letter.

959
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
Yeah, that's, you know, rho chi.

960
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,200
That doesn't sound...

961
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,160
That sounds almost dirty.

962
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,980
It doesn't sound religious.

963
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,920
Greek?

964
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,320
Greek?

965
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,180
What do you expect?

966
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,440
Sometimes transliterated as a CH or a KH or just an H or just a C or just a K.

967
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,020
And Dad, it looks like an X.

968
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,700
In the original Greek, it looks like an X.

969
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,880
And it's a sound.

970
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,500
Actually, we love our Greek friends.

971
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,320
I don't know where I'd be without those.

972
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,680
We love our Greek food.

973
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,980
Festivals.

974
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,820
Yeah, pastitsios and usakas and what do they call them?

975
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,600
Hildebarons.

976
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,460
Galactoburikos.

977
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,780
Galactoburikos.

978
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,620
Not to be confused with Galactus, which are devourer of worlds.

979
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,500
Yes.

980
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,060
Yes.

981
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:33,980
Hellenicius.

982
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:34,980
Galactus.

983
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,360
Devourer of Galactoburikos.

984
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,400
That's a dumb joke.

985
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,220
The Milky Way.

986
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,420
It makes sense.

987
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,780
If he's eating the milk custard, he's eating...

988
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,960
The very word Galaxos.

989
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:48,960


990
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:48,960


991
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:48,960


992
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:48,960


993
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,840
The very word Galaxos is derived from the Latin word for milk.

994
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,260
Milk wag.

995
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,920
And also the Greek word for milk, halah.

996
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,860
What's the Greek word for milk?

997
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,300
The Greek word is halah.

998
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,480
I don't know the Greek word for milk.

999
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,360
I don't know the Greek word for milk.

1000
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,780
The Greek word is halah.

1001
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,980
It's an aspirated gush, you know, it's halah.

1002
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,560
What letters are in it?

1003
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,900
You're supposed to put A-L-A's for sure, and I don't know what the ha is.

1004
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,960
Alpha, lambda, alpha.

1005
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,420
We're getting dorky because Stank's turning up the music.

1006
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,940
You know what it is?

1007
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,300
This time.

1008
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,920
That was smart.

1009
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,480
Well, actually, the music caught me.

1010
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,040
I was thinking, wow, they're getting heavy there.

1011
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,540
Dork talk.

1012
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,940
Dork talk.

1013
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,960
Yes, it is a...

1014
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,460
It's a good thing I've never been pulled over by the police under suspicion of drunk driving

1015
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,780
because they make you recite the alphabet, and I'm such a nerd, I'd say, which one?

1016
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,580
Somehow I don't think that would go over well.

1017
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,220
I don't think it would go over real well, you're right.

1018
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,940
Alpha may be the...

1019
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,140
Napoleon, you smiling little architect.

1020
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,320
Bend over and let me count to three.

1021
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,060
Huh?

1022
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,520
Gosh, Sarge, it's been a long time, you know?

1023
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,740
It makes me want to launch into Dolomite's ABCs of Love, which I've memorized, but I

1024
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:02,840
can't even say the first letter until after 11 o'clock tonight when we're in safe harbor.

1025
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,340
See, there I go again.

1026
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,500
It's just like playing YouTubes for a radio audience.

1027
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,380
I actually heard a...

1028
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,100
Which I get so mad at, and yet...

1029
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,500
I heard a terrible low bit rate MP3 played on WZN.

1030
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,500


1031
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,340
I think it was WZAK the other night.

1032
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,820
I think it was Friday night.

1033
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,920
I can believe that on WZAK.

1034
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,840
Oh, no!

1035
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,200
What happened to Dave?

1036
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,840
Is it our Dave?

1037
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,940
I hope he didn't run out of time for his new machine.

1038
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,480
Oh, the new improved machine that runs out of time.

1039
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,020
The empty battery.

1040
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,300
Dave has a new buzz, yeah.

1041
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,800
Oh, yeah.

1042
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,980
But it's a wind-up phone where it only lasts about half an hour before he has to wind it up again.

1043
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,300
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,320
And if I know Dave, that means a trip to the convenience store, so he won't be back.

1045
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,040
Now, now.

1046
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,380
That might not be...

1047
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,380


1048
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:54,540
Oh, no, look.

1049
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,140
There he is.

1050
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,520
Yay!

1051
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,280
Is that the Dave?

1052
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,080
Yes, it's starting to get very quiet, so I paused to look, and I got ended.

1053
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,200
Well, that's what happens with a new phone.

1054
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,720
Your call was dropped, sir.

1055
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,580
Is that like a butt call?

1056
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,440
The number or code you have dialed is incorrect.

1057
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,640
No, a butt call is when you leave it in your pocket, and it's not on.

1058
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,660
And try again.

1059
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,420
Show off.

1060
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,540
Message seven.

1061
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,020
Switch.

1062
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,360
Yeah, that was a little too quick.

1063
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,180
I've got the Cinco de Mayo disillusionments here at the very end.

1064
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,420
Did you know the Pancho Vito was actually subterranean?

1065
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,880
Pancho Vito?

1066
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,700
Yeah.

1067
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,400
Was a mole man underground?

1068
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:47,280
Well, La Cucaracha is a song that extolled his truth to go out and smoke heroin.

1069
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1070
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1071
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1072
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1073
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1074
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1075
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1076
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1077
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1078
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1079
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1080
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1081
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:47,280


1082
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,980
I saw an underscore, cause this is the most significant.

1083
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,100
Yeah.

1084
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:12,340
Whenever evil comes into your element, and evil only plays out before you really think

1085
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,340


1086
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:12,940
Really, for us, we just sit on the internet, and the only way to get the results from our

1087
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,680
experiment is to make sure my email account works.

1088
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,260
Great.

1089
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,020
When you have an externalized belly button, it means you drive one of those German cars

1090
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,180
whose logo looks like the Olympic logo, but there's one less ring.

1091
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,380
It's a class thing, man.

1092
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,160
Oh, wow.

1093
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,940
I didn't know there was any correlation between Audis and, oh, that's right, Audis.

1094
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,620
I could see a square.

1095
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,160
I was staying out of that one myself.

1096
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,960
It took me a while.

1097
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,860
I never got there.

1098
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,780
I'm very slow on the uptake.

1099
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,080
I didn't get there until after you did.

1100
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,160
Well, you have to have a little bit of dough to be able to afford an Audi,

1101
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,960
so I still would like to espouse more classism.

1102
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,240
I don't have enough dough to even know about Audis.

1103
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,420
You know, in Renaissance Venice, having an Audi belly button was a sign of luxury and noble birth.

1104
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,020
That's what I thought.

1105
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,660
That's what I thought there, because I could just see all these corrupt squires,

1106
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,280
you know, these sweet Terry, these escuderos all with their belly buttons hanging out,

1107
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,160
you know, giving people orders and stuff.

1108
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:28,440
Well, it's been traditional for inbred nobility to kind of consider whatever their particular deformity is

1109
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,780
to be the height of fashion and be...

1110
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,320
Oil diseases.

1111
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,340
Right.

1112
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,380
So everybody, the Habsburg lip was very, very popular for a long time.

1113
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,420
The Habsburgs didn't have belly buttons at all.

1114
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,560
Oh, like gray aliens.

1115
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,620
They just painted.

1116
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,240
Their food was painted onto their skin.

1117
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,560
Again, they were so sensitive, those nobles.

1118
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,880
That's sensitive.

1119
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,240
Like the Bodhisattva before them, they were born pure in a lake by themselves.

1120
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,520
They said, I want to be born, and I create the molecules right there, and that's what they did.

1121
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,020
For a while, anyway.

1122
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,360
That's amazing.

1123
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,780
Tell us more, Dave.

1124
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,340
I can't.

1125
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,480
How is Babi formed?

1126
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:15,940
Babi?

1127
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,240
Yes, how is Babi formed?

1128
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,360
How is Babi formed?

1129
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,500
Babi?

1130
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,500
Babi.

1131
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,580
Babi formed is very simple to make.

1132
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,660
It is a geometric figure consisting of 25 sides.

1133
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,760
I'm dating myself.

1134
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,420
That was an internet meme.

1135
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,480
You know that number pi, actually, huh?

1136
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,300
Membo pi?

1137
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,800
You know, I'm just old enough to remember old internet memes.

1138
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,640
How about all your base all belong to us?

1139
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,680
I'm just old enough to be in the continent partially.

1140
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,120
Well, yeah, how is Babi formed is much more recent.

1141
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,160
I'm just older than all your base all belong to us.

1142
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,340
Yes.

1143
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:56,200
Although I saw a YouTube that collected the internet memes since the internet sort of started

1144
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,540
for most people in the 90s.

1145
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,160
Like Go-See?

1146
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,860
Yeah, like that.

1147
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,300
And I was proud of myself.

1148
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
I only recognized about one third of them.

1149
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,220
I was not so much of a geek that I understood every single internet meme that had come along.

1150
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,880
Although Princess Wee and I participated in the...

1151
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,900
What not Uma Guma, what was that song we did?

1152
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,260
The Yaba Yaba song.

1153
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,340
The Romanian...

1154
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,080
Numa Numa!

1155
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,560
That was...

1156
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,260
Creative...

1157
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,740
The Yaba Yaba dude song.

1158
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,160
...information.

1159
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,520
Huh?

1160
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,800
That was very controversial, actually, because people thought you were cussing when you were

1161
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,660
just speaking...

1162
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,320
Oh, we got in big trouble.

1163
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,020
...either Romanian or Jibberish.

1164
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:37,680
Dutch?

1165
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,620
They couldn't understand.

1166
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,260
I speak fluent Jibberish.

1167
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,220
English that sounded like the Romanian words.

1168
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,120
So they were English words, but they didn't really make sense.

1169
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,740
And the dirty-minded station manager here assumed...

1170
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,220
He was absolutely certain he heard us saying the F-word when we were just saying, rather

1171
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:57,920
Bob didn't stay.

1172
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,620
She'd rather Bob didn't stay.

1173
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,900
Yeah.

1174
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,900
Somewhere, she'd rather Bob didn't stay turned into something...

1175
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,160
She'd rather if I could stay.

1176
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,340
You sure it wasn't Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

1177
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:10,440
Bob?

1178
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,300
Something like that.

1179
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:12,680
Yeah.

1180
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,100
Anyway, we almost lost the hour of sloth.

1181
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,100


1182
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,940
I had to show him the Romanian lyrics and then the English lyrics that we had translated

1183
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,340
over and make him listen to it while reading the lyrics.

1184
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:35,520
Then he could hear that we weren't actually cussing on a thing we'd prepared for a primetime

1185
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:43,440
radio show on a really, really famous, world-famous station, WCSB.

1186
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,080
You would never jeopardize that.

1187
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,080


1188
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,080


1189
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,320
I never jeopardized our FCC license that way.

1190
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,060
Never.

1191
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,860
You know, I actually have the evidence saved.

1192
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,240
I violated the terms of service on YouTube and downloaded the video from YouTube.

1193
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,960
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,340
You know, there was a recent study that said that, by golly, despite what the entertainment

1195
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,400
business says, they haven't lost any money at all to file sharing.

1196
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,280
How would they even figure out how much money they lost?

1197
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,020
You know how they come up with the numbers they come up with?

1198
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,420
They assume that every single illegal legal...

1199
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,060
No.

1200
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,340
Every quote-unquote illegally copied file out there would have been a paid movie ticket.

1201
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,380
Yeah, right.

1202
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,320
Or a paid DVD purchase or a paid CD purchase.

1203
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,120
That's their assumption.

1204
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,920
So they multiply that by 10,000, square that.

1205
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,700
And that's where they come up with that number, which is totally made up because it assumes

1206
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,080
that every single person who took something when they saw an opportunity to get it for

1207
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,460
free would have paid money for it had they not seen that opportunity.

1208
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:38,740
Right.

1209
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,280
Yeah.

1210
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,040
Yeah, it's a bit faulty logic.

1211
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,400
And like Econ 101, price and demand.

1212
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,220
When they start the study, like...

1213
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,940
You know, there's a relationship between them.

1214
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,200
Right.

1215
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,420
I would only watch The Lone Ranger if it was free.

1216
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,700
Yeah.

1217
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,740
I would only watch The Lone Ranger if all the Indian maidens were all bare naked.

1218
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,160
But that doesn't have anything to do with what they're trying to do to our minds right

1219
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,460
now.

1220
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,980
They're blinking in little hexagonal figures into our heads.

1221
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,820
And they tell us to do all kinds of funny things.

1222
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,080
Well, not usually funny, ha ha ha, that way, but...

1223
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,260
But they don't have to do that.

1224
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,200
All they have to do is put on stupid sitcoms and get the same result.

1225
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:15,920
People are going to be like, oh, I'm not going to do that.

1226
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,460
People are sitting there watching the sitcoms.

1227
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,080
Big Brother doesn't have to watch you as long as he knows you're watching.

1228
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,200
That was another slanted study.

1229
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,520
What you're watching.

1230
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,060
He created that.

1231
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,080
So...

1232
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,140
Literally.

1233
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,140
So I...

1234
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,360
Yes.

1235
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:29,780
So what?

1236
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,100
So, hell, that's all...

1237
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,260
It's a bunch of BS.

1238
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,820
It's just all a bunch of BS.

1239
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,580
Well, you can bare your chest or you can bare your entrails.

1240
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,520
You know, baring your chest, you do a gorilla-like thing like I revolt against this revolting

1241
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:43,820
situation.

1242
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,440
And then you run away and hide.

1243
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,940
For seven years.

1244
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,440
Maybe nine years.

1245
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,360
Because you can't bear it.

1246
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,580
You just can't bear what they're doing to you, friends.

1247
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,000
Well, it's like...

1248
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,200
Yes?

1249
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,260
It's like Jerry Lewis said.

1250
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,360
I'm sorry.

1251
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,560
Yes, yes, yes?

1252
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,180
Yes?

1253
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,300
No, I was just saying it was like what Jerry Lewis said.

1254
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:10,520
Like Jerry Lewis said.

1255
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:10,920
I'm sorry.

1256
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,700
Like Jerry Lewis said before...

1257
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:13,800
I'm sorry.

1258
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1259
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1260
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1261
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1262
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1263
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1264
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1265
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1266
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1267
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1268
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:13,800


1269
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,360
Do you remember the actor's union of...

1270
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,140
I think it was 1952.

1271
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,380
No, he didn't say that.

1272
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,040
He didn't.

1273
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,920
That doesn't even approximate what he was trying to say.

1274
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,760
His wisdom was so vast.

1275
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,180
His countenance was so beatific when he looked at you with that cute smile.

1276
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,100
Jerry Lewis?

1277
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,540
Yeah.

1278
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,140
Yeah.

1279
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,880
He's a genius in France.

1280
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,380
Wait a minute.

1281
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,480
You weren't supposed to say that now.

1282
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,380
Alan, I was supposed to have already forgotten what he said at the conference.

1283
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,120
Oh, no. Yeah, that's right.

1284
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,800
Okay, I'm going to whittle myself away from the situation by pretending I didn't say anything at all.

1285
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,940
That's what we all do, Dave.

1286
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,500
We all sit around pretending you didn't say anything at all.

1287
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,700
Unfortunately, there are people out there recording stuff off the Internet.

1288
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,320
It's automatically utilized.

1289
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:12,660
Dave, you and Susie the Flusie got a compliment on one of my Facebook affiliates.

1290
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,920
Official subgenius pages, the subgenius foundation.

1291
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,500
Oh, her breasts are much lovelier than mine.

1292
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,820
That's what someone was saying.

1293
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,760
Well, no, they were saying they didn't know who's they loved best, Susie's or yours.

1294
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,220
Yeah.

1295
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,260
They said, I don't know who I love best, the cowboy or Susie.

1296
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,940
They didn't mention me, I noticed.

1297
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,140
After all these years of manhood, we're both wearing the same cup size of bra by now.

1298
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,840
Does Bob have a Twitter account?

1299
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,420
A Twitter account?

1300
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,180
There are so many people using the name.

1301
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,080
Bob Dobbs with Twitter accounts.

1302
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,900
Who cares?

1303
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,280
I'm just kidding.

1304
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,360
I heard about their IPO coming out.

1305
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:58,100
I get the feeling it's going to start sucking even more now that it's publicly traded.

1306
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,900
It's going to have to.

1307
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,540
I mean, just think of the way things move in geometric speed.

1308
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,280
When something happens and like five things happen as a consequence of that,

1309
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,000
and then 20 things happen as a consequence of that, and then 100,

1310
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,300
and it keeps on going.

1311
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,780
And that's what you, you know, when you're driving home late at night after about four, five, 16 beers,

1312
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,940
that's what you've got to pay attention to.

1313
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,380
You've got to keep your eyes on that little white line.

1314
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,760
When you start seeing double, just close one eye.

1315
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,560
Yeah.

1316
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,860
That does not always work, actually, but I'd rather not go into that story.

1317
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,380
That's how I survived my 20s.

1318
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,980
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1319
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,740
Staring at the road through one eye.

1320
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,620
Sometimes you have to hold your hand over one eye because you're not coordinated enough.

1321
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,240
No, if you have to hold it.

1322
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:43,460
No, you have to hold it.

1323
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:43,460


1324
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,440
You have to hold one eye.

1325
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,720
If you have to do it with your hand, then you definitely shouldn't be driving.

1326
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,640
If we had known about our pineal glands.

1327
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,240
That would be going too far.

1328
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,540
Yes, yes.

1329
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,240
That's the threshold.

1330
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,100
And what about the combination of closing one eye and then only having one headlight working?

1331
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,640
Or having your pineal gland open again.

1332
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,340
By a damn steam truck.

1333
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,780
Well, you know who's in our driver's seat out in the parking lot right now and our fan?

1334
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,040
Did you notice?

1335
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,180
I didn't see, no.

1336
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,120
J.R. Bob.

1337
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,160
J.R. Bob's is sitting there slumped against the window.

1338
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,980
Guarding the car.

1339
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,020
Guarding the car.

1340
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,160
Because the thief was back last week.

1341
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,820
Right.

1342
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,400
Oh, yes.

1343
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,420
Rob knows.

1344
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,200
The devil's soul.

1345
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,620
We've all been hit by the Jager Meister.

1346
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,880
We've all been hit by the Jager Meister.

1347
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,440
You know what they never...

1348
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,380
It's raining tonight, though, so we'll be safe.

1349
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,380
They do not strike when it's raining.

1350
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,760
Fair weather.

1351
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,960
I shouldn't have said that out loud.

1352
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,640
Who doesn't?

1353
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,920
Who doesn't strike?

1354
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,560
Everything strikes in the middle of the weather.

1355
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,080
It matters not whether it's regardless.

1356
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:43,760
It matters not whether it's raining or not anymore.

1357
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,820
If I were going to take up a life of crime, I would think a rainy night would be the best time.

1358
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:48,840
Yeah.

1359
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,640
Well, it's the most atmospheric.

1360
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,200
And photogenic, that's for sure.

1361
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,840
Problem is how we wear glasses in the rain.

1362
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:58,920
That just makes things harder.

1363
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,360
Right.

1364
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,760
I can't wear contacts because my life's so miserable.

1365
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,040
I ran out of tears years ago, so I can't wear contacts.

1366
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,660
Yeah, I'm the same way, actually, Dr. Sinister.

1367
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,400
That's why I can't wear contacts.

1368
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,600
What can you do when your pineal gland wears out?

1369
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:12,680
Can you go to some ophthalmologist?

1370
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,160
Some ophthalmic cerebral cortex or something like that for that?

1371
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,180
I mean, where can you go when your pineal gland starts to shrink?

1372
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,120
Well, you have to have insurance for one thing.

1373
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:27,160
I have to get my eyelids replaced soon, but I don't know where the money's going to come from.

1374
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,820
And they consider that a cosmetic thing, our insurance company.

1375
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:31,420
That's cosmetic.

1376
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,840
And then you have to find a donor.

1377
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,300
You have to have somebody with a dream of...

1378
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,080
You don't have to have eyelids.

1379
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,780
Just put your hand over your face when you need to blink.

1380
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,640
Oh, great.

1381
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,180
Thanks.

1382
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:41,840
You know.

1383
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,340
I'm having nasal tumor.

1384
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,400
Donor's implanted and stuff.

1385
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,760
I can't find a donor.

1386
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,360
Why do they keep saying Obamacare when it's really Romneycare?

1387
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:59,480
Well, the best is when you ask them, don't you think the Affordable Care Act would be better than Obamacare?

1388
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,680
Oh, yeah.

1389
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,960
Obamacare is terrible.

1390
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,240
The Affordable Care Act.

1391
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:03,860
I can...

1392
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:04,860
Yeah, that one sucks so bad.

1393
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,200
Keep your government hands off my Medicare.

1394
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,080
Oh, there's a whole string of man-on-the-street interviews that demonstrates that effect.

1395
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,440
But you could do that with just...

1396
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:13,980
About any...

1397
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:14,380
Yep.

1398
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,780
Anything with two names.

1399
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,060
Think about how dumb the average person is.

1400
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,800
And by definition, half the population...

1401
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,340
Is half as smart as that.

1402
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:23,940
Is even dumber.

1403
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,840
Terrifying.

1404
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,660
We're getting near the end of this brilliant show.

1405
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,160
It's near the hour.

1406
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,720
Brilliant.

1407
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,420
Bloody freaking brilliant.

1408
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,020
The part where Stank said, you must all leave now.

1409
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,060
You must all leave now.

1410
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,920
You're all banned.

1411
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,780
Every one of you.

1412
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,500
Except for the ones who lied and said you were banned when you weren't really.

1413
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,700
You're the only ones who aren't banned.

1414
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,760
What the hell is that?

1415
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,480
And we're not banned.

1416
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,740
All those posers.

1417
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,700
Start rehearsing tomorrow.

1418
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,720
Because we're having a band reunion.

1419
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,120
Not that guy.

1420
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,380
Friends, you're unfortunately listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1421
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,840
For more information about that or anything, you can look at subgenius.com.

1422
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,860
Subgenius does not have an O in it, but dot and com do.

1423
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,660
It has two S's on the end.

1424
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,920
Don't forget that part, kids.

1425
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,580
Calm down.

1426
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,660
If you miss out on the double S's at the very end, your brown descendants is a pervert in

1427
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,020
Utica, New York or someplace.

1428
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:34,160
So always remember when you're smelling the church of the subgenius, there's two S's

1429
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,640
at the end of it.

1430
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,680
And that makes it a little bit funnier and easier for the kids to remember.

1431
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,900
Actually, that's my first name that has an O.

1432
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,400
It has two S's that make it funny.

1433
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,320
But let's leave that alone.

1434
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:50,180
It's got a pair of bird eyes in front of its nostril, doesn't it?

1435
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,820
It's because your first name is Mr. Smith.

1436
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,360
It has two S's in it.

1437
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,160
I get it.

1438
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,380
Hey, Dave.

1439
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:03,780
I, Evan Stang and Princess We Are Doe have been your hosts on this Hour of Slack with

1440
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:09,420
special guest stars, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Dr. Sinister, who's going to take over

1441
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,240
this microphone in about one minute.

1442
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:11,900
Hey, Dave.

1443
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,620
So I'm going to fade.

1444
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,520
Oh, go ahead.

1445
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,140
Dave, please call back for synesthesia, man.

1446
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,660
You're welcome anytime.

1447
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,480
I'm afraid I've spent all of my minutes.

1448
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,720
He's used up all of his phones.

1449
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,580
Oh, no.

1450
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,780
It takes him two hours to wind up the phone to use it for half an hour.

1451
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:28,900
Yeah.

1452
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,780
Well, next time you have the juice, man, please, please.

1453
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,080
Yes.

1454
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:33,860
Yes.

1455
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:34,340
My brother.

1456
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,860
They gave him one of those Oblonga phones.

1457
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,620
One of those Reagan phones?

1458
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,320
Yeah.

1459
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:41,920
Right.

1460
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,260
It was a Reagan phone, yep.

1461
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,140
Okay.

1462
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,140
I'm going to fade everyone out and let the whatever.

1463
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,500
I'm not sure what's going on.

1464
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,680
You could just see there were a lot of things going wrong in the world and nobody was saying

1465
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,540
anything about it.

1466
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:58,280
You know, Bob had long since faded from the present memory.

1467
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,340
Iron Man is a great story.

1468
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,240
You know, revenge.

1469
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:19,980
I have to say, I've been watching it for a while now.

1470
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,860
And when I heard that story, I'm like, yeah.

1471
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:22,420
Con.

1472
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,780
Coming up in just a couple days.

1473
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,320
Yes.

1474
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,540
All right.

1475
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,440
And I know I've already been told that I'm to refer to it as the con.

1476
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,540
You call it the con.

1477
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,260
I mean, you can call it the con.

1478
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,800
You can call it the con.

1479
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,160
No, I had a nerdy guy say, don't call it the con.

1480
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,020
You must call it the con.

1481
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,560
He called it the con.

1482
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,680
He's going to call it the con for now on.

1483
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,600
Do you think they were playing a joke?

1484
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,600


1485
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,600


1486
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:40,600


1487
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,900
I mean, because I'm going there.

1488
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,460
I'm going to the con in a couple of days.

1489
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,040
I'm going to make a little appearance there.

1490
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,620
And I thought maybe you could tell me what to expect because I've never been.

1491
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,840
Everybody talks about it.

1492
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,240
And I know that this is your thing.

1493
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,060
This is your wheelhouse.

1494
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,620
I like con.

1495
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,960
There's a lot of things there that I like.

1496
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,860
And most of the shows that I make or have gotten involved with.

1497
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,180
Captain Bob was in command of our sturdy little vessel.

1498
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,540
And you could tell he really hated his job.

1499
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,360
Well, like I always say, work is for people that don't know how to fish, especially when

1500
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,480
you're out here off the Mexican coast.

1501
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,580
Yeah.

1502
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,460
I'm out here on the Mexican coast catching 25, 30 sailfish a day on a good day and a

1503
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,460
good buzz and a bunch of naked ladies on a bad day.

1504
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,660
Listen, I know a lot of you thought the world was going to end on Saturday.

1505
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,340
Some of you even quit your jobs and sold your possessions.

1506
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,860
What a bunch of idiots.

1507
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,140
It seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type.

1508
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,880
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult, there's always a power hungry leader behind it all.

1509
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,340
I understand.

1510
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,400
I get it.
