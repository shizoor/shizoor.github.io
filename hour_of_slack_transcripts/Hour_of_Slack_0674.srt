1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,080
Are we ready to go?

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,280
Is this the sound system?

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,860
It's a good stiff microphone.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,940
This pulpit, however, is falling apart.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,700
That's alright. Heal it with a touch.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,500
Six. Five. Four. Three.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
Two. One. Ignition.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
The subgenius hour of sweat.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,240
Back to the temple.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,400
Back to the cave.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,960
Back.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,660
Back to the desert.

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,160
Back to the body.

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,380
Back to the jungle.

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,580
Back to the body.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,100
Back to the body.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,580
The body is magic. The body is magic.

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,580
There's magic in the body. There's magic in the dead body.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,000
There's magic in CHF fluid. There's magic in New Orl bOdy.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,080
There's magic on the floor. There's magic slaughtered in the rain.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,060
There's magic slaughtered in the rain. There's magic in the rain.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,700
zijn

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,540
Ver번

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,540


25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,440
Please sit tight, all of you.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,140
You may go apart.

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,800
From here on in, all reading apparatuses will be set at level three.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,940
At level three, please set reading apparatuses at level three.

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,580
From here on in until the finish of your excursion via platyto and the planetary windmill.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,440
Strap in, kids.

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,780
All of your earthly desires will be met via virtual reality in the console above your head.

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,060
Please access by pressing the button below your feet.

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,380
Plug in, kids.

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,840
The helmet will come down and cover your head.

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,640
And then we can go in there.

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,940
Then we can go away in this.

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,660
And then you go to sleep.

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,300
That's exactly right.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,240
You better fall asleep.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,300
Wait.

41
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,100
We'll make you fall asleep.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,440
Well, there.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,100
We had to.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,540
Of course, this was kind of a.

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,940
It's a shame that we had to be here.

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,140
But I'm glad that I had so many excuses to.

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,840
And just to get the assigned subject matter over with for the teacher.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,040
The subject matter was, I think I told them I would do something called the mask comes with the pipe.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
Well, since.

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,680
Yeah, well, not quite.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,900
I have a demonstration.

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,320
The mask literally really does come with the pot.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,440
We sell Bob masks for $50 and they come with a sacred Bob pipe.

54
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,480
However, the other way you can take that the mask comes with the pipe.

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,880
Well, how exactly would the mask would it be able to come without the pipe?

56
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,800
There's an orifice.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,580
There's the pipe.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
How does the.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,160
Mask come with the pipe?

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,320
Or is that an unfair way to describe a crappy mask of J.R.

61
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,540
Bob?

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:05,940
Dog?

63
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:19,440
Aren't there some masks that don't want a pipe that can only come with another mask, another Bob mask and some pipes that just aren't interested in being poked into some gross rubber hole?

64
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,420
Who just want another pipe?

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,300
And some just want to be a whole box full of masks and pipes all thrown together.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,420
Yeah.

67
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,420


68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,920
That's fine.

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,580
Who cares?

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
They can't take a job.

71
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,660
Shame.

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,460
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,460
The lights are so bright.

74
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,960
I can't hear the heckler.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,340
Pardon me if I ignore you completely.

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,980
The two sides look like they were about to get into it a little bit.

77
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,960
They've been ignoring each other mainly most of the evening.

78
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,300
But a fellow who's up here from Texas waited into the crowd and they moved in and broke it up.

79
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:51,700
Space.

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,160
Space.

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,860
Space.

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,880
A fellow who's up here from Texas.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,100
Many.

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,640
And we'll show him how to do capital punishment.

85
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,140
These Yankees are such amateurs.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,240
They only had about four or five ways to take him out.

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,480
We've got all the different.

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,740
God bless the free ministry.

89
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,740
And our ministry.

90
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,400
Will you wander through the wilderness?

91
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,500
Our ministry has every kind of extreme prejudice.

92
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,120
I don't know many people that are that serious.

93
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,340
We lose brothers and sisters every day.

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,640
We lose them every day.

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,620
We will know them one day.

96
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,900
We'll see them again.

97
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,080
We put them in the mulch pit and grow plants out of them.

98
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,440
And you see them again.

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,360
You don't even see them.

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,580
Persecution is the lot of the believer.

101
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,200
If you're not being persecuted, you have to wonder why.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,740
Then you ain't no kind of believer.

103
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,540
I can't get rocket motors in my neighborhood.

104
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,060
I have to drive miles to get rocket motors.

105
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,420
Radio just went off the air.

106
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,440
That means the war is over and the earth is finished.

107
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,640
I just like to tell you that you've you know, you helped.

108
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,520
You know, you flip my world over.

109
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,000
You try to turn it upside down.

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,180
I don't know why I don't like to get off.

111
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,840
First.

112
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,620
First.

113
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,760
We must get off.

114
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,220
First.

115
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,320
We must get off.

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,800
First.

117
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:13,220


118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,500
First.

119
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,940
First.

120
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:15,700


121
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,800
Get in front of your speaker.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,860
Kneel down in front of your radio.

123
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,400
And we will move on to Mars.

124
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,320
We must get off.

125
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,680
First.

126
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,380
We must get off.

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,340
We will destroy it.

128
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,960
We will destroy all who stand in our way.

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,200
All who stand in the way of Bob.

130
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,480
We must get off.

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,360
First.

132
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,520
First.

133
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,400
First.

134
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
Now who's going to talk for you on Earth?

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,600
Who's going to get a witness?

136
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,180
Earth.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,580
Who's going to put out the fire?

138
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,340
Blow it off.

139
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,320
Blow it up.

140
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,340
Just go and blow it.

141
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,940
Friends, send that $30 in.

142
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,520
Who's going to talk for you?

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,960
We must get off.

144
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,740
Who's going to talk for us?

145
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,360
Spread.

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,280
We know who speaks for the nation.

147
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,120
But who speaks for Earth?

148
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,800
Who speaks for Earth?

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,220
Cold billions of steel.

150
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,040
Hundreds of tons.

151
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,440
Red-white for the final rise.

152
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,820
The exits are coming.

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:09,840
No luxury.

154
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,820
No comfort.

155
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,100
No delight.

156
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,240
Suffering at every corner.

157
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,060
As prophesied by Nostradamus.

158
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,520
And J.R. Bogdan.

159
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,980
Well, that's what he meant anyway.

160
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:21,800
First.

161
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,460
Earth.

162
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,280
First.

163
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,140
Earth.

164
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,040
First.

165
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,260
Earth.

166
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,260


167
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,260


168
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,260


169
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,260


170
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,480
Earth.

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
We must get off.

172
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,960
We must get off.

173
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,740
First.

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,000
Earth.

175
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,440
Earth.

176
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,440
Earth.

177
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,280
First.

178
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:33,780
Earth.

179
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,320
Earth Farm 1.

180
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,560
Earth, First.

181
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:37,800
Earth.

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,320
Earth Farm 1.

183
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,160
Earth, First.

184
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,040
This was only the first of the Earth Farms.

185
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,920
We have destroyed the land of Avian Haiti.

186
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,320
First Earth Farm 1.

187
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,940
We will enslave it.

188
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Everything.

189
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,700
We will enslave the planet Earth.

190
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,240
We will enslave the planet Earth.

191
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,580
We will enslave the planet Earth.

192
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,100
Thank you for your charism.

193
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,220
We will take you away from now on earth.

194
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,220


195
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,240
Earth Farm 1,起.

196
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,240


197
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,760
The sun.

198
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,520
The tiny artichokes.

199
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
The sun should be a second.

200
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,740
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

201
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
We would turn it on and off.

202
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,480
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

203
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,720
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

204
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,160
Every centenius would be able to turn off a star simply by praying for five seconds.

205
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:23,020
And that, very simply put, dear friends, is the way it's been done for billions and billions of years.

206
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,180
And that's the way we did it for eight and a half hours, I guess.

207
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,520
I did it, man.

208
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:39,820
I managed to deliver my new science versus religion rant to a convention full of pagans, dear friends.

209
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,820
New agers and other assorted religious nuts at the Winter Star Festival up in Ohio.

210
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But I dressed that secular hero.

211
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:01,620
Humanist Dobbsian rant up in so many little gags and plays on words that I had those folks completely charmed.

212
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,460
Just like a snake in the hen house.

213
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,500
Ah, yes.

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,380
The harvest.

215
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,080
And only later was it that it sunk in of what I'd actually been saying to them.

216
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,580
And even then, some of them got it wrong.

217
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,380
This one old gal came up to me at a party afterwards.

218
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,480
She's a nice looking old gal.

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,740
And she goes, you're a patriarchal Bob religion.

220
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,740
And she said, you're a patriarchal Bob religion.

221
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,020
And she said, you're a patriarchal Bob religion.

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,140
And I was so happy to launch into the tirade about, well, I guess you haven't heard.

223
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:41,780
Madam, sir, ma'am, Connie Dobbs and her dag-blasted Connie types have been running this stupid mail-order cult since 1982.

224
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,180
And that's still not enough for you?

225
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,160
That seemed to kind of throw her off.

226
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,300
She didn't want to admit it.

227
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,700
No, she actually hadn't heard that, dear friends.

228
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,940
But it was a great winter star.

229
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:08,900
The two main superstars that were going to be at this weird convention, Sir Robert Anton Wilson and Magnus the Magician, both fellows of Genoi, had to cancel.

230
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:17,500
Which allowed me and Einstein's Secret Orchestra, heard in the background here, to get a whole lot more attention.

231
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,400
And I got to preach my sermon while Cantor Chaz played.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,860
With his huge organ.

233
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,980
You know how those Smith boys are.

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,180
And that was just our excuse for having the psychedelic space jam in Cabin 15 heard currently in the background.

235
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,700
You know, actually, it wasn't just Einstein's Secret Orchestra or ESO.

236
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:49,000
It was ESO plus ACE, or the Association of Cosmic Encounters.

237
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,380
Mainly, Ron Slater.

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,820
And I was looking for a band that would play on many synthesizers.

239
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,300
Plus Jeff Rosenbaum on guitar, Victoria Ganger on congas, and Joe Rothenberg on theorem.

240
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,380
And ESO ACE, one might say.

241
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,100
I was looking for an anagram of what that band would be called.

242
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,620
And came up with O.C.S.

243
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,320
O.C.S.

244
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:21,480
This endless combination of two bands of outlaws representing the cutting edge in pagan swamp trance.

245
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,200
Which?

246
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Which?

247
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,420
Disco.

248
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,880
That's what I did my last Friday and Saturday night.

249
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,040
And we also recorded hours of live radio show and a bunch of basement studio tape.

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,440
Most of which sounds like a bunch of four-year-olds blabbering away to each other in a sandbox.

251
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,160
Just as if they were paying any attention at all to each other.

252
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,160
And that's what we're stuck with for this show.

253
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,060
And I don't know what else.

254
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,100
But let's just go on.

255
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,480
On, on, on, deeper, deeper in.

256
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,200
Look to the phone.

257
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,100
Day four.

258
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,660
See the morning dancer crossing the sky.

259
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,520
3-5-1-5 anywhere on the planet Earth.

260
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,660
I see we have an unprecedented 11 listeners today.

261
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,780
How many we actually do have today?

262
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,360
Unprecedented 11 million listeners.

263
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,520
Unprecedented 11 million.

264
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,740
Unprecedented 11 million.

265
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure we have a lot of people here.

266
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,740
And let me tell you, we've got a lot of people here.

267
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,240
A lot of people.

268
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,240


269
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,240


270
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,240


271
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,240


272
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,400
Not all the time.

273
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
But during perihelion.

274
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,440
Venus has the prettiest perihelion of any orbit I've ever seen.

275
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,820
That's not to say much.

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
I don't want to say anything about Uranus.

277
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,280
Don't.

278
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,640
There's the bell.

279
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,100
You know, you cannot.

280
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,220
You cannot even talk about the solar system without mentioning that.

281
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,200
It just ain't done.

282
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,840
The bell is tolling.

283
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,220
This time they do toll for ye.

284
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:02,700
Yea.

285
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,340
They toll.

286
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:03,800
Thou.

287
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
They toll and they toll.

288
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,440
They all end up on their heads eventually, every one.

289
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:16,360
But they all meet on the other side if Bob or someone remembers to flip the tape.

290
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,040
Where are you, Dave?

291
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,900
He's lonesome tonight.

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,080
What?

293
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,080


294
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,260
Lonesome Cowboy Dave must be driving MY car.

295
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,960
Any of my fleet of cars.

296
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,600
All of the church car—

297
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:28,900
Friends?

298
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,920
The church...

299
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,600
The church delivery van!

300
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,060
It was in the shop.

301
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,620
It was broken down.

302
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,880
The starter chain's bad.

303
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,280
The timing chain is bad.

304
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,940
The timing chain.

305
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,000
The timing chain's gone.

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,240
Time control issue.

307
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,260
I think if we could...

308
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,820
We all got everybody who's listening, everyone who's listening right now, to pray for your timing chain.

309
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,960
No, pray for Dave's alternator.

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
That's much more immediate.

311
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,180
Pray for Dave's alternator.

312
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
Dave's alternator.

313
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,760
There's ten people on.

314
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,520
That's pretty good.

315
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,160
The alternate Dave.

316
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,420
That's ten people listening by the internet and overseas.

317
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,240
Yes.

318
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,760
The bell is tolling for Dave's alternator.

319
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,240
Dave is the most alternated of all escaped mental patients.

320
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,760
Country western singer.

321
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,460
Trance spouter.

322
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,080
He's the alternated cowboy.

323
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,840
Holy man.

324
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,720
He's the alternate holy man.

325
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,400
It shall be, in the end, the showdown in the middle of Main Street.

326
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:36,680
Bob and Dave and Bill Gates over in the back waiting to shoot the winner in the back.

327
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,660
Bob and Dave square off, ready to slap leather and go for it.

328
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,140
An old lady sneezes over in the crowd.

329
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,620
Actually, that was July 5th, 1998.

330
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,820
The subgenius emotions were the equivalent old lady sneezing in the crowd.

331
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,980
And at that moment, Bob, they both slapped leather.

332
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,860
And Dave killed Bob.

333
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,580
Slap him.

334
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,640
Bob fell over dead as a man.

335
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,760
Slap him.

336
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,340
On Main Street.

337
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,360
And Dave was so horrified at what he did.

338
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,420
Plus, the old lady in the audience got shot by Bob.

339
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,780
Dave.

340
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,140
If Dave was at home, he'd be called by now.

341
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,300
That means he's on the road again.

342
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,820
Dave was so shocked and horrified with what he did.

343
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:28,540
With remorse to have killed his personal savior, the living avatar of Slack, the center of the luck plane of the universe.

344
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,640
Dave just turned that gun around and blew his own brains out.

345
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,140
But he was in hell.

346
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,760
And it didn't work.

347
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,780
It just started up again.

348
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,820
Unlike his car in this particular hell.

349
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,300
Our slimy protozoan father.

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,040
In moist sailor heaven.

351
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,020
Hallowed be thy tissue of name.

352
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,440
In shallow, brothy, tropical pools.

353
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,600
Beyond life.

354
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,080
Beyond life.

355
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,360
Anybody can come any way, any how, and we accept them.

356
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,600
Cold, persistent fingers swarmed over my body.

357
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,820
Tugging at me.

358
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,700
Sucking me away from the machine.

359
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,340
And then.

360
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,240
His hands were so white.

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,860
The body was so white.

362
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,700
It looked like somebody shot the baby Jesus and laid him there by the garbage cans.

363
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,460
And what would the baby Jesus be doing in the corner of 14th and 9th?

364
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,100
In the middle of a plutonium storm.

365
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,380
In the middle of a plutonium storm.

366
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,460
Well, he sure wasn't looking for his baby.

367
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:50,940
Yeah.

368
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,560
From the looks of his pocket,

369
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,660
he sure wasn't looking for a place to buy a beer.

370
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,600
Man, the cat was empty.

371
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,560
See what I'm saying?

372
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,500
Like, uh, he was an empty vessel, man.

373
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,660
That's all I could say about him.

374
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,460
Nobody knew where he came from and what he was trying to do, you know?

375
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,380
And then when he slipped off that one night, everybody knew he was going over the edge.

376
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,140
Somebody saw him walking towards the river, man.

377
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,580
Going right over FDR Drive, man, all the traffic coming at him.

378
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,520
It's just like staring straight at the river, man.

379
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,320
He's crazy.

380
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,980
You know, but everybody knew that it was...

381
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,940
It was, you know, because he was different.

382
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,060
His body was different, you know?

383
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,340
His body was different.

384
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,300
His body.

385
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
There's something wrong with it, man.

386
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
There's something different, isn't there?

387
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh, yeah.

388
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,140
Oh, yeah.

389
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh, yeah.

390
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,820
Oh, yeah.

391
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:42,820


392
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,360
Oh, yeah.

393
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:43,740
Oh, yeah.

394
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,660
Oh, yeah.

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Oh, yeah.

396
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,700
Oh, yeah, yeah.

397
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Oh, yeah.

398
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah.

399
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,400


400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,400


401
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,400


402
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,760
All right.

403
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,420
Oh, yeah.

404
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:05,780
All right.

405
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, yeah.

406
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,100
Oh, yeah.

407
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,100


408
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,100


409
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:06,380
See?

410
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,860
Here you are following the G-Dancy.

411
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,940
It's up to about 4 Gs.

412
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,340
But you are psyched up, handmade.

413
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,840
Even letting God to move switches.

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,620
No problem.

415
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,680
Here you are coming up on Stanford.

416
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


417
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


418
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


419
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


420
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


421
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:24,680


422
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,980
Here you are coming up on Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the Cabin 15 Space Jam at Winterstar.

423
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,740
I guess with Ron Slade, I guess he would call this a live recording.

424
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,760
If only you could see the girls that were dancing.

425
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,180
And the things that were dancing too.

426
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,660
And all the boys filming everything.

427
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,540
That was Shut Down by the White House.

428
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,140
In the future, every character will be Bob Dobbs.

429
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,600
And there won't be that much variation though.

430
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,980
It will just be a planet of all white male Caucasian salesmen selling crap to each other.

431
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,940
Buying crap and shoving the pipe into the mast one way or another.

432
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,080
Praise Bob, who cares?

433
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,980
He's so proud of us.

434
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,020
But if Bob says it, he sold it, we smoked it, that settles it.

435
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:29,940
So, the other thing that we had to talk about, and this gets a little scarier folks, is the Y2K bug.

436
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,600
Or the so-called Millennium Bug.

437
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,820
Oh, and it said that that would lead into an examination of rival end of the world religions

438
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,580
and their various excuses.

439
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,920
Well, I really don't care about that.

440
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,220
There's a joke though, there's a joke that's been going around about how,

441
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,220
oh, you know, the dark ages were caused by the Y1K bug.

442
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,320
That's a pretty funny joke the first time I heard it.

443
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:09,800
But you know, if you look at the history of it, friends, it wasn't the Y1K bug that started the dark ages.

444
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,540
It was really the Y0K bug.

445
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,540
And that's a real mean thing to say, actually.

446
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,920
That's a kind of a gross, because the Y0K bug itself is just a bug.

447
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,680
It didn't mean to start the horrible chain reaction that it did, I'm sure.

448
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:38,760
And, you know, but really, a thousand years before the Y1K bug, the Y0K bug was born.

449
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,180
And this religion, the Church of the Subgenius, officially, we have nothing against insects.

450
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,400
Okay?

451
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,220
In fact, we don't dislike bugs.

452
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,800
In fact, some of us are what you would call insect sexuals.

453
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,240
We're into bug porn.

454
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,140
And check our website out if you don't believe me.

455
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,680
And, you know, to us, we're not worried about the Y2K bug.

456
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,700
That's just more bug pornography, guys.

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,040
More bug porn, no problem.

458
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,020
The Y0K bug, that's more like the kinky, old-timey bug porn.

459
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,460
You know, that's got its own attraction.

460
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,180
But we don't care!

461
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,600
To the true subgenius believer, the Y2K bug is the last thing we're worried about because we're going to be out of here.

462
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,800
July 5th, 1999, I'm sure that's what Bob really meant.

463
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
And Nostradamus agreed with him.

464
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,740
If you read Nostradamus, same exact date, that's about 100 days from now.

465
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,800
And so we don't care.

466
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,120
We're going to be out of here before any of those Y0Ks come.

467
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,120
Because we're K-ride up.

468
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,840
We're slide home free, baby!

469
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,700
We're slide home!

470
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:01,040
There you are, in the same room, the same dingy style.

471
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:07,760
The same cell block, the same ward, the same...

472
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:21,080
The same inscrutable eye, panning down on you day and night, as you stare at the floor and count the clock.

473
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,220
No, friends.

474
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:33,140
The world is coming to an end, but it never comes to an end.

475
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:38,180
It goes on and on and on.

476
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,020
And friends, that is hell.

477
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,960
There is no salvation in a world without end.

478
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,800
Everything must stop and at least take a breath.

479
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,700
At least look around and smell the flowers.

480
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:08,620
Yeah, when the world comes to an end, I expect I'll be right there with you.

481
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,680
At your side.

482
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,940
Handing out little glasses of Kool-Aid and hanging up your burnt clothes with my...

483
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,780
With my Styrofoam cup.

484
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,400
Standing by that tricycle over there with a fireman's suit and a hat.

485
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,020
Ha ha ha ha ha!

486
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,420
No chance!

487
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
No chance in hell!

488
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,000
No chance in hell!

489
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,920
No chance in hell!

490
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,480
I've made my plan.

491
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:47,980
I've made my plan.

492
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,780
You're all gonna die for love.

493
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,840
But you're still gonna die.

494
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,740
And I'll be gone.

495
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,980
And I'll be gone.

496
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,960
And I'll be gone.

497
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,340
And I'll be gone.

498
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,980
And I'll be gone.

499
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:05,980


500
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:05,980


501
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,900
You have no idea what love is,

502
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,840
You're leaving aboard...

503
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,840
Because you'll be from What's people are?

504
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,080
You'll just be...

505
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,980
And I know you

506
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,480
You did it sweetly

507
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,180
You're my girl

508
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,960
You're my sweet little ring

509
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
You got me teething

510
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,920
And I know I love you

511
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,540
You did it sweetly

512
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,520
You're my sweet little ring

513
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,440
And I know I love you

514
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,780
You did it

515
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,260
You did it

516
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,100
You did it

517
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,380
You did it

518
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,720
You did it

519
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,420
You do it

520
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,480
You do it

521
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,880
You'll never know when you've got a heart that's not stopping

522
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:50,400
You'll never know when you're in love with me

523
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,120
You touch the tree with your coat full of vinegar

524
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,620
You do the sweet and you're my girl

525
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:11,920
Get it on, get it on, get it on

526
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,240
Get it on, get it on

527
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,140
Get it on, get it on, get it on

528
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,920
You got your boots and your shoes and your stockings

529
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:05,320
You're waiting while you're here

530
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:16,280
You feel like you've got to get down and start again

531
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:25,100
You feel like you've got to get down and start again

532
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,140
Dirty sweet flat and flat

533
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,540
Don't look back and I love you

534
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,520
You're dirty sweet oh yeah

535
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,380
Dancing you want so let's dance

536
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,780
Ain't no chance of understanding

537
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,600
You're dirty sweet

538
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,780
You're mine

539
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,100
You're mine

540
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,780
You're mine again

541
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,280
You're mine again

542
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,100
You're mine again

543
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
One love

544
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,880
Earth

545
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,060
We must get off

546
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,640
We must get off

547
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,780
Get off the roads

548
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,260
Man it off

549
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,480
Man it off

550
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,080
Man it off

551
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


552
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


553
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


554
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


555
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


556
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


557
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,080


558
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
That's a hot one.

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,820
Choose a new name or two.

560
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,160
For your sweat name, try one with the letters of the first and last name of the same.

561
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,840
Like, Toward Tammy, Carla Come Ons, or Precious Peaches.

562
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,940
Or, choose a name that refers to your favorite body part, like,

563
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,400
Lotta Top, or Betty Bottoms, or Lotta Legs.

564
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,400
Or, have a silly little name like, Cha-Cha, Fifi, Hard Cora,

565
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,440
or the Reverend Susie the Floozy.

566
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:30,080
Now, for your goddess name, I want you to choose something that sounds more ancient and classical,

567
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:42,960
like, Anya, Baba Yaga, Ishtar, Zora, or Rainbow Buffalo Corn Woman.

568
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,620
You can change your consciousness by changing your clothes.

569
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,580
It must be hard changing clothes in one of those foreign car trunks.

570
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,140
Practice the body exercises before going on the mind trips.

571
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,760
Now, join us as we demonstrate some very pleasurable exercises

572
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,280
designed to increase your sexual energy.

573
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,720
It's best to do them just before making love.

574
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,660
I don't know where this 40-foot stripper came from, Johnson,

575
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,420
but you've got to jab her with that sedative before she bumps and grinds this town into oblivion.

576
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,880
Holy cow, Chief!

577
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,140
Holy cow!

578
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,140


579
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,980
How come I always get these assignments?

580
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,680
Boys, boys, can't you see?

581
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,220
That horrible mutant was sent here to punish us for our sinful ways.

582
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,180
It's the Lord's will.

583
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,700
I'll save your sermon for the pulpit, Padre.

584
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,220
Now, open up your pelvis with the peek-a-boo pump.

585
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,860
That's right.

586
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,340
Pump that lump.

587
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,140
And pump that lump.

588
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,620
Pump that lump up and down.

589
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,820
Come on.

590
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,120
Breathe it up.

591
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,300
Bring it on down.

592
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,620
Come on.

593
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,740
Don't stop.

594
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,320
You can do it.

595
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,660
Another exploding collar.

596
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,820
What collar?

597
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,300
It's been exploding all night.

598
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,240
Well, that's all a rocket motor is, is a channeled explosion.

599
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,220
Hey.

600
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,560
That's all a sneeze is, or a number of other expulsions of human eclupia.

601
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,720
A controlled channel explosion.

602
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,960
And if you do it hard enough...

603
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,120
You could, well, maybe not reach orbit philosophy, but at least get pretty high.

604
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,900
Well, that's how so many people have spontaneous combustion and so forth.

605
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,260
It's because the level, when it starts to oxidize in their bodies and stuff,

606
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,160
and they can't get it out quick enough, the membranes, the actual mucal membranes,

607
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:43,440
will somehow get involved in the foray and contribute in their own small way to having the whole person blow up.

608
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,100
The mucal membranes?

609
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,780
I guess they become under, I guess it's over 500.

610
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,640
500F or 1200C, they become the most flammable objects on your body.

611
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,700
The mucous membranes?

612
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,120
Yeah.

613
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,420
Well, that's why I shoot those hoses, those fire hoses at my nose every night.

614
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,580
To clear that stuff out, because otherwise I don't want it to get too hot and catch on fire.

615
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,640
Like what happened to my car, Dave.

616
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,100
You have a car?

617
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:11,820
I had a car.

618
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,080
We have a pineapple on you, Dave.

619
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,640
I have a car in the shop.

620
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Only it's not even in the shop because...

621
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:24,080
Because I can't give the shop what they need.

622
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,200
Yes.

623
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,980
They need your permission, Dave.

624
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,200
They need you, Dave.

625
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,280
They need you, the alternated man.

626
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,860
The man from the alternator, to go into my timing chain

627
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,520
and apply the time control that only you, Dave, as leader of the free world, can do.

628
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,420
Only you, Dave.

629
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,480
As an alternator, see, I can only go in two different directions at one time

630
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,620
because I'm both achromatic and bicep.

631
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,820
I'm biceaxophonist.

632
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,900
Well, you don't do it.

633
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,020
You do the other time the next time.

634
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,620
You go back once and forward once.

635
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,160
You don't have to do both.

636
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,500
It's the achromatic.

637
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,540
Right.

638
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,400
You would be the pipe cleaner of the timing chain.

639
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Exactly.

640
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,660
Well, see, I get temporal distension when I go through them little holes.

641
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,660
I get my pubic area gets so distended that I lose all concepts of human earth time

642
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,180
and I just get as flaky as hell.

643
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,620
I don't know how you guys...

644
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,420
Have you been pulling apart your DNA strands again, Dave?

645
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,460
Yeah, I've been pulling.

646
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,580
He does that.

647
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,800
That's what he does when he's bored.

648
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,340
Some people chew their fingernails.

649
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,400
Dave untwists his DNA strands.

650
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,420
I've got what I call a stripper.

651
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,440
That's a really odd hobby.

652
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,420
Unfurling DNA chains.

653
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,640
Well, it's not really a hobby.

654
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,900
I do expect to win a Nobel Prize for doing it.

655
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,560
It's more like an obsessive compulsive disorder.

656
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,240
I'll say.

657
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,380
A personality disorder.

658
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,900
That's really, really deep.

659
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,580
It's like constantly touching your beard.

660
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,220
I'm missing you here in the spaceship tonight, Dave.

661
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,600
Where are you guys headed?

662
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,800
Oh, we're never headed anywhere in particular.

663
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,880
We were gonna go check out...

664
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,160
We were just waiting for you.

665
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,800
That's the only reason we ever do this.

666
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,440
The plan...

667
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,220
I think the plan is gonna be to hook a...

668
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,620
You know, put a skyhook into Halley's Comet next time around.

669
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Take it for a ride, but...

670
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,540
We got a lot of testing to do.

671
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,460
We can't get that far out.

672
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,640
We can't even get into orbit yet.

673
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,660
So we were hoping you would be there.

674
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,640
It's all daevalous here.

675
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,620
Yeah, I don't know.

676
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,260
A skyhook.

677
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,720
That don't sound too plausible.

678
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,020
Because, you know, those things going by with a lot of mass and velocity and all them

679
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,600
things floating by look like little kernels of corn ahead of the net.

680
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,980
It would be dangerous for sure, but we figured that's...

681
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,320
That's why we can't do it.

682
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,560
That's why you have to do it.

683
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,360
There's a big net.

684
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,720
And we have this...

685
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, we got something better than that lawn chair with the dog leashes on it.

686
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,120
We're gonna use a big trash can with the dog...

687
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,320
And it has a lid and everything.

688
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,420
And you'll be able to have a little tiny radio transmitter in there and a TV camera.

689
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,820
Well, do I still get to wear the dog suit, though?

690
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,840
Well, if you...

691
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,260
You can wear...

692
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,880
Yeah, that's your...

693
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,360
Whatever space suit you want to wear.

694
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,300
But it needs to be as long as it's airtight.

695
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:54,680
I heard they have the big moon pants.

696
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,020
Huh?

697
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,580
I would assume you'd want to wear your...

698
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,040
You have to have the moon pants.

699
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,600
Moon pants.

700
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,100
Did you see that really cool monkeys in moon pants logo they got?

701
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,500
Thou shalt not shat thy moon pants.

702
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,740
That is...

703
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,540
That should be the first commandment, Stang.

704
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,160
I'm telling you.

705
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,640
Moon pants with bubble wrap underwear.

706
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,000
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's rocket ship.

707
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,660
Or thy neighbor's moon pants.

708
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,300
Because his...

709
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,940
His...

710
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:18,940


711
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,320
You know, as incontinence spreads throughout the land, as they said in that one survey,

712
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,380
as the vapid bourgeois empty state of whatever it was...

713
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,760
Moon pants.

714
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,880
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy rocket ship.

715
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,940
Thou shalt not breach the vacuum seal of thy moon underpants.

716
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,020
Thou shalt not be a fool.

717
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,380
Thou shalt not be a fool.

718
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,040
Moon pants.

719
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,240
Moon pants.

720
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,020
Moon pants.

721
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:18,940
Moon pants.

722
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,460
My dear father, 67 years old, they have called you a pure saint.

723
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,680
You would have been proud if they had stayed.

724
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,940
You wouldn't have had all this pain.

725
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,420
Part fully?

726
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,420


727
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,740
Power?

728
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,760
valeo.

729
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,460
Yeah, come on.

730
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,760
Inhale as you bring your bunnies down.

731
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,140
Exhale as you bring them up.

732
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,740
It's a very powerful tool. Try it.

733
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,180
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.

734
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,720
That's love.

735
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,260
She was the town's bad girl when she came.

736
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,380
An alcoholic and a thief at 14.

737
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,800
You ought to see her now.

738
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,760
She's got a light around her.

739
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,740
That's a pretty good one.

740
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,180
And then the other thing I was supposed to cover

741
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,400
was the mask routine again.

742
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,520
In particular, I was thinking, well, I could talk about the way

743
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,620
that most of us have to disguise ourselves

744
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,520
just in order to work with others

745
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,780
in, quote, normal society.

746
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,840
But on the other hand, you've already been through that.

747
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,240
You all have to do it yourselves.

748
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,180
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

749
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,080
What's a little more interesting to me,

750
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,940
than having to act like another dumb shit on the job

751
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,640
so they'll treat you like an equal,

752
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,320
is the masks that people use on the internet.

753
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,080
Now, not everybody is necessarily doing that,

754
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,080
but I don't know if you...

755
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,840
The false fronts that people find themselves naturally...

756
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,600
Since nobody knows you didn't shave,

757
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,660
and they don't know how old or young

758
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,620
or how many sexes you might be,

759
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,020
or any of that stuff, really,

760
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,680
you can impart your very inner self,

761
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,040
and they can see the real you,

762
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,280
which isn't some jobless loser

763
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,180
still living in his mom's house

764
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,120
and hasn't had a date in 20 years.

765
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,660
No, you're that hero of that sci-fi novel

766
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,920
that you were reading.

767
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,220
And not only that,

768
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,560
you can be several of those false fronts.

769
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,400
Now, recently,

770
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,420
and I've actually had quite a bit of experience with that

771
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,020
because I've been dealing with weirdos

772
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,520
that use funny names and fake...

773
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,340
identities,

774
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,880
some of them several levels deep,

775
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,800
as in the old gag of

776
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,300
they'll never find me with two masks on.

777
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,500
You know?

778
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,340
Especially if one mask looks just like the other mask.

779
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,140
That really throws them.

780
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,900
And if the bio-L3 masks look just like you.

781
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,300
And when they're not at the door,

782
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,300


783
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
On either side of the 대해서 that he had a point to make,

784
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,000
he wasn't as clever to try toening out his condition

785
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,500
as he was.

786
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,060
No, I'm going to be on a flight essen to sit down

787
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:06,880
with my chyba-I.

788
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,080
Because that structure yes it can't work.

789
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,480
Just get in a Patrol plane.

790
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:08,580
Take off my stunt boots,

791
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,260
and I'll take the kids out there,

792
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,720
my old school shoes,

793
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,720


794
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,720


795
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,160
Balloon day.

796
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,400
You're popping your skin.

797
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,600
That's what I heard, man.

798
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,940
I mean, it's a...

799
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,640
It sucks.

800
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,540
It really sucks out there.

801
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,760
It literally sucks.

802
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,820
But don't you love it in the movies when they show the guy and the airlock goes

803
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,640
and then he, like, starts imploding or whatever it is, you know,

804
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,120
and his eyes get real weird and stuff?

805
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,960
That gets kind of ugly, doesn't it?

806
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,580
Oh, some of them do that for fun.

807
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,740
They stand inside the airlock and they let just a little, you know,

808
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,740
little by little they crank the vacuum down until their eyes are bugged up

809
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,000
like Arnold Schwarzenegger's.

810
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,660
And then they, you know, fill it back up with air real fast, just the last minute.

811
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:53,600
It gives you the bends, the micro-bends, which is like the little death, they call it.

812
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,420
It's a...

813
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,380
You know, drugs don't work for these kids, these astronauts anymore.

814
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,380
No, they don't need drugs.

815
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,020
They've got their own little necro-supply right in their own bodies.

816
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,340
All they've got to do is fool around with the wrong stuff.

817
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,720
Oh, just a lackluster...

818
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,260
A lack of gravity would be, like, a terrible trip to me.

819
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,860
I hate it when that happens.

820
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,520
I hate zero-g myself.

821
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,860
I mean, it's supposed to be real fun, but I want to puke the whole time.

822
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,520
That's why I'm staying here and letting you have the trash can, man.

823
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,960
You get to be the first subgenius into space.

824
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,400
Well, I don't mind being the first.

825
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,980
If you get your car started.

826
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,640
Come on, you little bit traveler.

827
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,360
Sit down.

828
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,660
Center.

829
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,680
Go back down.

830
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,480
The ladder of genetic memory.

831
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,700
Come on, you divinity.

832
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:07,000
I guess the other secret is, don't take yourselves too seriously.

833
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,720
When you start...

834
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,000
When you start to turn into all those new...

835
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,900
When you start to release your inner child,

836
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,500
you better not take that too seriously,

837
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,460
because pretty soon the inner Charlie Manson's going to want it.

838
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,720
Oh, you can take your inner Charlie Manson just as seriously as your inner child.

839
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,760
You know what I'm saying?

840
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,980
So, but really, that $30 to Bob Dobbs,

841
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,940
sure, it may just buy you a few hundred pages of the funniest reading material

842
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,140
and most valuable contacts of friends.

843
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:38,720
You know what I'm saying?

844
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:38,720


845
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:38,720


846
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,920
For people you never believed could even exist.

847
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,720
But the main thing is, you'd spend that much on a rock concert nowadays, friends.

848
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,160
And when you spend it on Bob,

849
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,380
it proves that your own life, free of the conspiracy,

850
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,520
is worth at least $30.

851
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,460
That's what you're really saying, is that you're worth $30.

852
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,200
And you will be spending that much on some prancing rock star instead,

853
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,640
and that's why we're going to raise our prices soon.

854
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,200
But friends,

855
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,800
that's all water under the bridge.

856
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,220
It's beside the point.

857
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,060
Who cares?

858
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
Because, sure, it's true.

859
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,500
Bob Dobbs prophesied that July 5th, 1998,

860
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,300
the exes would come, the subgenius believers,

861
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,000
that spent their $30 would be ruptured up

862
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,080
into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses of most dose.

863
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,600
Oh, no, I mean planet X.

864
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:38,560
And, well, it's true that it didn't exist.

865
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,980
It didn't exactly happen on schedule.

866
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:47,140
And, well, like I say, we're sure, we know that he really meant 1999, July 5th, 1999,

867
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,820
Dos Equis, friends, XX Day,

868
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,120
or as we call it, Next Day.

869
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,280
The exes are, friends, ladies and gentlemen,

870
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,260
as we say, spread wide for the final ride.

871
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,520
Because the exes are coming.

872
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,720
And that means you will be,

873
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,160
you will be going to Earth.

874
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,580
If there's one thing that we can,

875
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,700
that the Church of the Subgenius has to say to everyone now is this,

876
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,800
Earth, we must get off.

877
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,480
We, you know, we can blow it up or we can blow it off.

878
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,680
But just don't blow it, friends.

879
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,940
Send that $30 in before the, before you Heaven's Gate yourself.

880
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,840
You know, it could have been,

881
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,700
I just can't stand it.

882
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,000
I mean, I've had friends that were disappointed that the saucer,

883
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,480
that they didn't get to destroy the Earth and ride the saucers for $30.

884
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,880
Maybe they should be glad that Heaven's Gate didn't get to them first.

885
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,080
They'd be missing a lot more than their $30.

886
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,520
Ugh.

887
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,880
But friends, you know, just the one important lesson.

888
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,500
It's probably true that the first X Day was an important lesson

889
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,280
that some subgenius believers needed to be taught.

890
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,140
But it also taught us an even more important lesson.

891
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:20,320
We can't depend on aliens or gods or even Bob Dobbs to save us.

892
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,880
And yet we must get off.

893
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,760
So that leaves only one conclusion.

894
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,340
Build your own ship.

895
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,940
Now you may not have to, but you should just cover your ass.

896
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,260
And if you're not going to do it,

897
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,000
if you're not good at building solid fuel launch rockets

898
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,920
that can in fact be rather dangerous,

899
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,140
then steal your own ship.

900
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,260
On the way to Brushwood this summer,

901
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,000
depending on where you're coming from,

902
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,680
stop by Cape Canaveral.

903
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,340
Stop by Area 51 out there in Nevada.

904
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Stop by Hangar 18 in Ohio.

905
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,320
You know, steal your own ship.

906
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,500
Stop by NASA.

907
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,940
Get the guidance systems.

908
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,440
God knows we need those.

909
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:16,120
We need to find one time, one time in the whole world

910
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,740
to be alive and to die.

911
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,300
What would that one time be?

912
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,180
Would it be at the end of the 20th century?

913
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,060
Or would it be the beginning of the 14th century?

914
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:37,260
Or when, when, when would you like to live and leave this planet?

915
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,000
Everybody, everybody's got a chance to go.

916
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,960
But only one I know.

917
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,440
Yeah, the one with the big cat-like eyes.

918
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,360
And me.

919
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,420
We're going to.

920
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,620
No, to.

921
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,780
We're going to.

922
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,900
Another reality.

923
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,080
And.

924
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,660
See around the fire.

925
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,440
The fires that will burn the whole solar system.

926
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,480
Yes dear friends, well everything has been Einstein's Secret Orchestra tonight.

927
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,220
Pretty much really.

928
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:53,640
Almost all from the Winter Star Weekend sponsored by ACE of Cleveland.

929
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,860
That's actually ACE, the Association of Consciousness Exploration,

930
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:05,880
which you can reach on the internet via www.roge.com.

Dot com.

934
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,460
Einstein's Secret Orchestra can always be accessed at post office box.

935
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,320
I got that pencil ready.

936
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,520
81555.

937
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,380
That's box 81555.

938
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,800
Cleveland, Ohio.

939
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:34,880
4418.

940
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,350
181.

941
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:45,090
A special thanks to WCSB in Cleveland for broadcasting so many.

942
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,230
And to ACE for.

943
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:57,210
And Susie the floozy collaged some of the material heard in the middle of the show with especially the Annie Sprinkle.

944
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,830
God.

945
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,210
Crackpot lady stuff.

946
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,910
In the background right here.

947
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,510
Now Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

948
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,610
Life at Winter Star.

949
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:21,350
Recorded by myself with Ron Slabe as guest synthesis and God only knows who else cranking away in there.

950
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:34,890
Friends, you can always find out more about the Church of the Subgenius by writing to Bob at P.O. Box 118.

That's P.O. Box 1403.

955
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,690
Dallas, Texas.

At subgenius.com.

958
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,110
Lane.

959
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,370
Down by the South 40.

960
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,710
Over by Miracle Mile.

961
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,890
Over to the pit.

962
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,950
And praise the Lord.

963
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:28,270
Are you talking bad on my festerings, buddy?

964
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,450
Hey, where I come from, these festerings are a badge of honor.

965
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:34,690
I'm a fester.

966
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,650
It's a sign of a man.

967
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,590
A man who's festered for his country.

968
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,150
Many folks praise their festerings.

969
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,610
I'm going to be a delightful fester of festerings.

970
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,970
I've festered for that B-dotted head for 29-on years.

971
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,410
Meanwhile, Skeech and Scooch have skickers and skickers all over their heads.

972
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:56,710
Skickers here and skickers there and skickers everywhere.

973
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,530
Where am I speaking to?

974
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:58,430
Me.

975
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,790
Me.

976
00:53:58,990 --> 00:53:59,570
Where am I speaking to?

977
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,310
Me.

978
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:01,510
Me.

979
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,990
Me.

980
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,550
Yes, we are.

981
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,850
We really are, Matthew.

982
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:22,850


983
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:22,850


984
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:22,850


985
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:22,850


986
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:23,150
你有 GRE liter, LUCAS Leave your hand up there.

987
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,150


988
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:23,150


989
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,790
The story is coming along.

990
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,670
Can you alive?

991
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,390
She's to you well.

992
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,610
I love her.

993
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,870
She's my best.

994
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:29,870


995
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:31,050
How Come She's Dead?

996
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,130
If you read the old page.

997
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,610
The Howard Shaso Boothesz www.dogs film magazine.com.

998
00:54:35,570 --> 00:54:41,670
Embrace this ancient circle coil of mothers and fathers.

999
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,070
Back to the source.

1000
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,710
Magical healing support.

1001
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,190
Curling back to primeval beginnings.

1002
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,770
An open chain of life.

1003
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:50,990
Pee deeply.

1004
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,010
Pee deeply into the bag.

1005
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:59,030
Now arrange the following mucal fluids in the following crystallographic order.

1006
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,450
Blue, nasal fluids and sinal fluids.

1007
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,730
Pee deeply into the bag.

1008
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:18,210
Many things appear while you're peeing deeply and it is nothing to fear.

1009
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:20,790
Nothing at all.

1010
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:22,350
No, no, Princess Wee.

1011
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,810
You have to get any closer because your voice doesn't...

1012
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:28,870
Your voice isn't as piercing as Dave's.

1013
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,550
About this far away.

1014
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,670
Yes.

1015
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:34,250
You get in deep and get in real.

1016
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:38,670
Indian build small fire.

1017
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,610
Sit in close.

1018
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,730
White man build big fire.

1019
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,610
Sit far back.

1020
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,890
Indian build high volume microphone.

1021
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:48,250
Get in close.

1022
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:48,830
Whisper.

1023
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:49,370
Indian.

1024
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,870
White man.

1025
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:51,530
White man.

1026
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,170
Fire.

1027
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,910
Your fire kills the Indian man.

1028
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:56,810
Indian man.

1029
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:57,110
Indian man.

1030
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:58,790
Indian man.

1031
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:00,110
Indian man.

1032
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,110
Indian man.

1033
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:01,650
Indian man.

1034
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,310
Now I know how my dog feels.

1035
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:14,730
Now I know how my dog feels.

1036
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,670
He feels with his little doggy hands, like all dogs do.

1037
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,730
He walks on little doggie feet and he thinks with his dog mind.

1038
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,230
How dare you upset the order?

1039
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,070
How dare you upset the major on such a way like this?

1040
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,110
His tongue was not a good enough hand.

1041
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,650
Thanks.

1042
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:31,650


1043
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:31,650


1044
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:31,650


1045
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:31,650


1046
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,490
So I gave it a thumb.

1047
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:39,630
My dog and his opposable thumbed tongue

1048
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:44,170
is one hand and the other dog there, Puddin,

1049
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,330
is the other hand.

1050
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,410
You know, just one is the left hand.

1051
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:53,090
Fido is the left hand and Puddin is the right hand.

1052
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,770
And together they can break into any art museum

1053
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,630
and steal the finest, finest paintings,

1054
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:04,670
most valuable industrial secrets.

1055
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:08,230
Why, with these two-handed tongue dogs,

1056
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,430
I can rule the very world.

1057
00:58:55,430 --> 00:59:00,570
I can rule the very world.

1058
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:18,010
I can rule the very world.

1059
00:59:35,210 --> 01:00:00,530
I can rule the very world.

1060
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:28,030
I can rule the very world.
