1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,020
The Strange Doctor Weird.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,780
Good evening. Come in, won't you?

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,100
Why, what's the matter? You seem a bit nervous.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,240
Perhaps the cemetery outside this house has upset you.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,240
But there are things far worse than cemeteries.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,120
For instance...

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,300
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,380
All right, fellas, here's your story.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
A man by the name of Bob once saved our world with an arc of electricity.

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,860
Bob is recovering from wounds received in the battle.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,900
He's got a broken carbone and a bad headache.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,320
Good.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,980
And now, before giving you the details of the battle,

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,220
I bring you...

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,640
a warning.

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,180
Every one of you listening to Bob,

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,800
tell the world.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,640
Tell this to everybody, wherever they are.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,400
Under no circumstances take action against Bob.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,120
Watch Bob.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,300
Watch out, he's got a gun!

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:10,820
Keep looking.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:11,580
Watch.

24
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,660
Keep watching Bob.

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,460
Fuck you, man.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, anybody around here want some coffee?

27
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,600
No.

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,160
Nothing counts except Bob.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,860
Watch it.

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,460
Anybody want some coffee?

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:21,920
No.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,000
Then just shut up.

33
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,400
Watch it.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,040
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,120
Right, you hayseys, it's a stick-up!

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,120
Everybody freeze.

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,140
Everybody down on the ground.

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,040
Well, which is it, young fella?

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,200
You want I should freeze or get down on the ground?

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,800
You mean to say, if I freeze, I can't rightly drop?

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,820
And if I drop, I'm gonna be in motion.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
You see...

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,240
Shut up!

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,400
Okay, then.

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,600
Now for our next experiment.

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,060
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,760
Bob.

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,740
Ee-bee-slash.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,540
War zombie.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,360
No.

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,780
I'll be alright.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,200
I got the door braced good and there's no outside windows.

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,000
But because this would be a great headlining act, of course, it's kinda limited, but it

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,040
would pack him in, and all I've got to say, no, no, this isn't a gag.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,060
Folks, I'm telling you, this is a...

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,940
No, no, no.

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,380
And so, the beginning of the monster movie itself.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,260
It's Incense Around, Super Eastman Cinefile,

59
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,080
Super Sit Around,

60
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,260
Dinerama,

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,420
and Todd AO.

62
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:47,780
Really?

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Okay, I got so worked up from that last caller's call

64
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,880
that I had to go out and have some ice water.

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,200
3D digitally projected bunion cream.

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,180
Yes, there it all is.

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Zipping off the silvery steam with 272 woofers and tweeters

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,760
stapled to the back of the fat man.

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
Whoa, look what I found.

70
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,940
Here we go.

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,960
Well, you tell me what's the purpose in this.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,560
You tell me what's the sense, what's the good of it.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,200
Get lost.

74
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,500
A tale told by an idiot full of sound.

75
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,920
And fury signifying.

76
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,560
Bob?

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,060
How do you suppose that happened?

78
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,660
Oh.

79
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,620
Cheat, yeah?

80
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,140
Goodbye.

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,020
Oh, wait a minute.

82
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,420
Nice going, Bob.

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,120
I was down in Australia when the Waco debacle ended.

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,500
The fiery inferno.

85
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Which we all saw.

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,180
And I was really bummed I was not here for it

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,320
because I thought it was the most fascinating news story of the year.

88
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,600
Bar none.

89
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,740
And everyone was so pissed off.

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,340
And I was like, I'm not going to talk about that guy

91
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,640
because he called himself Jesus.

92
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,960
And I was saying, come on.

93
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,780
The guy's real name is Vernon.

94
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,640
Let him be Jesus for a couple of months.

95
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,680
What's it to ya?

96
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,340
Who's going to follow a messiah named Vernon anyway, you know?

97
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,380
You got to call yourself Jesus.

98
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
It's sort of part of the messiah deal.

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,400
And Vernon spoke and he spaketh and he sayeth.

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,220
You know what?

101
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,280
Let's go get some beer.

102
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:18,520
Wee!

103
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,740
You know, Vernon.

104
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,860
Just didn't have the necessary speech.

105
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:22,860


106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm not going to talk about that.

107
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm going to talk about the spiritual weight that I'm looking for.

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,340
But anyway, isn't that weird too how everyone snaps in our country and thinks they're Jesus?

109
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,780
How come no one ever snaps and thinks they're Buddha?

110
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,000
Particularly in America where more people resemble Buddha than Jesus.

111
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,320
I'm Buddha.

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
You're Bubba.

113
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,620
I'm Buddha now.

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,800
All I got to do is change two letters on my belt.

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,940
Bubba.

116
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Buddha.

117
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,460
Vernon's a false prophet.

118
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,380
Isn't that weird though?

119
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,100
You know, and all this is funny.

120
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,040
It's real funny because these Australians had a big contingency in the compound that burned down.

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,180
And they were of course curious.

122
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,040
And I'm from Texas.

123
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,540
And I actually went to the compound the seventh day of the siege because it was right outside of Austin.

124
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,100
And I went to it.

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,540
But these people in Australia were like, oh, Bill, isn't he such an oddball?

126
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,460
Isn't he so odd?

127
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,760
He's such a strange character.

128
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,740
And I'm thinking, well, let's think about this.

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:47,240
Frustrated rock guitarist with a messianic complex, armed to the teeth, trying to fuck everything in skirts.

130
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,100
I don't know how to tell you all this.

131
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,400
But it sounds like every one of my friends.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,660
I'm waiting for the Eric Johnson compound to come out, you know.

133
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't know.

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,140
I don't think Eric's frustrated.

135
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,440
But anyway.

136
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,180
And they said, you know, they had to break down the compound because child abuse was stepping up.

137
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,560
Well, that's true.

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
How come we don't see Bradley tanks knocking down Catholic churches?

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,800
You know, I mean, if in fact child abuse is your concern.

140
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,580
Actually, folks, I don't know if any of you all have seen this.

141
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,640
It's a tape kind of bootleg going around of showing film of the Bradley tanks not knocking, as the official story was, small holes to insert tear gas.

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,820
But crashing the building off of its fucking foundation and fire shooting out of the tanks.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,460
The FBI and the ATF are liars and murderers.

144
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:58,240
And Janet Reno and President Clinton either A, knowingly passed on a lie, or B, are so out of touch with their own fucking arms or their government that they're incompetent and Clinton should be impeached immediately.

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,180
Case fucking closed.

146
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,780
And you all have probably seen the footage.

147
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,980
But it's sort of different than the official story, isn't it?

148
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,460
Small holes, tear gas, giant holes, flamethrowers.

149
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,980
They burn these people in their homes.

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Okay.

151
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,140
That's our government.

152
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,940
Okay.

153
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,260
I've seen the tape.

154
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,440
And I don't know.

155
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,340
It's fucking real.

156
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,580
And whatever.

157
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Make your own conclusions.

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,860
You haven't seen it.

159
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,680
So it's, you know, whatever.

160
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,580
But old Clint, you know, I have no illusions about these cocksuckers.

161
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,720
I know there's 12 guys who run the fucking world.

162
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,780
And they own every company.

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,440
And, you know, it's fact.

164
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,900
You can look it up.

165
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
I'm not a conspiracy nut.

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
This is all on paper.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,000
There really are 22 families who run and own 50% of the mainstream media, which is where we get our news.

168
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,340
And it's true.

169
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,120
It's a fact.

170
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,080
You can look it up.

171
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,700
I don't know.

172
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,360
You know, I can't be this big of an asshole without having the truth to back me up.

173
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,400
Otherwise, I'd be a fucking nut doing this.

174
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,300
But, see, if you have the truth with you, you can do this.

175
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,000
Gee, I'm starting to sound like Koresh, aren't I?

176
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,320
Fuck.

177
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,360
People have often said I remind them of Koresh.

178
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm like Koresh, only without the guns or pussy.

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
So, basically, I'm just an annoying fellow.

180
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,120
But, uh, and frustrated rock guitarist, too.

181
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,320
I'm just an annoying fellow.

182
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
What's up with that?

183
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,500
Dog poop.

184
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,480
No one's a viper without a cap.

185
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:38,800
You're just told to use a knife.

186
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:38,820
I think I'm a bitelse now that you're reading a book.

187
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:38,820


188
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:38,820


189
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,280
It's not safe

190
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,620
Oh, hey, guy.

191
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,400
Instead of saying I'm telling it all, to hear you talk about it, you know.

192
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Well, we can't you talk.

193
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,660
What you won't bet that all you gotta do

194
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,020
Is open up your eyes and you'll wake up screaming

195
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,260
And you realize that it's all come true

196
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,980
Hush now, don't you believe it

197
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Cover your head and close your eyes now

198
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,520
Take it or leave it, go back to bed now

199
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,160
Don't you cry

200
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,540
Half a million soldiers fly across the water

201
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,120
One in ten never coming back again

202
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,540
Fifty thousand sons that never grew to fathers

203
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,760
Don't you ever wonder who they might have been

204
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,400
Oh

205
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,400


206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Oh

207
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,840
What if you could have been there on that day in Dallas

208
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,500
What if you could wrestle back the hands of time

209
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,400
Maybe something could have been done in Memphis

210
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,060
We wouldn't be living in a dreamless life

211
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,820
Hush now, don't you believe it

212
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,240
Cover your head and close your eyes now

213
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,140
Take it or leave it, go back to bed now

214
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,980
Hush now, don't you cry

215
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,940
Hush now, don't you cry

216
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,020
Hush now, don't you cry

217
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,020


218
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,020


219
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,020


220
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,180
Hush now, don't you cry

221
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,180


222
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,160
Hush now, don't you cry

223
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,040
27

224
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't turn me down

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000


226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,900
And my magic will let you hear this

227
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,120
iPod

228
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,640
Put down your keyboard

229
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,060
Alarm bell

230
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,120
Chop chop chop chop chop

231
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,200
secrets go on tell yourself that you don't want to know it's best that you believe you don't hear

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,200
the footsteps that follow you around no matter where you go maybe you were thinking that it

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:10,280
didn't matter maybe you believe nobody else will care but once you've added every little lie

234
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,720
together you finally find the truth

235
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:30,880
it should be painfully obvious to everyone around us by now that you know we're nearing

236
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,460
the end times for sure now it's not just really okay we're getting closer to the end times

237
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,980
what are you doing about it you're still going to work or school coming home

238
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,260
doing your job you're still going to work you're still going to work you're still going to work

239
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:46,620
watching the war all day film archives what will happen to your routine when all the

240
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,700
comes down on us at once what are you going to do then

241
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,160
don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet

242
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,940
no good fact is it's too late anyway so you know you just need to have a good time and look for

243
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,720
the place where you can get the most slack

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
we know where that is

245
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,460
such childish small tiny children

246
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,640
now a little good christian as one half pulled it out of his bosom and began to try

247
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,280
now one half amazed break out break out break out pass from giant wreck bosom

248
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,480
pluck it out of thy bosom and try

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,440
from heaven

250
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,780
overthrow

251
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,540
from myself

252
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,840
stu has known asking brother

253
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,980
to dramatic

254
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,100
considerably larger and her

255
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,040
uh... we're active

256
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
the place of the story shot begin daily

257
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,100
understand or know

258
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,360
spent on we're growing babies you don't miss Elijah

259
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:00,740
I

260
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,120
are you going to become

261
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,140
all at one time

262
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,440
the

263
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:04,780
that

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,880
but even however also answered

265
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
will this last week

266
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,660
map

267
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:09,760
program

268
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,540
I think we've just seen the antechamber to terror.

269
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,720
We haven't even begun to see what we can do to the major population.

270
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,240
God has got to take a lot of blame for this.

271
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,620
Let Christ be hanged.

272
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,920
And I know I'll hear from them for this,

273
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,200
but God has got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked.

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,760
And when we destroy 40 million little innocent Democrats and Republicans,

275
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,300
God will point the thing in their face.

276
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,060
In other words, I point the thing in their face and say,

277
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,600
you pagans, you abortionists, the feminists throwing little innocent babies out of the school,

278
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,660
down the steps of the school, the pagans.

279
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,660
Jesus knows everything about you.

280
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,640
The abortionists.

281
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,780
He knows who you are.

282
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,520
The feminists.

283
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,060
Where you live.

284
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,420
The gays and the lesbians.

285
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,440
Everything you've done.

286
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,920
Tried to secularize America.

287
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,560
So there's no sense in trying to hide.

288
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,480
All of them.

289
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,980
You might as well confess it.

290
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,420
You've got to take a lot of blame for this.

291
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,300
In other words, God has got to take a lot of blame for this.

292
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,280
As I fought off the enemy of a fifth adopter of modern evangelism,

293
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,040
this is our victory.

294
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,500
So God said,

295
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,160
Yo, brother, you're talking about most of my relatives.

296
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Well, yeah.

297
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,480
Well, yeah.

298
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,220
Let me challenge you as to the validity of your salvation.

299
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,720
I want the babies in their face and say,

300
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,440
you babies, you helped this happen.

301
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,740
And I know I made the gays mad.

302
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,020
I really destroyed the nation on its knees.

303
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,980
Examine yourself and see if you're in the faith.

304
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,820
We're totally Christ haters.

305
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,100
Pat, did you notice yesterday,

306
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,940
Democrats and Republicans,

307
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,920
God lifestyle,

308
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,280
as they called out to God in prayer and sang,

309
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,680
God,

310
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
let the ACLU be hanged.

311
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,080
Let the ACLU be hanged.

312
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,260
Amen.

313
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,100
Let the ACLU be hanged.

314
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,140
I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush.

315
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,680
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too.

316
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,360
I saw Jesus at dinner time,

317
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,480
shoving the stone.

318
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,740
That Jesus is everywhere.

319
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,520
I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush.

320
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,660
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too.

321
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,320
I saw Jesus at dinner,

322
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,880
swimming in the stew.

323
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,940
I saw Jesus at dinner,

324
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:12,940


325
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,820
That Jesus is everywhere.

326
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,360
Jesus down by the river bed.

327
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,780
Jesus laying down by me.

328
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,040
Jesus down by the river bed.

329
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,920
Jesus came into me.

330
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,620
Jesus by the river bed.

331
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,640


332
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,060
Jesus laid down by me

333
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,280
Jesus by the riverbed

334
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,260
Jesus came into me

335
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,520
I saw Jesus in the morning in the burning bush

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,140
I saw Jesus in the afternoon too

337
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,040
I saw Jesus at dinnertime swimming in the stew

338
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,280
Jesus is everywhere

339
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
Jesus is everywhere

340
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,900
Jesus is everywhere

341
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,540
Jesus is everywhere

342
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,700
Jesus is everywhere

343
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,520
Jesus is everywhere

344
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,740
Jesus is everywhere

345
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:02,740
You know, Boogie Boy, who used to be the Devil Boy

346
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,900
has been reborn

347
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,160
and he's coming out tonight, people.

348
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,520
He is here tonight

349
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,100
and he is coming to sing with Devil.

350
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
Hi there, Long Beach.

351
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,060
You know,

352
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,760
we used to do Devil music

353
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,440
like that band Devo.

354
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,940
But then,

355
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,040
Jerry over here,

356
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,440
he sat down on a Bobby Dylan record

357
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,960
and the Lord came into him

358
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,280
and now we do music alone.

359
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,160
Hey!

360
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,100
You might be an ambassador

361
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,180
to England or France

362
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,520
You might like to gamble

363
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,460
You might like to dance

364
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,960
You might be the heavyweight

365
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,600
champion of the world

366
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,020
You might be a socialite

367
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,140
with a long string of pearls

368
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,620
But you gotta serve somebody

369
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,980
Yes, you've got to serve somebody

370
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,880
Well, it may be the Devil

371
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,340
Or it may be the Lord

372
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,840
But you gotta serve somebody

373
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,440
Well, you might be a punk rocker

374
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
Dancing on the stage

375
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,140
Money, drugs at your command

376
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
Women in a cage

377
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,480
You might be a businessman

378
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,440
A high-colonic freak

379
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,960
They might call you a freak

380
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:02,960


381
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:02,960


382
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,460
They might call you a doctor

383
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,540
And they might call you chief

384
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,480
But you gotta serve somebody

385
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,800
Serve somebody

386
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,060
Yes, you've got to serve somebody

387
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,900
Serve somebody

388
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,620
Well, it might be the Devil

389
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,080
And it might be the Lord

390
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,700
But you gotta serve somebody

391
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,020
Serve somebody

392
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,040
Well, you might be a state trooper

393
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,980
Or another kind of jerk

394
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,240
You might be the president

395
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,940
Of some new country

396
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,700
Or a big TV network

397
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,020
You might be rich or poor

398
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,080
You might be blind or lame

399
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,220
You might be living in another country

400
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,200
And there needs another name

401
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,080
But you gotta serve somebody

402
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,380
Serve somebody

403
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,400
Yes, you've gotta serve somebody

404
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,460
Serve somebody

405
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,200
Well, it might be the Devil

406
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,700
Or it might be the Lord

407
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,340
But you gotta serve somebody

408
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,680
Serve somebody

409
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
Serve somebody

410
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
Forgive somebody

411
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,840
Serve somebody

412
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,840
Serve somebody

413
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,860
Serve somebody

414
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,780
Serve somebody

415
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,980
Serve somebody

416
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,940
Serve somebody

417
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:20,940


418
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:20,940


419
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:20,940


420
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,700
Throw a pile out before dark

421
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,620
Save somebody, boogy

422
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Thrust a chainsaw

423
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,340
Thank you.

424
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,020
Thank you.

425
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,380
Thank you.

426
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,820
Thank you.

427
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you.

428
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,160
Praise God, brothers and sisters!

429
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,200
The important thing, friends, is, it's like, what is this subgenius thing all about?

430
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,140
What is the important thing that distinguishes a subgenius?

431
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,120
From a human being?

432
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,540
The ability to with-read the coolness in Bob's face.

433
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,720
That's all it is!

434
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,640
We all have a different definition.

435
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,980
If you start asking somebody, some subgenius, what they believe in,

436
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,040
you'll get a different answer from each one.

437
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,900
But the one thing they all have in common,

438
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,880
at some point, they looked at Bob's face and said,

439
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,220
that guy's cool.

440
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,360
I don't know why.

441
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,460
Maybe he's kitschy, maybe he's calf.

442
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,500
Maybe he really just looks good looking.

443
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,000
Maybe he really looks like your dad.

444
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,300
Maybe it's simply that he is Bob!

445
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,680
And that face is the center of the luck plane!

446
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,900
Why not?

447
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,880
Does anything else make any more sense, really, when you get down to it?

448
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,180
Math, maybe, but then that breaks down on the quantum level, so...

449
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,920
You know, is there any way to truly have slack?

450
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,380
There's an old prayer, a subgenius prayer, by Reverend Lemuel Atom, that goes,

451
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,860
Dobbs, grant me the serenity to endure the pinks and humans I cannot kill,

452
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:19,400
the courage to stuff the ones I can, and the wisdom not to do it when the cops are around.

453
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,400
Praise Bob!

454
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,780
Praise Bob!

455
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,820
Woo!

456
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,900
Praise Bob!

457
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,180
Bob!

458
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,760
Bob!

459
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,960
Is it we have left?

460
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,120
Chameleons?

461
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,600
What?

462
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,780
They don't even know one.

463
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,500
This one's so living, like my turf.

464
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Was this true, so now they hope you can smash cool and walk down the weed of financial heaven?

465
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,020
He's no one in the ocean with my sea slack.

466
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,360
Praise Bob!

467
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,340
The man's a frog.

468
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,900
I'm a hopping toad in the mud of the freaking Valkyries of Siegfried.

469
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,980
Hey, he's a real man.

470
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,240
He's a giant man.

471
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,040
He's Paul Bunyan.

472
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,880
He's a giant man.

473
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,220
He's a giant man.

474
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,220


475
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,220


476
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,320
Well, I'm going to get that accident and Bob, and Bob, and Bob's a real man.

477
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,820
I'm living in a...

478
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,680
When are you going to let me out of this spot?

479
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,400
You know, Bob is like the Elvis of gurus.

480
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,980
Have you ever thought about it that way?

481
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,760
Yes, since he has left the building.

482
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,320
But he keeps reappearing.

483
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,740
People know that he lives up there in Minnesota somewhere in a trailer park disguised as a

484
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,840
garbage carrier.

485
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,140
Only just to collect the rent periodically, to take from those who no longer receive the

486
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:34,880
slaking of their spiritual thirst, they are preyed upon by Bob's sloth and lethargy.

487
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,620
Lesson two tells us conservation and transmutation. He is sluggish and slow.

488
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:48,920
Really the tropical Bob is? Tropical, topical, popsicle Bob is just the same

489
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,900
slowness and sluggishness.

490
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:06,860
This is a place for crazy people. I'm not crazy. We don't use that

491
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:14,780
term crazy, Mr. Cole. We've got some real nuts here. Come out, come out, wherever you are.

492
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,900
You say you don't know Bob, but I know you.

493
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,320
Honey, why there ain't nothing to it. All you got to do is bee bop.

494
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,600
Bee bop, bee bop, bee bop, bee bop bee bee bop bee bee bop.

495
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,960
At last it's come down to this now, the final do it yourself in times relive.

496
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,680
Capital A.

497
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,460
For swinging mutants and terminal abnormals.

498
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,400
S H.

499
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,900
Even though people like Bob's slugging is not always good, it's a good thing.

500
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,940
You morons know these are the end times.

501
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
Welcome to the end times.

502
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,000
But Reverend Hal, Reverend Hal.

503
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,680
S H.

504
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,440
People ask this question of me all the time. Do I really need to remain entirely human any longer?

505
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:15,400
I'm sorry, your humanity must be abnegated and proscribed. For in the wonder world of tomorrow, it will no longer be an asset and may actually prove a hindrance.

506
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
Children ask me, can I stay a teenager while I'm a child?

507
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
Are you able to stay a teenager while mastering the appearance of adulthood?

508
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,980
S H.

509
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,220
If the child has a secure lock on his door, he may master what he likes in the privacy of his atelier.

510
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,340
It is now 417 AM.

511
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,380
S H.

512
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,360
Will I be able to turn water into gasoline?

513
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,600
You may be able to gasify more than water.

514
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,280
S H.

515
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,840
Look at that word, such genius. Anybody could qualify it. It has nothing to do with brains.

516
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,280
That is correct.

517
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,620
S H.

518
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,140
It's not intelligence, it's how you use it.

519
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,360
Once again, Dr. Drummond's sentiments are elevated and correct.

520
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,540
A subgenius has nothing to do with brains.

521
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,980
Genius is health.

522
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,060
One chuckle is worth four claps.

523
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,800
They don't have to hear me. There's nobody home.

524
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,500
When I'm clear, I'm not a lot of help.

525
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,120
If someone's in trouble, I can help.

526
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


527
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


528
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,580
I can be here.

529
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,720
I was very confused.

530
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
I'm going to go there.

531
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,920
For you, Angel.

532
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,240
I'm going to hell when I die.

533
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,920
I like to see how I'm brainwashing myself.

534
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,860
Yeah, I could go to hell when I die.

535
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,740
Whose business are you in?

536
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,400
Everything you said, I'm turning it around as you speak.

537
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,380
I'm going to hell.

538
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,060
If I am chaotic, that's very powerful.

539
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,680
When you die, you're going to go to hell.

540
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,100
It feels right brainwashing myself.

541
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,040
You know, I'll hold your hand.

542
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,420
We'll go talk to the government. How's that?

543
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,820
I'm not so interested in myself.

544
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,420
I'm going to teach them more chaos.

545
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,080
I'm so physically exhausted.

546
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:13,020
I'm sure that's where all your worst threats lie.

547
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,060
But be prepared to bring the worst horror here.

548
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,520
It's enough if you do.

549
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,600
Please prepare...

550
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,260
JSX

551
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:16,780
Let us teach you, Pour.

552
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,060
Because they're doing evil things for you.

553
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,060


554
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,060


555
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,560
Amazing time savers, aren't they?

556
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,520
Modernization denied.

557
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,380
But you can go in here, my friend.

558
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,920
No, no, I don't want to go in there.

559
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,760
Oh, yes, just take a look at it.

560
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,180
Flowers are so beautiful.

561
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,040
No, that's not for me.

562
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,460
This is the nature garden, my friend.

563
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,380
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.

564
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:37,820
It's okay.

565
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,660
Remember, fear is attracted to fearful things.

566
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,300
It is attracted to strength.

567
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
It is attracted to weakness.

568
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,420
Power.

569
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,300
Lack of power.

570
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,740
It is attracted to milk.

571
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,660
It is attracted to sour hot dogs.

572
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,160
It is attracted to french fries.

573
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,080
You're scaring me, man.

574
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,980
Jeez, of the idiot.

575
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,000
Are you afraid of me?

576
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,540
You're just disgusted by my presence.

577
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,120
They're nice presents.

578
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,320
I feel shame.

579
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,660
Don't feel obscene.

580
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,920
No one here hates your bowels.

581
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,620
We like the presents you brought to us, Mr. Heister.

582
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,460
Mr. Heister.

583
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,280
Mr. Grease Lightning.

584
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,400
What your name is?

585
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,600
Gwendolyn, get the antidote.

586
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, Gwendolyn, give him the antidote, please.

587
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,880
Just put it in his neck.

588
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,480
Deep breath.

589
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,680
Give me.

590
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,740
No, no, no, please, sir.

591
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,700
Take a deep breath.

592
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,140
Gwendolyn, please hurry up.

593
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,720
He's getting out of his loop.

594
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,100
Give me the antidote or kill me.

595
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,540
At the first sign of betrayal, I will kill him,

596
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,880
but I promise to return the body intact.

597
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,600
That's all right.

598
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,560
There is no synchronicity, my friend.

599
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,600
And things aren't going around in any...

600
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,060
...right circle.

601
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,320
Don't worry.

602
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,200
We've got to crack the loose side to get this body out of here.

603
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,820
We can bring Bob back to life if we can just crack him out of this loose side.

604
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,100
I don't think so, my friend.

605
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,560
This loose side was made in 1998 at the propaganda units in Fort Meade.

606
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,820
You will never break through.

607
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,980
He said on the 20th anniversary of my death,

608
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,640
you must break me out of the loose side and I will smoke again.

609
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
He was drinking with Ronald Reagan in those days.

610
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,340
You will not get him out.

611
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm afraid he is trapped forever.

612
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,240
We will get him from the loose side.

613
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,320
We will lose him.

614
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,000
If you obey me, you will survive.

615
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,800
The exorcist will come and...

616
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,740
Get your hand off that switch.

617
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,220
Stop it.

618
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,900
If you obey me...

619
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,880
It's not really his voice.

620
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,560
It is just a warning.

621
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,080
I am a machine vastly superior to you.

622
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,540
Oh, no.

623
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,160
You must...

624
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,580
Oh, my...

625
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,180
Yes, Lord.

626
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,100
Yes, Lord.

627
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
I must reach oxygen.

628
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,300
Down on your campus.

629
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:32,980
Switch.

630
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Get down.

631
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,840
Think of the evildoers as mole people who cannot see the light.

632
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,200
Their eyes are too blind.

633
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,220
And think of Jesus as a superhero.

634
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,280
These people...

635
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,680
Are crazy.

636
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
Must get knife out of boot.

637
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,720
They're sacrificing that girl.

638
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,700
This is horrible.

639
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,480
What is this?

640
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,860
They're throwing her into the bowl of that giant pipe.

641
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:56,880
Oh, God.

642
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,600
Oh.

643
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,080
Wait.

644
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,080
That's just a crappy special effect.

645
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,660
Wait a minute.

646
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,340
This is all...

647
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,940
This is...

648
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,780
These rocks are...

649
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,940
Man, that's my sex, Tommy.

650
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,060
Man, that's my sex, Tommy.

651
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,460
Those are...

652
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,220
Go get your...

653
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,120
Mad men of Borneo?

654
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,560
Those are...

655
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,980
Go get your own plastic girlfriend, buddy.

656
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,660
This is...

657
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:11,980
But...

658
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,360
This is your...

659
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,780
Obey me and live.

660
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,120
Or disobey and die.

661
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,940
You are a slave, Neo.

662
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,380
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.

663
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

664
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,160
A prison for your mind.

665
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,660
Freedom is a hard thing to do.

666
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,420
It's so much easier to be a slave.

667
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,240
And you can be a slave for Bob.

668
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,540
You don't have to think anymore.

669
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,400
You can just give your life to Bob.

670
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,860
So get in line.

671
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,880
You don't need to sign.

672
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,700
Forget about freedom.

673
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Become a sub-D&E right now.

674
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,140
Freedom is something that's for people.

675
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:45,900
For people that want it.

676
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,180
We don't want that thing.

677
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:52,080
We want to go ahead and have the slavery that we know that is the true slavery under Bob.

678
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,820
Does Bob offer freedom from terror?

679
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,840
Bob offers you no freedom.

680
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,340
Bob offers you the terror of the gods.

681
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,740
Unrestricted, unsullied, and undiminished by any censors of the 20th century.

682
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,520
But Bob does encourage a cheerful mockery of fear-mongering on the official level from the conspiracies reeking bowels.

683
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,360
Ew.

684
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,880
Monger-mockers.

685
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,860
That's us.

686
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,180
Correct.

687
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, that's the thing.

688
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,380
We find no fanatic.

689
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,080
This is a fanatical attack against fanaticism.

690
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,280
Mocker-mongers.

691
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,620
Well, he's got the magic word for this week, obviously.

692
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,840
Wherever you go, there you are.

693
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,360
That's on the day, Davey.

694
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,960
He's still trying to figure that out.

695
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,480
That's kind of a sentiment.

696
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,540
Chasing your tail.

697
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,260
They have that in there.

698
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,300
You can't look at your own eyes.

699
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,340
You can't look at your own eyes.

700
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,340


701
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,340


702
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,340


703
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,060
At the mechanic's store where I go to, there's a little thing above the door that says FIMC.

704
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,160
And it also says, wherever you go, that's where you are.

705
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,320
Bob wrote both of those slogans, you know, in the old days.

706
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Oh, that was his major employment activity at the time.

707
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,600
He used to just write up slogans.

708
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,900
They'd print them up and he'd sell them to these old novelty distributors.

709
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,660
I remember him back then.

710
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,120
He was quite different than he is now.

711
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,500
He used to make each of those fake vomits himself.

712
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,020
The doggy doo-doo he made himself.

713
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,680
Yeah, and they weren't fake.

714
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,060
He used the same mold for rubbery like that.

715
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,120
Those ideas just fell right out of his head.

716
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,880
They don't rot.

717
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,780
Yeah.

718
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,460
Well, sometimes they do.

719
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,680
Bob?

720
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,460
Bob?

721
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,080
Bob?

722
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,520
Bob?

723
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,520


724
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,680
We're not going to talk about the Lord and I.

725
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,640
I decided I'll...

726
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,660
Somebody said...

727
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,920
They called me up and said,

728
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,980
Dr. Drebin, don't talk about the war tonight.

729
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,520
Please, just do something different.

730
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,920
I agree. We must take a break for a moment.

731
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,860
We've got to take a break.

732
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,520
We've got to talk about silly things.

733
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,580
Things are bad enough.

734
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,040
We've got to talk about this normal stuff we talk about when wars aren't going on.

735
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,180
Imitation vomit.

736
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,140
That's what we talk about.

737
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,560
It's a joke.

738
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,540
It's so realistic.

739
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,440
Made of plastic.

740
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,600
Sometimes we reveal church secrets here on the show and that's one of them.

741
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,140
The vomit was an imitation vomit.

742
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
This show is the plastic.

743
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,180
Plastic vomit at KPFA.

744
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,140
Yes.

745
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,800
They've told us that several times, but not in so kind of words.

746
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:20,940
Vomitarium.

747
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,220
That's still a good price for plastic vomit.

748
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,380
Colin, why are you still awake?

749
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,200
I mean, how many drugs did you do this evening?

750
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,840
Something's classed as much as they always did.

751
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,540
Didn't the song that refused to die kill you yet?

752
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,380
We're going to have to turn it...

753
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,220
I mean, it's still there, but we'll have to turn it back up if you don't go to sleep.

754
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,600
Yeah, we've got it playing in the background.

755
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,700
You can't hear it.

756
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,680
Am I the only one left?

757
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,040
You're the only...

758
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,400
You're our only audience member right now.

759
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,500
The rest of the audience, except for those guys in the slaughterhouse.

760
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,240
See those guys over there?

761
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,780
Yeah, they got it.

762
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,760
Well, check this out.

763
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,320
Check this out.

764
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,880
I was also the previous caller.

765
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,140
You have tricked us.

766
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,720
Wow.

767
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,040
Man.

768
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,180
I can't believe it.

769
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,920
You get the previous caller award.

770
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
You're going to get the life preserver, too.

771
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,440
We're going to throw you the life preserver.

772
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,580
You don't have to keep dog paddling.

773
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,060
You can just hang on to the life preserver and float with slack for a while.

774
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,000
All right.

775
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,400
Clear out of here.

776
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,080
You can dog paddle all the way back to your dog patch.

777
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,860
Now, I could...

778
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,220
Tricky callers, call us up.

779
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,640
If you're in the Coalinga Slaughterhouse, please give us a call right now.

780
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,060
I have a 510 area code.

781
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,320
Wait a minute, Bob.

782
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,500
Can't you shut off that squallin'?

783
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,300
Shut up.

784
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,440
Shut up.

785
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,260
Look what you've done.

786
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,760
Made me kill Bob.

787
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,820
Lemur did it.

788
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,000
Fernanda and Nellie Murr.

789
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,740
And now...

790
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,880
DJ John Kay's Slack and Balls.

791
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,180
Accounting, Fernwell speaking.

792
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,020
Hello, Mr. Fernwell.

793
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,700
This is Neural.

794
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:12,900
Neuralman?

795
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Yes, Neuralman.

796
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,780
How's the virus?

797
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,640
This darn thing just seems to hang on.

798
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,660
I think I'll have to see him again today.

799
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,500
No problem.

800
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,740
Bob's here.

801
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,680
Oh, Bob?

802
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,360
Who's Bob?

803
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,580
He's the account temp's temporary I brought in.

804
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,480
You know, I think this thing's starting to break up.

805
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,520
But, huh, it could probably be in about noon.

806
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:28,840
What do you think?

807
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,400
No, don't worry.

808
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,760
Bob and I are doing just fine.

809
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,020
The name of the game is Ball Buster.

810
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,220
Ball Buster.

811
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,900
It's a family game.

812
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,260
Fun for children.

813
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,460
And for adults, it's exciting.

814
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,780
You make strategic offensive and defensive moves.

815
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,460
Then try to bust your opponent's balls.

816
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
It's as easy as checkers.

817
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,800
But it's acting like pool.

818
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,360
You're a ball buster.

819
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,260
Ball Buster.

820
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,240
A great new game from Hogan.

821
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,060
Let me have your attention for a moment.

822
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,300
Are they all here?

823
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,240
All but one.

824
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
But I'm going anyway.

825
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,060
Let's talk about something important.

826
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,780
You know what it takes to sell real estate?

827
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,620
It takes brass balls.

828
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,840
To sell real estate.

829
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,680
Because we're adding a little something to this month's sales contest.

830
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,940
First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.

831
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,220
Anybody want to see second prize?

832
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,140
Second prize is a set of steak knives.

833
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,800
Third prize is you're fired.

834
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,100
Hit the bricks.

835
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,080
Hit the bricks.

836
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,920
You hear me, you fucking faggot?

837
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,960
Hit the bricks.

838
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,900
Hit the bricks.

839
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,040
Beat it.

840
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,560
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

841
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,760
Brass ball. Convert that to real estate.

842
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,160
Motherfucker sell him, make him sign the check.

843
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,260
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

844
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,480
Brass ball.

845
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,240
Get them to sign on the line which is dotted.

846
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,660
My wife filled in a form.

847
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,400
Get them to sign.

848
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,200
And we have been played for the last year.

849
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,200
Get them to sign.

850
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,120
I don't want to buy land.

851
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,020
I don't want to invest in land.

852
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,440
I have nothing.

853
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,820
Nothing. Nothing.

854
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,460
Hit the bricks.

855
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,260
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

856
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,360
Beat it. Hit the bricks.

857
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,100
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

858
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,280
Beat it. Fuck you.

859
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,360
Oh, fuck you.

860
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,440
That's my message.

861
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,960
Hit the bricks. Hit the bricks.

862
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,520
You are going out.

863
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,240
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads.

864
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,240
With these leads.

865
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,060
I can't make a goddamn dollar with these leads.

866
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,080
With these leads.

867
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,980
These leads are shit.

868
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,020
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster. They're broke.

869
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,900
They're deadbeats. Deadbeats.

870
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,300
Woo!

871
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,300
Hey! Hey! Hey!

872
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,920
You listen to me. You listen to me.

873
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,340
Hey! I close that cocksucker.

874
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,320
I don't think so, shell.

875
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,080
I think you fucked up my office.

876
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,660
I think you're going away.

877
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,860
Cocksucker. Cocksucker.

878
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,400
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.

879
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,380
I don't care whose nephew you are.

880
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,360
Whose dick you're sucking on.

881
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,580
You are shit. Fuck the lot of you.

882
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,940
You are going out.

883
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,120
Go to lunch. Go to lunch. Go to lunch.

884
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,880
Fuck the lot of you. Go to lunch. Go to lunch.

885
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,860
Go to lunch.

886
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,940
Brass ball. Hit the bricks.

887
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,720
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

888
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,760
Woo! Hit the bricks.

889
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,540
Know what it takes to sell real estate?

890
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,820
Fuck the lot of you.

891
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,600
Fuck you. Fuck you.

892
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,380
Oh, fuck you. Hit the bricks. Hit the bricks.

893
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,960
You are going out.

894
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,780
Put that coffee down.

895
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,520
Where did you learn your trade?

896
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,600
Put that coffee down.

897
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,800
You fairy.

898
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,360
Where did you learn your trade?

899
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,920
Hit the bricks. You company man.

900
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,300
Trade!

901
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,220
You stupid fucking cunt!

902
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,800
Woo!

903
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,600
Fuck!

904
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,160
Woo!

905
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,800
You stupid fucking cunt!

906
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,720
What you're hired for is to help us.

907
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,880
Not to fuck us up!

908
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,160
Fuck us up!

909
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,100
Woo!

910
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,800
You know what it takes to sell real estate?

911
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Woo!

912
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,620
You know what it takes to sell real estate?

913
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,900
Fuck the lot of you!

914
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,660
Fuck you!

915
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,740
Oh, fuck you!

916
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,120
Go to lunch! Go to lunch! Will you go to lunch?

917
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,640
Beat it!

918
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,520
Coffee! Beat it!

919
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,440
No fucking good.

920
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,460
Fuck that shit, George.

921
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,720
Coffee! Beat it!

922
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,500
Good!

923
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,840
You're fired!

924
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,680
DJ John K's Slack

925
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,720
and Balls, dear friends, sent in

926
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,880
by DJ

927
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,380
John K. You are listening

928
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,740
to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

929
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,660
Hour of Slack.

930
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,940
Therefore, a subgenius

931
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,780
is one who is under his

932
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,460
own genius. Technically.

933
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,800
Under his own particular tutelary

934
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
spirit. That is correct, and technically

935
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,640
this organization cannot exist

936
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,700
because it is composed of people who

937
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,740
are not joiners. They are not

938
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,540
joiners, tinkers, plumbers,

939
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,720
watchmakers, fasteners. The only

940
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,780
thing most subgeniuses have in common

941
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,440
is that they are all different.

942
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,140
They have nothing in common with the

943
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,360
conspiro-si,

944
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,760
which is an anagram

945
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,780
for cliques of normal,

946
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,760
secretly planning insidious rituals

947
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,220
aimed at controlling you.

948
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,640
Regain your

949
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,840
lost yeti powers. I know you know

950
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,880
you have them, but you just can't remember

951
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,760
how to use them.

952
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,680
You've got to draw deep

953
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,860
from within yourself, and as you

954
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,800
undergo the unhallowed rites of

955
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,600
glanscaping and acubating,

956
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,920
forbidden shapes

957
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,820
from the shadows

958
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,000
will be called forth.

959
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,760
Okay? Alright, alright.

960
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,700
Will you relieve?

961
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,040
You can relieve your inner?

962
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,100
Yes, time marches on.

963
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,740
He's launched already. He's launched, he's launched.

964
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,780
Okay, sorry that we were a little bit

965
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,560
late there. Incredible inventions of

966
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,740
free electricity, time travel, death rays,

967
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,920
ozone generators,

968
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,720
unlimited wireless power.

969
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
You can look perfectly normal.

970
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,960
Mentally practicing the lost arts

971
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,160
of the atythropy and

972
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,660
schizophreniatrics,

973
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,440
not legal in most things.

974
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,960
Radio controlled anti-gravity

975
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,980
airships,

976
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,580
thought machines,

977
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,960
unlimited wireless power anywhere on Earth.

978
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,040
Exalted be the name of Bob,

979
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,100
slam dunk the Dobbs head

980
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,500
in you.

981
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,200
I will

982
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,600
present to you my seven

983
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,440
winner plans for

984
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,940
making you a real wiener.

985
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,420
And it will happen

986
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,780
almost at once.

987
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,320
Of course,

988
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,700
like any program,

989
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,720
it depends a lot on you.

990
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,960
So order my program

991
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,020
that is

992
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,300
Eye of the Storm

993
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,700
JK8990

994
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,640
and it retails

995
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,660
for $29.98.

996
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,400
So you take the high road.

997
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,900
I'll take the low road.

998
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,880
And I'll be in Scotland.

999
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,620
And I'll be flying

1000
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:44,180


1001
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,620
With a better car

1002
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,300
And Bob will

1003
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,100
drive

1004
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,420
to Dave's

1005
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,440
home!

1006
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,840
And in your

1007
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,340
home city

1008
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,780
Am I

1009
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:56,900
dying

1010
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,100
down

1011
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,120
these

1012
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,720
cloves

1013
00:45:59,720 --> 00:45:59,720


1014
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,600
fire?!

1015
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:13,820
with Allah? Can Jehovah One compete with Allah? Why don't normals care? Because I've said it once,

1016
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:20,620
I've said it a thousand times, none are so blind as those who have no eyes. Isn't it true,

1017
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:29,320
that is ever the truth that flows from Bob's grinning lips. But what's really abnormal and

1018
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:35,960
unnatural in normality? Maladjustment, I suppose. The terrifying thing to me is that whereas the

1019
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,920
normals cannot become like us, we can all too easily become like them. It is literally the

1020
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:49,140
next easiest thing in the world to become normal. Let us be thankful that we are not as are the

1021
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:58,180
normals, the pinks and the mediocre, the gimme bobs and bobbies who swarm by the thousand,

1022
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,300
yea, even the most.

1023
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:07,800
And don't further mongrelize the subgenius race by marrying a human. Stay away from mating with

1024
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:15,300
pinks and other beasts of the field. Use the normals, yes, even be friends with some of them

1025
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,280
in order to learn their weaknesses, but do not, I repeat, do not cross-fertilize with them.

1026
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:27,220
Bob is breeding his own new humans that are more like the oldest breed, humans with instincts.

1027
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,300
The flattening of the human's body is the most important thing in the world.

1028
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:35,680
The personality that comes down with the average conspiracy lifestyle has suppressed instincts down through the centuries,

1029
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:43,140
which is exactly why so many people injure or kill their own children, or customers, or constituents.

1030
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,040
It's why marriages don't work half the time, and the family has gotten a bad name.

1031
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,260
It's why you do stupid things yourself.

1032
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,200
Civilization, for all its fancy trimmings, is still just a rickety shack made by stupid people.

1033
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,480
It's why you have to be a real man to be a real man.

1034
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:06,860
With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.

1035
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,140
My situation was truly horrible.

1036
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,920
Men! When all seemed lost, I saw light!

1037
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:22,040
Rumor has it that a yeti has the ability to take possession of your mind.

1038
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,940
And they walk upright like humans and have the powers of telepathy.

1039
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,660
Oh boy.

1040
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,100
Was this a trick of the fiendish yeti?

1041
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,620
Yeah.

1042
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,380
Yeah.

1043
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,480
Take possession of your mind.

1044
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,040
Take possession of your mind.

1045
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,780
Your mind!

1046
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,820
It's impervious to our poisons.

1047
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,340
If it's blown up, its cells will regenerate and multiply,

1048
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,360
and it'll still be there.

1049
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:27,600
It'll be alive.

1050
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,840
Unbreakable.

1051
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,800
The rule of the universe.

1052
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:47,920
The spark, yeah, that distinguishes us from the beasts of the field.

1053
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,040
A

1054
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,420
thug.

1055
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,220
A

1056
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,840
thug.

1057
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,180
A thug.

1058
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,180
For information as to the whereabouts of the Yeti, you must get off here.

1059
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,200
On your way!

1060
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,440
A Yeti!

1061
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,340
A collage by the Cobblestone.

1062
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,460
Lay out of it!

1063
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,400
Is that what I hear playing in the background?

1064
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:18,000
My ears were ringing after that for hours, and I thought I had seriously impaired my hearing.

1065
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:25,400
It did. It had made them ring like a full-fledged episode of Tinnitus.

1066
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,020
Yes, well, I got a hold of it.

1067
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,820
It wasn't until I woke up the next day that I realized the sensation had departed.

1068
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,780
That's the way I was, but it sort of made it easier to sleep.

1069
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,560
It was like the white noise you need to sometimes fall asleep when the dogs are barking.

1070
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,880
Whatever color it was, it was still noise.

1071
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,120
Kids were screaming.

1072
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,620
And the noise that indicates hearing damage.

1073
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:49,300
It's dysturbia. Dysturbia.

1074
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,500
I was only one year old when my family moved to Dysturbia.

1075
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,740
At the ironically named Night of Slack.

1076
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,840
It was the day of the

1077
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:26,900
We are continuing his brave subgenius prophecy world crusade with a frenzy.

1078
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,720
I hope that it's not too late for most of us.

1079
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,980
Well, these words were written many years ago, and now we know that it was indeed too late.

1080
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,960
And it is too late for most of you out there.

1081
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,260
Perhaps you listen to this show expecting entertainment or even enlightenment.

1082
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,660
If you do, you will be plagued by nightmares of this horrible event for months, if not years.

1083
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,640
And that's just too bad.

1084
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,320
Sometimes even Bob can't undo the terrible damage the conspiracy has inflicted.

1085
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,820
Yes.

1086
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,660
Now if you send away, you can get a soft shot pepper pot pellet fist.

1087
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,340
Rapid fire.

1088
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,800
Continuous shooting.

1089
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,960
Shoot 50 rounds in one loading.

1090
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,260
Soft vinyl pellets offer the vinyl solution.

1091
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,280
Letting you create exciting.

1092
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,700
Indoor outdoor action.

1093
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:35,380
Set up many targets and see how many you can knock down in one loading before they get away.

1094
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,260
One pill.

1095
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,720
Do you think that we might be able to ask some more questions?

1096
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,980
Yes.

1097
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,360
I asked her if she knew something.

1098
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:53,620
One pill.

1099
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:54,820
What was her answer?

1100
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,140
Her answer was no.

1101
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,240
Yes.

1102
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,460
The answer was no.

1103
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,420
Any more questions?

1104
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,360
Yes.

1105
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,080
I asked her, did she hear Phyllis say that she was Gino thinking that he was Paul?

1106
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,640
What was her answer?

1107
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,080
Her answer was no.

1108
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,960
No.

1109
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,360
The answer was yes.

1110
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,100
Any more questions?

1111
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,580
No, no.

1112
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,400
What is your conclusion doctor?

1113
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,420
I don't know.

1114
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,080
Oh, what are you trying to prove?

1115
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,320
Next time, employees will have to do as they are told.

1116
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,620
Not attach new dogma to an already overburdened church donkey

1117
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,920
tottering on the path to public failure.

1118
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,380
If I have to look to those bored faces anymore,

1119
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,520
those num-nut meetings,

1120
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,120
I'm going to shave the rest of Paul's head.

1121
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,060
Oh, look.

1122
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,720
How did this ever...

1123
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,900
Look at that. He's shaving the rest of Paul's head.

1124
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,180
Wow, looks great.

1125
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,460
With a straight razor, too. That was incredible.

1126
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,300
Awfully cute.

1127
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,460
It's a miracle there was no murder that time.

1128
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,380
17.

1129
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,180
Yes, well, whatever happened to JFK's death?

1130
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,340
All right, run track 17 of the show.

1131
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,320
And little Thomas Butter with us now on the show.

1132
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,820
Hey, ride me to the doorway to Dune, would you?

1133
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,400
I need a ride down there.

1134
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,580
Down there to the doorway of Dune?

1135
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,000
Where the diamonds are?

1136
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,140
If you could take me down there,

1137
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,280
can you give me a ride after the show?

1138
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,260
You're not going to tell me what you almost said?

1139
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,580
Oh, no, the show is over.

1140
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,720
The show's going to be over very shortly.

1141
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:50,120
And so now we're here on the train, moving along.

1142
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:51,820
Yee-haw!

1143
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,480
I'll join you in the club car.

1144
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,680
It's all so confusing.

1145
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,660
And now the show, unfortunately, is moving down the tracks

1146
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,220
at an unfortunate rate of speed.

1147
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,340
We'll be pulling into the station, and the next show will begin.

1148
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,180
I just hope they open the door where I've got my luggage,

1149
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,080
because otherwise I'll be stuck on the train.

1150
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,840
The beautiful show person for the next show is already here.

1151
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,900
The band is getting remembered up.

1152
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,380
They're going to be the first off the train.

1153
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:20,980
And the light times that we know.

1154
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,360
That's really amazing.

1155
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,260
As we get nearer and nearer to the old place,

1156
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,380
I feel an absolute tingling in my veins.

1157
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,160
And when I step off that train,

1158
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,260
I'm going to have the biggest, sunniest smile on my face

1159
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,620
for that old town of mine.

1160
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,220
Hey, wipe that smile off your face.

1161
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,100
In time, soldier, in time.

1162
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,640
Don't deprive me of this wonderful moment.

1163
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,620
Let me prolong it.

1164
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,820
Okay, all right.

1165
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,340
I'll smile on my way to freedom.

1166
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,760
Smile on.

1167
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,660
The muscles on my face will be permanently closed

1168
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,400
with this rich, rich smile.

1169
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1170
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1171
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1172
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1173
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1174
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,400


1175
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,360
Just of like...

1176
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,900
Somebody's smiling with you.

1177
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,080
I don't know about the whole world, but...

1178
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,920
Bob is smiling with you.

1179
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,980
Well, at you is probably more like it.

1180
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,720
Yes, I, Stang, am giving credits now,

1181
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,640
because it seemed to flow,

1182
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,260
and I didn't want to interrupt it this time.

1183
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,360
But the new titles we heard this week

1184
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,440
were by Reverend Artemia Salina,

1185
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,300
and then several collages

1186
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,500
by the great Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr.

1187
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,820
The amazing story of the Waco debacle

1188
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,640
was told by the late Bill Hicks

1189
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,580
from a bootleg,

1190
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,820
and that was followed by the song

1191
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,940
Conspiracy Theory

1192
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,400
from the album Jerusalem

1193
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,980
by Steve Earle.

1194
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,220
Puzzling evidence.

1195
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,040
Yes.

1196
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,640
Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummit, of course.

1197
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,200
Lots of that there from KPFA and Berkeley.

1198
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,640
Devo did I Saw Jesus.

1199
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,820
And also that great version of Gotta Serve Somebody.

1200
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,880
That was when Devo was Dove, a Christian band.

1201
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,240
You heard me preaching at Winterstar

1202
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,480
and tons of ESO Swamp Radio

1203
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,260
live from WCSB Cleveland

1204
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,400
with Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1205
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,240
Princess Wee,

1206
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,000
and me.

1207
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,880
Brainwashing collages, friends,

1208
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,280
from the usual gang of idiots

1209
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,100
at alt.binaries.slack.

1210
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,780
Notably, this time,

1211
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,260
Reverend Cobblestone

1212
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,380
and Reverend Jarto.

1213
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,940
Cobblestone did the longer ones

1214
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,640
and Reverend Jarto did the shorter ones.

1215
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,600
Lee Murr did the most ones.

1216
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,540
Praise Bob.

1217
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,840
This is the Hour of Slack

1218
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,480
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1219
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:50,680
You can get more information

1220
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,720
about Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius

1221
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,120

1222

or write to, for free information,

1223
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,640
the church headquarters at P.O. Box 204206

1224
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,340
Austin, Texas

1225
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,360
78720

1226
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,180
And Lee Murr did this.

1227
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,840
Get hysterical.

1228
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,420
Bob!

1229
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,080
Bob!

1230
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,580
Bobhead!

1231
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,440
Get hysterical.

1232
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:22,780
Bob!

1233
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,020
Bob!

1234
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,560
Bobhead!

1235
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,040
Bob!

1236
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:24,300
Bob!

1237
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,820
Bob!

1238
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,680
Bob!

1239
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:26,820
Bob!

1240
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,480
Bob!

1241
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:27,780
Bob!

1242
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,020
Bob!

1243
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:28,300
Bobhead!

1244
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,280
Bob!

1245
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,400
Oh, ho, ho.

1246
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,600
Bob!

1247
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,480
Bob!

1248
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,560
Bob!

1249
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:34,860
Bob!

1250
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:34,960
Bob!

1251
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,160
Bob!

1252
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:35,220
Bob!

1253
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,980
Oh, ho, don't let yourself get hysterical.

1254
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,280
Bobhead!

1255
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,680
Bob!

1256
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:37,980
Bob!

1257
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,320
Bobhead!

1258
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,360
Bobhead!

1259
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,040
Bobhead!

1260
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,240
Uh-oh.

1261
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,080
Well,

1262
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:44,980
goodbye now.

1263
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,180
Favorite.
