All right now, this minute, I'm going to do something that may overthrow the entire radio business.
But I'm not going to say a word about laboratory tests or quote you statistics or make medical claims.
All I'm going to say simply and honestly is this.
Ladies and gentlemen, try, just try the finest money can buy.
Every advanced technique and control is concentrated on the subgenius.

Great job.
From PR News in Washington, I'm facing 18 counts of opioid and tax fraud and could face life in Washington if convicted.
President Trump has insisted that he killed dozens of children traveling on a bus near the Oregon border.
The bus was carrying 29 children, all under the age of 15.
PR News.
And Trump believes he is 77,000 percent contained.
President Trump's legal team has told Robert Mueller that Trump attorney tells Fox News that
We all do it.
It's our money.

On a 28-hour train

California is to the New Yorkers.
This land is my land.
This land was made for me.
Well, do you need a bathroom break, Dr. Howell, before the show begins?
Well, it's just a matter of walking down the road a piece, isn't it, Quylo?
The Jenkins chambers are down there, ready for hopping.
Within a stone's throw.
So if you want to do that now, that's entirely understandable.
Take your bathroom break now before the Bulldada auction,
because once the action starts, you won't want to step away for even a moment.
Well, that's not to imply that you won't be able to control yourself
because of the excitement of the Bulldada auction.
That's ridiculous.
It's going to be something.
Yeah, I think you're right.
It's going to be something.
We don't know what.
But there will be something.
So we are hoping that this is all going to transpire as planned.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to affect a somber attitude
while we ramp down our expectations such as they are for the Bulldada.
So, Quylo Drummond will be back momentarily.
Meanwhile, a poem, Paradise Lost, by John Newton.
Book one.
Of man's first disobedience, And the fruit of that forbidden tree,
Whose mortal taste brought death into the world, And all our ways were lost,



And all our ways were lost, And all our ways were lost,

With loss of Eden, Till one greater man restore us,
And regain the blissful seat, Sing, heavenly muse,
That on the secret top of Oreb or of Sinai Didst inspire that shepherd who first taught
the chosen seed, In the beginning how the heavens and earth
rose out of chaos.
Or, if Sion Hill delight thee more, And Siloah's blood-red




brook that flowed fast by the oracle of God,
I thence invoke thy aid to my adventurous song, That with no middle flight intends to soar
above the Aeonian mount, While it pursues things unattempted yet,
in prose or rhyme.
So welcome back, Quylo Drummond.
And now we are, I think, set for the very trembling beginnings of the Bulldada.

Bulldada auction.
Oh, we got feedback.
Feedback, yeah, we got lots of feedback here.
So, Quylo, is there a huge cache of stuff behind us that we should be dragging out and
piling up on the table?
Yeah, we should probably, I'll start bringing them forward and setting them up on the table
so people can eyeball that action item.
That's a very good plan.
And then one by one we will offer them up, eh?
That's right, huh?
You and me are offering them up.
Yeah.
That's the way that's gonna work.
That's right.
So in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the actual physical process
of the Bulldada auction itself.
What was this, Jay something McGee?
That was Jay Fred Muggs, the famous business chimpanzee that people remember, that is,
people of a certain childhood remember.
Jay Fred Muggs, an actual portrait here.
You know, a still, movie still size shot of Jay Fred.
Just one of the many inexplicable objects which we will be offering as part of the benign
venison of the Bulldada auction.
What is Bulldada, after all?
This essential subgenius concept?
So often through the years it's been misunderstood or even misapplied to inferior objects.
The fact is, we in the Church of the Subgenius have always believed that those who have the
opportunity should avail themselves deeply of this nation's popular culture and its many
evolutionary ramifications.
Going back to certain essential sources at the wellspring of creativity which informs
the nuosphere, or the world of things known.
And where better to find it than in cheesy monster movies and so on.
The reason is that people in the cheesy monster movies are trying to entertain, so they don't
necessarily have an attitude.
Thus, the eternal verities are not known.
It is all based on the
fairytale.
Because, until toothbrush, the object contains keeping Onu and

From PR News in Washington, I'm genetically modified to withstand the Trump killer
that weakens the president's most powerful turkey plan ban.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is stiff in Honolulu, Hawaii.
The mayor of Honolulu says three strippers at a high-rise residential building.
We want to be sure that we overreact.
The agency's new measures include requiring a special PR News during certain hours of the day.
And a sweeping crackdown, including the cracking sweepdown just last night.
The German turkey confirms this is PR News in Washington.
There's some movie on YouTube about it.
It shows...
It shows the age of the universe.
And the wrinkles, the falling hair, the falling...
It accelerates like ten times every ten seconds and goes like trillions and trillions and trillions.
That's gutter.
Into the future, until the last supermassive black hole explodes.
And sucks all the universe.
It's the end of time.
Yes, well, the question is, does it all start over again in the theory of eternal recurrence?
Yeah, I don't think we're going to that.
So then I'll see you a couple billion years...
A couple billion years from now, just in the same spot.
But there's also that film, Power of Ten.
Yeah.
I mean, if that one, that's the model for all such pictures.
Yeah.
Where it starts on the molecular level and then it keeps zooming out until you're way out past the galaxies.
Actually, it starts at a picnic and goes out and then comes back into the molecular.
It's on YouTube, folks.
The Hellstrom Chronicle.
Do you remember that movie from the 70s?
What was the name?
Well, it's...
Okay.
Yeah, it's a bug.
It's about, you know, it's actually micro photography of bugs.
And it's pretty good.
But then it's wrapped up in this story about this fake scientist saying,
we've only got a little while longer.
The bugs are going to take over.
They're utterly ruthless.
And one shot that's in it shows lovers.
They're lying on a blanket.
They're kissing.
It's the summer.
They make out.
And then it zooms into right next to them.
Two insects are eating each other alive with horrible sound effects.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
It's really pretty.
To show how horrible the insects were.
It shows you how bugs die.
And it cuts to famous big bug monster movies like Them.
Yeah.
They have bug goo in them.
I saw a poster for a really...
We call it Ickhor.
Really obscure movie called Day of the Dolphin.
With George C. Scott.
George C. Scott.
And some chirping dolphins that'll steal your heart away.
We don't recommend watching that one.
It's weird.
It's weird.
It's weird.
It's weird.
What's that you say?
He unwittingly trains a dolphin to assassinate the president.
Yeah.
Watch.
No.
Watch that.
Pet the dolphin, Mr. President.
No.
You'd better not pet that dolphin, Mr. President.
Step back from the dolphin, Mr. President.
Now get him, boy.
Like crap.
That dolphin just shot the president.
Can you resist the pull of a dolphin?
I'd want to pet the dolphin.
They got big teeth.
They can bite.
They're so gray and slimy and you just want to touch them.
They're nice, most of them, but that doesn't mean all individuals will behave in the same manner.
You could just have the bad luck to draw the crankiest, bitchiest dolphin in the ocean.
I was trying to pet one at SeaWorld one time and I almost got my finger nipped off.
Yeah, you're gonna bite your head off.
How's that for your peaceable dolphin?
Yeah.
One day, my father always told this story.
He was a young man.
He used to swim way out in the ocean.
He was out and something bumped him and he thought, oh my God, shark, you know, but then
a dolphin stuck its head up and went, and then it helped him.
It pushed him all the way back to...
Gave him 50 bucks.
Sure, yeah.
Gave him a haircut, a shoe shine.
I would be so happy if a dolphin would just help me solve all my problems.
Hey.
If the dolphin would just say, it's gonna be all right.
Then you know.
You know that dolphin's got his own problems.
He's in the ocean with all that plastic and everything and you want him to help you now
on top of all that other stuff he has to do and that?
I don't have any clue.
I don't know the sonar waves we put in the ocean that screw up their communication.
Yes, they interfere with whale music and everything else.
Well, they just need a hug.
From a giant octopus.
We call him Nemo.
And we just can't find him anywhere.
The video is over, but this is the last of the commercials.


The last of the commercials is from the one and only, Jeff.

official, but the cities, the East Coast and the West Coast, where the better off, you know,
higher income, more educated, privileged, elite type folks live, they can all afford to have
edited internet. They spend a lot of money to have people and very good programs
filter out the garbage. Everybody else loves the garbage and go for it. And so America has
divided up into, you might say, blue and red areas, defined by where the Walmarts
start appearing as you leave a big city. That's kind of like the border. It's not like they have
checkpoints exactly, but inner America, the Midwest, the rural areas,
is Ameristan, they call it. And as this one character says, oh, the roads there are decent
or by the standards of Ameristan. Farmers need roads to move stuff around so they don't see
them as a government plot. They don't tear them up on principle and they don't blow up the bridges.
There's not a lot of roadblocks, so call it two days with one night at our farmhouse,
which is like a little pocket of blue.
Meaning where people are educated enough to not believe everything they see on the miasma,
as the internet is called then. And there's some, one of the poe buckers that lives in the interior
says something to them as they travel about Iowa City. And this other guy explains, oh, that's where
the big hospital is. So it's like another country to them. But they have to go there when they get
sick, like to get a, you know, a good job. And so they're like, oh, well, I'm going to go to the
hospital. And they're like, oh, well, I'm going to go to the hospital. And they're like, oh, well,
melanoma whacked off or whatever. They can't afford blue state hotel rooms or food. So they
have to camp out on the periphery and cook over propane burners under tarps. Not a fun time.
And I know one person who would know about that would be lonesome cowboy Dave.
Who probably is me. I'm having a hard time hearing you and probably
even be more.
Idiotic than usual all evening because phone is screwing up here. Now the cell phone doesn't
seem to be charging. It's charged up. It's like, you know, that's okay, Dave. That's okay.
Everything's fine. You don't have to understand us. I never understand you. I usually can't really
even hear any, anything anybody's saying to me. Is my voice coming through clear and loud?
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I hear noises. I can understand. I can guess what you're saying.
Well, we can all hear the gas pig, the noises from the gas pig that they've released down by
the, uh, untrary movement when they first opened up the gates and let some of the prisoners around.
Well, not physically aroused and kind of like mentally aroused, but they believe those
photographs that the president was showing about how, you know, how Iran attacked their ship
so that we'd get in trouble with everybody in the world, you know?
Well, everybody will believe
anything.
That they want to believe.
Oh, come on. What? What? Oh, come on. I mean, I read a lot of science fiction, but
dumber than a subgenius named Lunsum Cowboy Dave? Right? Or, I mean, even I can't understand that,
and I'm even dumber.
Hey, hey, watch your language there. Language.
I was going to say something untowards, pointed in no general direction, specifically.
Well, I was reading in the sci-fi book just before you called, Dave. I was reading in this new,
brand new Neil Stevenson novel, Fall. It's so new that I, I had to buy a hardback.
I hate Neil Stevenson so much. I have to. I had to. I've read all of this guy's books,
every one of them. I've read the...
Did you read it?
cycle three and a half times and it's 3,000 pages long that's how much I'm
jealous of this guy I hate him because I'm so jealous he's such a good writer
just has to say it that way anyway he's describing your part of the country Dave
and so one of the characters is asking how come so many of them have bad teeth
but our driver doesn't and this guy goes Ted has normal people teeth because
he's old and grew up before this part of the world got Facebooked after that the
people with education flute fled to places like Ames Des Moines Iowa City
which includes dentists a few mainline churches used to run charity dental
clinics where you could get a bad tooth pulled or whatever those are being
chased away
by these these people which is the Leviticus who I was over a thousand
miles away but we yeah but all of all of red America is the same in the sci-fi
book and they all believe the same everything they read on the Internet
well they should there yeah I can understand that people carry around a
little card with them
a little card with them that they put in front of awkward conversations they'll
hold it up in the middle of conversations that means they don't want
to argue one side of the card was solid red with no words or images and was
meant to be displayed outward as a nonverbal signal that you disagreed but
you weren't gonna be drawn into a fake argument the other side facing the user
was a list of little reminders as to what was really going on and here's the
the list of reminders, Dave, that you have to remember whenever you're talking to anybody,
especially on the internet. One, speech is aggression. Two, every utterance has a winner
and a loser. Three, curiosity is feigned. Four, lying is performative. And five, stupidity
is power. And so we find ourselves right back at the beginning of the Dark Ages.
Sounds like we're...
Before it starts and begins.
Well, yeah, yeah. Well, you know. It's a really fun, prescient science fiction book, Dave,
sort of like yours, Neighbor World.
Yes, I was thinking, just think of all the things in Neighbor World, particularly there
are two that are happening right now. In fact, you see, like, oh, Jan Janskaville, but 20
years ago, they kept it a secret what they were going to do. They have since the 1980s.

And they have been.









But what the hell? Who cares? Somebody struck me on the head kind of hard, was messing
around, picked up a brick and hit me on the head.
No!
Well, that happened when you were much younger, though, right?
Oh, when I was in the common age of, I think I was 25 years old. It was my first time
in Lisbon and I joined the Navy, but I became a hiccup sergeant and I had to be reduced.
I was taken out of the military.



I think it was like one point and that's the only place I could live.
Dave.
Dave's had a rough life.
I guess.
He was a Navy cowboy. One of those brickheads, they called him. The ones that had been injured
in the head became less than a genius.
Yeah, they're...
And the ones in the submarines were called sub-less than.
They were called sub-less than geniuses. They kind of shortened that to sub-geniuses.
And it came to mean all the sailors who'd been hit with a brick in the head and eventually
it came to mean, you know, any, anybody really cool. So there you go.
Can I tell you...
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob. Or not.
Or not.
Can I tell you a true story now? I know of a municipality somewhere in the local northeastern
Ohio area who discovered while it was doing some drilling and stuff, that there was a
whole network of underground water to service fire engines that would come by and they could
just hook the pumper trucks up. They were like perfect brick catacombs, or not catacombs,
but they looked kind of like cylinders underground and you'd pump them dry and they'd fill up
with water again. Water, although they're not sure if it's completely potable or not
because so many things have happened. I think at one time you could get a lot of water out
of anywhere just by these things. And nowadays they don't have stuff that they had 20 years
ago. You know what I mean? People are getting stupider.
No!
Yes.
Hey, that's a good, hey, that's the first time anybody's mentioned on this show that
I can remember this hour. I wonder why that would be. Oh well.
It must be in the news today. Today it must be very forceful, like a bad bag of diarrhea,
you know, kind of something that you can't really compromise on.

Well, of course, needless to say, it's pretty sad when subgeniuses are calling somebody
else stupid. That's a bad, bad sign, but it's been going on for a while.
I haven't called anybody by name. I didn't say like, Reverend Ivan Stang, he's stupid.
No, and you wouldn't even say which municipality it was in Ohio that had these, what do they
call them, water pipes? Only they're not connected to city water, right? They're just well water.
No, they were discovered just recently and they were abandoned probably a year ago.
Probably in the 1880s.
Well, what town, how old are these towns you're talking about?
200 years.
There were towns in the 1880s?
Yeah. Most of these towns are 200 years old.
Oh yeah, up here in the north you'll run into that kind of thing.
Underground water reservoirs.
Well, now actually we have towns that are over 200 years old in the south, but they all have names like Santa
Antonio and El Paso.
El Paso.
San Jose.
Oh yes, Ohio was pretty well populated with the bad guys.
Well, now at some-
They were all Revolutionary War veterans and they were promised a bunch of land for doing their duty to the-
Oh, really?
Jefferson and Washington tried to get out of it, but instead they gave them a bunch of land that belonged to the natives.
That was the Revolutionary War?
Yeah, the Revolutionary War. So here's a bunch of land and you don't have to move, of course, a bunch of the native American people out.
So a bunch of white po'buckers got promised 40 acres and a mule and got gypped.
Not to put down gypsies, that's actually kind of a bad word to use because it implies that all gypsies are thieves.
You have to say Roma.
Yeah, they're trumped. They got trumped, rather, would be more accurate.
Yes.
Yeah, you can use that bad word as many times as you want. Never stop thinking.
Trumping. Go trump yourself. You're full of trump.
Oh man, I gotta run to the bathroom. I gotta take a trump real fast, man. Don't get in my way. There's trump running down my legs already.
Have you seen this thing on the internet? It's Trump, but it's like the old Ogden Nash cartoon of Humpty Trumpy Dumpty.
From sitting on a wall and it's kind of like a fat belly, like a, well it looks like Tweedledum and Tweedledee all rolled into one.
I think I've seen 40 or 50 different editorial cartoons on that theme.
It's, it's a fat shaming, you know.
Well, you know, you hear Tweedledum and Tweedledee all trumped and dumpty.
Sphere shaming.
Not so much fat. I mean, because eggs aren't fat, they're just spherical.
Trump is not spherical. He's just a big fat guy. Big. And he calls everybody else little. If you notice that, he doesn't like somebody, they're little.
He's called condescensionist.
He calls them stupid.
He's like the Buddha before he had to learn the seven lessons. He's just the son of a king and so he thinks everything should be like, you know, son of the king style.
Well.
Misery has never touched his life. He's been blessed.
I wouldn't say that, actually. I wouldn't say that that guy's blessed at all. I wouldn't say that he's happy.
I wouldn't, I would say that that's the most insecure, unfulfilled, terrified, blatantly defensive person I've ever seen and I've seen a few of them.
But, you know, they say that the woman is the most beautiful.
I mean, don't you think that's a pretty good thing?









You know, it's almost the worst thing that can happen to you is being born rich and never, ever having to face consequences for your decisions because that turns you into little better than a moron.
And that should help, that should make all of us poor folks feel a lot better about that.
You know, it's like we may be struggling, but at least we have some awareness of what is actually happening.
And we're striving to be little more than a moron.
Well, little more than little, if anything, you know.
We're struggling to be morons, yeah.
Yeah, if I could just work my way up to the moron level, God, then I could pole vault up to idiot.
You know, like C5 is really a good holding zone.
You know, at least if you've got packages, you know, that you want in underwear.
Yeah.
Well, at least I'm not a vegetable.
Oh, who says you aren't?
Well, the nurse said I wasn't.
She said I could get out of the vegetable wing as soon as I started, you know, doing that thing for myself.
Instead of having them have to do it.
Well, you've spent some time in the beet department of the vegetable wing.
I remember.
I won't do that again.
I'm not going to do that again.
They don't have to put me in the beet wing, the beet ward.
The beet wing.
I'm going to beet off.
I mean, I'm not going to.
I mean, I don't want to end up in that ward again.
I'm not going to.
You won't be in that root cell.
I won't.
I quit.
I quit doing that.
It's not right.
There's a war in Ward 4.
These human valium group and grop and cry.
Herr Doctor, my authority, you know no more than I.
I'm not stuttering.
I'm not.
I'm not stuttering.
I'm not stuttering.

Why?
You keep me.
I have such an evil ring.
I'm sorry.
Dave, don't apologize for that.
No, he just said a point.
You can't recite poetry and then apologize.
He sounded like Dr.
Hal saying some kind of a highfalutin poem that I couldn't understand.
Yeah.
It's part of a lonesome song called kill talk about a person who's been put in a mental
institution against their will.
A new one?
A new Lonesome Cowboy Dave song?
No, I'm afraid it's about...
I'm afraid it's like a couple decades old.
Huh.
It's an old band, the Clocks, the Radio Alarm Clocks.
I don't know if you remember.
I know the Radio Alarm Clocks.
I've seen the cover.
We were in the Clocks.
We got afraid because there was a Clocks in Chicago, too,
so we had to be different.
It didn't make any difference.
It was stupid.
We have all the Clocks records.
We just don't have a record player.
Yes, we do.
We have a record player.
We just don't use a record player.
Right.
We don't use it, but we have one.
But you do smudge the house once in a while
because if you were a Native American or Phoenician
or a troublemaker or you had too many toilet breaks
during the first part before lunch and stuff like that.
That's how you keep the ghost and the tax man out,
is smudge the house.
You mean with, like, sage and...
Yeah.
And, uh...
And holy words.
And tiger X.
Tiger X.
And that sage.
That sage incense.
That Indian incense.
Yeah, the tiger poop scares away almost all the varmints.
Even dogs.
Yeah.
Tiger poop?
Yeah, of course.
It's very metal.
Expensive.
Well, you don't need much.
Just put a little bit around your door sills.
Oh, you can't.
You can't have too much
because you probably could have some convulsions or something.
Well, you better get it while you can
because there aren't going to be much tigers left on this planet after a while.
Yeah, that's...
We're going to have to build a very special
X-Day escape festival that has tigers in it.
Oh, well, it'll be like a zoo,
except that it'll be bigger than the entire Earth
and it won't have any bars.
And the tigers can eat all the giraffes and monkeys
that they can catch and kill.
And the monkeys and giraffes can flee as far as they want to.
And everything will be natural again.
I love when the Bratons do that.
Huh?
When they flee and scream.
Yeah.
Anyway, that's going to be one of...
On my escape vessel,
that's where all the animals are going to escape to
on X-Day in two weeks.
God, it's two weeks.
Yeah.
Well, two weeks before Dr. Howell gets here.
Yes.
And then that's like it's begun.
Yes.
I'm packing the van.
Mm-hmm.
And we're driving down to Southern Ohio.
Oh, I know.
Spending money hand over fist.
And even though it's cheap...
Dark-boiled socks, you know?
I mean, this is a cheap trip.
It's only...
What?
I can't...
I can't say what the week worth of partying costs,
but it's kind of like the subgenius membership.
You know, it's so small,
you can't even say it on a public radio station.
Right.
It's too embarrassing.
It's like a secret society.
Well, that too.
That's what I was going to say.
It's like one day they discover you're wearing gargoyle socks.
You know what I mean?
Well, the Illuminati don't go around saying how much it costs to join.
You know, Al-Qaeda doesn't say what their dues are.
No, they got that blank booklet.
They can just open it up anywhere they want and sign their first...
You know.
We're in the wrong club, man.
We joined the wrong fanatical hate religion.
Just not enough hate.
And they don't take it seriously.
All they do is draw funny pictures of their enemies
and say mean things on podcasts.
America's a club and you ain't in it.
And wear gargoyle socks.
Yeah.
Two-tone shoes.
We're in the club in that we work there
as dishwashers and, you know,
waiters and cooks and toilet swabbers.
That's why we get chicken bone soup for dinner every night after the shift's over.
Hat tippers.
Free food.
Shoe shiners.
Chicken fat.
For the swells.
Lizard wings.
Carnicobia.
Well, I shouldn't complain.
I actually have a pretty good situation as a club employee.
I'm one of the videographers.
So the rich people will actually talk to you if you have a camera
because they want to act like they know what kind of camera it is and stuff.
And you wear a tuxedo like they do.
Yeah, they like that too.
That's how I know about rich folks.
I used to videotape their deb parties and weddings and stuff on Betamax.
Because they didn't have their own cameras then, you know.
Nobody did.
Only experts.
That's mostly in the days where they used to have social registers.
And now you have to register to do anything.
You know, like if you're insane or something and you want to buy a gun,
you've got to go register just like the social registers did when they were all social.
No, you don't.
Are you kidding?
Not in most places you don't have to.
You can be as insane as you want.
You don't have to register to buy a gun.
Especially if you're a socialism.
You're not allowed to.
Because you could cause an insurrection that would be persecutional to our leader.
Whatever it is.
Seriously, my son bought him.
He'd moved back to Texas from a blue state.
And he thought, well, I better get a handgun now like everybody does.
He asked his cousins and his uncle, okay, well, where do I get this thing?
And they said, well, you know, you're not getting registered.
And they went, registered?
This is Texas.
What are you talking about?
So there you go.
Not only do you not have to register it, if you want, you can wear it on top of your head.
You know, wear a gun strapped to either side of your head just like part of your glasses.
Everywhere you look, there's a gun.
You could like put holsters on each ear.
So if somebody were to harass you, you say draw, and you could like pull both of them off your head.
If you wanted to.
If you wanted to, yeah.
Yeah, you can.
And everything's legal.
Of course, because it's Texas.
Everything's legal except sickness.
If you get ill, you just basically, that means it's time for you to die.
What kind of loser are you to get sick?
That's the way the health care system works there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

















Of course, anything is possible then.
But I'm not exaggerating, by the way.
I've had up close and personal tragic experiences with this sort of difference.
It's true.
Yeah.
If you've got Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, kids, rob a 7-Eleven and move to Washington State or someplace.
Get on disability and get on pain pills and die legally.
Because otherwise, you're...
You're just up the creek.
Not only without a paddle, but without use of your limbs.
And in constant, endless pain.
And, yeah.
Well, that can happen to anybody in any country.
And some countries have worse...
Some states have worse health care even than Texas.
True.
Yeah.
It's a good thing we're not there right now.
But, too...
We won't be back.
We won't be back there for another couple of months.
By then, everything will already have been forgotten.
Everything that ever happened will be forgotten again.
Because it's...
The world has been...
The world has been Facebooked.
Why does anybody need to remember anything?
It's all been Facebooked.
Yeah.
And that's the truth, too.
It's a solemn, perfunctory act that we perform nightly.
With shoes or without shoes, we're all face west.
Why do they...
Why do you have to remember any...
Why do you have to remember any history at all?
Because there's always something...
There's always a new funny cat and dog picture on Facebook.
Right.
And plus, you are history.
You know, don't forget.
Any kind of revolutionary idea you may have is too late.
It's already done by somebody else.
Well, it's already been done.
And not only that, but there's an inoculation in society to keep it from working.
So everything will always be worse and stupid forever.
Oh, God.
It's so depressing.
The only thing that would ever make me feel better about any of this
would be to join some crazy cult that was really just not a cult,
but sort of for fun and made you laugh at all the sick, horrible things in the world.
Just long enough to not kill yourself.
You feel just a little bit of slack for half a second
and maybe get a leg up on something.
Hey, I know.
I've heard about this one called the Church of the...
What was it?
The Rub Plenus or the...
The Scrubnemius or...
God, I never can...
And they were like, praise gobs or praise dick or praise slug or something.
Praise Richard.
Bub.
Yeah, praise Bub.
Bubba.
Bubba.
Yeah, it was Church of Bubba or something like that.
Anyway, I'm going to join them sub-clemuses.
They've got the answer.
That Bub guy said so.
The Church of the Benign Slug.
That's the way I'll always be.
I'll always remember it.
I'll remember something that I go to the quartermaster of the den and stuff.
And right there in my chest of drawers,
it's like a Gideon's Bible as to a normal Hungarian or maybe a policeman.
I don't know.
But to me or anybody like me, it's not a silly thing.
It's a thing that we have to know what to say back.
We have to know how to converse with our friends
and our reparates who are...
Subgenius is...
Stupidity is power.
Well, where would I write to or where would I sign up for that on the miasma?
I don't suppose it would be scrub...
You cultivate a relationship with yourself.
Scrubgenius.com would be whatever.
If I could remember the name of that darn world religion,
then I could find their .com.
But if only I could spell it right.
I typed it in.
I typed it in a hundred different ways.
Subgenius, subgenousy, sobgen...
I just, I tried everything.
Scrubgeniality.
Sobgenius.
Yeah.
Well, I just don't know.
I just don't know either.
Hope we can figure that out.
It sounds awful slob-leelius.
That's it.
That was close.
That was real close.
Slobgenius.
That was it.
Because that would describe that cult perfectly.
Oh, wait.
We almost forgot.
Who is Vermin Supreme?
Presidential candidate, prankster, performance artist, jester, time traveler, all of these.
You could find out at Starwood Festival 2019.
Because he's going to be there and he's going to give us a lesson on hook...
Called Hooked on Megaphonics.
Where you learn how to protest...
Do street protest megaphone techniques and skills.
I should take that one.
The history of humor and satire in politics.
From Jonathan Swift through the Yippies and Abbie Hoffman to the Yes Man and Lonesome Cowboy Dave's novel Neighbor World.
And then there's a documentary about him.
And that's all at StarwoodFestival.com.
How about that on July 9th through 15th?
That sounds real interesting.
Along the edges here it says you can also see subgenius figures.
That's not very inviting.
Subgenius figures.
A couple of them.
I can think of a few that are okay.
Reverend Ivan Stang, author.
John Shirley.
John Shirley's going to be there.
God, he's written the grossest, most horrible, not side horror books ever.
Oracle.
Ask Dr. Howell.
Robbins.
Fat Man D.
And Wizard O'Bronzel.
And listen.
The angels are calling us home.
The angels have a job for us.
They want us.
They need us more than this horrible old world does, Dave.
So we're going to have to go.
To subgenius.com.
Well, I can see you're certainly lucky.
I couldn't hear very much.
I can't answer what you were saying.
But I can tell that you probably deserve to be in a penitentiary somewhere,
or at least facing the floodlights for what you've done to so many.
I won't say how much it costs.
Well, I'll be—
Because cost is not the issue.
Well, I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Huh?
When they come and arrest us and throw us into Trump stop for a permanent job.
Oh, I see what you mean.
You're being sarcastic and saying that I'll also be there when they come to arrest us all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.













And us, the Trumps, are home.
Oh, our background music, this show, has been, once again, CyberChump,
our friends who also do exposed foreheads.
They're going to be at the devotional Devo Research Center in late July.
I guess we're going to be there, too,
because we'll still be here.
And you're listening to WCSB Cleveland.
Okay, we just got legal.
I think Dave's gone.
Did he go?
Dave left?
Did he go?
Did he go away?
The dome of his head is no longer with us?
Yeah, but you know—
No, the dome of his head is right over here.
You tricked us, Dave.
Usually he hangs up before I even finish fading him out.
I was pretending to be asleep.
I was sleeping, you know.
I thought, throw a little bit of humorous action there, some psychotronic rub, some dingleblad.
I thought you were sleeping the whole time.
Well, I'm so sorry.
I'm so very sorry that my neuropathic syndromes don't work along the same subliminal lines as yours does.
If he was sleeping, then I'm zeeping.
Oh, I hope you wouldn't do that publicly anymore.
Well, maybe I should.
Maybe I should.



I should think about that twice.
I feel like Dr. Sinister's been right over there this whole time.
Why, yes, he's been here.
He's just leaving us here to do an extra five or ten minutes of show.
Brother Love went and let him in, and he's been here, and you've just been doing show and doing show and doing show.
All over your bodies and having your weird dances in the moonlight and all this stuff.
I think it's sinful and evil.
Well, maybe not evil, but sinful for sure.
Dave, are you dancing in the memes?
Moonlight?
Or inappropriate.
Let's just call it.
Say it was inappropriate.
Barenaked dancing in the moonlight.
Ooh, Barenaked dancing in the moonlight.
The urine thing was something else.
They had to drop that.
They had to drop that?
Yeah, the charges ensuing from the urine.
Ah, I see.
Sounds unpleasant.
Well, it sounds like everybody's wound down now to like about a chicken strength.
Chicken strength?
Yeah, true.
I'm about a chicken strength myself, yes.
What about you?
I'm having muscular spasms and a diagenesis, aphelon for its biological diversions.
Oh, Dave, that's awful.
I'm so sorry.
I know, I know.
Thank you so much.
It's all right.
Nothing's really going to help unless you give me an awful lot of money.
And I don't have any money.

I don't have any money to give you.
I'm in debt.
Well, you could maybe find somebody.
I don't know.
Maybe I could find somebody.
You never know.
I could be resourceful.
I've been resourceful.
Okay, I'm going to send all of you away now.
Oh, no.
Dave and we.
Please don't.
See you guys later.
Yes, and then the background music and everything and then this.
This.
And incidentally, schizophrenic behavior is such a vague term that it has really no
exact or scientific meaning.
How we think about things.
How we think about things.
How we think about things.
How we think about things.
Let's introspect together and see what are the conclusions that we all can draw.
So when there's only awareness.
And attention is not.


It is resting just with awareness.
Then the concept of belief does not even exist.
Because if I can't have it all.
I don't want any of it.
And I'm for real too sweet.
Okay.
Now we can talk about the real truth.
Really important stuff that we can't talk about on the air on broadcast radio because
the hour of slack is almost always played on college and public supported stations that
are non-commercial.
That means we can't be commercial.
But on the internet we can do anything.
And we can tell.
As fast as possible.
As available.
We can.
This is the.
This is our one chance to let you know that we know that you're tired of that old.

Begging.
Recording that I stuck at the end of all those shows.
And this is the new one.
And we're not even begging.
We're just selling you the ordainment kit.
The subgenius ministers kit.
Or membership kit.
It's $35.
Plus.
375 postage.
I think.
Unless you're overseas.
In which case it's like 150 bucks postage.
But you'll see when you get on.
On subgenius.com.
Right at the top.
It says.
Become an ordained minister.
You click on that.
And you'll see a picture of all the cool stuff.
The package that you get.
Aside from the fact that you're now a damn minister.
Okay.
You could really can perform weddings.
In fact I did one tonight.
I signed the papers for my niece Jessica.
And that lucky sum bitch Guillermo.
And I did it for them for free.
Because they're relatives.
And.
He's my nephew in law now.
That's right.
But anyway friends.
You can do that too.
You can perform weddings.
And I usually get about 200 bucks.
From you know.
Civilians.
You can do burials.
Unfortunately you can't do divorces.
And that's where the real money is.
But for your 35 bucks.
You will get inside a large puffy envelope.
You'll get a black card.
A black folder.
That has.
For one thing.
Your subgenius minister's card.
That says you're an ordained minister.
But also.
All the kind of things you'd expect.
From a fan club.
Such as.
A decoder ring.
That only we can decode.
You won't be able to do it.
It looks like a little metal button.
With Bob on it.
No you will need some assistance.
Or actually divine intervention.
You get eternal salvation.
Or triple your money back.
Right.
Of course.
Or yeah.
Two ways.





You really.
Really fancy looking documents.
The all inclusive excuse.
And the doctorate of the forbidden sciences.
Which both look fantastic framed.
On your law office wall.
Hint.
Hint.
All those lawyers out there.
Who haven't joined yet.
But the main thing about membership.
Is the feeling you get.
That you finally really did support the hour of slack.
And the subgenius Facebook pages.
And all the other stuff that's free.
and you helped Reverend Stang pay his half of the mortgage.
So, and it allows us to keep doing this and so forth.
So friends, send that $35.
Actually, make it $40 with postage.
For $38.75.
Okay, $38.75.
You can write a check to Subgenius Foundation.
You can do it online and use a credit card.
You can technically call us and give us a credit card number,
but we hate doing that because, oh wait, I'm not deaf anymore.
I guess I could take those calls.
Yes, you can take those now.
Anyway, friends, yeah, really, $35.
And you get to write.
And you've got to mention the post office box, both in Ohio and in Texas.
Don't forget that, Reverend Orville Stang.
Right, that's the post office box.
And during the winter months.
It's Subgenius at Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.
During the summer and fallish, springish sort of months,
it's Subgenius at P.O. Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.
Oh, I remembered it.
Yeah, that's, don't be a gimme bob, friends.
Don't be.
Be a bommie gimme.
I mean, it's really not cool to not send in your $35.
It's the one-time thing.
And from then on, I'll speak to you.
That's about the only way that's going to happen.
Also, you'll get to look at the members-only internet forum called Scrub Genius.
Yeah.
And believe it or not, there's some really intelligent writing on that thing.
It's nothing like Facebook.
So, and the reason is, I can kick out anyone I want.
And I've never kicked anyone out.
Because Susie the Floozy always does it and stay in.
Reverend Susie the Floozy's on Scrub Genius, friends.
And that's the only way you can be Reverend Susie the Floozy's friend.
And I know you want to be friends with Reverend Susie.
The Floozy.
With a name like that, she must be purdy and sexy and just ready to jump in bed with anybody.
Well, some of those things are true.
She is really purdy and sexy.
She is purdy and sexy.
And she's really, really funny.
And friends, that's why you must join the Church of the Subgenius.
Get slack.
The real thing.
Yeah, exactly.
How invaluable of a trick-or-treat bag is this?
When you...
Think of all the things you've gone through in your subservient lives out there.
Waiting for one day or the next for something to change or happen.
This will actually change your life, friends.
I don't mean to call you friends speciously because I'm not in that form of mood.
I'm a nice person.
I could just diseasely say something very vicarious and argumentative about you.
But I don't know you.
And that's the problem.
So to solve that problem, vote for the Church of the Subgenius by becoming a preordained...
Preordained ministry.
Because ministration is a very important part of our existence.
If we didn't have it, we wouldn't have it.
Praise Bob.
And with that, friends, thank you and good night.
Okay, but we're still on the phone, Dave.
Buenas noches.
Buenas noches.
Buenas, buenas.
Are we done?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, we're done.



I'm afraid...
Okay, I'm going to actually turn the recorder off and that means we really are done.
