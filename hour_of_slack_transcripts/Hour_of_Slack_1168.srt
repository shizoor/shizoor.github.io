1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
The shadows where the mule-lips dwell are dark and wet as ink,

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,380
and low and softly rings their bell as in the slime you sink.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,240
You sink into the slime who dare to knock upon their door,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,140
while down the grinning gargoyles stare and noisome waters pour.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,640
Beside the rotting river's strand the drooping willows weep,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,880
while gloomily the gore-crows stand croaking in their sleep.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,260
Over the murloc mountains, by a long and weary way,

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,480
in a narrow valley where the trees are gray,

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,060
by a dark pool's borders without wind or tide,

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,300
moonless and sunless the mule-lips hide.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,980
The cellars where the mule-lips hide,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
where the gore-crows sit, are dark and dank and cold,

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,840
by single flickering candle lit, and there they count their gold.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,680
Their walls are wet, their ceilings drip,

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,000
their feet upon the floor go softly with a squish-flap-flip as they sidle to the door.

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,480
They peep out slyly, through a crack their feeling fingers creep,

17
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,860
and when they've finished...

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,600
in a sack your bones they take to keep.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,920
Over the murloc mountains, by a long and lonesome road,

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,140
through the spider-shadows and the marsh of toad,

21
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,780
and through the wood of hanging trees and the gallows' weed,

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,060
you go to find the mule-lips and the mule-lips feed.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,980
It's time for the subgenius hour of slack.

24
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,380
Fun for the whole family.

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,060
For kids from six to sixty, and oldsters ninety years young.

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,000
Now is the time to gather around the electronic hearth

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,980
and receive the bountiful benisons of a boy.

28
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


29
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,120
Bob Bob. I'm Dr. Howland Owl, and I will soon be joined

30
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,560
here on the radio stage of the Theatre of Air and Darkness

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,960
with the Reverend Ivan Stang, the most sacred scribe,

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,720
from time to time the Reverend Katayden Legume,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,120
and the unspeakable, lonesome Cowboy Dave.

34
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,580
How good it is to broadcast

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,040
the power of slack.

36
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,000
How pleasant it is to release waves and particles of slack

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,840
into the nuosphere.

38
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,780
Slack is the soft voice.

39
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,640
Slack the luminous cloud.

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,200
We're recording. Everything's going fine.

41
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,980
And now, a dramatic report well calculated to keep you in...

42
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,920
...Squatch.

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,880
Now I remember when I visited Philadelphia the last time

44
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,520
I saw a cat in a green grocer's window, and it looked pretty fake,

45
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,000
but I told him it was fairly lifelike.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,960
Well, you can imagine, when I found out it was some real

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,440
weird twisted kitty, boy was my countenance crimson.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Hello there, Stang.

49
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,100
Hi, Dr. Howell.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm still setting up little bits and pieces.

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,840
That's all right. Save your strength. Save your stamina.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,400
But remember, you can't get a good subgenius down.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,440
They pop up again, like those things that pop up again.

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,100
Those round-bodied dummies that you slap that bounce up again.

55
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,540
That's us, like that statue of Judge Punch that we were all punching

56
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,040
a few years back.

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,880
That really doesn't belong with Judge Punch.

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,520
It belongs to the Church of the Subgenius.

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
We should have a Bob slapped down, because, you know, friends,

60
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,460
Bob can't stay down, slapped or not.

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,660
There's only one way for Bob to be, and that is up...

62
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,880
Is Bob still in the stocks?

63
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,340
Yes, he is observing penitential procedures.

64
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,140
He's there...

65
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,840
I understand he gets off on that. He likes that.

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,740
Well, you see, but Bob is...

67
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,620
You can't chastise Bob, because whatever happens to him

68
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,000
is more a reward than a punishment.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,640
He's kinky, is what it amounts to.

70
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,380
He put himself in the stocks.

71
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,220
Or, in the title of a recent motion picture,

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,700
hideous kinky.

73
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
If anyone saw that one.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,060
What?

75
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,280
You never saw that?

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Kate Winslet was nude. You didn't see hideous kinky.

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,300
Well, that's all right, because...

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,840
I saw the nude frame grabs on celebrityoops.com.

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Better than watching the whole movie, I guess.

80
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,920
Have you ever seen celebrityoops.com?

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,620
It's almost solid frame grabs of famous movie stars,

82
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,160
in their nakedity.

83
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,060
Of nipple slips and so on, but so many are obviously deliberately arranged.

84
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,140
For movie stars, you'd think they could do it with more craft and artfulness.

85
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,580
But nay, they are novices to exhibitionism.

86
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,800
In the case of the Chinese stamp caper,

87
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,520
a Chinese special delivery stamp of 1913

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,700
wasn't invented until four years after that.

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,340
We stamped out a swindler.

90
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...

91
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
A horrible knife!

92
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,820
What is the horrible knife doing up here?

93
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,800
Well, for some...

94
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,040
A minute ago it was commanding me to stab you,

95
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,000
and I fought valiantly against the urge.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,980
That's very good.

97
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,880
It must have been a knife owned by some murderer.

98
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,280
There's something on that.

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,480
I don't know what that knife is, but I won't say what it is.

100
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,720
But there's something on the blade.

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,060
Well, and there's no coffee or peanuts.

102
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,200
Nonetheless, we're going to move ahead into our award-winning Bobcast.

103
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,460
Pretty soon, as I said, you'll be hearing the voices of Reverend Ivan Stang,

104
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,780
then throughout the hour,

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,280
the voice of Reverend Katayden Legume and lonesome cowboy Dave.

106
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,960
We had hoped that Reverend Bleepo Abernathy would be here.

107
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,980
He's the voice who says the hour of slack at the beginning of each show.

108
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,580
And, of course, Pater Nostril has ended up being the number one audio god here.

109
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,840
Well, thank heavens for that.

110
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,280
That's what usually happens.

111
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,860
He's the primary one.

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,180
It's just that the backup audio recording gods ended up being us mortals here.

113
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,980
Well, the audience is small,

114
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,140
but whenever only two or three subgeniuses are gathered together,

115
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,500
there is the sacred excuse for having the hour of slack.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,380
And as Bob Nelson said,

117
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,540
anything that two or more subgenius businessmen do is legal.

118
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,240
Well, he's right about that because he considers himself a king,

119
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,480
as I suppose you know, who makes his own laws.

120
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,100
But...

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Well, he's...

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,180
They haven't put him away yet.

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,160
What can you say?

124
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,220
He's out there, this peculiar, twisted, embedded alchemist,

125
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,040
living out, chipping weird crystals out of caves.

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,120
And there are many behind us right now, working underground,

127
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,320
trying to develop a new way to reach the core.

128
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,920
Because apparently earlier this morning, right around the time of rupture,

129
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,260
there were some minor...

130
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,580
What would you call them?

131
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,920
Convulsions.

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,460
Convulsions, complications, misarrize-

133
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,280
Spasms.

134
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,060
Mortifications.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,340
We call them incidents.

136
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,940
So, if you have been trying to eat the urinal cakes,

137
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,140
please don't eat the urinal cakes.

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,660
It's not the way it's supposed to be.

139
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,280
Those sweet-scented urinal cakes are for the use of all,

140
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,260
not just a few selfish subs.

141
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,380
But we can understand their ravenous hunger to proceed,

142
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,100
because one must always move forward to the next challenge.

143
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,960
A lot of those who have been trying to munch the urinal cakes

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,420
are confused, as we all are, because of these misarrize-ments.

145
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,020
Just pay attention to your chronometer, make sure everything's on time.

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,780
Some people are actually phasing out, going back to a previous time

147
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,760
when there was no X-Day.

148
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,460
But once again, the urinal cakes, no matter how hard you try,

149
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,460
or how much mind power you think you can will,

150
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,780
will not become real cakes.

151
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,220
And now we are joined by the lovely Princess We Are Doe,

152
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,460
queen of all the UFOs.

153
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,860
That delightful odor!

154
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,520
I can't imagine that those weren't hostess mints.

155
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,060
Brayden drops keep falling from her head.

156
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,540
Maybe they were hostless tovinkies.

157
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,800
Perhaps. Perhaps they were.

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,460
Tovarish stinkies.

159
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,840
Yes.

160
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,740
Golden sponge cake, cream filling,

161
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,260
gin-engineered paste.

162
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,420
You get... what is it?

163
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,400
You get a big something in every something.

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,240
A crystal in the forehead.

165
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,160
You get a sucrose blast that comes on fast.

166
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,960
That's right.

167
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,880
You get a big delight in every bite.

168
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,480
And so it is with the subgenius hour of slack.

169
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,040
It's like Jenkham marinade, right?

170
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Each morsel is more nutritive than the last.

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,540
It makes your ears droop.

172
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,520
It makes your...

173
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,780
It's like whale milk,

174
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,440
which grows a tiny whale pup into a huge blubbery monster

175
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,620
within a short year.

176
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,560
It's so nutritive.

177
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,600
It causes unlimited growth and development.

178
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm speaking, of course, of sacred subgenius doctrine.

179
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,300
Right, Dave?

180
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,520
Yes, of course.

181
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,720
You're speaking of sacred subgenius doctrine,

182
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,440
which is as rich and pure as mother's milk.

183
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,220
And we're not talking about Mother Earth.

184
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,100
We're talking about the vacuum of the cosmos.

185
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,120
And that's where you've all gone and been and come back.

186
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,340
And look at you now.

187
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,540
You look exactly the same as you did before.

188
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,060
Now, that's a complete and total miracle.

189
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,800
And some of you have grown goat breasts.

190
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,700
Princess, we have traveled here over city and sea and land

191
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,820
to touch me and Dave with her opiate wand

192
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,600
and bless us on this occasion.

193
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,900
Oh, it is...

194
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,860
True bliss.

195
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,600
Her power is brought on by the true bliss.

196
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,280
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but...

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,140
It's easy to get all confused and contorted and wound around,

198
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,360
but here at Brushwood, the great subgenius simplicities become apparent.

199
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,220
In fact, many have become apparent at Brushwood.

200
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,600
Quite a few have become offspring,

201
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,080
and that's another thing you should guard against.

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,760
Too much spring in your step and too much...

203
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm a little behind.

204
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,340
It is nature's way that the youth spring off from the parent,

205
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,100
that the bud detacheth from the stem.

206
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,900
Some apparent, some applement, and other orangement.

207
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
Many are called, but few are chosen.

208
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,680
Many have taken ship at the pale beaches,

209
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,380
but few return to the sunlit lands.

210
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,920
Indeed.

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,340
There is some muttering behind me.

212
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,380
I don't know if we are observing the strict protocols, but...

213
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,040
I thought Dave sprung a leak over there.

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,440
No, that was the moderator behind the moderator,

215
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,780
including the rest of the guests that are invisible.

216
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,140
Oh, right.

217
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,860
For the love of God, I...

218
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,820
The choir invisible.

219
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,240
I can't see them, and now...

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,000
Is there something wrong with my pineal glands?

221
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,100
Ellery Queen's.

222
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,680
This is Ellery Queen with a case I call The Big Mistake.

223
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,340
In this case, the charge was murder, and police were holding a youthful suspect.

224
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,360
I told him, it's a good story, but you're a murderer, John.

225
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,940
It's just the same.

226
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,560
In a moment, I'll explain why.

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,940
In the case of The Big Mistake, most desk drawers are automatically locked by the middle drawer alone.

228
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,140
But a big one.

229
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,020
Listen again to Ellery Queen's...

230
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,940
Today is X-Day.

231
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,340
This is just after the sacred baptism in the pool of slack,

232
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,080
where we inculcated slack in many new members

233
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,820
who joyously shouted,

234
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,660
shouted their church name,

235
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
were submerged by Pastor Stang,

236
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,000
and by Reverend Legume,

237
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,180
and caught by me, Dr. Howland Owl.

238
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,320
And so it shall always be.

239
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,260
There shall be subgenius hands to keep you from plummeting into the abyss,

240
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,820
for at least the first time.

241
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,100
And after that, you're on your own.

242
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,620
Plummet away, we say.

243
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,240
But remember, gaze not into the abyss,

244
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,840
lest the abyss gaze into thee.

245
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,860
When you get to the bottom of the abyss, you can go...

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
That's if you have vocal cords left.

247
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,980
Create your own world.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,740
Many are experiencing body changes that cannot be easily explained.

249
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,660
And...

250
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,020
Now, look, notice the man.

251
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
Over there rolling up a suitcase.

252
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,740
Or is that a huge f-f-fatty?

253
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,860
No one knows.

254
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,440
And in fact, we're all very, very blinded by the true light

255
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,720
that's coming in through the side...

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,580
that's coming through the windows.

257
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,820
It's everywhere.

258
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,820
It's everywhere.

259
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,120
It's like, oh, oh.

260
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,300
You sure you're all right?

261
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm fine.

262
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,940
I'll see what I can do.

263
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm fine.

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,880
I think there might be something wrong with Commander Tucker.

265
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,680
Tucker! Tucker!

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,440
Commander Charles Tucker the Third.

267
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,420
Where's Commander Tucker?

268
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Charles Tucker the Third.

269
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,760
Where is he?

270
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,540
He's no longer a corporeal.

271
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,960
But he will be again, Tucker.

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,100
What about Tucker?

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,660
I'm fine.

274
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,900
Are you sure you're all right?

275
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,680
Tucker!

276
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,560
Tucker, dance and cook!

277
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,140
Quickly, please, Tucker out!

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,880
Something wrong?

279
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,880
No.

280
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,020
Everything's fine.

281
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,140
I thought you said we needed to get out of here.

282
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,860
Commander Tucker.

283
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm fine, sir.

284
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,320
Is everything going all right, Doc?

285
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,340
More or less.

286
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,400
Everything will be all right.

287
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,600
Where's Commander Tucker?

288
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,080
Are you doing all right?

289
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,240
We're okay.

290
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
Has anyone seen Commander Tucker?

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,760
I think he was down there.

292
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,280
Thanks.

293
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,740
I can't find Commander Tucker.

294
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm fine.

295
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,260
Go ahead.

296
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,340
Mission accomplished.

297
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,300
Go ahead.

298
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,400
Mission accomplished.

299
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,860
He's left, Commander Tucker.

300
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,900
He'll be fine.

301
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,940
What to tell your teenager about Bob.

302
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,960
Bob and his place in this world for troubled teens.

303
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:04,060
You know, we insist that all troubled teenage sub-genius girls go to Dave's home for the slackless

304
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,780
and get reoriented and cleared, as we say.

305
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Ready for liftoff.

306
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,760
Yes, I'm proof positive that that school works.

307
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,020
This child here had no direction whatsoever until she came to Dave's camp.

308
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,800
And look at her today.

309
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,180
She's sprouted a third breast, a new pineal gland, and she can see with her ears.

310
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:38,760
Once they've matriculated from Dave's camp for wayward teeners, then they're ready to immerse themselves in my course in sex and marriage.

311
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,320
And she's a real estate.

312
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:49,480
This award-winning program has been shown to be a proven soul-winner and to bring millions to Bob's spidery embrace.

313
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:59,200
I tried it, and in 45 minutes or so, I couldn't find my own cranium or any other part that was connected before.

314
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,760
And I had an A average.

315
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,400
Dude, I actually freaking died and stuff.

316
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,960
And then I was still dead and stuff, but...

317
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,060
No way, you died? You're like after-dead now?

318
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,260
Yeah, and they actually paid me to come to the camp.

319
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:32,280
Sub-genius youths go through our program of glandscaping and acubiting and emerge gleaming new beings,

320
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,380
ready to conquer a world which waits passively for their fulsome impetus.

321
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:38,600
And they embrace.

322
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,080
Some have swollen, gleaming, dry white humps on the back of their necks.

323
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,660
Yeah, I know. Don't rub it in.

324
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,200
I've been trying to rub it in for the last 25 minutes and you resist me.

325
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,820
Is that what you were doing over there?

326
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:04,140
You know, there's some curious bugs in this campground that can bite through the heel of your hand and leave bug bites that look like warts behind.

327
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,960
I've never seen anything like it.

328
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,820
I believe that's called a horsefly, also known as a dobsfly.

329
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,760
I would have seen one of those big bastards and felt it. It can't just bite me in a clandestine way, but...

330
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,200
Dobsonfly.

331
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,100
Dobsonfly, pardon me. Dobsonfly, yes.

332
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:32,200
The smackly bite of the Dobsonfly causes all form of ailment and disorientation. See? Yes.

333
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,900
You know, speeders and flies are close relatives and fellow travelers.

334
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:43,420
That mosquito may seem like a tiny insignificant thing, but it's man's unconquerable enemy.

335
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,080
And so is his fellow traveler and sympathizer, the fly.

336
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes, these are no pals of humanity, but scourges which should be extirpated with fire and sword.

337
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,460
Of course, I'm only talking about the female mosquito.

338
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,480
The male is a wimp who doesn't bite anyone.

339
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,780
Simply flits around, sucking out nectar from flowers.

340
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:18,220
But the female has killed millions on this terraqueous globe and shows no sign of stopping.

341
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,980
None at all.

342
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,620
The female rock, on the other hand, shows no interest in anything and fairly well ever lubricates herself.

343
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,480
Sometimes she's half-baked, and other times she's completely and totally overbaked.

344
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
You mean when she sits on her nest?

345
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:45,900
I didn't know about this phoenix-like activity in the rock, that giant bird of Persian lore, but you learn something new every day.

346
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:53,780
As the Mithras believe, a shiny rock or a nest of rocks can produce gold.

347
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,360
This is the old alchemical signal we've given to everyone.

348
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,140
The rock was also supposed to be, in some respect, the father of...

349
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,540
gin.

350
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,500
It's a very strange life cycle.

351
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:15,680
That is, the genie that comes out of the lamp can have its origin in the egg of the rook.

352
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,220
Why this is, I have no idea.

353
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,500
Ah, the mysteries of life and science.

354
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,040
Another unturned page of subgenius science.

355
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:32,840
But you remember from Sinbad's travels when he saw that huge white dome that he thought was the dome of a mosque.

356
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,120
And he went and walked around it.

357
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,400
And realized it was an egg.

358
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:45,380
And soon the sky blackened as the enormous bird came swooping and settling down on this giant egg.

359
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,780
And so it is.

360
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,020
Can you try to take olive oil away and then Popeye?

361
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,140
That's in Popeye Meets Sinbad.

362
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:00,560
And in that film, Popeye defeated the rock and served it up like an enormous turkey on a plate.

363
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
Steaming. It looked delicious.

364
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,980
They didn't have time to eat it, though.

365
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,180
It was all fisticuffs after that.

366
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,040
So much for pugilism and our olfactory glands.

367
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,860
We all smell bad when we've been beaten up by Bob.

368
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:22,780
The island itself, in that case, was said to be on the back of a whale or the back of a marine monster.

369
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,980
And such stories have gone for a long time.

370
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,240
That there are islands that are actually huge organisms, which, when you land on them,

371
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,300
will dive and then devour you.

372
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,500
Some of them are actually fetuses floating around in the cosmos.

373
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,540
They haven't even been born yet.

374
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,420
They're kind of embryonic and stuff.

375
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,000
And once they begin to expand, they eat entire galaxies.

376
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,580
So you've got to make sure you watch out for that as you're hurtling through whatever the freaking hell it is.

377
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,480
Like Galactus, you mean?

378
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,940
Very much unlike Galactus.

379
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,820
See, in Galactus...

380
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,320
What?

381
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,360
Isn't that where the truck comes alive and devours all the subgeniuses?

382
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,900
No, that's one of those slam-bangety robots.

383
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm talking about Galactus, who's represented by the Silver Surfer.

384
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,920
The pompous windbag who goes through space intoning for,

385
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,180
Am I not Galactus?

386
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
Well, I don't know. I guess you are.

387
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,520
Yeah, I guess you kept on posing the question as if it were some sort of...

388
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,800
You know, you were a mythical type.

389
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,220
Am I not... or are...

390
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:38,260
By God, I'm not. I'm Arthur Q. Jones of 1229 Mapledale Avenue. I forgot.

391
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,720
I'm Dank Singer-Vell of 2525 Ewe Christian Avenue in beautiful downtown Nor...

392
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,460
Nor...

393
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,400
For am I not the waiter?

394
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,060
And I am Bingham St. Clair.

395
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,980
And I'm the maitre d' of all the bad things you've been thinking.

396
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll just have the diet.

397
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,660
Ah, that's all right. You're gonna get the whole smorgasbord.

398
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,120
We're gonna slap it right in your face.

399
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,180
A smorgasbord of subgenius science and philosophy.

400
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,940
That's right.

401
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:18,900
Served up piping hot and savory with the special succulent spices of our subgenius suck-off.

402
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,980
But remember, new organ meat is very, very difficult to cook.

403
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,620
And once you sprout a new organ, you gotta take care of all kinds of spicing and rubbing and deep frying.

404
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,240
And that's what we're gonna do.

405
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,320
Message one.

406
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,080
By continuing to listen, you are acknowledging that you are two, three, one, eight.

407
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,920
This is one, three, zero, one, three.

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,960
A debt collector with ass acceptance.

409
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,820
Please contact me about a personal business matter Saturday morning between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Mountain Time.

410
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,340
Again, this message is for three, eight, two, one.

411
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,560
Thank you.

412
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,280
I suppose you've all made dinner plans for tonight?

413
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,460
Decided where and what you're going to eat?

414
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,080
You all gonna have your own, eat your own new organs tonight, are ya?

415
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,480
Huge slabs of ribs slathered in barbecue sauce.

416
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:24,000
And of course, the delicious odors that emanate from the cryptic factory where giant chickens die an unspeakable death.

417
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,380
Remember, you're making the barbecue sauce in your own mind, you know.

418
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,500
You're like creating it in your own mind.

419
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,260
I read an interesting obit in the paper before I came out here.

420
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,040
It seems that Arby died.

421
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,820
Arby the...

422
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,180
Arby?

423
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,860
Arby behind Arby's.

424
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,440
Oh.

425
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,380
Yeah, there's no Hardy behind Hardy's.

426
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,300
And no McDonald behind McDonald's.

427
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,400
But there was an Arby.

428
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,600
Arby is dead?

429
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,140
Mr. Arby?

430
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:49,680
Dead.

431
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,820
Yes, he's dead.

432
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,560
He died.

433
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,820
And actually, he lost the business years ago in a poker game.

434
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,440
I'm the lawyer.

435
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,160
And continued with his name.

436
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,560
But that old geezer shuffled off this mortal coil.

437
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,440
He founded other burger joints too.

438
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Single-handedly responsible for despoiling vast tracts of the Earth's surface.

439
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,200
There are so many planes that we could just kind of slip lightly into and never be seen again.

440
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,540
So many concurrent planes existing in one place.

441
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,060
In the one we're in right now, Mr. Ms. Murr-Ms.

442
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:33,980
Arby is now consuming all of his food and returning it to the people.

443
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,080
But there aren't any people.

444
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,560
Not as we know it, Jim.

445
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,820
You see, these are subgenie and they've been modified.

446
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,920
Modified in plenty of different ways.

447
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,880
Some of them have involved new organs of their own choosing.

448
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,420
Some of them have become very muscular when they were small and pallid.

449
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,280
Others, well, they're invisible.

450
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,460
And there are thousands of people right now in this room crowding around to hear what we have to say.

451
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,960
Fucking bullshit, isn't it?

452
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,380
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,400
I reach, Herbert.

454
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,120
Yes. Yes, I do.

455
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,620
I understand the deeper things of life.

456
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:17,980
You come.

457
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,480
In a way I can see into the bottom of your mind.

458
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,480
And see that even a sober-sided subgenius such as yourself,

459
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,900
persists in dissatisfaction with things as they are.

460
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,740
And ever seeks to cast a subgenius shape over them.

461
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,440
No, man, it's not like that.

462
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,440
I love it.

463
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,340
I'm full of the love of Dobbs and I'm with it.

464
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Oh, you can't fool me.

465
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,900
No, no, no, I'm not trying to fool you, man.

466
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,160
I'm just laying on some...

467
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,340
I know.

468
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,760
It's like a head trip that's been hanging around for the last...

469
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,780
I don't know, man.

470
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,340
Is there any time anymore?

471
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,260
No, no.

472
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,120
You see, we were putting the speed freaks to sleep, man.

473
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,820
The one guy started shaking and his knees fell.

474
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,040
What?

475
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,100
What was I talking to you?

476
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,780
Well, perhaps you were addressing the Reverend Ivan Stang.

477
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,980
He's not gonna be shaking, is he?

478
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,540
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, you guys.

479
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

480
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,140
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

481
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,620
Well, we have a lot of stuff on the docket today.

482
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,260
And of course, many wonderful, notable wonders and undertakings

483
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,880
from...

484
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,700
which we will never repent.

485
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,620
Actually, Dave and Hal...

486
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,120
Yes?

487
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,160
I feel bad about coming up here and interrupting you...

488
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,160


489
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,120
...because last year, after we did the X-Day Hour of Slack,

490
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,680
just like this, I got an email from an active subgenius

491
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,380
whose name I won't mention, Reverend Eggplant,

492
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,120
who said,

493
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,600
Stang, you're okay, but I wish you'd get Dave and Hal

494
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,420
together again.

495
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,720
I like listening to them.

496
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,460
They're just the funniest thing in the world.

497
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:57,760
Oh.

498
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
Dave and Hal are together.

499
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,800
They're so funny.

500
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,900
So why don't you get Dave and Hal together more?

501
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,660
And he just left it unsaid that less of you, Reverend Stang.

502
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,660
So you guys just go ahead and be funny, funny, funny.

503
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,980
Oh, no, we, we, we, we, we...

504
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,360
Smarty, smart, smart.

505
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,740
I guess I'm just not good enough for the Dave and Hal show,

506
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,780
according to Reverend...

507
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,080
That's not a left-handed compliment.

508
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,860
...I won't say his name, Eggplant.

509
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,860
We were just trying to fill the dead air, man,

510
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,100
while you were messing around.

511
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,440
We were sitting up here trying to fill the dead air,

512
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,360
waiting for you, man.

513
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,120
We were just trying to get it set up for you.

514
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
No, no, you're not good enough.

515
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,600
Let the dead lie.

516
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,360
And there were some lying dead people last night, I noticed.

517
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,240
We smelled them.

518
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,440
Friends last...

519
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,660
They were.

520
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,620
I don't know if all of you were at the...

521
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,540
What was that thing called?

522
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,820
The Lurching Zombie-thon?

523
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,680
No, no, it was the ritual...

524
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,940
It's on the schedule.

525
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,460
It's on the schedule.

526
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,120
They were going to dig up the late Chaz Smith

527
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,720
and roll his corpse around.

528
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,380
Oh, yes.

529
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,220
But first, they had to...

530
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,240
But first?

531
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,900
Oh, that's very undignified.

532
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,720
...bring the spirits of many deceased villains and murderers,

533
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,500
mass murderers and jerks...

534
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,040
Spirits or gods that used to share this earth with men.

535
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,860
...where the spirits were allowed to enter various subgeniuses...

536
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,660
Are they good spirits?

537
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,960
...then walked up in line...

538
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,560
Are they dead spirits?

539
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,480
...and passed the holy man, Dr. Le Guin,

540
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,100
who then forgave their sins and sent these mass killers to heaven.

541
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,960
So that I suppose eventually...

542
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,420
What happens when you slaughter an angel?

543
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,680
Where does the angel go?

544
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,460
Heaven's heaven.

545
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:39,620
They reform.

546
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,460
Do angels have souls?

547
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,980
They come back together.

548
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,220
Comes back...goes to a place called...

549
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,560
So they're like Bob.

550
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,160
Yeah.

551
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,520
You hit him and they bounce back with a band-aid on their head.

552
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,540
It's like in hell.

553
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,000
In hell, or ground up into hamburger,

554
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,240
you eventually, painfully reform for further torture.

555
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,880
And it's the same in the afterlife.

556
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,340
Your body is simply an organizational system.

557
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,740
I thought the idea was more like if you hated hamburger

558
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,800
and you went to hell, you were forced to eat it daily.

559
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,780
Well, if you're ground up into hamburger in hell,

560
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,180
it's considered your fault.

561
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,500
And there's extra punishment, of course, for that.

562
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,720
But I only use that as an example.

563
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,440
Are we allowed to eat ourselves as subgeniuses?

564
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,020
It's just a question I wanted to ask the panel right now

565
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,720
because I've been thinking about doing it.

566
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,040
You can't eat your own stomach.

567
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,380
I would have to avoid my stomach, wouldn't I?

568
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,260
You can't chew your own teeth.

569
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,600
Copyright, Jane.

570
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,880
You have to avoid chewing them, too.

571
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,640
If you're a bad subgenius and you go to subgenius hell,

572
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,580
say you were a glutton.

573
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,480
Well, you'll get to eat all of them.

574
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,000
You'll get to eat all you want in subgenius hell.

575
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,300
So you like to eat, do you?

576
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,780
But not like that cartoon with the little piggy

577
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,720
who's forced to eat more than he wants.

578
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,880
You get to eat all you want,

579
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,640
but it's as if you had the diverter installed.

580
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,940
You can eat and eat and eat,

581
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,100
and it won't affect your health either way.

582
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,120
It just makes you happy.

583
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,820
You're eating just for fun.

584
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,840
And say you're a sex addict.

585
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,800
Why, in subgenius hell, there's no shame in it.

586
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,700
There'll be endless demonic sex partners.

587
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,700
You'll get to eat all you want.

588
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,800
Whatever your failing was on earth,

589
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,980
that will be your strength in subgenius hell.

590
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,500
So practice that stuff, man.

591
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,660
Don't puss out.

592
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,360
For those of you who are more sedentary

593
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,100
and don't want to do things for yourselves,

594
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,580
even though it's on the mental cerebral plane,

595
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520
there are thousands of demon servants

596
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,220
waiting to do your every bidding

597
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,700
and slap your every pudding at any time.

598
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,520
When they put me in subgenius hell,

599
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,240
well, actually, what is it?

600
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,240
I don't know what I should work on.

601
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,880
Your fingers.

602
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,060
My fingers will quit hurting.

603
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,660
That's right.

604
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,740
Thousands at Bob's bidding speed

605
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,020
and post over land and ocean without rest.

606
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,600
But of course, I was talking about the Christian hell,

607
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,200
which is so different from subgenius hell.

608
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,160
Oh, it's easy to get into, too.

609
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,680
You don't have to spend 30 bucks

610
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,260
to get into Christian hell and be tormented for eternity.

611
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,580
No, they're automatic.

612
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,060
All you have to do is jack off once or twice

613
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,800
without saying your prayers.

614
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,300
You don't even have to do that.

615
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
You only have to think about it.

616
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,100
Christian hell consists of having to attend

617
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,920
Christian services all the time.

618
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
And if you're not baptized.

619
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,780
That's pre-hell.

620
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,280
It doesn't matter.

621
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,800
According to Jack T. Chick,

622
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,600
who we consider the ultimate authority on these things,

623
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,180
you're going to go to hell no matter what you do.

624
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
It doesn't matter what you do.

625
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,760
You're not being punished for a specific sin.

626
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,300
You're punished because you're born sinful

627
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,060
and only

628
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,780
the blood of Jesus can wash it away.

629
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,140
If you are interested in this insanitary procedure.

630
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,140
Now, of course, this is what this famous

631
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,940
underground cartoonist says,

632
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,580
and in no way does it reflect subgenius belief.

633
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,900
It only in some strange and unknowable way

634
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,760
mirrors, echoes, or reflects it.

635
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,720
In the old Norse myths,

636
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,940
we know that hell meant earth.

637
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,600
Hell was the land,

638
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,540
and commonly referred to afterwards

639
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,360
in English and Old Anglo-Saxon,

640
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,660
who, and it's called over the hill,

641
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,580
meaning you've gone past life.

642
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,100
Under the hill, meaning there was no more life left in you.

643
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,520
Therefore, never mind.

644
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,100
You are in hell now!

645
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,140
That was Bob's message.

646
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,740
You're in hell now, my friend.

647
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,580
As long as we're still enslaved to the conspiracy,

648
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,160
it might as well be hell.

649
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,680
Life seems like it goes on forever.

650
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,220
The younger you are, the more forever-like it seems.

651
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,580
You might remember what Mephistopheles said

652
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,800
when Faust asked him,

653
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,920
Hey, I thought you demons were confined to hell.

654
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,560
How come you're up here flouncing around and tempting me?

655
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,740
And the devil's answer was,

656
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,000
Why, this is hell.

657
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Nor am I out of it.

658
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,560
Because any place that isn't hell,

659
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,440
even heaven, the one place they can't go,

660
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
is hell to them.

661
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,780
But to a subgenius, this applies in a greater,

662
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,760
a more spiritual sense.

663
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,100
That's why when we fight the conspiracy,

664
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,200
we're not only fighting a material or spiritual conspiracy

665
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,940
that keeps our minds down and our bodies down.

666
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,300
We're actually...

667
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,860
Principalities and powers, thrones, dominions,

668
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,880
and badly animated Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

669
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,420
The conspiracy is our bodies.

670
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,360
The conspiracy is our minds.

671
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,560
So when we reject our bodies and we reject our minds,

672
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,320
we reject the conspiracy, and we have...

673
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,360
What left?

674
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420

from here.

696
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,340
Halaciously bad animated Jesus story.

697
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,400
By Pisces.

698
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,520
I've noticed that the subgenius

699
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,380
schedule keeps

700
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,180
jumping away from the printed one

701
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,800
and then jumping back again.

702
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,320
Time control. Once again

703
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,380
friends, it's time control.

704
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,860
Elastic as a jellyfish.

705
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,480
Subgenius schedule flows in

706
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,520
to fill a vacuum and expands

707
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,220
to

708
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,820
expand around.

709
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,980
The malleable molly of time.

710
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,040
Also remember when you change

711
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,140
time you become a changeling

712
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,240
yourself and actually are

713
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,160
capable of re-entering

714
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,580
anywhere you want.

715
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,120
That is anywhere you want.

716
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,220
I guess. That's biology.

717
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,000
Just as when

718
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,840
the incubus

719
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,160
drains the seminal

720
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,000
fluid from a young man

721
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,320
in his sleep. Happened to me

722
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,160
this morning. Then the

723
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,040
incubus takes its special

724
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
flight and

725
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,220
in that flight the incubus

726
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,180
changes sex. Becomes

727
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,000
a succubus. Descends.

728
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,880
Finds a female human

729
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,600
to mate with and

730
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,060
deposits the spermatic

731
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,040
package. Creating the

732
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,060
changeling. That which is

733
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,160
born of a demonic being.

734
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,360
A good example

735
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,300
would be Reverend Anna Dynamite

736
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,620
standing at the back of the

737
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,040
stage there.

738
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,120
Perfect example.

739
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,100
The succubus allegedly sprung

740
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
from the loins of that fabulous

741
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,820
mythic monster known as

742
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,900
Dr. Legume.

743
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,340
Loins? There are no more

744
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,020
loins in this realm. Everything

745
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,280
springs into existence of its

746
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,120
own free will.

747
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,500
That's the way it used to be.

748
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
I'm sorry I don't belong here.

749
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,920
The world was fecund and

750
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,820
bursting at the seams with life

751
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,080
growing outward in all

752
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,960
directions but now it's sort of

753
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,900
tired and sagging

754
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,520
and life and living

755
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,580
forms a sort of peremptory

756
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,880
motion which shall soon

757
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,020
be still. Moving

758
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
toward the stillness of its rest.

759
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,960
Like old underwear

760
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,480
elastic that's just gone saggy.

761
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,180
Yeah and it reminded me

762
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,740
to get that stuff out of the bathhouse.

763
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,060
Like old underwear that's so

764
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,160
dead it's sprung to life

765
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,100
again and has a mind of

766
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,480
its own.

767
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,480
Well I said Chernobyl was so long ago.

768
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,460
Nothing to worry about.

769
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,120
And now I hear in the news

770
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,340
these dumb guys in the Department of Energy

771
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,180
and the Defense Department are gonna start

772
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,220
building a bunch of Chernobyls

773
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,480
across the United States.

774
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,000
And then I hear on the news that Chernobyl

775
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,320
is not really over. No.

776
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,400
All these people are dying.

777
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,960
It's all the pollution that's getting into the

778
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,020
water. It's getting into the aquifers and

779
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,400
groundwater.

780
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,660
Everything goes

781
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,900
from one to one.

782
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,480
The distance between Kiev and Cleveland

783
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,100
I know man we're getting in tune.

784
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,620
You like hearing.

785
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,940
You know.

786
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,960
And then I started thinking.

787
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,720
How come my moods are getting so

788
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,740
janky.

789
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
The iodine

790
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,240
the one three one

791
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,660
has got my thyroid on the run.

792
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,780
And the krypton

793
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,760
at eighty five

794
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,900
is making it hard just to stay alive.

795
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,660
But the iodine

796
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,260
the one three one

797
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,000
the iodine

798
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,380
the one three one

799
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,320
no more running through the metal

800
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,280
mines. No more

801
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,660
boiling in the mud.

802
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,000
Power powers

803
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,240
in the power scenes.

804
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,960
Shake the bony head and shake it good.

805
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,300
The better

806
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,980
man

807
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:18,060
the poison

808
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,640
man

809
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
shake it

810
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,120
all

811
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,240
the

812
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,380
poison

813
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


814
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


815
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


816
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


817
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


818
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


819
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:20,380


820
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,000
in the

821
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,540
bony head.

822
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,340
The iodine

823
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,100
the one three one

824
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,200
has got my thyroid

825
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,380
on the run.

826
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,380


827
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,640
And the krypton

828
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,600
at eighty five

829
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,680
is making it hard just to stay alive.

830
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,620
But the iodine

831
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,180
the one three one

832
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,880
the iodine

833
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,480
the one three one

834
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,640
No more running through the metal mines.

835
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,140
No more

836
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,500
boiling in the mud.

837
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,840
Shake the bony head

838
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,160
of the poison man.

839
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,980
Shake the bony head and shake it good.

840
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,360
No more running through the metal mines.

841
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,340
No more

842
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,540
boiling in the mud.

843
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,980
Shake the bony head

844
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,240
of the poison man.

845
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,300
Shake the bony head and shake it good.

846
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,340
Shake it

847
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,680
Shake it

848
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,980
Shake it

849
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,700
Shake the bony head

850
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,620
of the poison man.

851
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,780
The iodine

852
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,920
the bony head

853
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,320
Iodine one three one

854
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,200
friends. Written and

855
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,060
sung by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

856
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,260
On Einstein's Secret Orchestra album

857
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,400
Sex in Another Dimension.

858
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,040
And we'll be playing some more songs

859
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,220
from ESO in honor of the late

860
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,100
Chaz Smith, leader

861
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,220
of that band whose funeral we've been

862
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,800
having over and over again. But

863
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,040
time is running out.

864
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,020
Let's clear the docket and see if there are any points

865
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:10,120
of subgenius theology that have not

866
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,240
been explicated that we might do a better

867
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,400
job with as we make

868
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,980
this historic recording

869
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,160
for the Akashic Records. Brilliant!

870
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,040
Let's begin.

871
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,500
Lesson forgotten number one.

872
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,700
What is it?

873
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,800
What is it?

874
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,260
Yeah, what he said. That's a good thing.

875
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,400
What is it? Yes. Well if we're going to be

876
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,080
going over all these different things that

877
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,160
are unforgotten and forgettable

878
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,020
why, you know what I'm saying?

879
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,000
Capital. That is correct. Yesterday

880
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,080
Dr. Howell answered the simple

881
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,660
question, why?

882
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,600
I get that one all the time.

883
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,200
But it is important

884
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,820
that whether one is going to

885
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,160
review a cathedral or a

886
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,100
corkscrew, one must first

887
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,960
understand what it is supposed

888
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,220
to be. And so

889
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,300
what is this subgenius

890
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,320
thing supposed to be? And is it

891
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,260
what is it supposed to be? Is it

892
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,000
fulfilling its potential?

893
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Or is it just some other

894
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,220
thing? Shall we ask

895
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,140
those present if perhaps

896
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,740
they've been un-fun-filled?

897
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,300
Or fun-fun-filled? Well if anyone wants

898
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,260
to testify, we'll take that

899
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,120
testimony into the record at this time. Actually I

900
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,220
have some quotes

901
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,360
from various famous subgeniuses

902
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,960
that do indeed

903
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,540
address this

904
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,940
exact subject.

905
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,800
Dr. What an astonishing coincidence.

906
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,180
Let's have some of them now

907
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,960
for the benefit of

908
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,580
future generations.

909
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,040
Well as we said yesterday friends, you know

910
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,020
you really have to be able to get the outer joke

911
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,200
before you start worrying about the inside

912
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,300
jokes. Most of the Bobbies, it's just

913
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,380
the other way around. They get all

914
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,460
the inside jokes first and they never

915
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,240
realize that the outer joke is

916
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,160
themselves.

917
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,440
And others go, well the church

918
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,140
well isn't it really

919
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,700
just a drug thing?

920
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,060
If you ask a Cleveland

921
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,100
policeman, that's the standard answer

922
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,240
you would get. They're just

923
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,220
marijuana addicts. Have you seen anybody

924
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,140
smoking marijuana in this whole campground?

925
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,100
No. Frop maybe.

926
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,560
Some crappy buglers

927
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,960
like Dave here, but

928
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,120
no. No friends, because

929
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,840
Bob replaces the drugs

930
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,420
simply

931
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,200
looking at the dots

932
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,080
of his

933
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,220
face erases more

934
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,200
brain cells than any of those

935
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,600
drugs. It replaces

936
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,300
so many brain cells that it might as

937
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,860
well be like using the drug.

938
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Except that you don't lose the brain cells

939
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,880
forever, they're just changed.

940
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,320
And all it takes is that Dobbs hit.

941
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,300
It's good to

942
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,180
buy the books and all of the CDs

943
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
but

944
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,880
really all you need is that one

945
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,100
true, bedotted,

946
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,340
classic Dobbs head.

947
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,160
That's all the drug any real subgenius

948
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,120
needs. Unfortunately most of us are

949
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,340
adulterated subgeniuses.

950
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,120
Even the best of us are mostly

951
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,060
subgenius with some

952
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,300
pink pneumatic

953
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,260
matrix left over.

954
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,020
And we hope that the progressive

955
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,280
portion will overwhelm

956
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,200
the unfortunate

957
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,100
and inferior remnant.

958
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,040
We're no better than octoroons

959
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,100
or other sea mammals.

960
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,340
We've only got one part of one part of one part

961
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,600
of one equation.

962
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,500
Yes, according to a racist

963
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,300
that makes you an inferior.

964
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,940
If you have even that

965
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,080
one part of the

966
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,920
blood, as they put it, of the

967
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,340
despised race.

968
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,180
But you see none of that matters as long as you've got

969
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,020
that Dobbs head.

970
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,240
Yes, because that will,

971
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,220
looking at it, it will actually change your

972
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,980
cellular structure. It will

973
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,580
reassert the ancient

974
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,520
Yeti bowel plan

975
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,700
which still exists in

976
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:50,500
the ancient

977
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:50,500


978
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,300
to run through

979
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,920
your veins.

980
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,780
As one subgenius

981
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,940
said, it's the Chinese

982
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,280
finger trap of the mind.

983
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,540
That's what the church is.

984
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,920
We will get somebody to stick their brain

985
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,140
in one end and their brain

986
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,900
in the other end and then you can't

987
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,600
get it out.

988
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,620
You're just stuck.

989
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,280
And that's good. That's the slack.

990
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:21,500
As Onan said, slack is the oomph in comfortable.

991
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,640
And we don't advocate drug taking of any kind.

992
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:33,500
I remember in Arizona around 10 p.m. back in the 60s,

993
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,400
they used to broadcast this message which was supposed to get teens off drugs.

994
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,180
And this gruff, authoritative voice would say,

995
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:46,140
will drugs turn you on or will drugs turn on you?

996
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,880
And there it would be.

997
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,460
You could set your watch by it.

998
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,600
I frequently did.

999
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,660
But it's funny.

1000
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:58,900
All the stoners would tune in, especially to listen to that message.

1001
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,920
Now, they were already taking drugs.

1002
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,940
That's how I learned how to do drugs was from anti-drug commercials.

1003
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,420
Well, they are very informative.

1004
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,880
Dave.

1005
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,160
I was just going to say I learned in a mind control experiment.

1006
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,100
I forget where it was.

1007
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,620
It was Buffalo or Zippy Town.

1008
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,900
There was some place near there.

1009
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,440
And we were kept underground in like these little cavern places and stuff.

1010
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,520
And we were forced to endure.

1011
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,640
Montauk, right?

1012
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:26,960
Montauk, yeah.

1013
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,920
Yeah, Long Island.

1014
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,760
Montauk is just somewhere out there.

1015
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,820
And we were supposed to hide under one of them sentient rocks.

1016
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,920
And one of them was brooding at the time.

1017
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,000
I guess she was going to give birth to a bunch of little baby rocks.

1018
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,860
And they kept on planting this symbol in our skulls.

1019
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,600
It was the smiling face and the pipe and all that stuff.

1020
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,660
But sure enough, I noticed the dot matrix changed every time it went in.

1021
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,460
And it came out pure.

1022
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,860
In other words, I wasn't losing brain cells.

1023
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,560
I was gaining brain cells.

1024
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,140
I was growing a new brain.

1025
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,160
The Dave brain.

1026
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,840
Without it, life would make sense.

1027
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,260
But now, another song from the ESO album, a Chaz Smith song called X19.

1028
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:20,660
The ESO, by the way, had Dave on guitar, Bob Mosick on drums, Michelle George on electric violin, and Chaz played keyboard, theremin, and vocals.

1029
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,820
But when he lost internetington, that came on at the top right side.

She's driving me crazy

1043
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,920
Ah, the view is hazy

1044
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,720
Oh, no, it happened again

1045
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,820
And every time I say

1046
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,000
I'll never fly with lizard eyes

1047
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,960
And turn the other way

1048
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,560
Then you find you came to swim in water

1049
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,760
That is free and flowing in a night sky

1050
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,080
Of a land beyond, beyond a world of hope and fear

1051
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,880
And so I bid you space man

There's a place where there's no sunshine

1058
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,500
A little planet called X-1-9

1059
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,960
No flowing rivers, no communists

1060
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,380
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

1061
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,640

00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,860
I jumped like Geronimo

1073

1082
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,920
Now I'm here

1083
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,360
Now I'm here

1084
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,520
Now I'm here

1085
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,880
There's a place where there's no sunshine

1086
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,580
A little planet called X-1-9

1087
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,940
No flowing rivers, no communists

1088
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,320
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

1089
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,580
There's a place where there's no sunshine

1090
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,180
A little planet called X-1-9

1091
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,500
No flowing rivers, no communists

1092
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,900
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

1093
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,280
Just poison, vapor and electric mist

1094
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,660
Just poison, vapor, and electric mist.

1095
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,080
Just poison, vapor, and electric mist.

1096
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,360
What do you know?

1097
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,600
What do you know?

1098
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,880
What do you know?

1099
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,180
What do you know?

1100
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,400
What do you know?

1101
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,580
What do you know?

1102
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,460
Slack can come from anything, as Dave has just explained.

1103
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,540
From any orifice.

1104
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,560
And it comes from...

1105
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:38,900
Or all.

1106
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,780
As Onan said, Slack can come when you throw good money after bad,

1107
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,260
and bad money after Bob.

1108
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,860
And that's why that swag shack is up there, my friends.

1109
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,100
It's not going to be open all day.

1110
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,620
Swag shack.

1111
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,680
Yeah, I got to...

1112
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:54,980
What?

1113
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,260
A swag...

1114
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,640
What?

1115
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,300
What?

1116
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:57,440
What?

1117
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:02,360
A tiny finger tapping, tippy tapping me on the shoulder.

1118
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,380
And you never know when the master cometh.

1119
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,920
Yes, you never know when you might be summoned by the fellow in the bright,

1120
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,020
nightgown.

1121
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,560
So we've got to make sure to keep our broadcast happening,

1122
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:21,260
and keep expounding on these gems of subgenius philosophy,

1123
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,120
these rhinestones of elder subgeniuses.

1124
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,620
And I believe Stang has many thick pages of these subgenius...

1125
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,020
Well, we call them Tijuana Bible quotes.

1126
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,580
Could we go back to the plutonium phlegm part of it?

1127
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,000
I suppose.

1128
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:37,940
Wasn't there...

1129
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,360
Why not?

1130
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:38,820
Yeah.

1131
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,760
Plutonium?

1132
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,300
Sure.

1133
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,680
Friends, Brushwood is a magical place.

1134
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,920
As you get drunk or whatever and go stumbling around here at night,

1135
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,400
you may find yourself encountering little altars,

1136
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,940
and even the pagans got here.

1137
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,020
I noticed last night they had the drumming going.

1138
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,520
Magic is a foot, friends, but slack is a shoe.

1139
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,480
You might see a dragon in the bathtub bathing up,

1140
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,340
or a flying saucer that is searching for its cup.

1141
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,020
Peaceful groanings coming from underground.

1142
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,000
And you might hear a bonemak and a bullhorn at any time.

1143
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,800
A lot of what X-Day is about,

1144
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,420
besides greeting the saucers all together in jolly fellowship like we do...

1145
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,240
And greeting the saucers in the all together.

1146
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,220
It's about escaping the conspiracy.

1147
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,660
But, you know, just walking away from your job,

1148
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,000
even quitting your job,

1149
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,080
all you've done is get away from the immediate material aspects

1150
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,720
of the conspiracy in your life.

1151
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:47,800
You've still got the conspiracy deep inside you.

1152
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:54,580
Now, we all get sick of all those trappings of the conspiracy.

1153
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,300
Pee-ness.

1154
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,340
Shabby trappings.

1155
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,060
And so forth.

1156
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,200
As Baldwin Lee Primer said,

1157
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,420
I've had it up to here.

1158
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,460
And I've had it also down to there.

1159
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,980
And I must say I prefer that.

1160
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:06,980


1161
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,900
So friends, that's what we're doing here.

1162
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,660
We're not concerned about just Bush and his little halibuddies.

1163
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,720
We want to reach down deep into our own britches.

1164
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,160
Grab the conspiracy in us and yank it out.

1165
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,880
Wipe it, friends.

1166
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,720
Wipe the conspiracy that has besmeared you and chapped your ass,

1167
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,980
as it always does every time.

1168
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,940
Don't forget to keep that stool sample.

1169
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,040
God...

1170
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,960
Friends,

1171
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:36,960


1172
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:44,780
friends, forgot one thing. He forgot to make stupidity painful. We're here to change that.

1173
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,400
And what about the doctrine of deniable plausibility?

1174
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:57,380
Yes, as Professor Pressure brought up. That's what we're all about, deniable plausibility.

1175
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:03,680
It's sort of like the doctrine of erasability. Some subgenius blurts out the truth in front of

1176
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:09,540
the authorities, but by the doctrine of deniable plausibility, he can say, I didn't say that.

1177
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,820
Not only did you misunderstand me, but I didn't say it at all. Those words on that tape recorder

1178
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:22,840
are not real. Also, the brains of pinks, as we know, contain buzzware that just tends to

1179
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:30,220
wipe clean the memory of any subgenius utterance. So they ask you the same question about it

1180
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:33,240
10 minutes later. That's why I have to keep

1181
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,540
these utterances typed out on pieces of paper.

1182
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,240
The strongest memory is unequal to the weakest ink.

1183
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:47,460
But our ink is strong. The strongest ink. Happy birthday to my brother, by the way.

1184
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:55,160
And so we will remember to continue this treasured two-hour live recording next or some week here on

1185
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,540
Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius, which is visible at subgenius.com.

1186
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,020
The background music behind me right now,

1187
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:09,440
is by Calvin Ball, recorded live at X-Day. But now, let us close with this X-Day hymn

1188
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,280
by the great El Queso All-Stars.

1189
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:40,900
Control what's left of your brain. Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend

1190
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,080
Highton's Day.

1191
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:59,260
Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend Highton's Day.

1192
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,340
Embrace the Yeti blood that flows in your veins to the top.

1193
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,200
By your clouds, rain, slack, like rain. Let all control what's left of your brain.

1194
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,720
Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend Highton's Day.

1195
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,520
Embrace the Yeti blood that flows in your veins to the top.

1196
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,220
By your clouds, rain, slack, like rain. Let all control what's left of your brain.

1197
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:46,020
Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend Highton's Day.
