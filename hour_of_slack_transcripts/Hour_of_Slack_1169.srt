1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,320
Bob is fictional and purely coincidental.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,280
All names used on this program refer to real people either living or dead.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,040
I feel happy.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
The Self Genius.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Power of Swatch.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,400
And now we are at your service.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:18,820
No.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,000
If you are unhappy.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,940
No, no.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,500
Yes?

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,680
Who said I was unhappy?

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,140
I'm happy.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,880
I'm very happy.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,100
Very, very happy.

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:27,600
Yes.

16
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,740
Unhappy.

17
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:28,940
Unhappy.

18
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:29,680
Ah.

19
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,460
Is he happy?

20
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,020
We were trying to address just what is this Church of the Subgenius?

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,280
Yes.

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,000
Why are we here?

23
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,540
What is this?

24
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,280
The third question.

25
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,800
Here's one of these false memory items here.

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,920
The subject on alt-slack was asked,

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
the Church of the Subgenius is like dot, dot, dot.

28
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,720
Well, most of us never saw that subject.

29
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,060
We never saw it as being that dot, dot, dot like.

30
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:08,680
But our friend Dr. Morose here, Dr. Holocaust rather, said on that Worthy News group,

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,080
the Church of the Subgenius is like a giant inverse push me, pull you with a thousand

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,740
assholes pointed in different directions and only a vestigial head.

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,520
And that's why I like it so much.

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,540
Woo hoo.

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,600
There you have it.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,840
Yeah.

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,320
Really.

38
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,720
I love it.

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:28,720


41
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,680
A quote that really stood out.

42
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,000
That's what I'm talking about.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,740
A thousand assholes pointed in different directions.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,440
You there.

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,520
That is our church.

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,380
It's almost like some Hindu painting or something.

47
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,160
And the vestigial head, of course, is the bedotted smiling face of Bob.

48
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,740
Could I interject a joke that illuminates this viscera of the church?

49
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,240
Sure.

50
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,960
Let's have a few laughs up here.

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,240
Stang notices there's a huge growth on the side of his neck that resembles his own head.

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,720
And he walks into a bar and he's kind of disappointed.

53
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,360
He's distraught about it.

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,520
He sits down and orders a drink.

55
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,200
The guy says, bartender says, hey, we don't serve freaks in here.

56
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,620
And the little head on the side of his body says, hey, fuck you, asshole.

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
I've been trying to get rid of this guy for the last three weeks.

58
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,460
Was that a joke?

59
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,500
You in the front row, you're sleeping through viscera instructions.

60
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,400
Hey, if the coffee water hasn't been poured.

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,820
Coffee.

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Let it be poured.

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,500
And if it has been brewed, then let coffee cups be brought to the blabbermouths.

64
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,760
Because the illumination's gone now.

65
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,900
Thus it has been spoken.

66
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,220
Is this yesterday's coffee?

67
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,880
No, this is brand new fresh.

68
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,800
I just made it.

69
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,040
It was ground from special civet beans that I collected myself.

70
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,480
Mountain grown in the flavor zone.

71
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:56,500
These are the coffee beans that are eaten by the civet cat, which lives in Burma or whatever they call it now.

72
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,280
Passes through the gut of this cat.

73
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,180
The cat digests these beans and then they're collected at great risk by highly paid farmers.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,280
This is all true.

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,740
These are human beans.

76
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,560
So this is the thousand dollar a pound civet coffee mixed with some Folgers and Maxwell house.

77
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,520
It's very, very good when it's freshly brewed and it's very good indeed reheated.

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,540
Finally, we got some Minion and Bobby action.

79
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,480
This is the way a cult is supposed to look.

80
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,740
With the babes bringing libations to the old blabbering farts.

81
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,900
This is the first and only time this X day I've ever encountered wild blueberry flavored coffee creamer.

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,800
Is that not what this is?

83
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,420
That's right.

84
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,900
That's what the funny taste is.

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,500
By organic wild blueberry flavoring.

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,140
Free range flavoring.

87
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,100
Well, at least it's organic.

88
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,400
Could I ask one very, very small question?

89
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,640
Why, sure.

90
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,160
What is the mental dynamic in preparing oneself to become a subgenius?

91
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,740
Is there an interim level perhaps where you can jump on board and take the fly down the road?

92
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,420
People have this misconception and they think, okay, I'm going to be a subgenius.

93
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:21,180
And they have this pained look like they're about to take a math test or something.

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,780
It's nothing like that at all.

95
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:39,600
One does not so much take up the cause of being a subgenius as simply allow oneself to be enfolded by the undulating protoplasmic organism which is the church of the subgenius.

96
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,760
Achieve achievingness without trying.

97
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,080
Could I have some coffee, too?

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,240
It'll come around you like the moving arms of a big easy chair or something.

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,720
Or if you've ever seen that old movie, It Came From Outer Space.

100
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,760
You remember the way the air came from outer space?

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,140
The aliens would absorb people.

102
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,460
These filmy, bubbly-like things would encircle the writhing people.

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,500
Well, that is a good metaphorical description of how one becomes a subgenius.

104
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,300
Because once one has been inculcated with even the slightest fragment of subgenius perception,

105
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,040
these grow in the manner of crystalline formations in all directions.

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,760
And then one sees subgeniusness.

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Where one never would have seen it before.

108
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,580
In every direction.

109
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,380
It is, in effect, all around the new seeker.

110
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,500
Enfolds him, her, or it.

111
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,700
And in this chrysalis, the new subgenius is born and later emerges.

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,460
As a serial killer.

113
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,000
Right. We were talking about the stages they go through.

114
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
There's the larva, which is just a jabbering bobby.

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
The brand new subgenius.

116
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,680
Yes.

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,900
In fact, I believe the best example of those we've seen here were the nice young folks from Chickenhead

118
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,080
that showed up this morning at 7 a.m.

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,680
They hadn't even been ordained, and yet they somehow knew every bobby cliché.

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,300
Shot out of their mouth just as if by instinct.

121
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,600
Now, on their way home from here, having been insulted,

122
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,060
we actually surrounded them in a crowd and said,

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
Inside outsiders.

124
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,140
Inside.

125
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,200
Inside.

126
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,100
They will achieve the second step of subgenius, where you go,

127
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,520
This is stupid!

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Why did I spend my money on this?

129
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,340
It's just a bunch of conformity of nonconformists.

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,020
God dammit.

131
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,880
They all act like they're supposed to be different or something.

132
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,960
They've all got that stupid bob face somewhere stuck on them.

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,080
Branded on them or something.

134
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,420
But then finally, when they're not trying anymore,

135
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,860
when they're not even thinking about it,

136
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,560
the truth of Bob enters their head.

137
00:06:51,560 --> 00:07:05,800
And it usually doesn't come from anything some other subgenius said or any wise words would be spaken by Dr. Howell on the Puzzling Evidence Show or any ridiculous nonsense farted by Dave on the Hour of Slack.

138
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,540
Nay, but it comes from just glancing at that Dobbs head and that's all you need.

139
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,880
I have an update on the chicken heads.

140
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,700
There's an update on the chicken heads.

141
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,340
Chicken head update.

142
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,740
On this earth, their empty deflated body shells are collapsed on the ground up the road.

143
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,320
They passed out.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,600
Supposedly they're collapsed on the ground up the road, folks.

145
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,640
Like deflated bags.

146
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,000
So the viscera itself of them is gone?

147
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,640
They drove all the way from Portland.

148
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,200
They showed up at the campground at 1.30 at night.

149
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
They started drinking.

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,900
And a little while ago there was a line of Pabst Blue Ribbon about 12 feet long up there.

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,640
Yeah, they were awfully beery at 7 a.m.

152
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,100
They had been up all night.

153
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,080
They are the salt of the earth.

154
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,540
Future subgeniuses.

155
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,440
Coming up through the cropland.

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,060
Well, that just shows then the buzz down you were talking about.

157
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,620
The loss.

158
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,640
The loss of memory of Bob and stuff.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,380
Their whole bodies were taken.

160
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,200
They forgot them.

161
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,520
Sometimes it takes a long time for the lesson to be absorbed.

162
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,220
I got to admit, it was amazing.

163
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,660
They had never been to an ex-day, didn't know much about the church,

164
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,860
and yet they sounded like 1980s Bobbies.

165
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,540
Without even having to...

166
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,020
try.

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,480
As Connie Dobbs said, though,

168
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,780
I like my religion dry with a twist of sarcasm.

169
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,060
That doesn't mean we don't...

170
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,200
we're not going to frown on your every butt joke or fart joke.

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
Obviously, Dave's still here.

172
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,160
Well, Bob does find Connie's vagina rather dry and unappealing like an unattractive...

173
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,220
And with a twist of sarcasm.

174
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,520
Yes.

175
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,360
Dry...

176
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,200
Connie's vagina dry with a twist of sarcasm.

177
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,260
And can only be entered with a little corkscrew like pecker like a piggy has.

178
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,740
That tells you something interesting about old J.R. Bob Dobbs.

179
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,360
Of course, he doesn't have just one.

180
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,900
For me, it's been a special joy.

181
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,400
A little closer up, I've wanted to do that for a number of years and I'm thankful.

182
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,820
We want to help our children have this cult.

183
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,720
One of the questions that cult answers is,

184
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,420
who or what is worth living for?

185
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,660
And the answer to that question is to...

186
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,300
uh...

187
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,560
to...

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,980
to...

189
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,600
uh...

190
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
to...

191
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Now, let's think about this.

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,940
Compulsive.

193
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,640
Compulsive.

194
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,920
But your children stay...

195
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,820
Wow, that's incredible.

196
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,700
ESP.

197
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,200
ESP.

198
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,400
To grab a children...

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,040
Hardwired.

200
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,800
Hardwired.

201
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,500
Hardwired.

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,280
Hardwired.

203
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,020
Hardwired.

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,360
Awesome.

205
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,740
You open your hand and satisfy the desires of joy.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,940
You may as well eat it because you have no capacity to keep it.

207
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,540
Bite into that juicy...

208
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,400
So juicy it runs down on your chin.

209
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,680
Greater joy!

210
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,780
Greater joy!

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,460
Joy is the longest lasting pleasure.

212
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,680
More and more joy.

213
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm in the midst of men.

214
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,520
Plunder.

215
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,220
They plunder.

216
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,660
They...

217
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,680
I will be satisfied.

218
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,380
Devour my flesh.

219
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,220
Devour my flesh.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,700
Acid.

221
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,300
Exchange the truth for a lie.

222
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,240
Oh, children.

223
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,340
Oh, oh...

224
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,640
It's a rack.

225
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,040
Nothing.

226
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,780
Nothing.

227
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,380
Dreams of illicit sex or piles of money or more stuff.

228
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,740
Oh, children.

229
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,520
Open wide your mouth and I will...

230
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:18,520


231
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,280
I will fill it.

232
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,440
Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.

233
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,420
Uh, Ted.

234
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,140
Joy.

235
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,400
He went off.

236
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,260
Fill with joy.

237
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,840
Joy.

238
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,880
Pounding.

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,560
Pounding.

240
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,940
Bucket, bucket, bucket, bucket.

241
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,540
Uh, many of us here know each other from the news group alt.slack.

242
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,620
Some of us don't.

243
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,380
Dr. Howell hardly ever messes with it and Dave doesn't even know what the internet is.

244
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,780
Well, I would but these nosebleeds I have keep me on my back.

245
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,520
Princess Wee is a nice person and only reads.

246
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:48,520


247
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:48,520


248
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,620
She reads it every now and then.

249
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,680
But a lot of us are sort of addicted to it.

250
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,580
I should go on it because it concerns the doings of people I'm interested in.

251
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:04,820
It's entirely my failing that I'm not, uh, burrowed into alt.slack every single day.

252
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,580
Oh, I yearn to have the time to go on alt.slack.

253
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,700
That's one thing, the time.

254
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,460
You've got to have time to do it.

255
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,440
Actually, Princess Wee, we all sound like it's this big friendly thing, but Princess

256
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,520
Wee herself pointed out that alt.slack is the most anti-social social activity I can think of.

257
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,960
I ain't afraid of no flavor.

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,600
It really is.

259
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,380
It's where you go when you're sick and pissed off on your job and you want to pick a fight with somebody.

260
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,880
Preferably a stupid kook.

261
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,040
And alt.slack is the greatest kook flypaper ever invented on the internet.

262
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, there you go.

263
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,080
It's a hotbed of tom kookery, you might say.

264
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,640
One person said,

265
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,840
The church is to crazy people making asses of themselves what bug zappers are to bugs,

266
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,620
what matators are to bulls, what Lucy Van Pelt with her football is to Charlie Brown.

267
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,180
And as I said, your hot button is my trampoline.

268
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:13,700
And it seems that the old timers on the subgenius news group have a skill.

269
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,620
As soon as a newcomer comes in,

270
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:15,620


271
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,620
they wait to see what is that person's hot button.

272
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,480
Is it that they love unions and think unions are a great thing?

273
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,280
Or is it that they hate all unions?

274
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,200
Whatever it is, suddenly every subgenius there is going to have a nasty, nasty wisecrack about that very sacred cow.

275
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,200
And it sure happened to me.

276
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:44,640
I've been reduced to tears from stuff I've read on the nice, friendly subgenius news group almost every time by Nensla.

277
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,120
They've ambushed Stang.

278
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,720
Who is always right.

279
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Stang himself.

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,120
And that is why so many people hate him.

281
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,560
He offers a bitter cup.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,400
It is the medicine without the sugar.

283
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,340
It doesn't go down easy.

284
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,680
Although Nensla might if you treated him properly.

285
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,620
He's a nice little fellow.

286
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:11,000
He scarred his chest and his thorax in the same way that the Lakota used to when they felt grief or pain.

287
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,900
I heard about it.

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,980
I saw that in a movie maybe.

289
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,660
Yeah.

290
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,660
I know he was scratching at himself pretty.

291
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,260
The subgenius social activities are not for the thin skinned.

292
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,980
You eventually develop quite a shell.

293
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,020
And we have our drama queens.

294
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,340
And we love them because they give us something to react to.

295
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,820
They're like the straight man and they don't even know it.

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,480
The incomparable deja thorax.

297
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,640
Princess We said with some people you have to put on the kid gloves with kid gloves.

298
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,600
They're that sensitive.

299
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,680
Those are the folks that I pity as they approach all slack hopeful.

300
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,380
Subgenius head shells.

301
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,020
Waiting to see the togetherness.

302
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,980
Gosh it won't be like the conspiracy.

303
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:07,480
It won't be like my awful office job where it's this endless fight among all these alpha male assholes and ass kissing pink boys.

304
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:07,940
No.

305
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,520
It'll be.

306
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,840
But yet it turns out church of the subgenius when you get down to it.

307
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,340
Paul Mavridis called it the high school from hell.

308
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,660
No it's not like your office.

309
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,220
It's like your fucking junior high.

310
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,480
I could attest to that positively myself.

311
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,920
And especially when it comes to kid gloves and manly teach.

312
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,040
And what is it again?

313
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,680
A small no small feet for manly teach.

314
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,780
Every time you mention kid gloves.

315
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,960
They start talking about the manly children gets all worked up and stuff like that.

316
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,060
But we were forced to play extreme sports.

317
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,020
Wisdom teats or something.

318
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,740
And one of the training methods was used.

319
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,960
They would actually put us in little teeny cages and they would electrocute us every four or five seconds.

320
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,020
Not real electrocution.

321
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,540
I guess that part was maybe mental too.

322
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,860
Maybe I made that up or something.

323
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,740
They don't let us do that in Dobstown anymore.

324
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,620
No.

325
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,940
Thank God for that.

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,100
Even in Malaysia the government's gone pink.

327
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,000
They've gotten wise.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,680
It's like in Amsterdam.

329
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,520
You can't walk around smoking frop on the street.

330
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,740
Not anymore.

331
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,100
No.

332
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,240
You can't murder people anymore the way you used to be able to.

333
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,260
No.

334
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,560
At Burning Man you can't sacrifice live victims anymore.

335
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,080
At Starwood they had to quit putting up men in the wicker man.

336
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,920
And at X Day we're not even allowed.

337
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:35,320
Dr. Mojo is not allowed to fire off his simple beloved ritual worshipful dynamite packages.

338
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,960
No more plutonium.

339
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,640
No more bombs.

340
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,660
Full of shrapnel.

341
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,600
No more ear removing rituals.

342
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,240
We've had that one year.

343
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,880
And all the Amish horses kicked their stables down.

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,280
But this is all for your safety and protection.

345
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,760
Right.

346
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,360
It is.

347
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,160
We don't want to make anything less fun.

348
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,620
We love you friends.

349
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,400
And we hate you.

350
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,500
We care about you.

351
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:53,980
We're not.

352
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,480
Bob doesn't notice you.

353
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,940
And you should be glad.

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,180
We encourage pyrotechnics of every type and variety and firearms and stuff if you use

355
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,060
it on yourselves.

356
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,460
We just don't.

357
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,660
We want to protect some of the other subtenu who are more or less serious about all this.

358
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,580
So we're not going to do that.

359
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


360
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


361
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


362
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


363
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


364
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,580


365
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,840
So please, if you have to keep it in your pants, keep it there.

366
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,600
Of course, we subgenius doctors in the higher circles of the church have special powers

367
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,980
and are completely impervious to physical pain.

368
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
Of other people.

369
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,180
Of other people's physical pain.

370
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,700
It doesn't hurt us a bit.

371
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,180
That's right.

372
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,740
That's an important thing to remember.

373
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,860
Are we abjured from enjoying the physical pain of others?

374
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,460
Or should we poke them with sticks?

375
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,760
Well, we're supposed to rise above all that, but we can all deal with it in our own way.

376
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,900
Now here's an adversarial question for Stang.

377
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,020
You mentioned St. Paul Mavridis.

378
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,160
On the day I left, he was grumbling that Stang had a good idea with subgenius, but he ruined

379
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,680
it when he took out the conspiracy and he put in Bigfoot.

380
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,420
How would you answer this charge?

381
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,560
Paul hasn't been reading his pre-scripture slightly, is all I can say.

382
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,540
Well, all I can say, that sounds like Paul.

383
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
St. Paul.

384
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,760
He's very much like the St. Paul of Christianity.

385
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,700
Yes, he is.

386
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,620
Please explain.

387
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,600
That was lame.

388
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,360
That sounds just like my friend Paul.

389
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,280
You know, he might as well have said, Stang fucked up, as if it was up to me.

390
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,440
He might as well have said, Stang fucked up when he left behind the conspiracy.

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,480
He was just playing with the whole conspiracy and started talking about slack.

392
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,140
Because friends, there's some people that are drawn to the church only because of their

393
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,600
hate of the conspiracy.

394
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,220
Others are drawn by their instinct for slack.

395
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:03,680
When you go to a subgenius event, if you can walk in miserable because you're such a stupid,

396
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,720
ugly loser.

397
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,880
But when you look around at your fellow subgeniuses.

398
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,060
All of a sudden, by comparison, you feel like a brilliant, handsome, super hero.

399
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,340
And that's what, friends, that's what draws me to the slack of the church.

400
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,920
You know, like almost everybody here, I got, I was smart enough or invisible enough not

401
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,320
to get picked on in school.

402
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,860
But I knew that they would have picked on me had I not kept my low profile.

403
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,380
And I watched without joining in.

404
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,780
And while they picked on the less confident or quiet or smart mutants, you know, the poor

405
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,780
pasty faced, bespectacled kids with the four eyes, you know, the ones they pick on.

406
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,740
Or the one single Jewish kid in the class.

407
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:59,340
Or the one kid with the really frightening amount of freckles.

408
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,740
Or the one that smelled funny.

409
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,920
Or Susie the floozy.

410
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,220
You know.

411
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,180
We all know.

412
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,360
We've seen those talks.

413
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,360


414
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,640
We've seen those types.

415
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,560
What does that sign say?

416
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,760
Grand opening.

417
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh, the grand Susie's opening.

418
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,940
Oh, I thought she was pointing to her opening.

419
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,080
Susie is a doorway to slack, my friends.

420
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,780
That is so.

421
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,760
She is the cave.

422
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,300
You can stand in front of that black hole, say open sesame, and Bob smoke will pour out,

423
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,420
gagging and choking you with knowledge.

424
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
For it is, is it not the very wisdom teat?

425
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,960
A prophesied by Chaz and Dave, that great old folk band.

426
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,140
I've sucked it.

427
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,200
Susie has sucked it.

428
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,780
We all suck.

429
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,600
You see, she bent that.

430
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,160
One way or another.

431
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,440
But as Ninslow said, until you realize that you suck, your suckliness will only grow.

432
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,780
You must realize that you suck before you can start to carve away and reduce your suck-fullyness.

433
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,460
Is that an actual tenet then?

434
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,180
Was Bob picked on as a young lad?

435
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,020
Ninslow said it, we added it, that settles it.

436
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
I quoted it.

437
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,580
I wrote it down.

438
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,400
Ninslow didn't remember.

439
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
I also wrote down this.

440
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
I am the poor blinded cyclops stumbling towards what I think might be light.

441
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,080
No, that's not on the page there.

442
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,580
You're saying that to yourself.

443
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
You've lost connection with what's going on here.

444
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,060
Yes, that was me.

445
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,800
I am the poor blinded cyclops stumbling towards what I think might be light.

446
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,380
You're having a psychotic episode.

447
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
That's not on the page.

448
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,440


449
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,640
That's not on the paper.

450
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,500
You're just saying that because you're thinking that right now and that's how you feel or

451
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,720
something.

452
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,040
You're just slouching toward barfing.

453
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Dave here has been taking college courses.

454
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,420
I am.

455
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,460
And all of a sudden he's got this post-modernist take on everything.

456
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,500
He's a regular Marshall McLuhan all of a sudden.

457
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,480
Marshall McLuhan.

458
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,860
Because your communications course, right?

459
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah.

460
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,620
There's girls in college, see?

461
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,860
So Dave goes back to college.

462
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
He's 75 years old.

463
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,880
Yet, you know.

464
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,540
Well, I better finish my communications degree so I'll really know how to do things right

465
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,280
on the radio.

466
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,060
Uh-huh.

467
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,760
So that means that I can't read English there and say that that was not that you were just

468
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,300
saying that in a psychotic rant that you had lost connection with reality.

469
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,120
Instead, you're pretending to be reading it off the page.

470
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,120
No, I was reading it because I'm in a psychotic fugue and I don't want to let on that that's

471
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,560
happening.

472
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

473
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,980
Have the script.

474
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,680
Ladies and gentlemen.

475
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,180
Have the script.

476
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,340
Have the script.

477
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,700
Have the script.

478
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,460
Have the script.

479
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,820
Ladies and gentlemen.

480
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

481
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
We had the script.

482
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,040
Yes we do.

483
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,500
Ladies and gentlemen.

484
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,500


485
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,620
Yes!

486
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,440
Ohバイ

487
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,120
Darling.

488
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,400
You're Peròbecause

489
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,000
I didn't come out.

490
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Da Snapdragon 2.5 and that position.

491
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,180
Psychedelic, you know?

492
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,280
Heavy, man.

493
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,220
What are we talking about again?

494
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,160
Flower power.

495
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
Dubs, dubs, dubs, dubs.

496
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,760
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor.

497
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,760
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, it's hard to believe.

498
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,520
I've seen pictures and certainly watched video.

499
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,460
Cult drug.

500
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,180
Be, be person to person.

501
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,880
Be crazy in a cult.

502
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,600
Cult person to person.

503
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,980
God is dead.

504
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,040
Perverted sex.

505
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,080
Divorce is an easy way out.

506
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,100
Person to person.

507
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:38,800
Shock.

508
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,100
This country is involved in an illegal and immoral war.

509
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,440
We're supporting a military industrial complex.

510
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Stop the war now.

511
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,260
Drugged out.

512
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
Gonna come, gonna come, gonna come, gonna come, gonna come.

513
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,920
Well, I did a lot of drugs.

514
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,880
And you could get drugs.

515
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,820
Party, party.

516
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,060
Penanistic lifestyle.

517
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,640
Uh, if it feels good, do it.

518
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,180
Other drugs, uh, just a great form of recreation.

519
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,700
Into prostitution.

520
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,660
I don't know.

521
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,300
Exciting.

522
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,020
Exciting.

523
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,580
There's a word.

524
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,080
Well, I did a lot of drugs.

525
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,020
I don't know.

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,720
Exciting.

527
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,400
Exciting.

528
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,940
There's a word.

529
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,480
Person to person.

530
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,700
Person to person.

531
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
Person to person.

532
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,880
Person to person.

533
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:32,980
Eric's.

534
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,540
Day.

535
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,980
Eric's.

536
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,520
Day.

537
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,620
Person to person.

538
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

539
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,120
Have the script.

540
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,540
The new voice that you're hearing is that of Reverend Susie the floozy.

541
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,600
Susie the floozy has joined the show.

542
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,260
Ah.

543
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm the beaver shooting on the end.

544
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,120
Oh, something wonderful.

545
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,280
Ha ha ha.

546
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Thank you.

547
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,020
And yeah, what's all this blather about?

548
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,500
Camera three has panned.

549
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,880
Or Susie has panned.

550
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,320
I guess you can help us grow our movie conversation to more contemporary topics.

551
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,040
I want to take issue about this blather about postmodernism.

552
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,480
Blather.

553
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,740
That is so old hat.

554
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,600
Aren't we into pre-past by now?

555
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,400
We're into post-pablum, baby.

556
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
We're into pre-pubescent.

557
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,240
We're actually pre-po.

558
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,740
Po.

559
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,020
Po.

560
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,100
Po.

561
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,920
I try to stay as pre-zygotic as I can.

562
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,220
We're poop modernists, friends.

563
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,800
That was a pretty presumptuous assumption there that.

564
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,140
Mm.

565
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,480
The whole postmodern idea.

566
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,660
We'll get a press-up pump on that.

567
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,920
Selfishly provided no place for any future movement.

568
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,720
That's true.

569
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,840
Mm-mm.

570
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,300
Whatever the hell that means.

571
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,420
Well, we don't believe what all those French theorists did.

572
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,180
For one thing, they hardly knew anything.

573
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,260
But.

574
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
They eat frogs too.

575
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,780
You know, stuff like that.

576
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,260
Yeah, they do all that sort of stuff.

577
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,800
So I.

578
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,760
I hate weefers.

579
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,260
No, they're freedom theorists now.

580
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,480
Oh, really?

581
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,620
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,300
They call them freedom.

583
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,700
That's what we're supposed to call them.

584
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,700
Fritters?

585
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,960
Fritters?

586
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,560
Brain fissures?

587
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,760
Corn fritters.

588
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,160
Potential chunks of batter.

589
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,300
Made out of some of that soft-pore corn.

590
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,760
The stuff that goes down good and comes out easy.

591
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,480
We want soft-core porn that melts in your eyes.

592
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,100
Easily digestible theological maxims and apothegms.

593
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,260
But of course, we have an audience of core subgeniuses here.

594
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:46,860
And they need more than the usual song and dance before they can feel that their time here has not been wasted.

595
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,740
That's why we've been.

596
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,700
They're hardly stoned enough to be awake yet, though, poor things.

597
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,940
Oh, well, there is that.

598
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,460
They may be wasted, but their time was not.

599
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,000
That is so.

600
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,760
And through the miracle of time control, time may be made not.

601
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,360
Super time-imation.

602
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,420
It could be yesterday, couldn't it?

603
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,800
The new miracle of the screen.

604
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,020
Is it yesterday still?

605
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,880
Tomorrow is yesterday.

606
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,680
No, I know it's X-Day, because I still have that sorry, suck-ass feeling.

607
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Uh-oh.

608
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,680
We got reamed again, and that doesn't wear off easy.

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
Oh, aw.

610
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,880
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I would have met you off the train.

611
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,900
I didn't come on the train.

612
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,920
Off the bus, then.

613
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,700
Didn't come on the bus, either.

614
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280
So how did you get here, then?

615
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,380
Basically, there was this little dot, right?

616
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,400
And the dot went bang, and the bang expanded.

617
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,860
Energy formed into matter.

618
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,900
Matter killed, matter lived.

619
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,920
The amoeba, the fish, the fish, the fowl, the fowl, the froggy, the froggy, the mammal, the mammal, the monkey, the monkey, the man.

620
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,540
And though I'm after math, quick pro quo, memento mori, add in for nice and sprinkle on a little bit of grated cheese, and leave under the grill till doomsday.

621
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,900
Leave under the grill till doomsday.

622
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,660
.

623
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,060
.

624
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,160

625

628
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,180
It's okay

629
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,480
It's the end of the world

We can all escape

633
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,500
into outer space

634
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,680
and start again

635
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,920
It's the end of the world

636
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,360
It's okay

637
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,680
It's the end of the world

638
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,460

673
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:07,960
plan x is the name of that x-day hymn by the reverend max slack talk about a promising subgenius

674
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:16,140
he started that song on july 5th 2008 the same day that most of this show was recorded

675
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:25,920
dr howell lonesome cowboy day and suzy the floozy joined us on stage at brushwood for an hour of

676
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
slack in front of the camera

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,180

00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,760


687
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,760


688
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:03,100
As I was in my glorious inn, I was hooked up to my Wi-Fi connection,

689
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,040
and unfortunately I had to be a Google hosting jacked in.

690
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,740
I'm not sure I can transliterate that one.

691
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,080
As I was posting an interim report on X-Day,

692
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,180
Google requires you to go through that captcha thing

693
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,120
where you have to spell out a word.

694
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,240
Right, to verify your identity.

695
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,200
The word last night, and I kid you not, was jacked us.

696
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,920
Jacked us?

697
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,420
J-A-C-T-U-S-S.

698
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,200
Jacked us.

699
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,260
Yes.

700
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,180
Jacked us.

701
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,640
Bob jacked us again.

702
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,280
Bob jacked us again.

703
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,480
The Google verification procedure.

704
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Bob speaks in so many strange ways, friends.

705
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,100
It proves that Bob himself may be a Google posting jack-a-dandy.

706
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,560
I didn't want to let that pass.

707
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,340
Wow.

708
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,940
Jacked us.

709
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,900
Jacked us.

710
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,600
Does that take care of it?

711
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,640
It almost seems like there's a word missing, but I would thought.

712
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
No, we didn't get off.

713
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,360
Jacked us up.

714
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,760
Jacked us something.

715
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,820
We've been jacked.

716
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,900
Bob's jacked me in every direction but off,

717
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,560
and I'm getting damn tired of it.

718
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,760
I'm still slobbering under the delusion that we actually were ruptured,

719
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,220
and we've been given little clues like the guys from Tacoma

720
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,840
who lost their chickens and stuff,

721
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,760
and that we're just dreaming, thinking this now

722
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,780
because our belief in Bob was not strong enough

723
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,640
to actually bring about beautiful sex goddesses

724
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,120
and cool rocket ships and stuff.

725
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,620
Instead, it's just like Sherman Brushwood,

726
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,820
and we're there now, and we're all freaking stuck in this one frame

727
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,800
trying to get out to our paradise.

728
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,220
Right.

729
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,360
It could be a lack of imagination.

730
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,940
One of the most insulting things I ever saw one subgenius say to another was,

731
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,580
Uh-oh.

732
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,720
Your escape vessel.

733
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,860
Your escape vessel probably will look just like your dingy apartment,

734
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,600
and you won't even know the difference.

735
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,400
No problem.

736
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,200
It's like, what if that's exactly the case?

737
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,400
We just couldn't believe.

738
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,400
It was too good to be true, so we didn't believe it.

739
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,440
And, of course, the exes give you what you want,

740
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,220
and it turns out most of us, we're like rock gnar.

741
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,620
We really did want to keep our same old body because we were used to it.

742
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,180
I got a flying side of the mechanical problem.

743
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,760
Is that a penis inside of us?

744
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,560
Is that the part of the conspiracy we must carve out?

745
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:32,200
The part that makes us not believe the saucers are really going to be that great,

746
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,060
that we could truly make our own reality, and not in a new age way.

747
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,660
I'm talking about in a forbidden planet way.

748
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,600
Exactly.

749
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,460
Not your, not, I make my own reality because if I feel like everything's cool

750
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,440
and everything's really cool.

751
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,740
No, it's the forbidden planet way where if I feel like I want,

752
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,760
I want to tear the shit out of every one of these assholes like a giant monster,

753
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,000
a giant monster will appear and tear the shit out of all those assholes.

754
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,580
Boy, I'm going to have to bleep that one a lot.

755
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,660
Just like in that movie, of course, everybody else's giant monster comes and gets you,

756
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,760
so that's the difficulty with giving everyone the giant monster franchise.

757
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,440
But you will develop into something beyond a human being at this point, we fervently hope and expect.

758
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,140
Well, when asked to give testimony, we'll be able to say,

759
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:32,480
I am not now, nor have ever been a member of the human race.

760
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,360
Well, eventually we'll either be Morlocks or Eloi.

761
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:44,740
And as Frater Sodi said, don't just eat that Eloi, eat the hell out of it.

762
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,120
They're both human.

763
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,920
For we are the Morlocks. We're not the Eloi, we're not the cattle.

764
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,740
We want Morlocks for our business.

765
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,680
Morlocks for our bagels.

766
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:02,580
The Morlocks are our beloved descendants, our sweet children living in the bombed out future.

767
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,100
We're the Morlocks. We're the clones.

768
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,180


769
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,840
I am not alone.

770
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,060
I live in a home where the other clones roam.

771
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,160
We just sit around and get stoned.

772
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,940
I am a clone, why don't you leave me alone?

773
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,740
In my plastic world in our fadeaway zone.

774
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,340
It's the only place I call home.

775
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,980
I wonder as I wander.

776
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,740
Whatever I do, I will find.

777
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,140
Whatever happened to the time when people could see with their minds?

778
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,680
I wonder as I wander down the line.

779
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,420
I wonder as I wander down the line.

780
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,460
I wonder as I wander down the line.

781
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,540
I wonder as I wander down the line.

782
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,820
I...

783
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,340
I...

784
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,320
I...

785
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,400
I am a clone. I eat styrofoam.

786
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,820
I was born in a dorm. My mom was a drop.

787
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,960
My papa was an automaton.

788
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,740
In a pop bar was an automaton.

789
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,160
I am a clone, I am not alone

790
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,660
I live in a land of silicon and chrome

791
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,520
And there's never a white or a moon

792
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,220
I wonder as I wander

793
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,500
Whatever happened to the time

794
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,320
When people could see with their minds

795
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,820
I wonder as I wander down the line

796
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,560
I wonder as I wander down the line

797
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,200
I, I, I, I

798
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,280
I am a clone but I won't be for long

799
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,840
From inside I planted a little bomb

800
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,200
To turn everything off once and for all

801
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,140
I am a clone, now I'm on the roam

802
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,980
From my plastic world in a fadeaway zone

803
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,440
And I'm never, I'm never going home

804
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,060
I wonder as I wander

805
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,400
Whatever happened to the time

806
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,120
When people could see with their minds

807
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,700
I wonder as I wander down the line

808
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,280
I wonder as I wander down the line

809
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,780
But the atmosphere is not normal

810
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:03,820
As I wander down within a night

811
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,060
I wonder as I wander down the line

812
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,440
I wonder as I wander down the line

813
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,980
And time goes by

814
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,540
I wonder where I'll loom

815
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,340
I wonder as I wander up the enemyulation

816
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:20,040
Ogre, ogre, ogres to body

817
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,800
I am a family member

818
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:20,800


819
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,200
I'm a clone.

820
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,980
And now, if we are recording, it's back to Hour of Slack Live at Brushwood.

821
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,580
Are we recording?

822
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,160
Oh, no.

823
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,220
Yeah, we're back to recording again, I would think.

824
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,280
Everything's going fine.

825
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,820
You can be funny now.

826
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,660
All right.

827
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,620
Oh, we were taking a...

828
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,800
Can we take a little bit longer?

829
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,840
I said you could be funny.

830
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,480
All right.

831
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,680
Well, try.

832
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,960
Well, try as hard as we can, kids out there.

833
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,660
There's been a lot of strange fucking who even said over the last three hours.

834
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
Some of you may have swelled.

835
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,120
Followed it.

836
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,640
Hook, line, and sinker.

837
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,600
But believe me, it's all lies.

838
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,420
Desperate freaking lies brought to you by a bunch of escaped mental patients that have

839
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,300
no business being here or anywhere else on this earth plane.

840
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,640
Don't be so embittered.

841
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,760
No, that's only the terrible grotesque face which is occasionally presented toward us

842
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,860
from the universe.

843
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,240
Actually, we prefer a more genial smiling face.

844
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,640
A face composed of many dots.

845
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,200
Of a genial smiling man smoking a pipe.

846
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,780
Calm, restful, peaceful.

847
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,120
What?

848
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:08,740
Well, as, you know, if something's bothering you, as Reverend Diva Schematics said here,

849
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:16,660
if you don't like being fucked up the ass with a brick, stop sitting on the brick.

850
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,560
These things are common sense.

851
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,860
And that's the kind of intelligence we're talking about in Church of the Subgenius.

852
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,060
Not a high IQ, common sense, sense of humor, dollars and cents.

853
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,780
And for some people, sense of Mia, I think, has entered that thing.

854
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,140
But, you know, in the gap between the best possible result and the best result possible,

855
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,520
there lies slack.

856
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:44,980
Slack.

857
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,500
Trademark SOTY.

858
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,340
Yeah.

859
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,100
And as Benslow said,

860
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:55,060
the Church of the Subgenius is like steroids on acid.

861
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,420
A beautiful dream for some people.

862
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,240
Steroids on acid for others who live in reality.

863
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,360
Each and every one of us got it in us.

864
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,460
On the reality channel.

865
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,800
Or maybe that's just a rare form of gonorrhea.

866
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,140
We're today gonorrhea tomorrow.

867
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,180
Does gonorrhea still exist?

868
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,080
Because last time I was here, I was in the hospital.

869
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,120
Last time I had sex, they still had it.

870
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,580
And then they had a giant outburst somewhere.

871
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,640
I don't know if it had to do with gonorrhea or if I just hallucinated it.

872
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,920
It comes in different flavors now.

873
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,040
It's designer flavored?

874
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,480
Mm-hmm.

875
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,840
Well, why can't the church get in on that?

876
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,960
On flavored gonorrhea?

877
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,580
Lime-flavored gonorrhea?

878
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,320
No, I feel it.

879
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,900
You can't get that in.

880
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,420
They sell the lime and chili-flavored gonorrhea

881
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,180
in Texas and California, but not in Ohio.

882
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,200
Border states only.

883
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,780
Or New York.

884
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,340
Because I guess they figure only Hispanic people

885
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,960
like the lime and chili-flavored gonorrhea.

886
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,280
But everybody loves it.

887
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:05,220
As if some Caucasian or Shieti was not capable

888
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,860
of appreciating those tastes.

889
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,240
It's like that marketing.

890
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,460
Has any of you experienced the reverse marketing

891
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,280
that the conspiracy does on subgeniuses

892
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,180
where you finally find...

893
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,560
You find a brand of something you like.

894
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,640
There's one peanut butter that's mixed with...

895
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,860
Crack.

896
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,380
Lime-flavored gonorrhea.

897
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,760
Even one particular peanut.

898
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,620
But as soon as you've bought it three times,

899
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,780
it's taken off the market.

900
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah.

901
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,980
Right.

902
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,520
I mean, I've run into that over and over and over again.

903
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,060
You finally find a cheap wine that's good.

904
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,080
And as soon as that computer beast in Belgium,

905
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,380
666 Computer,

906
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,780
figures out that you've bought three of that item.

907
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,820
Like the Dayglo Squeeze Margarine.

908
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,040
Dayglo Blue Squeeze Margarine.

909
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,420
Sure, the normals weren't going to buy it.

910
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,380
And the way they knew that?

911
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,640
Because I bought it.

912
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,560
More than once.

913
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,700
That wasn't Rectal Lube?

914
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,880
Dallas, Texas, my friends,

915
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,080
was the test market for most big corporations

916
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,160
and Hollywood.

917
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,580
They would test things.

918
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,720
You know the old phrase,

919
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,720
will it play in Peoria?

920
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,380
Well, Dallas is the real Peoria.

921
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,520
They figured that's where the people are the most normal and stupid.

922
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,920
That place was lousy with that clear Pepsi crap when I was there.

923
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,580
Was that why?

924
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,280
Dallas test audiences are why Steven Spielberg movie endings suck.

925
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,820
Well, I...

926
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,520
There's always a good ending and a bad ending.

927
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,140
And they run the bad one by the end.

928
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,140


929
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,580
They run the bad one by the Dallas audience and they go,

930
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,560
oh, I got that.

931
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,140
That was why the end of the Kennedy administration sucked.

932
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,300
What, the testosterone examinations?

933
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,060
The testes could be stacked.

934
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,340
And they use us as a reverse barometer.

935
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,700
If there's something we like, they'll take that thing off the market.

936
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,380
Does this not explain television and radio?

937
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,500
As well as fast food chains and every other...

938
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,480
It explains this church.

939
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,760
Well, three weeks or three days is definitely...

940
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,600
A sign that marketing influences are involved.

941
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,100
And that they're trying to nail a particular demographic splinter.

942
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,080
So what I was assuming is if they're in Texas,

943
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,220
they're trying to see if the testosterone and ovarian levels are high or low

944
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,560
so they can exterminate more cows or other beasts.

945
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,400
Other beasts.

946
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:46,780
Other beasts might include Moe's Giganticus and its song.

947
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,900
Commander.

948
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,960
This is still the man with the foolproof plan.

949
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,060
Master, master, electrical master,

950
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,660
we're pulling the plug on this fantastic disaster.

951
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,580
Action, action, attack with passion.

952
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,460
We'll buy you more time if they sell us the pants.

953
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,660
Come and die!

954
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,500
This is not a case that defies convention

955
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,240
This is the example that you can't explain

956
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,280
This is not a story that we know so far

957
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,120
And all the rest of the exceptions to the rules of the game

958
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Come and die!

959
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,440
Come and die!

960
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,040
Come and die!

961
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,160
This is no mistake

962
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,060
This is no accident

963
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,240
I work for a living

964
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,800
I put my back into it

965
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,680
Don't be confused

966
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,920
Between fucking circumstances

967
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,320
I'm a fucking magician

968
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,460
I make shit happen

969
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,000
This is for the days that we spent in darkness

970
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,420
This is for the future that we lived in

971
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,660
This is for the minds I saw

972
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,220
This is for the man who died broken alone

973
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,300
I never questioned the direction or the purpose of it all

974
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,300
Come and die!

975
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,840
Come and die!

976
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:09,640
Good lord man, Mos Giganticus there did that song

977
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,680
Commander, Commander

978
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,140
From the album of the same name

979
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:21,920
And you can get more about Mos Giganticus from mosgiganticus.com

980
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,080
Mos is spelled M-O-S-E

981
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,920
And now, are there any other questions?

982
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,460
The little bald headed girl with the breasts just forming over there has a question

983
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,740
What does that say about those of us who paid more than three times to come to Exit A?

984
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, you've obviously been penetrated by our adroit niche marketing

985
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,600
And also known as

986
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,940
Three holes, no waiting

987
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,380
Thrice stupid

988
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,600
Makes you a son of a niche

989
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:57,120
Well, you must learn to know that niche because now you are of it

990
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,480
If you have a niche, scratch it

991
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,840
You fit like a glove with a kid stuck in it

992
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,940
But serially folks

993
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,740
Give them a niche and they'll take a smile

994
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,040
The smile of J.R. Bob Doggs

995
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,640
Beaming down upon us

996
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:16,100
Aren't computers supposed to be able to identify niche markets and then take care of them

997
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,520
But in fact that's not what they're used for

998
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,900
They're programmed to satisfy stadium sized audiences of pinks

999
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:27,460
And let the preferences of subgeniuses blow away in the wind

1000
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,340
They don't care about us, friends, so forget them anyway

1001
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,880
Praise Bob, praise Bob they don't care about us

1002
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,480
That's why we're still getting away with this

1003
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,020
That's why nobody's getting away with this

1004
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,860
Nobody's killed us yet

1005
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,420
Because they would care about us but they don't understand

1006
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,960
And that makes them sort of want to go away

1007
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,420
Based upon your previous purchases we believe you would be interested in these items

1008
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,680
Now how many times are you subjected to that on alt slack or on the website

1009
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,360
Never, never

1010
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,360
No actually Dave, I'm the one who does that

1011
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,240
Never, never

1012
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,100
They just can't figure out how to make money on us

1013
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,560
Amazon.com knows me so well

1014
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,640
They're getting intrusive aren't they

1015
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,000
They're getting intrusive aren't they

1016
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,880
Because it's headquartered in Nichigan

1017
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:13,980
Nichigan?

1018
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,140
Down on the farm

1019
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:19,700
Nichigan, home of the anemo acids

1020
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,620
Friends that was the amazing reverend Susie the floozy

1021
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,680
Who also built a goat

1022
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,280
Why a goat?

1023
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,200
Why not mention the goat?

1024
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
A goat with an upside down

1025
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,980
A, a, an artificial Frankenstein like goat

1026
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,960
Or a cleverly designed robot of a goat

1027
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,700
With, yes, Greek features

1028
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,680
Ah yes and udders

1029
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,700
Udder features we could mention

1030
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,300
Udders made out of a rubber glove

1031
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,360
It was a rather large goat

1032
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,700
It was, it was large for a goat

1033
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,780
But unfortunately

1034
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,980
It was a love goat

1035
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,260
The love goat

1036
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,680
The love goat

1037
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,100
Wasn't there a show called the love goat?

1038
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,160
Life's sweetest reward

1039
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,020
Speaking of loving goats, you know portions of the following broadcast may be found objectionable by members of the listening audience

1040
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Therefore WCSB advises listeners to discretion the views and opinions expressed in this program are not those of WCSB or Cleveland State University

1041
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,300
Can't believe the way he does it

1042
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,880
Let's say something obscene

1043
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,640
If you are to fail then you should be ashamed of yourself

1044
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,700
What we air by definition is not obscene

1045
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,020
You're a disclaimer voice

1046
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,880
You sound like the guys from the hair care project

1047
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,360
You know I've been wanting to get into voice work for years and I really have no idea where to start

1048
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:34,540
Make that voice of yours roll up its sleeve and get elbow grease all over your pots and pans

1049
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,040
You know there is a show called the love goat

1050
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,860
But it's banned in 30 states

1051
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,020
Ah, bad

1052
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,080
It's a bad movie

1053
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,360
A bad show

1054
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,420
Well we're on the horns of a dilemma here

1055
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,660
But at the axe day celebration this large artificial goat was the cynosure of all eyes and the center of attention

1056
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,240
And like the other goats before her she blew bubbles

1057
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,320
She could also perform many tricks

1058
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:06,200
Number one she would take one of the little pipes out and the bubble would appear and float seemingly

1059
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,180
Interestingly for a long period of time she also performed songs and did tricks for the kids

1060
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,300
But the kids had leprosy

1061
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,840
They'd been fondling too many armadillos

1062
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:24,240
Take time now to look at my tremendous manhood and experience great joy

1063
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,800
Word?

1064
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,200
Come on in, it's fine

1065
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,600
I have the large organs

1066
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,800
And by the way let me just mention too we have a website with tons of large organs

1067
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,080
At www.largermanhood.org

1068
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:45,660
So please take a look at that and download large organs right there on our website

1069
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,640
Feel free to do that

1070
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,140
Well what is this position?

1071
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,660
Ssssssss

1072
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,240
Male

1073
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,260

00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:39,980
Head

1114
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,280
Head

1115
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:41,940
Don't

1116
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,060
Don't think for one minute

1117
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,620
Yup yup yup yup

1118
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:51,160
You know the Church of the Subgenius is like that model of the visible man or the visible

1119
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,920
woman which was even more fun.

1120
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,300
I spray paint in my flesh color I didn't want her visible anymore.

1121
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,840
You can see the insides.

1122
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,740
We have transparency you know.

1123
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,240
You can you can

1124
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,740
Walk up and see the inner workings of the Church except for the one key secret and that's

1125
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,860
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1126
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,220
He may be here though.

1127
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:19,140
He may have decided since puzzling evidence and some of the other gun happy nuts aren't

1128
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,740
here maybe Bob will show up.

1129
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,100
He often does during amino acid concerts.

1130
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,100
That would be the time to look for him.

1131
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:32,580
He stumbles out as if he's almost blind and he looks he's shorter than I always expected

1132
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,300
him to be.

1133
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,760
Well you're standing on a stage.

1134
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,560
Right.

1135
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,460
And you often get people often say to Bob Dobbs I thought you were dead.

1136
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,220
He's the snake Plissken of religious heroes friends Bob is.

1137
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,100
Now this is just the beginning of what I wanted to tell you.

1138
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1139
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1140
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1141
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,180
Why have you picked me when I always wanted to play the music.

1142
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,180


1143
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,020
Thank you.

1144
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,640
Thank you.

00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,860
Thank you.

1146
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,100
Thank you.

1147
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,280
Thank you.

1148
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:57,960
Thank you.

1149
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,840
Thank you.

1150
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,740
Thank you.

1151
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,320
Thank you.
