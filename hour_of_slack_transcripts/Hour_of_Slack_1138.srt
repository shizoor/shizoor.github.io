1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Grandfather, I have a white wife.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,120
You do?

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,820
That's interesting.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,360
Does she cook and does she work hard?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,660
Oh, yes, grandfather.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,060
That surprises me.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,920
Does she show pleasant enthusiasm when you mount her?

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,600
Well, sure, grandfather.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,520
That surprises me even more.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,860
I tried one of them once,

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,700
but she didn't show any enthusiasm at all.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,020
Well, grandfather, all the whites aren't crazy.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,980
I'm glad to hear that, my son.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,760
I thought they were.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,020
Oh, no.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,960
I know of one who is as brave as any human being.

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,500
I'd like to know.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,380
I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,380
What is he called?

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,600
Mom?

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,080
The English pig has not yet learned the rules.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,140
No, and I'll never learn the rules.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,460
Not your way.

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,940
Blind obedience.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,380
Without reason, without thought, without soul.

26
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,700
The Self Genius Power Roles.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,720
Watch.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,780
I'll listen carefully.

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,520
I see.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,140
Is that clear?

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,020
Yes.

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,340
Yeah?

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:31,820
Yes.

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,340
Can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,800
The one that ruined you was that damn mob.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,200
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe and there isn't any.

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:55,240
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy, and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them all in vain.

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,180
All in vain, Jack.

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,720
Did you hear anything?

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
Listen to me.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,620
And the more preposterous, the better.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,560
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,420
The horses of Arabia have silver wings.

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.

46
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,600
I have sold all those propositions.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,380
Maybe we're all fools enough.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,980
None of it matters.

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,540
Ah.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,820
You stay with Allardyce, Meriwether.

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,780
And you wear silk.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
What I don't know is I want to wear silk.

53
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,420
My dear boy, what else can a man of parts wear than silk?

54
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,740
Tarn feathers, I reckon.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,360
And what did you say?

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
What did you say they find in your body?

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
What did you say?

58
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,560
That's the big news this evening.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,260
Let your thoughts fly the ship.

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,260


61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,600
Leave the world behind.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,600


63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,180
Let your words boil both the faces and the mouths.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,960
And the craftsmen hold a stray!

65
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,260
To build machines of industry To send him to his grave

66
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,700
He'll calculate the blood and sweat The sight of which he'll soon forget

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,760
Swallow with the decadence Of all the time he saved

68
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,120
When intelligence progresses In a never-ending wave

69
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,500
An exponential growth The likes of which we've never made

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,360
The next day, wire to the plan

71
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,800
Every aspect of our lives Is moderated by remote device

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,120
And in the name of common sense Believe everything they say

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,680
War makes sense, there's a nation Is it patient? It's the end of the world

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:57,520
The dangers of your race are abomination Of complicated, unenplaced myths

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,100
With the comfort of conformity We were silently enslaved

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,360
An instant wire to the plan

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,800
Wire

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,320
An instant wire to the plan

79
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,680
Wire

80
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,060
And before we even realized The message was relayed

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,300
An instant wire to the plan

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:29,840
Wire

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,320
An instant wire to the plan

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,740
Wire

85
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,820
To communicate to all of them The force required to break the skin

86
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,740
Let the force prolong Our whole existence

87
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,900
We'll all live but decay

88
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,680
War makes sense, there's a nation Is it patient? It's the end of the world

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:06:00,560
War makes sense, there's a nation Is it patient? It's the end of the world

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,560


91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,560


92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,560


93
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,200
So responds

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,120
TheÃ¶m

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,120


96
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,680
Unfor searches

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,900
Connect that wire to the black wire.

98
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:34,500
And what should start up but that band Mose Giganticus from their album The Invisible Hand.

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,000
And you can learn more of Mose Giganticus from mosegiganticus.com.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:53,020
And before that, some lemur makings and clips from one of my favorite movies and books, Little Big Man by Thomas Berger.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
This is Hour of Slack, number 1138.

102
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:10,240
And we're pirating some pirate cat radio recorded last December during a season in hell in San Francisco.

103
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,820
With host John.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,480
John Kell.

105
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,260
And Dr. Howe.

106
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,360
The Mongoloid of Lloyd Mongoloid.

107
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,880
Mine truly.

108
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,520
And puzzling evidence and you.

109
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,420
So yes, you too.

110
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,460
You too can participate in the program this evening.

111
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,560
That's right.

112
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,160
Where the Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius is traveling and visiting us here out in beautiful San Francisco, California.

113
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,140
United States of America.

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,540
Western Hemisphere Earth.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Dr. Howe.

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,680
Puzzling evidence.

117
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,280
K. Rob.

118
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,580
Lloyd Mongoloid.

119
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,260
And myself, John Hill in the studio this evening for a season in hell.

120
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,300
Happy to be here.

121
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,680
Happy to be talking to all of you.

122
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,180
Four and five.

123
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,540
That is the number for salvation, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,840
Isn't this an extra long season this week?

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,540
No, it's always four hours.

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,200
Really?

127
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,160
That is quite a hefty bite of radio.

128
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,940
I guess after two hours, honestly, I'm just getting warmed up.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
So we need the extra two hours for me to eventually burn out.

130
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
Now, I have five minutes.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,560
I have a question.

132
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,500
Is that a jug of jinkum next to the bathroom in the hallway there?

134
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,400
A jug of what?

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll tell you about that.

136
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,760
I've always wanted to try that.

137
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,380
I hear it makes you see your ancestors.

138
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,880
So free.

139
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,740
It might be some old...

140
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,980
That is jinkum.

141
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,000
I wanted to make sure because it looked like...

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,780
It could be cleaning fluid left by the cleaning lady.

143
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,840
Well, it looks like the...

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,780
It is a unisex bathroom, you know.

145
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,400
For the listeners out there this evening, now you know.

146
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,900
You call.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,980
You do go on.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,640
You do participate in the cavalcade of fun that we're having here this evening on the program.

149
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
Once again, 415...

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,140
You couldn't do it.

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,380
No.

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,780
Skis, skis, skis, skis, skis.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,140
You know, they're listening in Berlin on the FM dial.

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,740
At 104...

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,760
Guten Morgen, Berlin.

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,080
Und on the Internet at piratecatradio.com.

157
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,620
That's correct.

158
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,760
That is correct.

159
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,300
All Dr.

160
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,700
And everybody appears to have some type of technological device.

161
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,980
Bundesmundsherrlichderloh.

162
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,200
Ich bin ein Berliner.

163
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,540
Really?

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,380
A jelly roll?

165
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,300
Delicious.

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,620
How goes the spreading of the doctrine overseas?

167
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,000
No, you can be in California for not using a technological instrument every 90 seconds.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,520
Germany's a big...

169
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,500
Germany's a big fan.

170
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,620
...big center of subgenius activity.

171
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,120
And Debo.

172
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,600
And Shanadu.

173
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,760
Yep, but the Scientologists have got to go.

174
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,060
Shanadu?

175
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,800
Shanadu.

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,320
My late fetish is four girls, Japanese girls, singing para para pop songs.

177
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,000
They sing about King Kong.

178
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,180
Ask a geek boy.

179
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


180
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


181
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


182
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


183
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


184
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


185
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


186
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


187
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


188
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,180


190
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,620
He'll tell you, because his girlfriend is deeply involved in this.

191
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,580
We should get Geek Boy to call us this evening.

192
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,860
Maybe he can tell us what's going on.

193
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,180
Since they sing about King Kong, they come into my purview.

194
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm X-Boy.

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,780
I'm a Kill Zero boy.

196
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,980
Philo showed me that video this morning.

197
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,140
And then King Kong was on his TV?

198
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,740
And they didn't get...

199
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,280
A little while later.

200
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,880
Philo and Einstein were disimpressed by it all.

201
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,320
Coincidence?

202
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,640
They thought it was...

203
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,420
Or conspiracy?

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,500
Well, they're very stupid, yeah.

205
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:02,840
Remain secret.

206
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,480
I had to justify this all day.

207
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
Not King Kong, Shanadu.

208
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah, exactly.

209
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,640
I thought they were a sham of a dude.

210
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,160
Oh, come on.

211
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,160


212
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
Now, how high and mighty are we going to be?

213
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,920
Just because we are the head of a successful cult, it doesn't mean we have to...

214
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,040
Actually, I'm jealous, because we don't have the four little Japanese pop stars doing

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,820
Bob songs.

216
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,120
Well, there was one...

217
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,180
I don't know.

218
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,040
I guess I...

219
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,980
The director said it's the great...

220
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,840
Comment on last X-Day, but if you'll think really hard, you'll think that you will.

221
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
At least part of the way there.

222
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,080
Okay.

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Now...

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,940
Can I let out my thoughts now?

225
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,300
How easy.

226
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,220
How hard it is to pass these thoughts.

227
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,140
Oh, this is a bit...

228
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,140


229
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,140


230
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,540
Big thought.

231
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,520
That's the robo-puzzling, it sounds like.

232
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,740
So often, we have to choke philosophical thoughts on the show with a roughage of knowledge.

233
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,360
It's like when...

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,940
Man, that was fun, following you through the crowd.

235
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,800
Oh, right.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,660
On the deck, he ran down all the way.

237
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
That was during that first set.

238
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Trying to run behind you and cut through the people with a little...

239
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,080
Oh, yeah, about the wireless mic that afternoon.

240
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,260
I was going to give it a good workout.

241
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,400
They call him Wireless Mike.

242
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,820
But I'm sure he's got some award-winning video now.

243
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,340
We'll just see.

244
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,980
This is a new camera, and I kept hitting the button that went from movie to still pictures,

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,540
much to my frustration, because I'm not used to where they put it.

246
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,360
Puzzling, are you putting any of your stuff up on YouTube?

247
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,660
Yeah, should be this week sometime.

248
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,760
All the time, man.

249
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,280
The last concerts.

250
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,540
Now, where do we find you on YouTube?

251
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,420
Puzzling Evidence TV.

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Puzzling Evidence TV.

253
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
Not Puzzling Evidence TV.

254
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,280
Yes.

255
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,380
Puzzling Evidence TV.

256
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,060
TV.

257
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,540
TV.

258
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,140
Because I was going to say, Shenandoah are the great grand artists of the two-way.

259
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,140


260
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,260
They're the women who are singing in Mothra.

261
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,000
I think it is, right?

262
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,420
The twins?

263
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,300
The A-linas.

264
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:43,760
Yes.

265
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,640
That's where they come from directly.

266
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Shenandoah?

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000


268
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,020
They're all about Shenandoah.

269
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,820
Or Hinoi Team, which is, you look at Hinoi Team and you start feeling really guilty.

270
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,780
Something like the A-Team?

271
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
The T and A-Team?

272
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,520
Sort of.

273
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,340
But it looks like 14-year-old Japanese girls.

274
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,220
So you feel really weird later.

275
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,160
Not much T, but a little bit of A.

276
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,540
Wow.

277
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,340
The twin fairies from the Odo Island.

278
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,460
And they do King Kong, too.

279
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,280
And they do Ike Ike, and they do Night of Fire, which is, man, I love that song.

280
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,920
Yeah, they are.

281
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,600
I had great regard for them when I was a child.

282
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,960
I liked those two little twins.

283
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,200
The Irreverent Friday Jones could sing that entire song that those little twins sang.

284
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,120
She knew the Mothra song by heart.

285
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,140
King Kong!

286
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,100
Well, it is a catchy number, and so is she, as I understand.

287
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,540
Is Bob big in Japan?

288
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,080
Bob is big everywhere.

289
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,880
It's true.

290
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,800
It's just that some people don't know him yet.

291
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,780
But do the Japanese know him?

292
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,040
They call him Big Bob.

293
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,100
Oh, yeah.

294
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


295
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


296
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


297
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


298
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


299
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


300
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


301
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


302
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


303
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


304
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,100


305
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,800
Now, believe it or not, a Japanese publisher about ten years ago paid us five grand for

306
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,260
reprinting the Book of the Subgenius, and then they never did it.

307
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,780
We got paid, but they never published it.

308
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:03,680
And what I heard was that nine translators had committed seppuku in frustration over

309
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,940
trying to translate it into Japanese.

310
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,540
They could not get slacku.

311
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,180
Oh, yeah.

312
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,420
A subgenius translated all of Revelation X into French.

313
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,400
This makes no sense!

314
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,420
And then we never were able to sell the French translation.

315
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,640
What about Shining Path of Least Resistance?

316
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,560
Would he be able to do anything like that?

317
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,940
Well, Shining Path of Least Resistance, and this is a true story, was going to set up

318
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,460
a subgenius devival at a club in Osaka.

319
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,580
And he did.

320
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,140
And one week before the devival was to happen,

321
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,160


322
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,300
the earthquake tore Osaka to the ground.

323
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,040
So apparently the gods of Shinto, well, there aren't gods of Shinto, but, and that's maybe

324
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,100
why they had power over Bob, prevented the subgenius devival by causing an earthquake

325
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,940
in that city.

326
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,220
That must have been a little bit of a warning.

327
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,680
Oh, now, here's the...

328
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
Talk about warnings!

329
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,180
This one's kind of the other way around.

330
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,820
Remember the terrible disaster of the tsunami?

331
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,160
Yeah.

332
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,320
The tsunami that destroyed so many, uh, coastal areas.

333
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,120
Countries in Japan by years.

334
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,140
In Japan.

335
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:20,680
In that, in that town, uh, that, that, uh, that main resort town that you saw so much

336
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,120
footage from, with the embarrassing name of, uh, Fuck You or whatever it was, and, uh...

337
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,420
What is that tourist town where the, so much of the tsunami...

338
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,460
Anyway, there was a subgenius there that Christmas Eve.

339
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,220
Wooden Chiseled.

340
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,900
Partying on the, in the bars along the beach.

341
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,340
Of course.

342
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,780
Absolutely.

343
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,420
Only one?

344
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,260
Only one?

345
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:44,980
I'm quite surprised.

346
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,760
Probably just one.

347
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,600
But get this.

348
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,440
He was going from bar to bar, spreading the word of Bob, putting up little Xerox Dobbs

349
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,580
heads, and at some point he probably said the phrase, the world ends tomorrow and you

350
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,240
may die.

351
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,660
Famous subgenius quote.

352
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:05,140
He then got too drunk and pa- went to his hotel room, which was luckily on the 10th

353
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,000
story furt way downtown.

354
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,780
Woke up in the morning and of course the streets were filled with bodies and water

355
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,220
and...

356
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,080
He looked out on a wilderness of waste.

357
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,480
Yeah.

358
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,260
So, uh, what can I say?

359
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,760
I guess there's something to be said for going to bed when you get that drunk.

360
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,160
Fascinating because I have a story to share with you.

361
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:34,000
I had a friend of mine staying in the Marriott between the Twin Towers on September 10th.

362
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,260
Whoa.

363
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,980
He goes to the hotel room.

364
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,800
He's in a hotel bar, ordering drinks for he and some friends.

365
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,800
He's talking to a couple of stewardesses or would they be steward-i?

366
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,800
I don't know.

367
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,680
And he says to them, the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

368
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,760
Oh my God.

369
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,980
Next day, down.

370
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:00,980
After tower one comes down, he's running out of his Marriott in only his underwear, leaving

371
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,280
everything behind.

372
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,840
And luckily, some people on the streets were kind enough to give him some clothing and

373
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,040
a few dollars and such and allow him to settle his accounts the way he needed.

374
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,880
So yes, we have, we have, we're gathering evidence as we speak.

375
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,960
Be careful about uttering that phrase, shouldn't we?

376
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,140
I guess so.

377
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,400
You know, it's a no laughing.

378
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,380
Depends on when and where you are.

379
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,120
I love the culture.

380
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,360
Like the other girls.

381
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,680
The other girls on the subway.

382
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,260
They're still obsessing over those jackets.

383
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:33,260


384
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,400
I love the Japanese Twitter page.

385
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
On September 11th.

386
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,980
On September 11th.

387
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,540
On September 11th.

388
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,020
Puzzling evidence bidding on Japanese girls underwear.

389
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,600
He's trying to get that pop group to come over here and participate in the next puzzling

390
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,740
evidence-a-palooza.

391
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,840
How's it going?

392
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,720
How's your luck hanging out?

393
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,300
I think they're coming.

394
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,240
Wow.

395
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,380
Oh, here's another September 11th related subgenius story.

396
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,080
See, I told you.

397
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,500
We knew a subgenius who worked in the...

398
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,980
The towers.

399
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:12,960
But he slacked off that day and called in sick and stayed home just because he was lazy.

400
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Saved by slack.

401
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,680
Saved by slack.

402
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:15,940
Saved by slack.

403
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,600
And that's another true, inspiring true story.

404
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,060
That's quite brilliant.

405
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,260
Sliciness in this case.

406
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,400
Rob just did the ultimate September 11th show the other night.

407
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,900
I wonder if...

408
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
It made callers peel out and crash.

409
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh, gosh.

410
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,480
That's terrible.

411
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,820
That's in terrible taste.

412
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,240
Talk about the Tokyo Drift.

413
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, I hope so.

414
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,340
Yeah.

415
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay.

416
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,600
Weak.

417
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:37,820
Blah.

418
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,220
Blah.

419
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,600
Blah.

420
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Blah.

421
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,240
Total.

422
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,200
Trashy novel.

423
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Industrial effluent.

424
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,180
It was impossible to ponder.

425
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,300
Excessive consumption.

426
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,060
Thinking.

427
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,500
Thinking.

428
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,360
Presumption.

429
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,980
So real.

430
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,840
Cribs.

431
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,720
Obliterate.

432
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,300
Excess.

433
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,580
Bodies.

434
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,360
But everyone knows the agenda.

435
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:51,960
Bad.

436
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,620
Light bulb.

437
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,300
Light bulb.

438
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,640
Think.

439
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:53,880
Think.

440
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:53,980
Think.

441
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,180
Think.

442
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,180


443
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,180


444
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,020
Please.

445
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,480
Think.

446
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:55,860
Please.

447
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,300
Think.

448
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,440
Think.

449
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,100
That is truly.

450
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,020
Excess.

451
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,540
So real.

452
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,200
Two Real Friends by Reverend Noel Pref.

453
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:12,260
And now we'll go back to the world of Little Big Man, a classic literary proto-subgenius.

454
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,940
In this scene meeting his long-lost boyhood pal, who has become the Cheyenne equivalent

455
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,880
of a rogue subgenius.

456
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,860
Incidentally, the Lakota subgenius.

457
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,440
equivalent of a rogue subgenius is called a Heyoka.

458
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,020
Hello, younger bear.

459
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,660
Goodbye.

460
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,180
There was a boy whose life I'd saved.

461
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,640
It was a mortal embarrassment.

462
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,980
Did you catch rabbits on your hunting trip?

463
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,140
No.

464
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,840
Then don't give the rabbits you didn't catch to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

465
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,280
You see, younger bear had become a contrary,

466
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,020
the most dangerous of all Cheyenne warriors

467
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,300
because the way they live drives them half crazy.

468
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,140
Except for battle, a contrary does everything backwards.

469
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,660
He says goodbye when he means hello,

470
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,480
yes when he means no,

471
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,260
walks through bushes instead of on trails,

472
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,940
and washes with dirt,

473
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,120
and drives with water, and so forth.

474
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,260
I thought you were dead.

475
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,980
Dead to the normal world, friends.

476
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,080
The rogue subgenius.

477
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,420
And now, a little more Mos Giganticus.

478
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,820
Uh, for just some...

479
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,140
Uh, slack.

480
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,180
A slack break.

481
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,120
etz

482
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,280
Tr Miz

483
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,280


484
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,280


485
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,280


486
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,300
What!

487
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm leaving.

488
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,600
Opps.

489
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:05,880
A ÑÑÐ°Ñacic nossos was is here.

490
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,520
He hasDisapointionS

491
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,760
But are Bh basin

492
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,460
A tennis just flies like dÃ©cor.

493
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,040
Do not attempt to sabotage me again.

494
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,360
I will defend myself.

495
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:20,780
I will defend myself.

496
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:28,720
I will defend myself.

497
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:20,180
I will defend myself.

498
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,520
I will defend myself.

499
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,760
I will defend myself.

500
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,980
I will defend myself.

501
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:49,380
I will defend myself.

502
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,780
I will defend myself.

503
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:50,800
I will defend myself.

504
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:50,800


505
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:50,800


506
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,880
He just blew the place away.

507
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,060
I fell down and worshipped them.

508
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,480
On vinyl?

509
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,720
No, no, on CD.

510
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,360
I was about to hear that, although it was just this...

511
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,300
It was great.

512
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,860
But they were just so energized.

513
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,360
I saw them at 7778 at the Mabuhay, is what I was saying, for those of you on drugs.

514
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,360
And Sting, how did you end up meeting the real, actual Debo?

515
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,160
Well, I...

516
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,260
After my initial frustration at them beating us to the Cliffhart Act,

517
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,920
they printed their address.

518
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,100
The Club Devo and their second album.

519
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,020
And I sent them a subgenius pamphlet.

520
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,320
And Mark Mothersbaugh wrote back a postcard

521
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,420
indicating that he had read it very closely.

522
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,100
And we started communicating.

523
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,740
And I sent them my underground movie, Let's Visit the World of the Future,

524
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:48,300
which featured pornographic violence animated with G.I. Joes and Barbie dolls.

525
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,700
And they were planning to do just...

526
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,460
I mean, it was such an animated sequence in Love Without Anger video.

527
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,700
So they hired me to do it for $1,000.

528
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,000
And I had five days to get it done.

529
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,160
And it really shows.

530
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,840
You're all, right on, that's $200 a day, yes!

531
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,400
And then I found out, of course, later,

532
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,180
that Devo had actually been just one of Bob's many experiments in pop music,

533
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,360
like The Monkees and that band that Wellman likes so much, or Shambuzy, or whatever.

534
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,780
Those were all...

535
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,960
Those were all Bob's experiments.

536
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,060
And Devo will tell you that Bob just...

537
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,600
He created them, but yet he...

538
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,880
Then he ruined them.

539
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,840
And they had to struggle back after being Bob followers for a while.

540
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,780
Like...

541
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,020
They were at...

542
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,800
Mark came to the very first World Subgenius Convention in Dallas

543
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,420
because they happened to be performing in Dallas that very weekend.

544
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,320
That was the most fun.

545
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,220
That must have been a pretty brilliant time, actually.

546
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,620
And I thought that video would be up on the walls, but it wasn't, actually.

547
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,740
But it's on YouTube.

548
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,640
You put it on...

549
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,460
Yeah, we used the quotes from that ancient interview a lot.

550
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,060
It's fun, because he was the famous guy.

551
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,100
We had a BBC crew shooting us.

552
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,980
Three-camera shoot.

553
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,580
Showtime.

554
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,180
Light, sound.

555
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,340
Even they were blowing it, I guess,

556
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
because on a lot of the tapes, the sound was...

557
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,780
They forgot to turn it down, and the band blew out the...

558
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,060
What year was that?

559
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,000
1981.

560
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,380
1981 and 81.

561
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,300
Yeah.

562
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,860
I just...

563
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,440
I drove out in 80 and met these guys.

564
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,620
So that was the first big gathering?

565
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:19,960
Yeah.

566
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,760
Yeah.

567
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


568
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


569
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:20,760


570
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,700
The first World Subgenius Convention.

571
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes, it was held in Dallas.

572
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,760
I lost...

573
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,100
Personally, I lost $1,500, which was basically my life savings.

574
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,160
I was a father of two...

575
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,660
Yeah, I had a family to support.

576
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,480
It was really the name of God.

577
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,640
I did not myself produce another subgenius show after that until X-Day.

578
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,300
The X-Day things, which was a whole different thing where we can't lose.

579
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,320
We found the perfect campground.

580
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,520
The perfect.

581
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,160
The perfect campground for the end of the world is a place called Brushwood.

582
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,820
Surrounded by miles of Amish and Pennsylvania Dutch Hutterite country.

583
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,680
Yeah, it's an Amish country, and it's about two hours from Cleveland.

584
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,840
It's clothing optional.

585
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,900
They only knew what we are doing.

586
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,560
The owners of it are dear, dear friends of all of us subgeniuses,

587
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:16,880
and it's just the perfect place to wait for the end of the world.

588
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,080
But I think what John was...

589
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,760
You can party like you would party if the world really wasn't.

590
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,700
I think what John was asking about is why we dedicated the entire church to that.

591
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,380
The guard and the first thing.

592
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,280
The what?

593
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,600
Remember the guard who...

594
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,960
Is that what I was asking about?

595
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,440
Yeah.

596
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,100
I'm sure you know better than I.

597
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,020
I think you were asking about the Dallas policeman who was hired...

598
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,860
Yeah, tell us all about that.

599
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
...to be the security guard at the first...

600
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,060
That's exactly what I was thinking about.

601
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,300
...at the first subgenius show.

602
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:40,980
The guy who quit.

603
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:49,280
And he was so insulted and offended and humiliated and embarrassed as a Christian by Bob.

604
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:49,680
Oh.

605
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,020
Go ahead.

606
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,840
Leaving you with no security.

607
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,480
Right.

608
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,860
So, you know, nowadays...

609
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,720
That was the plan the whole time.

610
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,820
Praise Bob.

611
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,060
Praise Bob.

612
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,000
These days, we don't have to pay for security because almost every revival we've held has

613
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,520
several subgeniuses there who are young Marines or Army or Navy SEALs.

614
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,580
I'm not kidding.

615
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,400
They're out of uniform, though.

616
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
By the way, yeah, they're out of uniform.

617
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,740
But, Dr. Hathaway...

618
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,900
Well, no, it's true.

619
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,040
Young female Marines.

620
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,080
That was my favorite.

621
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,480
Well, they're young female Marines and they're out of uniform.

622
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
But there's...

623
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,060
She actually was...

624
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,720
They come and go.

625
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,500
Stations, post-ins.

626
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,480
You know who we're talking about.

627
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,600
I just like the show.

628
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:45,260
There were three folks from an Army base in Hamburg or someplace in Germany helping us

629
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,200
do security and watching out for terrorists and so forth.

630
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:57,220
And at Baltimore, friends, one of the mighty military men, not on duty, nor in uniform,

631
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:05,180
nor his right mind, nor in any condition for a job interview, nonetheless, Reverend Jimbo

632
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:12,200
took that defiable mic and told us how he had been in a land of pinks and...

633
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,300
That spirit and soul and slack mean absolutely...

634
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,380
Absolutely freaking nothing to these people.

635
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,760
Say that it's so, but I love you.

636
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,700
It's so.

637
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,520
It's so.

638
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,360
I am sorry to say.

639
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:37,600
But I'm here to tell you that slack conquers all.

640
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,120
Yes, it does.

641
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Slack works.

642
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,520
Slack worked for me and it works for you every day.

643
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,220
It does.

644
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,140
All the time.

645
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,160
You don't need love.

646
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,320
You don't need real religion.

647
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,680
Real religion.

648
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,640
Slack is all there is.

649
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,240
There ain't nothing else.

650
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,140
All you gotta do is believe in Bob.

651
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,360
Yes!

652
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,960
All you gotta do is believe.

653
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:23,260
That there's something else besides the grind.

654
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,540
There is!

655
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,760
And the hate.

656
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,800
Show us Bob!

657
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,080
I can't show you Bob.

658
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,000
Bob reveals himself to you.

659
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,760
So true.

660
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,460
Now, Bob reveals himself to you in many different ways.

661
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,500
Love me.

662
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,280
There's...

663
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,160
Oh, I don't know.

664
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:58,200
Spending a whole day just engrossing yourself in the dirtiest parts of the internet.

665
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,360
Oh, the best!

666
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,240
Oh, the best!

667
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,980
They're the best!

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,260
There's days just watching the weirdest fucking movies you can find.

669
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,380
Apologize for my French.

670
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,180
Turns me on.

671
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,240
Hell yeah.

672
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
I like it.

673
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,740
French is right.

674
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,060
Come on.

675
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,440
I got an outfit.

676
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,460
I'm French.

677
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,320
You guys motivate me.

678
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,220
Oh yeah.

679
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,420
What do we motivate you to?

680
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,720
What, what, what, what?

681
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,520
Say it louder.

682
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,520
What do we motivate you to do?

683
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,920
You motivate me...

684
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,320
To win!

685
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,260
To spend more money.

686
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,000
Yeah!

687
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,960
Fuck yeah, buddy!

688
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,920
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry to say...

689
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,760
That old, poor Reverend Jimbo de Limbo...

690
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,400
No!

691
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,980
Is nigh close to broke.

692
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,180
No.

693
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,960
He spent all his money on the vices of life.

694
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,980
Jimbo de Limbo!

695
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,340
And Bob!

696
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,000
Grace Bob! Grace Bob!

697
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,060
And Bob!

698
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,160
Fuck what, bud?

699
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,020
There's nothing, because there's nothing more important in life...

700
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,100
Than the vices and Bob.

701
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,680
Do all you can to live every day, because the world ends tomorrow.

702
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,440
And you...

703
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,560
And you...

704
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,260
And you may die!

705
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,500
There's nothing worth living for, friends.

706
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,160
There's nothing worth living for, friends, other than today.

707
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,620
Tomorrow may never come, but today is right now and right here.

708
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,620
This is the only time.

709
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,880
This is the only time that you can be possibly, absolutely positive of.

710
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,740
I wanna be with you!

711
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,460
You can be with me, friends.

712
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,860
You can.

713
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,940
All at the same time.

714
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,820
All at the same time, where I'm staying at Pisces Place.

715
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,900
Gotta be thinking!

716
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,680
Come on over.

717
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,480
That'll be so creepy.

718
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,960
Get going!

719
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,540
Why do they have two bedrooms, though?

720
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,780
There's a big floor.

721
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,900
Show us!

722
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,040
Friends, Dobbs has revealed to me his plan for the future.

723
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,900
What is it?

724
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,860
His plan for the future...

725
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,100
Is everybody living together.

726
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,360
Everybody living together.

727
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,340
Yes!

728
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,540
Everybody fucking together!

729
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,740
Everybody fucking, fucking together.

730
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,400
Yes!

731
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,200
Yes!

732
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,620
Yes!

733
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,480
Yes!

734
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,640
There ain't no differences left.

735
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,460
There'll still be differences, friends.

736
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,120
But it's in your mind.

737
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:53,760
Fuck that.

738
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,980
Once there's...

739
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,340
There's still a mind.

740
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,200
And there's still a soul.

741
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,140
Now, to get back on topic.

742
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,440
This lacklust places on the planet, they need us.

743
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,060
They need your spirit.

744
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
We need help.

745
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,080
They need your money.

746
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:20,420
We need to break out. We need... the only way to do this friends is to put your

747
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:27,640
money and put your faith in Bob. There's a merchandise table right there friends.

748
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,140
I know some of you hadn't bought anything but there is stuff you need to

749
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,520
buy tonight.

750
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:41,980
Tonight. Money. That's all it's... that's all... that's the world revolves around

751
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,800
money. Bob needs your money. Bob needs your soul.

752
00:34:48,040 --> 00:35:00,540
Praise money. Praise Bob's. All the Bob's. All the different Bob's friends. Praise Bob's.

753
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
There's more

754
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,160
than one. I hate to admit it but there's more than one. I've been led to believe

755
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,700
up until recently that there was only one Bob Dobbs but there's actually very

756
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,960
more than one. Very more than one. There's the Bob that takes your money

757
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,680
and there's the Bob that gives back.

758
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:41,220
At the store he'll give you something for your money. In your bed he'll give you

759
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,900
something for your trouble. In the bathroom in the head.

760
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,220
I know you all enjoy the scent of your own extra meditation.

761
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,740
I do! Extra meditation!

762
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:13,920
Hallelujah friends. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. I do so enjoy the scent of my own. It smells like roses to me.

763
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:23,640
It smells like beans to y'all but... My friends hate me. Oh they hate you. Your roommates, my roommates, they despise it.

764
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:32,780
My roommate hates it. I do! There's the Bob. There's the Bob that you see when you go to church with your grandparents.

765
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:39,000
You may not realize it but he's there. Praise Grandma.

766
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,220
He's the Bob that gives you the slack from doing whatever the hell it is that

767
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:52,420
your family wants you to do. Yeah, no indeed. Fuck them friends.

768
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:01,140
But it's the slack of not hearing about it anymore. I'm sure you understand.

769
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,800
There's the slack from downloading stuff off the Internet. That's Bob. Right there.

770
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,920
Pirating stuff. Yeah, Ebom's World. Crazy stuff on there.

771
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,880
This'll find it's way onto YouTube I'm sure.

772
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,720
There's the Bob that's there.

773
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,520
when you pop that pirated CD into your CD player.

774
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:35,800
Yeah!

775
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,140
Thank you.

776
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,800
Unpaid shit.

777
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,480
Unpaid stuff.

778
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,860
Now, don't you do anything unpaid

779
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,340
from the Church of the Subgenius,

780
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,620
because that's the only sin.

781
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,280
And to talk about sin, it's really kind of an anachronism

782
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,720
as far as the Church of the Subgenius is concerned.

783
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,080
It's something from the past, isn't it?

784
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,280
Pretty much.

785
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,000
For the most part.

786
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,640
I mean, sin, really.

787
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,400
Who the hell really cares about sin in this day and age, friends?

788
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,120
Kind of.

789
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I personally hate sin.

790
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,840
Sin equals death, and death equals non-slack.

791
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,680
Sharpen the slack!

792
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,340
Sharpen your slack. You have to.

793
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,480
So what I want you all to do, dear friends,

794
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,200
is go to church.

795
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,980
Go to church.

796
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,640
And write down everything your preacher says not to do.

797
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,480
And do every last thing.

798
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,160
Because there are no sins.

799
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,080
There are no sins under Bob.

800
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,900
He offers an excuse.

801
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,320
A divine, all-purpose excuse for only $30 and, you know,

802
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,520
a little something-something.

803
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,460
A little something-something.

804
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,960
Justification.

805
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,740
Justification, yes, indeed, my friends.

806
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,060
Injustification.

807
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,540
All right, friends, we're ready for the amino acids,

808
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,700
my non-ending rule.

809
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,360
The rant has finally come to an end.

810
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,420
Allahu Akbar.

811
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,360
Praise be to Bob.

812
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,920
And may the revolution of Bob never end.

813
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,380
Praise Bob!

814
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,540
Praise Bob!

815
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,960
Praise Bob!

816
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,880
Praise Bob!

817
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,680
My blessing with you.

818
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,800
And these few precepts in thy memory look of character.

819
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:55,700
Thank you.

820
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


821
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


822
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


823
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


824
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


825
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


826
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


827
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


828
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:55,700


829
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,000
Thank you.

830
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,980
Give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act.

831
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,840
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar.

832
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,480
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried,

833
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,580
grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel.

834
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,660
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatched,

835
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,780
unfledged comrade.

836
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,400
Beware of entrance to a quarrel.

837
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,860
But, being in, may that the oppose it may beware of thee.

838
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,440
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.

839
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,700
Come, come.

840
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


841
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


842
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


843
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


844
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


845
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


846
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


847
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


848
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


849
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


850
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


851
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


852
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:25,700


853
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,640
Master, thy habit as thy purse can buy, but not expressed in fancy.

854
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,120
Rich, not gaudy, for the apparel oft proclaims the man.

855
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,340
Neither a borrower nor a lender be, for loan oft loses both itself and friend,

856
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,980
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

857
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,000
This above all, to thine own self be true, and it must follow,

858
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,880
as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.

859
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,760
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

860
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,180
There is a pain between my ears.

861
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,400
Shakespeare will do that to you, friends, as will the world according to Noral Pratt,

862
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,620
who has a report on Trouble Cook Condoleezza Wright.

863
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,640
The United States is very interested in the future.

864
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
Oil provincial, provincial, provincial.

865
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,780
I had a chance, I had a chance, had a chance, had a chance, had a chance.

866
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,460
Chance, chance, chance.

867
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,400
I, um, I.

868
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,240
Oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil, oil.

869
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,620
When things go bad, things go bad.

870
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,580
And that's true.

871
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,980
And when you look at Iraq and the Middle East, I think that that's been the case.

872
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,640
And I'm telling you now that things are getting bad in Iraq, thanks to this new strategy.

873
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,060
And thanks, very frankly, S.S.S.S. Hard, hard, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, take the lives of others.

874
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,500
To seek out and destroy.

875
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,800
Bill Russell, I will get the gates of hell.

876
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,980
Chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty, chitty.

877
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,800
Huckabee, Huckabee.

878
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,700
Toonoo, toonoo, toonoo, toonoo, ham, ham, ham, ham.

879
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,060
This morning, again, early this afternoon.

880
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:56,980
Congratulations.

881
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,780
Thank you.

882
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,360
The first question is, you had a much smaller organ.

883
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,920
How do you think you did it?

884
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,120
About pain.

885
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,760
All this mess we create.

886
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,400
Do you think, uh.

887
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,620
Live free or die.

888
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,420
Die, die.

889
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,200
Unusual, unusual.

890
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,440
You know, there's this sort of myth, um, we might even surprise some gay people in New Hampshire.

891
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,960
Well, you know what, Christian conservatives care about eating gays.

892
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,500
Nasty dumpster diving.

893
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,520
I really did it.

894
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,880
Cut, cut, methamphetamine.

895
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,340
Watch this hand so you don't see what I'm doing with this one.

896
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,160
Deep relationship.

897
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,260
I'm not giving up yet.

898
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,100
My blackberry was lighting up like crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.

899
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,340
Turn it on, turn it on.

900
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,640
Huckabee, Huckabee, Huckabee.

901
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,620
Got that.

902
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,180
Up, up.

903
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,420
Look.

904
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:34,800
Blow.

905
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,340
He put his finger on deep.

906
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,060
I'm ready.

907
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,400
Huckabee understands that.

908
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,180
That's quite bright.

909
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,100
Which candidate would Bob be most interested in today?

910
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,320
Well, President, I'm assuming.

911
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,200
Well, again, the question is, which one would Bob do?

912
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,420
All right, let's answer.

913
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,160
Which candidate would not?

914
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,420
Would Bob not do?

915
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,760
All right, let's go down the list.

916
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,420
I don't have it in front of me.

917
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,900
We have to guess.

918
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,560
We need the list.

919
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,340
Bob loves everyone.

920
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,660
Fred Thompson.

921
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,680
Fred Thompson.

922
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,900
He would not do Fred Thompson.

923
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,840
Absolutely right.

924
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,880
That's what I wanted to know.

925
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,880
All right, there you go.

926
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,100
Because in Kill Them, if you notice carefully what was showing the other night.

927
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,520
The great film Kill Them.

928
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,700
Yes, was playing on the screen a lot the other night at the production.

929
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,380
And in Kill Them is a very young Fred Thompson trying to run over a guy.

930
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,800
And he ultimately gets blown up by a.

931
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,080
By a charge in the hood of the car he's driving around.

932
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,040
Well, that's Hollywood.

933
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,060
Your senator.

934
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,780
He's been busy.

935
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,720
He's an amazing guy.

936
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,740
Lawyer, actor.

937
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:30,620
Liar.

938
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,860
Yeah, amazing guy.

939
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,540
And he's too old for what he's doing.

940
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:34,960
Poor guy.

941
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,260
Yeah, I think he's kind of.

942
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:37,980
Eisenhower.

943
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,440
He's got nothing to worry about.

944
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,380
He's forgetting his lines.

945
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,220
Yeah.

946
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,360
I guess they're hoping he's going to be the new Ronald Reagan.

947
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah.

948
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,420
Oh, yeah.

949
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,400
I think Mr. Romney would love to do that.

950
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,900
Yeah.

951
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,160
The horrible Mormon.

952
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,640
I was.

953
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,040
The handsome guy.

954
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,840
I totally thought it would be Fred Thompson.

955
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,980
But now that we've seen him, he's just.

956
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,720
Yeah, he's not as good as he is on Law and Order.

957
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,740
Too bad the writers.

958
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,140
Like.

959
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:00,980
Nobody's sexy.

960
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,760
Nobody's like.

961
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,200
And Richardson, who I thought would do better because he's actually.

962
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, Huckabee's hick like appeal has proven to be powerful on the Republican side.

963
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,940
They like Huckabee.

964
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:21,120
They like Huckabee more than they like Romney because slick and smooth like Romney is boring compared to Huckabee.

965
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,840
Huckabee's earnest hickitude.

966
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,440
But of course, he's also a horrendous superstitious.

967
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,580
I mean, he's like all the rest of them.

968
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,640
I went about Giuliani today in San Francisco being asked point blank on the news about public funds going to pay for his his tryst.

969
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,400
And he said, no, no, no.

970
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,580
He said all those funds are accounted for.

971
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,080
You could even ask Wendy or whatever his mistress's name.

972
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,100
He's totally out in the open.

973
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,460
You did.

974
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,880
But it was a Judith.

975
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,900
I can't remember her name.

976
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,320
But she's now his wife.

977
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,900
At that time, she was his girlfriend.

978
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,460
That's right.

979
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,540
And he said, well, the city does that.

980
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,020
You know, it's not up to me.

981
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,260
They have to do it.

982
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,920
But I do the same thing with all the people that come up.

983
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:08,260
Weird about Giuliani is how he titters and laughs at every.

984
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:08,780
Oh, I know.

985
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,640
You've seen that.

986
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,460
He's kind of like Bush in his shoulder shrugs.

987
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,580
Giggles and he laughs and he exposes all his teeth.

988
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,100
And then he either answers the question or not.

989
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,740
But he's always tee hee heeing.

990
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,380
When they ask.

991
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,080
Ask him a question.

992
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,100
He's done the drug.

993
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,440
He does it every time.

994
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,040
He's pretty good at these questions.

995
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,780
And of course, the prozac nation that we are, we nod.

996
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,480
Yes, he's laughing.

997
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,640
He must be likable because people that are happy laugh.

998
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,100
Oh, now, with tonight's exciting story, the hair turn.

999
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,160
The soldiers quickly overpowered the loger.

1000
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:42,780
Let me go.

1001
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,260
Hello.

1002
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,120
Got what he was after at the post.

1003
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,260
The loaner held one of the officer's wives.

1004
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,040
Who's that?

1005
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:50,700
Goat.

1006
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,860
She's the scheme and double dealing polecat.

1007
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,960
An unshavery type.

1008
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,080
He is the loan.

1009
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,760
That's right.

1010
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,720
I am there.

1011
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,780
Be here for.

1012
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,900
This is the loan.

1013
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,200
Tonight's story was written by the loan here.

1014
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,800
And edited by Fernanda Nandi Lemur.

1015
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,580
Now, let's drop out for a second with those gigantic.

1016
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,180
Oh,

1017
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm going to go to the

1018
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,080


1019
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,280
I'm going to go to the back.

1020
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,800
Are there any other bands you guys can think of that the church has really

1021
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,220
influenced?

1022
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:55,120
Or even like other artists video wise about stalling, of course, would be the first.

1023
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,540
Just about the first come to mind.

1024
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,920
The guy did the music for the Warner Brothers cartoons.

1025
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,440
You know, Esquivel indirectly influenced.

1026
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,920
Many of us.

1027
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,560
And I heard.

1028
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,780
Bernard Harmon obviously is one of the.

1029
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,840
Are you speaking of things that influence the church or what the church is?

1030
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,300
Yes.

1031
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,240
Speaking of things that influence the church.

1032
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,700
But you're thinking of things that the church.

1033
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,040
The church influence.

1034
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,720
But I actually I like the direction you were also going.

1035
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,960
So what else influenced the church before we get into what the church is?

1036
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,020
Well, of course, more than anything else, all the great world religions.

1037
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,060
All right. You know, Judaism, Zoroastrianism.

1038
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,240
I think he was asking about musical.

1039
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,180
What do I do?

1040
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,760
I'm so religious, artistic.

1041
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,180
I can tell you some really major influences for those of us who worked on the Book of the

1042
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,260
Subgenius and the radio shows and go the Fireside Theater.

1043
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,860
All right.

1044
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,060
So we were all Fireside Theater maniac.

1045
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:52,600
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:58,580
Underground comics like Zap, Robert Crime, Gilbert Shelton, Esquivel.

1047
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,000
Mad.

1048
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,540
Justin Green was my favorite.

1049
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,040
Justin always great.

1050
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,180
What else?

1051
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,940
Well, the Warner Brothers cartoons that we grew up with.

1052
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:15,100
The Three Stooges, Ray Harryhausen, the Secret Teachings of All Ages.

1053
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,980
That's that's all you need to start your own religion.

1054
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,740
The work in general of Stanislaw Zukalski.

1055
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,760
The great Zukalski.

1056
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,080
He's the genius who realized that humanity had been molded by interbreeding with yetis.

1057
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,960
Yetis. Yes.

1058
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,560
And that's who we are.

1059
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,480
We're the result of that interbreeding.

1060
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,680
That's what he was, too.

1061
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:45,240
But in his theory, he thought that the yetinsani or crossbreeds were the bad people.

1062
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,040
Well, we, on the other hand, as subgeniuses,

1063
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,840
believe that they are the ancestors of the subgeniuses and are therefore the good

1064
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,020
rather than the bad eventuation of this interspecies cohabitation.

1065
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,720
Well, that explains everything.

1066
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,100
Well, it's well, almost proto subgenius thought, which is found in many places.

1067
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,560
Carnival freak shows and side shows were very inspiring to many of us.

1068
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,160
We saw our fellow subgeniuses actually

1069
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,040
making a buck.

1070
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,180
Exploiting their abnormality.

1071
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,400
I got to actually meet Priscilla, the monkey girl and her husband, the alligator man.

1072
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,720
Texas State Fair.

1073
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,740
They would come by every year.

1074
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,360
How about Louie Louie, the goat woman?

1075
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,840
We immortalized.

1076
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,000
Gary was so impressed.

1077
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,960
I was so in love with her.

1078
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,320
The state he was in.

1079
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,920
I'm going to go to the other side of the state, but I'm not going to.

1080
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,620
I went.

1081
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,020
I went to the bathroom after Louie Louie.

1082
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,760
The goat woman had been in there and there

1083
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,300
were little pellets in the toilet she'd forgotten to flush.

1084
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,540
It's just like a

1085
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,520
just like a real nanny goat.

1086
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,620
Sometimes guys get really turned on.

1087
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,060
Special head for you.

1088
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,940
Yeah, you're on.

1089
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:11,560
Well, then also there's Chuck McCann and a bunch of great film.

1090
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,200
The Projectionist was what was the early media media barrage.

1091
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,040
It's what we that was.

1092
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,720
Yeah, kill them.

1093
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,400
And media and media barrage.

1094
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,340
And also what was the other one?

1095
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,940
There was a great media barrage in the Monkeys movie Head.

1096
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,000
Right.

1097
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,100
By Jack Nicholson.

1098
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,480
And he's certainly much worse than the plan.

1099
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,300
The writer's base.

1100
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,960
Oh, head head moves fairly fast.

1101
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,620
So with the old diamond writing, that's the only good part.

1102
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,900
Thanks.

1103
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,480
You don't like the time.

1104
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,020
Frank Zappa tells the truth.

1105
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,860
I just saw a thing on YouTube that Rosie sent me with Frank Zappa playing.

1106
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,180
Michael Nesmith and Michael Nesmith playing Zappa.

1107
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,640
And the nose keeps falling off.

1108
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,260
Oh, horrible, horrible, horrible.

1109
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,680
And they're on the set of the Monkeys and they're doing this kind of uncomfortable.

1110
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,540
But they're trying to really send up.

1111
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,580
It's really funny when we're not paying you to watch movies YouTube all night.

1112
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,760
Oh, they are.

1113
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,820
So, yeah, I'm not like Brooker's.

1114
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,200
You're lucky

1115
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,920
the guardians of help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

1116
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,020
At home, in the neighborhood and that school at school.

1117
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,000
To wrap, wrap, wrap.

1118
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,180
To keep all of their body warm.

1119
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,980
Color is good, good, good.

1120
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,140
Learn to jump.

1121
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,600
Get another supply of trouble.

1122
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,300
Oh, no, it was hard.

1123
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,260
Miss May can blow.

1124
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,280
George, you forgot something more important than your handkerchief, hand or food.

1125
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,960
People who put fingers into their mouth come to them.

1126
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,680
Blow George gently.

1127
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:35,980
That's better.

1128
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,180
Oh, and oh, oh, and oh.

1129
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,540
What do you think?

1130
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,380
George, who sent you in here?

1131
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,920
I'm hot. I'm hot.

1132
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,460
George.

1133
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,360
Oh, not so hot.

1134
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,800
No pressure on the opening.

1135
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,760
Oh, you're moistening your lips and hold it under your tongue.

1136
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,300
George came in to see me in bed.

1137
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,720
I do think he'd be more comfortable in bed.

1138
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,440
Well, just a minute. Just a minute.

1139
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,760
It will be better for mother when Joan chooses.

1140
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,660
Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap.

1141
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,260
We need heat. We need rubbers.

1142
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,480
I'm going to visit Duke come often.

1143
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,580
Next morning, father made a box.

1144
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,580
Father made a box.

1145
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,620
And here are new cups spit into the toilet.

1146
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,360
Spitting.

1147
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,220
Keep away from persons with.

1148
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,520
Here, kindergarten children go to the toilet.

1149
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,480
Go to the toilet.

1150
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,480
Now, Joan has a wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap.

1151
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,540
Everyone is having a good time.

1152
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,060
It pays to avoid people with wooden shoes on their doorstep.

1153
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,260
And that's why I can of an Arctic creature, an unknown animal.

1154
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,780
It doesn't a ruminant.

1155
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,280
It swims in the subzero saline waters of the Beaufort Sea.

1156
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,020
Hmm, that's very clear by the thousands.

1157
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,540
The Beaufort Sea.

1158
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,900
The Beaufort.

1159
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,260
The Beaufort was.

1160
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,840
Some people call it Beaufort.

1161
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,140
And a beautiful one it is.

1162
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,380
Speaking of Beaufort.

1163
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:58,760
Glossy skins are valued highly by educated professionals.

1164
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,200
The subgenius foundation got a membership

1165
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:10,460
of application and donation from the town of Beaufort from a man named Robert Dobbs.

1166
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,920
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1167
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,720
Is this.

1168
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:13,220
Yeah.

1169
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:13,800
Coincidence.

1170
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,100
First Robert Dobbs to join the church.

1171
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:17,820
I think that's very significant.

1172
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,040
Man from Beaufort.

1173
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,440
The irony is.

1174
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,320
Beaufort, Michigan.

1175
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,960
Would that be Beaufort, Michigan?

1176
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,340
Beaufort, Kansas or Texas?

1177
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,000
Beaufort, Texas.

1178
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,600
Texas. Beaufort, Peru.

1179
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,780
Peru to you too.

1180
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,740
Beaufort, Beaufort, Peru.

1181
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,360
Oh, well, I'm not sure I understand.

1182
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,020
But it's true.

1183
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,600
Robert Dobbs joined the church of Bob Dobbs.

1184
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,840
Now, do you think that was his real name?

1185
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,900
He actually sent it as 30 bucks.

1186
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,800
Well, it was a credit card order.

1187
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,640
And that does him credit.

1188
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,080
Although you don't have to have the correct name to pass a credit card.

1189
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:53,940
I don't.

1190
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,420
You only need the the number and the expiration date.

1191
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,620
Oh, I'll do a number.

1192
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,500
You can have a.

1193
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,140
So friends, all I need is your your credit card number and your expiration date.

1194
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
We don't need your name.

1195
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,200
I only wanted to help him.

1196
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,100
No one knows his own expiration date.

1197
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,100
I know mine.

1198
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,760
It is not given to know thine own expiration.

1199
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,800
But do you know you're born on day?

1200
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,700
I know what I got.

1201
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,540
I know what I go.

1202
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,260
And do you know your staleness date?

1203
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,240
Do you know what it's you're over the hill?

1204
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,540
Five minutes. There's no more.

1205
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,180
You may not be dead yet, but don't you know what it's like?

1206
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,020
He's like a fork in a.

1207
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,840
He doesn't trust our youth.

1208
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,680
How about your God on too far?

1209
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,980
Our joy are the same ones stamped on my head and pays us.

1210
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,340
But with earth and dust.

1211
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,420
How about you're living on.

1212
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,440
Borrowed time date.

1213
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,200
I'm in the dark.

1214
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,100
It's a moment.

1215
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,360
Half when we remember the challenges of the unknown.

1216
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,760
We're living on borrowed time.

1217
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,740
Shut really the story of our.

1218
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,640
It gives me hope.

1219
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,540
You know, it just makes me remember that, Dr.

1220
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,540
How the challengers of the unknown were living on borrowed time.

1221
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,540
That's right.

1222
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,940
They didn't know who they borrowed it from.

1223
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,760
They don't they didn't know who they were.

1224
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,600
They don't know who we are.

1225
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,700
And I remember that most people know who they are.

1226
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,660
That's why they're unknown.

1227
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,100
They were the challengers of the unknown.

1228
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,760
Very good.

1229
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,780
I guess you guys.

1230
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,440
I don't remember helping.

1231
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,180
Maybe they were out of this room.

1232
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,860
We're going to get it out of here quick before these other fellows.

1233
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,600
We're going to pull the show.

1234
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,260
You have to pull the plug on the show.

1235
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,420
Pull the corners of the show up and fold it in on its own.

1236
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,200
The show over the end of this bag.

1237
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,900
Or I mean, I still feel like a hobo.

1238
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,300
We'll just put it on a stick like a bundle stick.

1239
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,300
OK, then trundle the bundle stick.

1240
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,160
Bundle stick.

1241
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,860
We'll bundle the show up and put it on a bindle stick.

1242
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,220
OK, let's get ready.

1243
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,360
But from this earth, this grave, this dust.

1244
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,240
Bob Dobbs is going up in triumph.

1245
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,460
I trust it's goodbye from all of us to all of me.

1246
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,140
Goodbye.

1247
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,680
The puzzling evidence show of KPFA and Berkeley recorded last December and

1248
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,980
finally hauled away by Dr. Philo Drummond, Dr.

1249
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,200
Gary Debrogue fan, puzzling evidence, Dr.

1250
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:29,980
Howe, Leslie, a girl, a K-Rob, Bishop Joey and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1251
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,920
The background music is the great Rudy Schwartz Project.

1252
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,900
You are listening to the Hour of Slack from

1253
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,580
the Church of the Subgenius, praise Bob.

1254
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:52,260
Subgenius.com, Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 4411A.

1255
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,160
Now, what do you want me to do with the cash, Bob?

1256
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,960
You know what's to be done with it.

1257
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,960
Food and warm clothes and

1258
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,840
the long

1259
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,160
chair.

1260
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,020
The story you have just heard is the long chair.

1261
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,600
Thank God the president may stink,

1262
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,840
but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday.

1263
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,380
And everywhere I spread my seat, I know I'm leaving a little bit of that

1264
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,020
gland of Bob, that gland that we all carry and you can bring out that gland

1265
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,460
and more of these the more these special little bibles and little translations we

1266
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,400
have that are the only.

1267
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,040
And they'll bring out that Bob gland in you that will make success come your way.

1268
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,340
It will change the way the luck plane works for you.

1269
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:53,520
I mean, the the the way the patterns in the special formulas and the way it all works

1270
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,180
in the universe, the way it's all put together in a special mathematical way by

1271
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:00,840
who knows what all and and no one can decode it.

1272
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:08,680
But we can sure make it work our way if we just if we just cleave to Bob, cleave to to

1273
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,720
the words of Bob and the foundation that's trying to help Bob and his ministers.

1274
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,600
You cannot help Bob without helping the ministers of Bob.

1275
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,220
Praise the Lord.

1276
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,000
It feels all right. Oh, yes.

1277
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,400
Put your hands up.

1278
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,420
It's through Dobbs.

1279
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,120
Through Dobbs.

1280
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,240
Who is who is.

1281
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,300
The truth about Bob.

1282
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,640
That's my feelings about him.

1283
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,120
There he is.

1284
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,000
The truth about true feelings about him.

1285
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,680
Absolutely. I love Bob and I think Bob lives in all of us.

1286
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,360
Nice.

1287
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:49,480
So, Bob, don't get serious about Dobbs.

1288
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,120
Don't get serious about Dobbs.

1289
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,220
Fuck Bob.

1290
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,640
Fuck Bob.

1291
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,220
Fuck Bob.

1292
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,240
Fuck Bob.

1293
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,140
No. No.

1294
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,760
What's the trick you're going to show us this time, Blackstone?

1295
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,660
Well, now all you need is to show us.

1296
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:09,700
Here's a quarter. Well, here's one.

1297
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,400
Lay two matches side by side about four inches apart.

1298
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,000
Right there on the table.

1299
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,880
Done. Now, Rola, take the coin very slowly.

1300
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,980
Here it goes.

1301
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,400
Slowly, slowly.

1302
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,720
Well, nothing happened. Do it slowly.

1303
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:25,840
Easily.

1304
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,400
Here it goes again.

1305
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,980
Slowly, slowly.

1306
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,480
It doesn't work.

1307
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,920
Well, here's a half dollar.

1308
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,400
Just give me that coin.

1309
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,080
Now watch.

1310
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,300
This is Blackstone.

1311
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:38,900
I'm going to fight it out.

1312
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:38,900


1313
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:38,900


1314
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:38,900


1315
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:38,900


1316
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,060
I'm wrapin' it up for you.

1317
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,060


1318
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,060


1319
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,280
Nobody's gonna get too high or anything.

1320
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,280


1321
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,280


1322
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:39,280


1323
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,380


1324
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,380


1325
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:39,380


1326
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,420
It'll just be a second, then.

1327
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,420


1328
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,420


1329
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,420


1330
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,420


1331
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,460
Maybe.

1332
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:40,460


1333
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:40,460


1334
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:40,460
