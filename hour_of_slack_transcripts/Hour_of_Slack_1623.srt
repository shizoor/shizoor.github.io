00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
E.B. Slash

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,420
Worshombie

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Bart, give me my hand

4
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,100
No

5
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,080
Thank you, Bart

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,300
Oh, I'm so late

7
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,940
I'm so very, very late

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,040
Well, no wonder you're late

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,960
Why, this park is exactly two days full

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,740
Nine

11
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,840
Nine

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,080
Eight

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:23,600
Seven

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:24,640
Six

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,100
Five

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,780
Five

17
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,400
Four

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,340
And six

19
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,420
Five

20
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,180
Four

21
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,920
Three

22
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,020
Two

23
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,120
Three

24
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,320
Two

25
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,420
One

26
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,600
Bob?

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,560
See you, Bob

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,720
13 reporting

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,600
Everyone, please, this is the end of the partner

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:04,600


31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:04,600


32
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,980
뿌

33
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,800
Because of fact that the對啊

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:26,100
You returns

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,080


36
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,100
you

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,540
Some scientists were experimenting with Bob.

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,000
That was by Fernanda Nandeli-Murrer.

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,240
Before that, a piece by Artemia Salina.

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,700
Authorization denied.

41
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,560
I am the guardian of the river.

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,700
I am the bursar of Dumpstown.

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,300
I am the bursar of Dumpstown.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,800
I am the bursar of Dumpstown.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Mr. Sheehy.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,100
There will be no subcutaneous violence here tonight in the halls of separation

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,700
where all of the among us have met.

48
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,760
There are so many here.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,080
I can't believe it.

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,020
I can see their faces gleaming in the dark as if they were wearing their own hats.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,340
And I can just see my fingers passing very, very lightly over these pages.

52
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,100
And I don't look good.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,140
This show is in Braille tonight.

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,580
So we went up the hill to the church that the old man had built.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,120
Yes, it was an exquisite little building on the side of the cliff overlooking the ocean.

56
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,440
Only to be shot down by the song.

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,940
And it's deadly, the cynical.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:08,880
And it's deadly, the cynical.

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,860
Raising up of the eggheads.

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,620
Directing your dreams.

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,300
Arranging your dream world.

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,500
Now, please have your dream world arranged as you enter the show.

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,600
Look, there's monks on TV that are setting themselves on fire trying to stop the show.

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,020
Human sacrifices won't stop them, folks.

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,940
That's what the Aztecs were doing.

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,420
They were trying to stop it for real on the show.

67
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Oh, now.

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,180
Okay, maybe the song has died now.

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,340
I don't know.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,200
Can you hear the song behind?

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,480
A pop song?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,220
I can hear the song.

73
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,460
A polished AM style talk show theme.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,820
Can you still hear the song right there?

75
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
Or has the song died?

76
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,680
Was the song carried out of the bomb shelter looking blue with an oxygen mask over its face?

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,300
And maybe one of its sons is dead.

78
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,020
Yes, this could be you shuffling from universe to universe

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,760
with a big, happy, sleepy, goofy-looking grin on your face.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,940
Transcending the limits of the astral plane.

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,520
And now we have a special announcement.

82
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,880
Drugs!

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,220
What did they give you?

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:19,660
Thorazine?

85
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,240
Haldol?

86
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,960
How much?

87
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,320
How much?

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,480
Learn your drugs.

89
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,100
Know your doses.

90
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,660
Elementary.

91
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,880
We're talking about the secret amendments to your constitution.

92
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,620
Make sure it don't stop.

93
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,460
The amendments made while you were sleeping somewhere.

94
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,020
Off slack lustered in your bed.

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,700
Look at your insignificant little...

96
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,700


97
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,700


98
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,740
Look at your insignificant little...

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,660
...rebellion Skywalker.

100
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,380
What happened to our insignificant little rebellion?

101
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,440
For crying out loud.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,580
Geez, they just swept that under the media rugs.

103
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,340
All your friends would soon be dead.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,720
Or sleeping soundly.

105
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,460
Looking comatose with their feet up in the air.

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,520
La la da da.

107
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
La da da da.

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

110
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,780
When I walked you home the other night.

111
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,960
I wanted so much to hold you tight.

112
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,220
But I was relax-ful.

113
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,120
Relax-ful Bob.

114
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,820
They call me.

115
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,980
They call me.

116
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,000
I saw the love light.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She yawning in your eye.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I wanted so much to be your guy.

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,440
But I was relax-ful.

120
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,240
Relax-ful Bob.

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,740
They call me.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
They call me.

123
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,680
Relax-ful Bob.

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,760
Will you ever change?

125
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,020
Will you ever grow up and lose your relax-ful name?

126
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,260
You're missing lots of love and lots of kissing too.

127
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,520
From Judy, Joyce and Mary.

128
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,080
From Peggy Sue.

129
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
From Mary and Peggy Sue.

130
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,580
I was going with the girl's head on a plate.

131
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,700
He's trying to get a body for the head of his fiancee.

132
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,880
So he has to freak with these sleazy strip keys clubs.

133
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,360
And he brings these bimbos home.

134
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,460
We'll may distract the audience into believing that the song has stopped.

135
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,360
But it isn't.

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,760
In reality it keeps on going.

137
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,000
You know we tried to cripple it.

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
Nobody knows the words to it.

139
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,220
My grandfather knew the words.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,100
But he's dead now.

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,880
They say aliens dropped the song here trying to get rid of it.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,260
They damaged the song.

143
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,500
But it just hid in a hole until it healed.

144
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,340
Then it came back louder than ever and hurt everybody's ears again.

145
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,020
When they pulled the plug on it it just thundered along but never quite got down.

146
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,480
It just turned into sort of an acoustic song.

147
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,600
So they gave up on that.

148
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,960
But it still walks the earth.

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,840
Roaming the countryside.

150
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,420
Shambling about like a swan.

151
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:53,420


152
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,380
Like some hideous zombie.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,620
Never knowing where it'll go next.

154
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
And there it goes.

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,980
The show.

156
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
Shambling down Main Street.

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,160
Your town.

158
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,420
That's a bully shoot at it with a knife.

159
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,000
Because it refuses to die.

160
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,860
Maybe that's the show's.

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
That might be the show's theme song.

162
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,420
That refuses to die.

163
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,960
Maybe how when the show moves the wind blows.

164
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,240
Like the show the song is an ancient animal.

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,240
It extends back to the time of Pangea.

166
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:33,720
When all of the planets and all of the earth's continents were one giant single continent.

167
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,700
A place of paradise and harmony where all creatures lived together.

168
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,640
Worshipping the song because it still extended back that far.

169
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,500
Into the one world land.

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,100
The dreamy paradise.

171
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,300
True greatness of the continent of Pangea.

172
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,220
Which was the prototype of it.

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,540
Mew.

174
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,100
Hey what's that knocking at the door?

175
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,340
Oh my god don't let it in.

176
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,420
Don't don't don't let it in.

177
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
It's the song.

178
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,860
Oh my god it's Roam the Countryside.

179
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,560
It's back now.

180
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,340
Tell your kids to stay away from it.

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't worry about your neighborhood.

182
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,700
Property values go back up after the song leaves.

183
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,880
Yeah you hope.

184
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,740
You wish.

185
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,720
But the song it just never stops.

186
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,840
It just keeps going.

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,220
Sometimes the only lyrics to the song are the lyrics to the song.

188
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,220


189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,220


190
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,640
Where thousands of people in torment scream.

191
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,820
Do they still have the Kennedy car?

192
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,720
I didn't see the Kennedy car the last four times I've seen it.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,320
It never stops.

194
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,040
Where's the Kennedy car?

195
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,360
They've got the hip hop and the hot rod.

196
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:34,760
The Kennedy car.

197
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,820
But they don't have the Kennedy car.

198
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,800
Even when the DJ tries to pull it out of the mix the song just keeps on going.

199
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,340
It just keeps dropping.

200
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,480
They got their motion activated marking guards though.

201
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,660
Hey Overman this guy misplaced the caller.

202
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,540
Uh oh.

203
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,580
They have the horizontal.

204
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,520
I would speculate that the song kidnapped him.

205
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,040
Many a chance.

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,940
I took it to another channel on your mixer there.

207
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,240
Try another channel.

208
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,960
Try the A channel.

209
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,380
Which generates up to 50,000 volts.

210
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,180
Is the song.

211
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,360
Is the caller there?

212
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,500
Caller are you there?

213
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,680
Is the song with you?

214
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,980
The legendary rock hard abs.

215
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,300
In six minutes.

216
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,980
Maybe if you don't move the song will be at least a little bit merciful on you.

217
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,360
Yes with the ultimate nutrition pack you rub the oil of origin into your ears.

218
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,760
Don't move.

219
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,040
Don't move.

220
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,840
You'll be just an empty husk when the song sucks the life out of you.

221
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:20,840


222
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


224
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


225
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


226
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


227
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


228
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


229
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


230
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


231
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:20,960


232
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,880
The results will delight and depress you.

233
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,660
How can you kill a song that's already dead that's the real question.

234
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,940
It shambles on with an unholy life of its own.

235
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,280
It's lived for centuries and it can't stop killing.

236
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,100
Strap yourselves in folks and take a journey into the unknown.

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,660
Now, friends, what's coming up.

238
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,060
You may have seen ads for send in your song and we'll turn it into a record.

239
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:02,440
Our friend John Truby saw that ad, and he wrote this song and sent it in there, and they turned it into this record.

240
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,500
I got high last night on LSD

241
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,360
My mind was beautiful and I was free

242
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Warts love my nipples because they are pink

243
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,800
Vomit on me, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

244
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,700
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he is blind

245
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,320
It's a wreck because he is blind

246
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,260
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he's blind

247
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,660
It's a wreck because he's blind

248
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,540
Let's make love under the stars

249
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,980
And watch for UFOs

250
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,060
If little baby Martians come out of the UFOs

251
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,440
And fuck them, yeah, yeah, yeah

252
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,820
The zebra spilled his plastina on Venus

253
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,460
And the gelatin fingers oozed electric marbles

254
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,980
Ramona's titties died in hell

255
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,440
And the Nazis want to kill

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
And the Nazis want to kill

257
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,040
To kill everyone

258
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,380
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he's blind

259
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,160
A blind man's penis is a wreck because he's blind

260
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,480
It's a wreck because he's blind

261
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,780
It's a wreck because he's blind

262
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,480
I'm celebrating May Day now. This is the International Workers' Day.

263
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,200
And you guys are just too freaking bourgeois for me.

264
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
I'm a wobbly stank.

265
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
I know, I know you are.

266
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,500
I respect that.

267
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,700
I respect that.

268
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,520
I remember old Joe Hill and everything.

269
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,060
I know, I know. I respect that.

270
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
Yeah, you guys died for our sins.

271
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,280
And then they took six guys out.

272
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,560
Go to the basement.

273
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Us 70s drug brothers are really into what you wobblies did for us, man.

274
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,680
I told them.

275
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,040
Those guys died or something for something, man.

276
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,840
These arse-fits-boozies are like, screwed, man.

277
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,960
Go to the basement level and let them in.

278
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,440
We're the man's little bitch, dude.

279
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,560
Go to the basement.

280
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,260
We're all the man's little bitch.

281
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,360
Get down in there, boss.

282
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,620
He's got his keys and his signs, man.

283
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,820
His stop signs.

284
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,900
Come on, stank.

285
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,340
He's got a control thing, man.

286
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,300
And they've got this machine where they can tell if you're thinking or not.

287
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,440
They've got a TV.

288
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,660
And if it's off, you're guilty, man.

289
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,160
Mom?

290
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,480
Dad?

291
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
Kids with drugs.

292
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,820
Every day.

293
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,440
So ask them.

294
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,160
What?

295
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,680
Where?

296
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,320
When?

297
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
It's pestering.

298
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,340
Sponsored by the Office of Drug-Free America.

299
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,480
Now, a ranch has got 800 head of cattle.

300
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,000
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.

301
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,360
The other half loses 20 pounds.

302
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,420
On the way to market, each one loses 50 pounds.

303
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,060
The other half loses 700 pounds.

304
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,620
All right, son.

305
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,440
How much does a herd weigh?

306
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Paul, I'm glad those two robbers hit my head on that road.

307
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,280
Each one weighs 20 pounds.

308
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,640
Paul?

309
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:12,980
Hmm?

310
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,540
I don't think too bad.

311
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,680
I came to help.

312
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,440
Half the herd weighs 50 pounds.

313
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,760
The herd weighs 700 pounds.

314
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
I don't know.

315
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
For it never sleeps or lies idle.

316
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,880
Every filament of it always working.

317
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,200
It's never at conflict with itself over such human considerations as honor or love or pity.

318
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,860
From now on,

319
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,500
you will answer the question.

320
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,220
From now on, you are...

321
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,660
But the Krells forgot one thing.

322
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,140
...to work in the uranium mines.

323
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,760
Monsters taught.

324
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,640
Monsters from the Id.

325
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,200
Making reduced plutonium.

326
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
Monsters from the Id?

327
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,040
Oh, I can't wait for X-Day when the monsters from the Id come to raging life

328
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,800
and your hormonal unconscious comes belching and erupting up with living beings.

329
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,560
Your very fantasies of beautiful women, men, monstrous aliens,

330
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:15,840
and...

331
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,360
All will become real.

332
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,500
Real to the pink next door.

333
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,400
Who will flee in terror but he can never escape.

334
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,580
Because he's in your nightmare now.

335
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,020
He's in your nightmare.

336
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,500
Because it's X-Day.

337
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,760
X-Day.

338
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,680
And you paid your dues.

339
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,300
And Bob will save...

340
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,180
Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.

341
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,540
...the mechanics to save any man.

342
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:45,260
Yet to save his own precious bodily juices as they flow freely from his neck and his thigh muscles.

343
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,500
He is a man on a mission and I dare not say what kind of recalcified mission that might be.

344
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,260
He's an emissionary.

345
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,960
He is the emissionary.

346
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,380
Don't be proud of his technological terror you can stop now.

347
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,600
He is the spermatic royal.

348
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,620
He is the king of squids.

349
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,600
You and your aliens can never defeat us, Bob.

350
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820
You and your squids, your gigantic prairie squid army, can never live forever.

351
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,240
I trust you know how to cure the subcutaneous impurities.

352
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,380
Your mind is going to be going soon.

353
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,580
I hope you know at least where you are now, Dr. Stang.

354
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,900
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.

355
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,500
Take the red, white, and blue pill.

356
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,480
Earthman.

357
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Wonder if there are any other words that rhyme with pill.

358
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,080
Pew.

359
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,960
Pew pew pew pew.

360
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,820
Pew.

361
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:42,860
Pew.

362
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,520
Pew.

363
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,360
Pew pew pew pew.

364
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,120
Pew.

365
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,240


366
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
Pew pew pew pew.

367
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,520
Pew.

368
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,260
Pew pew pew pew.

369
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,980
Pew.

370
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,720
Pew.

371
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,520
Pew pew pew pew.

372
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,320
Pew.

373
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,860
Pew.

374
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,640
Pew pew pew.

375
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,700
Pew.

376
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,220
Pew.

377
00:15:59,860 --> 00:15:59,860


378
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,680
Pew.

379
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,720
Pew.

380
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Pew.

381
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:04,400


382
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:04,900
Pew.

383
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:04,900


384
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:04,900


385
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,980
Pew.

386
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,060
Pew...

387
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,900
I don nonsense.

388
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
My name's John, and I'm writing this mandarin out to make my blood boil fast and

389
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,220


390
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,940
Here are a few limericks that I wrote.

391
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,520
There once was a girl named Donna who liked to smoke that guano.

392
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,300
And now she's scooping marijuana.

393
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,300
There once was a guy named Dent.

394
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,520
Let me tell you a story about Bill.

395
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,780
There once was a guy named Blue.

396
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,760
Sponsored by the Partnership for a Free America.

397
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,360
At 17, I knew too much to listen to the wise.

398
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,500
The world of hippies beckoned and I joined the rebels' cries that said,

399
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,720
Tune in, turn on, drop out, see how free you'll be.

400
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,580
Now I'm an abject slave to what they said would set me free.

401
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,740
My God, my eager hopes and dreams have wound up unharmed.

402
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,120
They're all on the shelf.

403
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,100
And I'm no good to anyone, least of all myself.

404
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,360
In this mad dream to find myself in pot and LSD,

405
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,940
I'm shackled beyond hope to what they said would set me free.

406
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,960
My life's become a living hell.

407
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,900
I beg and rob and steal.

408
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,600
Somehow, I can no longer tell the fancy

409
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,700
from the real.

410
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,820
I may have killed.

411
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,800
I just don't know.

412
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,060
A soul gone blind can't see.

413
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,240
A heartless, mindless slave

414
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,420
to what will never set me free.

415
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,620
I sometimes think I feel my mother's warm and loving hand

416
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,360
come through a psychedelic fog,

417
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,960
but like the rest,

418
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,740
it's just a dream.

419
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,100
I'm in a world of mescaline and pot and LSD.

420
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,400
And link by link, it's forged a chain

421
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,480
that's made a slave of me.

422
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,300
The devil's strumming on my nerves

423
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,920
and fires within me rage.

424
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
My tortured mind so gone,

425
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,120
I can't recall for sure my age.

426
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,780
I think I'm 22.

427
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,860
I know I won't reach 23.

428
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:58,020
But hell can be no worse than what is made a slave of me.

429
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,020
Fear.

430
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,000
Fear.

431
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Fear.

432
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


433
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


434
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


435
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


436
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


437
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


438
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


439
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:08,720


440
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,020
al des grbec.

441
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,140
The fear attracts the fearful.

442
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,120
The strong.

443
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,300
The weak.

444
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,320
The innocent.

445
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,280
Slack is the mind killer of the mind.

446
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,180
I must not slack.

447
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,640
Slack is the killer of the mind.

448
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,000
Slack is the killer of the mind.

449
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,960
I must not slack.

450
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,900
I must not mind.

451
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
I don't mind.

452
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,840
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

453
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,960
Wake up, wake up,

454
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,000
Welcome to another world.

455
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,900
You ass-nater!

456
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,220
I shouldn't have taken that other half!

457
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,060
Don't worry, my friend, you didn't take the other half.

458
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,640
The other half is waiting for you here.

459
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,260
It took me!

460
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,980
In the bottom of the mind.

461
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,440
Look, look, look!

462
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,660
It's a shadow of your own face.

463
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,400
It's a reflection of your own mind.

464
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,060
Look, friend, it's you!

465
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,940
You're staring blankly, mutely into the...

466
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,400
dark horizon and see nothing but that...

467
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,560
slap-shot, slap-shot face.

468
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,820
You must!

469
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,780
That face!

470
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,980
That face!

471
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,780
I've seen it before.

472
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,580
I think I...

473
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,200
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

474
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,380
Never mind.

475
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,580
My mind is not my mind!

476
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
I'm aboard, kiddo!

477
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,220
Like slack, popper, booper, popper,

478
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,980
eeper, eeper, bleeper,

479
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,360
rattle on its way,

480
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,700
convo, bound, points unknown!

481
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,740
Out aboard!

482
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,340
Never mind!

483
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,400
My mind is no longer my friend!

484
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

485
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,860
Do you mind having things taken

486
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,900
and placed where you can't find them?

487
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas ever!

488
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
Hey man, hey man, do you think people are gonna think,

489
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,820
do you think people are gonna think,

490
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,800
do you think people are gonna think I'm, I'm, I'm...

491
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,300
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,520
Are you on one, dear?

493
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,140
You feel persecuted, left alone.

494
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,420
I'm repeating, we're not in Kansas anymore.

495
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,460
I'm being locked there!

496
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,160
Are you on one?

497
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,260
Yes you are, a fabulous eight-hour day,

498
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
chained to this machine!

499
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,720
You will see the way, as void.

500
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,660
This is not the true void.

501
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,980
You can know that which does not exist.

502
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,080
That is the void.

503
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,540
It is not included in man's knowledge.

504
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,260
The inscription on the wooden post reads,

505
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,280
In the void, sharp and sharp,

506
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,900
and strong, it can be used to cut, sack, and stick priests. This is not the true void. Of course,

507
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:02,460
the void is nothingness. A long-armed monkey holding a rope in his left hand to bind evil

508
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,480
and a sword in his right hand. He sits in flames, reaching out for a reflection of the moon on

509
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,740
water. There is the true void. In this, dreaming in heaven is where there is nothing. That is the

510
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:27,360
void. Must be the void. The Void by Reverend Cobblestone. And before that, Buck Ritchie did

511
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:36,980
The Slave. There is a place that I often find myself at and uh... Oh yeah? In your dreams? Yes.

512
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,540
No, I am a floating spirit without entrails, without a need for

513
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,720
anything. I am a floating spirit without entrails, without a need for anything.

514
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,860
Ingestion or digestion? It depends. You go to bed looking at a book with pictures of

515
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,280
insects and you can have insects in your dream. You can direct what you do by...

516
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,320
That is true. Just before you go to bed. That is true. That's probably why I always dream about,

517
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,740
have dreams about women. Yes, if you go to sleep looking at voluptuous imagery,

518
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,180
then that will percolate through your dream. That makes a lot of sense now.

519
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,740
Cause and effect, so to speak.

520
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,440
Could be. Could be. Could be. Yep. Uh, well, of course...

521
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
Do you believe that you can change your dream by your diet?

522
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:29,700
Much to regret in our pasts unless we are condemned to relive certain incidents over and over.

523
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,800
But... That's what we have F.R.O.P. for.

524
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,120
Yo-Yo... Yes. Well, that's another superstition.

525
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,720
Some people believe that F.R.O.P. suppresses dreams, but it does not. It simply makes you sleep more soundly so you don't tend to wake up.

526
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,200
And remember your dreams. But you have them all the same.

527
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,360
If you don't have them, you start losing your mental health very quickly.

528
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Yeah, you still get your REMs, is what you mean, right?

529
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,180
You still get the byproduct which the brain wants, and that's the rapid eye movements.

530
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,820
You get the flushing out of the repressed psychic substratum.

531
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,660
Sort of like... The flushing of the mental O.G.M.

532
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,700
It's sort of like driving your mom's Dodge Dart 63 Dodge Dart backwards around in a circle in the park.

533
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,800
You have to wind the miles off of it.

534
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,380
But your brain has to do that every night.

535
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,200
It does that when your eyeballs are blinking.

536
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
Rapidly blinking.

537
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,700
They sound like this.

538
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,800
You don't know they sound like that because you can't see them.

539
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,820
Because you're asleep. You're sleeping.

540
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,860
So you don't know you're actually doing that.

541
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,280
People are watching you do it. They're sitting there laughing. They're holding their guns and they're laughing. They're going, ha ha ha.

542
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,420
You are such an idiot. Look at that idiot.

543
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,500
They're looking at you and they're taunting you. They're making fun of you.

544
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,240
And they know that you're laying there. You can't hear them because you're sleeping.

545
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,860
You should ask the protection of Saint Pedro of Penelope.

546
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,260
Then before you wake up, they leave.

547
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,560
Really? And then Saint Pedro would just do a mechano.

548
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,360
He might just do that.

549
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,060
So that later on they can show you those pictures and play you those tapes.

550
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,840
And you can then feel stupid.

551
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,960
So stupid.

552
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Listen to what the...

553
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,660
The price is yours.

554
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,680
Obey me and live or disobey and die.

555
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,240
I'm... I don't want to wake up. I don't want to wake up.

556
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,480
I don't want to wake up.

557
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,880
I'm trying to...

558
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,440
Get those shoulders up in the air. Look directly at the face of his beatitude.

559
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,580
I can't.

560
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,620
Look at him.

561
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,880
I can't bear to look at him.

562
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,640
Obey. Obey.

563
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,660
I cannot gaze upon him.

564
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,420
Obey.

565
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,200
I'll be blind.

566
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,180
He is too beautiful to gaze upon.

567
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,640
Never mind the brilliance.

568
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,600
For in the light is where the signals and signs come into the inner ear of your vapid brain.

569
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,960
I feel shame before him.

570
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes, you do.

571
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,020
You've been a bad man, haven't you?

572
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,560
I was afraid of him.

573
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,980
You were afraid.

574
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,140
I saw him.

575
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,260
You detested him.

576
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,660
The man with the pipe.

577
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,060
Yes.

578
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,360
Surely you can't be serious.

579
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,640
I am serious.

580
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:03,960
True.

581
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,220
And don't call me Shirley.

582
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,540
It happened though.

583
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:06,940
Yes.

584
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,540
But it is true.

585
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,780
Yes, you were envious of him.

586
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,120
You must believe me.

587
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,360
You looked at his nozzle.

588
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,280
You said if only the Lord had provided me with a Winchester like this, I could fly with the duck vehicles.

589
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,360
I could live.

590
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,040
I was.

591
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,260
I was.

592
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:20,840
Escape.

593
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
No escape for you, my friend.

594
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,660
You're stuck here.

595
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,540
I'm staying.

596
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,980
Unplug me then.

597
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,400
I'm staying.

598
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,640
Unplug me.

599
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,160
Quiet, man.

600
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,420
I'm trying to get the plugs out.

601
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:31,960
Take drugs, Danny.

602
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,500
Why are you doing this to me?

603
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,460
Bring around the fizz water.

604
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,240
Come on.

605
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,060
We got to get him out of here.

606
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,460
Look at that stuff coming out of his ears.

607
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,380
Oh, my God.

608
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,940
I think they really got him this time.

609
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Oh, man.

610
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,140
They put Stonky and George in Daniel Bush's prison camp and licking him now.

611
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,840
Authorization denied.

612
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,660
My God.

613
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,780
Why hast thou forsaken me?

614
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,860
They turned a political and religious priest into an American in 2005.

615
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,260
Oh, man.

616
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,840
This is sick.

617
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,660
Look at all the welts on his neck.

618
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,800
Somebody's been sucking his ear.

619
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,300
I think.

620
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,320
Authorization denied.

621
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,860
I know.

622
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,620
The mask is a thing.

623
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,700
Authorization denied.

624
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm going to go to jail.

625
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


626
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


627
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


628
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


629
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


630
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,100


631
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Everyone has different dreams.

632
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:14,900
Authorization denied.

633
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,960
The past does not hope.

634
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,420
Authorization denied.

635
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Change in the air.

636
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,720
Authorization denied.

637
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,060
Authorization denied.

638
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,300
Authorization denied.

639
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,260
Demons.

640
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,480
Authorization denied.

641
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,700
Demons.

642
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,200
Man, I just can't get it up.

643
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,480
This just ain't doing it for me.

644
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,440
I am the king of the world forever.

645
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,160
You need one of these.

646
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,740
I mean, it hurts, but not enough to come.

647
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,360
You know what I mean?

648
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,360
Well, try one of these.

649
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,400
Check it out.

650
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,760
Oh.

651
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,860
Look at the little spindle here.

652
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,080
Directly.

653
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


654
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


655
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


656
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


657
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


658
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


659
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,080


660
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,800
Red, white, and blue pills?

661
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,500
Well, these are more than red, white, and blue pills.

662
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,020
These actually make the whole thing go.

663
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,000
You know what I'm saying?

664
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,580
Oh, it's like a little tiny world inside that pill.

665
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,720
Yeah.

666
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,940
Don't stare too hard.

667
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
You might get sucked right in there.

668
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,820
Just rub it very gently on your lower parts.

669
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,300
Oh, yeah.

670
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,320
Not those parts.

671
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,700
Hey, more of them kind pills, Dave?

672
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,160
Yeah.

673
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,340
I've got a whole bag here.

674
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,320
Oh, man.

675
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,720
Those pills feel good all over my body.

676
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,080
I've never had one of these.

677
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,340
I've never had one of these.

678
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,060
I've never had one of these.

679
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,060


680
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,060


681
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,060


682
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,060


683
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,860
These are the only red pills you could wear.

684
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,840
Are you who?

685
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,140
Can I try one?

686
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,160
The pills that worked on the outside instead of the inside.

687
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,700
Remember that old weird Coddy song?

688
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,000
Whoa.

689
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:19,440
Yeah.

690
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,900
Hey, your molecules are starting to evaporate.

691
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,780
The inside is bigger than the outside.

692
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,520
It's expanding.

693
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,760
It's out of focus.

694
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,680
It's rising up.

695
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,100
I know.

696
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,360
I know.

697
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:30,740
It's inflating.

698
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,080
Can you adjust the horizontal or something?

699
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,120
Here, let me try this little knob over here.

700
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,960
Sure, sure.

701
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,640
One soul per breath.

702
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,980
It seems to be, I don't know.

703
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,040
I don't know.

704
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,040


705
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,040


706
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,740
Grab the knob down there.

707
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,360
You want a fabulous eight hour day.

708
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,400
Give it a good old tweak.

709
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,960
Hey, try it.

710
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,780
How many still?

711
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,580
Thanks for the iron lung, Bob.

712
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,640
Totally destroyed.

713
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,080
Oh, man.

714
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,380
Now he's growing an iron lung out of the side of his neck.

715
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,300
Huh?

716
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,760
Don't pass out on me yet.

717
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

718
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:58,860
not yet.

719
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,680
Not yet.

720
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,940
Don't pass out on me yet, you rock noinker.

721
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,440
You rock noinker.

722
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,580
You have a frag-

723
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,360
There is infinite power in the red, white, and blue pill.

724
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,020
You rock noinker.

725
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,020


726
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,020


727
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,960
You are invincible once you take the red, white, and blue pill.

728
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,120
You can only see fields of green and the waves.

729
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,660
The balloon has gone up.

730
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
Hit the playground.

731
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,820
You can only see F6 and 14.

732
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,820
You are clear to hit the playground.

733
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,240
You can only see an M14 or 16.

734
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,920
After the playground.

735
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,740
You know the numbers.

736
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,480
Move on towards Disneyland.

737
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,640
It is time to provide drugs for the citizens.

738
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,260
Drugs for citizens are more important than community responsibility.

739
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,240
Citizens need drugs, not just a profit.

740
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,940
It is time to stand up on the table and most of all stand on the disabled low-income children

741
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,000
for the proposition.

742
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:02,760
The basic right to disrupt unacceptable reality is essential for all of our citizens.

743
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,020
Thank you all.

744
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,320
Keep up the good drugs.

746
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:08,620


747
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:08,620


748
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:08,900
Really?

749
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,740
Or zombie?

750
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,180
Bob give me my hand.

751
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,760
No.

752
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,660
Thank you Bob.

753
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Expensive secret.

754
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,360
Come on.

755
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,840
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

756
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

757
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,380
Dangerous.

758
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,940
Ridiculous.

759
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,100
More and more goodness.

760
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,660
More and more goodness.

761
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,320
More and more goodness.

762
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320


763
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320


764
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320


765
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,320


766
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:25,340
Brain.

767
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,500
Heart.

768
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,560
Liver.

769
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,040
They're in your sink.

770
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,320
Kids sniff.

771
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,820
Research shows that one in six 8th graders has sniffs.

772
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,880
Protect your sniffs.

773
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,260
Thanks.

Chris.

776
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,720
Chris.

777
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:55,880
Chris.

778
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,400
Chris, it sounds very different from, uh...

779
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,140
Chris.

780
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,280
Well,

781
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,220
Christmas

782
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,960
has other meanings, hasn't it, Bob?

783
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,100
Bob.

784
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,320
Don't do that!

785
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,460
I'm not resisting arrest, sir.

786
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,320
But you are resisting your bowels,

787
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:43,740
aren't you?

788
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,800
You argue with your body, don't you, Stan?

789
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,740
And you continue to believe

790
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,400
that you do a radio show

791
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,520
rather than a radio show does you.

792
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,360
It won't let go.

793
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,000
It's hard.

794
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,520
It pulls.

795
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,240
It pulls.

796
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,400
And then it tightens it up.

797
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,320
And then it...

798
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,080
And then I think it's gonna let go

799
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,960
right when I can't...

800
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
Just right in front of everybody.

801
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,440
You never know when it's just gonna go.

802
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,260
Yeah, that's right. You never know.

803
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,280
Because there's nothing you know.

804
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
Freaking out, man.

805
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,180
I shouldn't have took that other half.

806
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,340
Crime doesn't pay.

807
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:23,760
Okay.

808
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,160
Mom was right.

809
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,880
I thought I was gonna be cool.

810
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,660
Stop cutting back, sir.

811
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,940
Will you have your miracle this year, children?

812
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,640
Will this be the year

813
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
you have your miracle?

814
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,780
Stan, Chaz,

815
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,660
don't you guys think sometimes

816
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,880
that X Day's redundant?

817
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,700
I'm talking about X Day.

818
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,340
Well, even if the thing

819
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,920
is the 4th of July redundant...

820
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,980
I'm talking about the party

821
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,720
at Tranquility Base, goddammit.

822
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,500
But I mean, you know,

823
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,480
just all this waiting

824
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,380
and never happening.

825
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,040
I mean, why...

826
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,940
Maybe they'll come to our houses.

827
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,140
Oh, maybe this, maybe that.

828
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,860
Dave, maybe they'll be here tomorrow.

829
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,940
Maybe you don't know what time it is.

830
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,320
Maybe you don't know what day it is.

831
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,320
Maybe you don't know what year,

832
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,460
what century it is.

833
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
I have no argument with that.

834
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,440
I don't know any of those times.

835
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,120
But are you ready?

836
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,780
That's the question.

837
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,560
Have you drilled?

838
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,440
Have you prepared?

839
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,140
Are you ready for the end times?

840
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,380
Are you ready to be ruptured?

841
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,680
Are you ready to meet Bob?

842
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,160
Are you ready to be meted by Connie?

843
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,120
I've already met Bob,

844
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,220
and I did not,

845
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,660
not like the experience one bit.

846
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,340
He was drunk.

847
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,980
He was loud.

848
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,200
He tried to tickle me

849
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,560
in front of a huge number of people.

850
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,820
He vomited on his shoes,

851
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,880
and he had to be escorted

852
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,480
by two large bald guys,

853
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,820
balder and larger than me,

854
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,660
out of the area.

855
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,120
He never stopped smiling

856
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,220
for a second, though.

857
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,740
Yeah, you call that a smile?

858
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,740
With all that torn flesh hanging?

859
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,540
Happiness.

860
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,860
He looked ecstatic the whole time.

861
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,000
Satori, indeed.

862
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,600
Slack.

863
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,880
The nth slack.

864
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,740
The extreme slack.

865
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,060
Slack.

866
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,600
Square.

867
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:55,960
Sure.

868
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,760
It's not just the smile,

869
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,720
it's the placidness in that face.

870
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,660
The expression in his eyes.

871
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,040
Just the cool, calm.

872
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,320
He is definitely in moon pants

873
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
every hour of the day.

874
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,540
I know he's under 24 hours.

875
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
It's sighted lust.

876
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,880
It's the grin of

877
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,980
infinitely sighted,

878
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
infinite lust.

879
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,180
The first thing I...

880
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,760
Infinitely being sighted.

881
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,040
Before his desire has had a chance

882
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,680
to barely form.

883
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,380
It is instantly sighted.

884
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,160
By fate.

885
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,840
The subgenius performs memory editing.

886
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,820
He buries his arm deep in the archives of the score,

887
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,300
gropes for the proper file and its specific remembrances,

888
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,400
and retrieves it to stand at leisure.

889
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,520
And he knows that this file,

890
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,660
and his archive,

891
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,920
are but one drawer in the greater archive of all creation.

892
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,000
For everything is but a pattern,

893
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,620
an intersection in the code.

894
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,700
Everything exists at once,

895
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,760
it just shifts position continuously.

896
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,360
Every distinct object we see around us is but an opening into the files.

897
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,740
Don't worry, if you missed something,

898
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
it's all in the can.

899
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,760
It will all be aired again,

900
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,160
in some better world.

901
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,160
And the angelic host which must soon descend

902
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,160
will bring an index to all the shifting patterns of the code,

903
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,700
providing us with a guide to the anti-laws.

904
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,080
But we have been warned of the tampering.

905
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,020
Once one has gone swimming in the fourth dimension,

906
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,660
this dry land bound pace seems excruciatingly ordered.

907
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,740
It's a shame that we have to go back to the past.

908
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:22,740


909
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:22,740


910
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,140
It's a shame that life on this plane is so chronological.

911
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,720
Many are the subgenii who have gone waiting in the turbulent surf of time,

912
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,760
never to return.

913
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,980
It's hard to get back in step once you've changed the setting on your astral wristwatch.

914
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

915
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,400
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

916
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,400


917
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,400


918
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,460
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

919
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,480
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

920
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,560
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

921
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,740
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

922
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,180
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

923
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,860
Open your eyes wide in the continuously ride

924
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,660
Just a military persona knows without knowledge

925
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,560
That this town has S Acts

926
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,140
A restaurant in the motives was cold

927
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,000
We still dream

928
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,880
A paradise with that minimize

929
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,000
A sweet-time in mind

930
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,780
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

931
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,580
Nyaa-oy-nay-bob-ay!

932
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:39,760
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

933
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:04,540
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

934
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

935
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

936
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,660
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

937
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:05,660
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

938
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:33,040
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

939
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:02,700
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

940
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

941
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,920
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, a woman, I'm a woman.

942
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,060
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

943
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

944
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,540
I'm a woman...

945
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

946
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,120
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, I'm a woman.

947

resemble, maybe it was just an action

952
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,860
center. Didn't have to have

953
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,740
any higher thinking.

954
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,180
See what I mean?

955
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,380
And once they catch you that way,

956
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,220
they can bleed you and

957
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,800
suckle from your teeth

958
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,460
like vampires.

959
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,840
Your blood is no longer

960
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,540
your own. No, it's going to be someone else's blood

961
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,580
very, very soon.

962
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,100
See, um, my colon

963
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,360
is not my colon, but it's actually

964
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,600
parallel with the needle.

965
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:50,680
So,

966
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,760
share shit with Gilligan.

967
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,020
Gilligans.

968
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,900
Gilligans.

969
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,680
Thousands of Gilligans

970
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,320
in your closet

971
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,060
and shower.

972
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,960
Millions of Gilligans

973
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,540
everywhere.

974
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,380
Gilligans under the bed.

975
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,920
Millions of Gilligans marching across

976
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,760
the desert.

977
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,540
Millions of

978
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,160
Gallions of

979
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,260
Gallions of Jones.

980
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,000
Millions of deserted

981
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,480
and beaten,

982
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,120
What did I—

983
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,400
Millions

984
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,680
and

985
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,660
considerations

986
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:29,960
fill

987
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,200
around

988
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:30,560
you.

989
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:31,920
Daniel

990
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,460
of

991
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:36,500
The

992
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:36,720
The

993
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,700
留言

994
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,120
Although the church of the subgenius, well, let me put it this way.

995
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,220
If the church goes down, well, civilization goes up.

996
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,420
In flames! In flames, my friend!

997
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,500
And when the world goes up in flames, the subgenies have the weenies!

998
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,300
We will be the ones barbecuing!

999
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,240
Ah, yes!

1000
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,140
Friends, you know, the news, you turn on the news today and it's pure surrealism.

1001
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:44,120
Did I really see jiggly pixel vision of Geraldo Rivera in the desert

1002
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,500
with these 1,000 troopers pointing guns at 20 skinny little Afghani guys

1003
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,260
who were all, one of whom is standing there going,

1004
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,460
when the Taliban finds out about this, they're going to kick your ass!

1005
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,320
It's all relative, friends.

1006
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,020
You know, those guys weren't getting CNN, but maybe they know more because of that.

1007
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:12,560
We have to get used to the idea that at any moment, anything can happen.

1008
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,740
Both the imaginable and the unimaginable.

1009
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,420
Sometimes the impossible, but more often, the unlikely.

1010
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,980
I wish Rod Serling was here to say that instead of Mr. Sister who wrote it.

1011
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:32,200
Sometimes you're the screwy and sometimes you're the screwer.

1012
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,260
More often we're the screwy.

1013
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,260
And the way I read it, we're one screw short.

1014
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,720
Of World War III!

1015
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,740
Which I grew up looking forward to because I like atomic monsters.

1016
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,740
Oh, once again, the worst it could be was Planet of the Apes.

1017
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,800
That was pretty cool.

1018
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,780
And the best, Road Warrior.

1019
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,320
Whoa!

1020
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,080
Blood for oil there.

1021
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,360
Ooh la la.

1022
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:04,800
But friends, you know, it's scary because the craziest train engineer in the world is at the helm.

1023
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,000
Not Dennis Murphy.

1024
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:06,960
No.

1025
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:13,880
But Casey Jones, the craziest train engineer in the world, is at the helm of Spaceship America

1026
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,480
as it careens out of control with that drunken, coked-up madman at the wheel.

1027
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,420
And what is America's final destination, friends?

1028
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,340
The moon, the future, and Hooterville.

1029
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,000
Especially Hooterville.

1030
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh, man.

1031
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
It's so depressing sometimes.

1032
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,220
And I mean, I get...

1033
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,220
I get depressed at watching the normal folks go through their routines.

1034
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,800
But you know, the do-gooders can be just as bad as the evil-doers at times.

1035
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:46,700
And they mean well.

1036
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,480
But if you happen to be evil and you're a do-gooder, think about it.

1037
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,260
You don't even know you're evil.

1038
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,520
For instance, anti-smoking.

1039
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,740
Anti-smoking bullshit eats up a lot more slack than secondhand smoke.

1040
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,520
I have no doubt about that.

1041
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,080
And I swear, the smug do-gooder...

1042
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,940
will be the death of us all!

1043
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,640
For our own goods, of course.

1044
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,380
You know, they're fairly easy to spot, the smug do-gooder,

1045
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,620
because they oftentimes practice what we would call flamboyant humility.

1046
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,760
Or conspicuous humbleness.

1047
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,420
You know, a sort of grandiose self-effacement.

1048
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:32,080
Like Buddhists who never cease to remind you of how egoless they are.

1049
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,660
You know who I'm talking about.

1050
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,820
They just...

1051
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,780
They just want you to notice how egoless they are.

1052
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,760
That's all.

1053
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,060
You know, listen to me when I tell you, go beyond ego.

1054
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,140
You don't know who you're dealing with, man.

1055
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
Listen to me.

1056
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,080
Go beyond ego.

1057
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,260
Because I know.

1058
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,660
It's easy to be a social Darwinist.

1059
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,180
Survival of the richest.

1060
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,900
If you're that kind that puts the evil in evolution.

1061
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,800
And I like to think...

1062
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,760
You know, somebody said, you sub-geniuses are just a bunch of elitists.

1063
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:10,840
Well, yeah.

1064
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:11,880
Duh.

1065
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,080
For one thing, we won't let any geniuses in.

1066
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,620
But it's...

1067
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,520
Like, you know, it's not that we look down on the cow manures.

1068
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,700
We just don't believe in their shit!

1069
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,720
Bob noticed how some people believe this and some people believe that.

1070
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,040
You know, oh, I believe the world was created yesterday.

1071
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,620
No, no, no.

1072
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,680
I believe the world...

1073
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,940
The world crew happened by accident seven billion years ago.

1074
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,680
Well, Bob said, believe me out of it!

1075
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,780
You believe what?

1076
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,580
Just relax in the safety of your own delusions, friends.

1077
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,240
Just keep them out of my delusions.

1078
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,100
We'll stick with the contradictions that make good sense.

1079
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,400
Thank you very much.

1080
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,360
You know, I think you mistook me for Mr. Give-A-Shit.

1081
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,300
When I don't have my head stuck in a black hole,

1082
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,340
I always listen to the hour of slack because it makes me laugh and I like to laugh.

1083
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,700
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

1084
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,860
Oh, you mustn't forget the nice letter.

1085
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,620
Oh, my...

1086
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,080
Uh-oh.

1087
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,700
That's right, laddie.

1088
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,880
It's an important physical document which you must keep with you at all times.

1089
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,960
Especially now that the...

1090
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,460
Dear Paul and Gary, you stink.

1091
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,240
The show was a fake.

1092
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,660
How can you guys laugh at my show behind your backs and still get away with it?

1093
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,600
What was the show to you?

1094
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,820
Some sort of sub-clown parade to impress your sick, groupie, fringe friends?

1095
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,080
Like Nina Hogan and Mark Motherbrow?

1096
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,160
I put my artistic life on the line.

1097
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,060
And I get the subgenius Ed Sullivan show.

1098
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,600
I work like a little devil trying to balance the forces of good and evil in three cities

1099
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,520
and get the drum set set up and tuned each time,

1100
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,140
the foam head adjusted, the radios and explosives in place,

1101
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:08,560
the zombies checked out and nuked, the stage managers go get them speeches written,

1102
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,440
and the line to tie Cleve in through the board done.

1103
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,900
You guys just sit on your smiles waiting for someone to help you tear the veins off the sound man's amps.

1104
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,960
Between Gary's asking where the food is and Paul,

1105
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,660
your bitching about not wanting to clean where the banners are,

1106
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,640
I was just about up to my sub-gland and too much is always butter for not enough.

1107
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,120
Gary, you sad mop of a man.

1108
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,300
Where do you get off thinking a child's towel is the way to go on stage?

1109
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,580
With a band that now sounds like bus brakes,

1110
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,900
you want me to play drums to what?

1111
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,480
Hurting dolphins may be funny to you,

1112
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,920
but it simply gives little Jerry Jeff callers everywhere the wrong and the long idea.

1113
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,020
If you'd taken your mom up on that hair deal,

1114
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,500
we could have had a decent light, man,

1115
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,000
and some better church air, but no,

1116
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,700
you said it's Bob's will,

1117
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,480
and walked away.

1118
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,640
Nice lights, Gabo fam.

1119
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,040
Paul, you sniveling art snot.

1120
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,400
To make it all your show,

1121
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,160
you've moved the damn thing to LA,

1122
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,040
and I had to blow it up on the freeway before we could go on.

1123
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,360
You probably think putting the sponge head in the middle instead of me on the drums was pretty funny.

1124
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,860
Intent as you were in wrecking my show,

1125
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,500
I tell you, everyone,

1126
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,000
with oral contract,

1127
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,320
that I will wear my space suit,

1128
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,360
and you scamper out to your friend to borrow his gorilla suit and space helmet.

1129
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,740
If this is the new church,

1130
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,420
the new take what you want from whoever you want,

1131
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:47,300
well, you lowerites can sit on it and extrameditate.

1132
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,920
I'm gonna go back to the legitimate religion where the sneakers become suckers the old-fashioned way.

1133
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,840
We burn them, not each other.

1134
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,320
Smith, that lost little fool.

1135
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,300
He couldn't find Philo's shirt.

1136
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,700
He's a show-hole with both pipes.

1137
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,100
And he expects everyone to be excited about his limp dishrag of an act.

1138
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,160
My buddy, D. Meyer, poop of all, etc.,

1139
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,500
worked up some of the best lines and runs in the mouth history of the church.

1140
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,740
And you steal them all the time, all of you, every line.

1141
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,920
Then put him on last so you may deliver his best lines first, badly,

1142
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,860
driving away all the people who know what we mean and leaving precious little for the audience.

1143
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,100
For him to swing and swig and swoon to.

1144
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,600
And for me, when I shot Bob, there were 200 tops left.

1145
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,380
I could have shot all the audience, too.

1146
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,780
There were so few left, I had enough bullets left in my gun.

1147
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,700
I may have, I was so mad.

1148
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,060
Why save the best for last?

1149
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,920
Those people want to see Bob shot.

1150
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,600
And you, school marmalade of a man, Smith, act for two years like it was you I shot.

1151
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,840
I hand you the biggest publicity ploy since Jane and I.

1152
00:51:59,840 --> 00:51:59,840


1153
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,920
And you complain the curse and cry to Paul, your sleep genius S.F. lackey,

1154
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,640
about how it's just a blank.

1155
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,800
And oh, he just does the best.

1156
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,540
Really, well, you just coming up if you think you have been.

1157
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,940
Uh, uh.

1158
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,540
Where did you dig up those Arkansaniacs?

1159
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,880
Funnier than a gravel mixer, yes, and noise that matches one.

1160
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,000
But next time, get someone who knows how to dress

1161
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,840
and won't sit in the middle of Broadway to eat his dinner.

1162
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,160
Sticks, rocks, and knives.

1163
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,000
Feuding.

1164
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,600
Cemetery.

1165
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,220
Graves.

1166
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,080
No trespassing.

1167
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,940
Stolen pig.

1168
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,860
Escalated.

1169
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,460
People died.

1170
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,620
Killed and hurt.

1171
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,300
Fight argument.

1172
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,060
Hilliard Hall.

1173
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,000
Fight rumble.

1174
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,760
Gang fight.

1175
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,460
Tattoos.

1176
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,940
Fraternity.

1177
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,500
Feud.

1178
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,300
Uh, feud.

1179
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,900
Don't forget, folks, the song that wouldn't die.

1180
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,100
It's still in your brains.

1181
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,840
You may not be able to hear it.

1182
00:52:59,840 --> 00:52:59,840


1183
00:52:59,840 --> 00:52:59,840


1184
00:52:59,840 --> 00:52:59,840


1185
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,660
But it'll be with you always.

1186
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,060
Following you through life.

1187
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,940
In cover versions by Liberace and Herb Alpert and Gioanna Bratt.

1188
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:09,560
Together.

1189
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,120
The most horrible thing you can ever imagine.

1190
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,440
With Tina Turner singing background vocals.

1191
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,660
And Nancy Sinatra and Lee Haverwood.

1192
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,580
And Yoko Ono.

1193
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:25,280
And a cameo appearance by Mel Gibson as the World War II soldier returning to his daughter.

1194
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,620
Melanie and Claudine Rosés.

1195
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,180
With Bob sharpening knives.

1196
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,400
And the Ghetto Boys.

1197
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:39,080
The letter was written by Puzzling Evidence in copying David Rudepra, the amazing pope

1198
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,240
of New York's first letter critiquing the first show of the first century, of the first

1199
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
millennia, of the first group of subgeniuses that ever were.

1200
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,620
That is the show's way.

1201
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:56,180
Okay, we're just moving the body of the show out of the way here because in two minutes

1202
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,600
I've got to hide this thing under the set.

1203
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,600


1204
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,300
Yeah, we've got to get it under the board.

1205
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,660
Roll it in there.

1206
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,720
I'll let them show it the other way.

1207
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:03,920
I know what you mean.

1208
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,600
I know exactly what you mean.

1209
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:12,760
An elite padre, a random rogue group of renegade subgeniuses are responsible for this outrage

1210
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,580
that we of the church utterly deny and show.

1211
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,220
Can't figure out.

1212
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,580
Can't think clearly.

1213
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,020
And separate ourselves.

1214
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,160
Friends, a little bit of KPFA in Berkeley.

1215
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,460
Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell.

1216
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,860
And, uh, Dr. Philodrum and other.

1217
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:39,460
Well, we're about ready to wash down the worm, as they like to say in Cozumel, where

1218
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,440
I like to hang my britches every Tuesday and some of the kids like to hang out with me

1219
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,660
too.

1220
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:45,920
I've got a good joke for you.

1221
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,860
One of my friends, one of my little friends told me, he said there was this little boy

1222
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,800
and kind of like a 40 year old man.

1223
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,480
They didn't really know each other.

1224
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,740
They were walking off towards the woods hand in hand.

1225
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,060
And the little boy squeezed the older man's hand and said, I'm afraid, I'm afraid to go

1226
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,580
in the woods.

1227
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,160
And the man said, you're afraid.

1228
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,620
Think of how I'm going to feel coming out alone.

1229
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,400
And you know, that's what I think is wrong with today's people.

1230
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,280
So true.

1231
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,880
So true.

1232
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,240
So true.

1233
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,860
They just, they don't understand that when their time is nigh, they might as well plop

1234
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,000
one in the eye.

1235
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,360
They might as well forget the whole thing.

1236
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:25,720
They might as well forget the whole routine.

1237
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,440
Give up.

1238
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,880
Give it up.

1239
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:27,760
Give it up.

1240
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:34,140
And buy one of these beautiful, beautiful synchronized goat shirts, ghost shirts from

1241
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,280
the ghost dancers out there in the Lakota lands where the wind blows free and the bison

1242
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,280


1243
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,300
Now that's the name I've wanted in a long time.

1244
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,080
J.R.

1245
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,140
Bob Dobbs.

1246
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,400
Oh, you didn't even know J.R.

1247
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:45,860
in the mains?

1248
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,600
I ain't give anything for another bowl of J.R.

1249
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,980
Bob Dobbs maple syrup.

1250
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,200
Oh, I remember him.

1251
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,440
The only maple syrup drained straight from the cow's throat.

1252
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,340
His fingers are like a knife.

1253
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:55,340


1254
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,540
His fingers were as black as the coal from all the coal he dug.

1255
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:05,720
He'd circumcise the rectums of those when he would mutilate a cow to get the syrup all

1256
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:05,960
down.

1257
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,180
I remember.

1258
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,400
I remember.

1259
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,260
He'd be put by any other name would smell his feet.

1260
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,580
Dismembering a cow with Bob, now that was a fine Sunday.

1261
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,100
Better than singing and going to the mines.

1262
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,340
The old fashioned way.

1263
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,040
Old fashioned.

1264
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,520
That's the way to do it.

1265
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:21,540
And yet there's no other way than the way that happened yesterday.

1266
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,060
Day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day.

1267
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,100
Oh, yesterday.

1268
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:25,340
Oh, yesterday.

1269
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1270
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1271
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1272
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1273
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1274
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1275
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1276
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,340


1277
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,240
It's no time for an old man no more.

1278
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,340
When I was a young baggie, we used to take three and five year olds.

1279
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,800
We'd pull their hair out as long as it would go.

1280
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,220
Really?

1281
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,380
And drop them down into the shaft to see if they'd make a splattering sound.

1282
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,920
Those were the days.

1283
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,320
Before the damn English owner came here.

1284
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:51,540
Absolutely disgusting.

1285
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,380
Wouldn't let us start a union.

1286
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,320
Those were the days when I was a young baggie.

1287
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:55,320


1288
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:55,320


1289
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,260
Those were the days when I was a young baggie.

1290
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,860
Oh, you had a little bit of hair.

1291
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,160
A little one-eyed fella.

1292
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,400
Always standing up for his own rights and lefts.

1293
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,300
Always eager to please the height.

1294
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:09,920
Oh, he was.

1295
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,620
I liked Jonah and the whale.

1296
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,120
Until next week.

1297
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,620
Keep your hat on tight.

1298
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,500
You're back to the winter.

1299
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,040
The sack and the saddle.

1300
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,300
Keep your hat on tight.

1301
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,300


1302
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,300


1303
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,300


1304
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:25,300


1305
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,480
That's after Princess May.

1306
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,720
No, that's where it belongs.

1307
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,980
She's a mysterious girl.

1308
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,700
Order!

1309
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,140
Who is it?

1310
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,620
This is my rifle!

1311
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,000
There are many licenses, but this one is mine!

1312
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:50,080
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1313
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:58,980
And you can get more information about the Church of the Subgenius from www.subgenius.com.

1314
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,880
And friends, if you've got some kind of tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think is suitable,

1315
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:14,660
is suitably bobbed and slacked up and conspiracy bashing and ear bone ripping to play on this Auguste Radio Show,

1316
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,640
then you can send that to me, Reverend Ivan Stang at this address.

1317
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,060
Stang at Postal.

1318
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:35,460
Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1319
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:38,740
44118.

1320
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,860
That's Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1321
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,820
Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise help him.

1322
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,240
You eat it back.

1323
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,080
By the way, friends.

1324
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:49,740
That song.

1325
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:55,640
Earlier days and confused or believe that was my bomb water.

1326
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,740
He be slacked or zombie.

1327
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,140
Bob, give me my hand.

1328
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:00,700
No.

1329
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,600
Thank you, Bob.
