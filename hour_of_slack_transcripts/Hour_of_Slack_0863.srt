00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
Good evening fellow necro-mediacs. I'm glad so many of you could come.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm Harvey Mews, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,980
Please introduce me, I'm Harvey Mews.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm a little creep.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,660
I want to be a friend of mine.

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,700
I'm sorry, good friend of mine.

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,820
I don't know why I'm here.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,580
I don't know.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,160
I don't know why.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,480
What was your name, sir?

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,600
You got a beast away from me.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,400
I'll kick his head.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,940
It's chaotic.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,900
It's chaotic.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,900
It's chaotic.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,220
cynic

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,240
corpses

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,500
bruised

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:01,880
bruised

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920
bruised

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,540
bruised

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:03,960
bruised

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,240
vulloy

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,080
full of

25
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,820
Bah yun

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,720
ah

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,400
Oh mah

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,660
A boy

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,520
who's

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:19,940
coming

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:46,560
This is the basic closed loop control input by opposition to open loop for which the pursued

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,140
objective is to get a given deflection and generally a maximum deflection.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,760
In order to obtain the desired outcome of the aircraft motion.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,480
Do you fucking understand me, you fucking piece of shit?

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,140
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this

36
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,160
brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,220
Oh yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,860
Hey, you know those policemen on motorcycles won't let me preach on car hoods downtown

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,220
because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,120
And there's no such thing as a crazy man.

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,120


42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,760
There's no reason to arrest me, yet they would.

43
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,260
Because I'm free, free, free enough to rant to myself in public because I come against

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,400
death, taxes, work, and premature immaculation.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,780
For Bob, your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,640
Them!

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,600
Them, and oh we hate them.

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,200
They and their tools of iniquity.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,740
Not the tools of the preacher, not the tongue nor the other parts, nay, but tools of false

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,240
slack dangled forever in front of you.

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,020
You like that raise right around the corner or like that rat swimming in poison cheese.

52
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,380
Let there be slack.

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,980
I'm going to Godstown, Godstown.

54
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,920
Here I come.

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,220
I'm going to Godstown, Godstown.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,220


57
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,220


58
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,220


59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,220


60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,220


61
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,900
Here I come.

62
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,820
They got some crazy little Godsheds.

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,640
There ain't nothing gonna get me one.

64
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,980
Why did you let your daughter dream of going on this mad moon journey?

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,940
Because I love her and I wanted to live to the best effect.

66
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,680
Dragging out life to the last possible second is not living to the best effect.

67
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,200
The best of life is to live to the best effect.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,200


69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,200


70
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,680
The best of life, password, lies nearest to the edge of death.

71
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,800
Our fathers and our fathers' fathers cleaned up the old order of things because it killed

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,280
children.

73
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,560
It killed those who were unprepared for death.

74
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,780
Because it tormented people in vain.

75
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,380
Because it outraced human pride and dignity.

76
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,620
Because it was an ugly spectacle of waste.

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,640
But that was only a beginning.

78
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,320
There's nothing wrong in suffering if you suffer for a purpose.

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,780
Our revolution didn't abolish danger or death.

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,600
It simply made danger and death worthwhile.

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
We must hold this crowd back at any cost for a time until the gas of peace is ready.

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,940
I think you've done toilet on your floor.

83
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,260
A great законish state of things will never be passed by you any more.

84
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,260


85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:43,340
Don't letter this псuh out, it'd be a

86
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,340


87
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,340


88
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:43,340


89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,760
begr least get a marking.

90
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:59,080
disagree with Chairman Bob. I do agree with Chairman Bob that Chairman Bob can't be working.

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:10,140
I recall that Chairman Bob went that route, right? Right. I think the thing, the thing,

92
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:19,700
the thing, and I think some, and I think in essence that Chairman Bob can't be working

93
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:33,000
while they're type alive to investors. We've viewed and so forth, but how to close down

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,680
the law. But now, one final question, if I could.

95
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,160
Anybody on the panel who'd want to address Chairman Bob?

96
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,920
No. No. Okay.

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,800
Who's responsible for all of this?

98
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,800


99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,800


100
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,800


101
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,800


102
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Whoever's rolling water, that said.

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,120
No, this other guy buries me in the沒 preposterous not in part because I didn't have

104
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:23,640
Ah, yes, dear friends, some wonderful edits and credits by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

105
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:31,860
Except for the very last one, which was from Dr. Mr. Sister here in Cleveland.

106
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,540
Yes, aside from that, all the rest was by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

107
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,540
All those cut-ups, anyway.

108
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:50,360
Our title tune, The Hour of Slack Mix, is by El Queso All-Stars.

109
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,680
And the very opening was by Heart Ignition. More from him soon.

110
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:04,580
But first, this fantabulous rant by the old-time Dr. Dr. Dinosaur.

111
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,180
Dr. Dinosaur.

112
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,700
Dr. Dinosaur.

113
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,860
Dr. Dinosaur.

114
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,160
What kind of savior do you want?

115
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,040
You want something exciting in a deified being?

116
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,900
Or do you want a completely predetermined cosmology

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,740
with static and stable and sedentary gods hanging off of it

118
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,100
like apples still stuck on a tree in January?

119
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,620
Are you looking to get carried away on that sweet chariot?

120
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
Or are you afraid that there won't be any difference between it

121
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,260
and the boxcars that will unload at the gates of the Eternal Concentration Camp?

122
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,680
Will you settle for a holy order that's all order?

123
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,700
Or are you hankering for a chance to put in a few licks yourself

124
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,920
in the timeless struggle between good and evil?

125
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,460
Unless you're ready to let your soul roll over and die

126
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,480
before it's even had a chance to prove itself on the field of holy battle,

127
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,680
it seems to me that you might want to think about making a choice.

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,860
Are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan

129
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,240
when you know that you're going to have to make a choice?

130
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,000
Or are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000


132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,620
You know from the book that he loses in the end?

133
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,100
We may pull the wool over our own eyes,

134
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,180
but that doesn't mean we're stupid.

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,300
We may go in for the underdog,

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,480
but we don't place no bets after the cards have been shown.

137
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,580
And even though he wins just before the credits roll,

138
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,920
credits with only his name on them, by the way,

139
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,700
are you going to sign up for the Yahweh team when you know the outcome?

140
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,060
Hell, everybody likes to win,

141
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,560
but only after they get to play the game.

142
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,320
You can turn a buck betting on a sure thing,

143
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,860
but where's the slack in that?

144
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,180
Now we got the fighting Jesus,

145
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,760
that hardcore three-nailed money-changer-ass-kicking Aramaic rowdy,

146
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,740
and that's fun for a while.

147
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,900
But he ends up selling your account to Yahweh,

148
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,300
and you still get shortchanged on the action and thrills you crave in a belief system.

149
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,100
Well, kids, I think you know what the answer is.

150
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,420
The answer is the ever-widening smoke ring around J.R. Bob Dobbs.

151
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,860
Yes, only Dobbs, among all the modern mythological madmen,

152
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,400
represents the uncertainty, the dramatic tension,

153
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,700
the screaming scary monster movie mayhem

154
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,620
that keeps your heart a-thumping and your blood a-pumping

155
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,000
while you sit on the edge of your pew

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,860
waiting to find out how this movie turns out.

157
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Where do the big spenders, the high rollers, make their fortunes?

158
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,300
Do they toss their bankrolls into long-term IRAs and deposit certificates and play it safe?

159
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,600
Hell no!

160
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,880
They dare to risk it and play the market.

161
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,400
And that's the kind of savior Bob is, children.

162
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,500
Bob is the Wall Street savior.

163
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,060
We may know the saucers are coming, but we don't know what the outcome will be.

164
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,220
We know Bob can cut deals with human guns,

165
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
and he can take the money from governments and overlords and Illuminati

166
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,200
and rake in the cash from that.

167
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,360
But we don't know yet whether he'll be able to close the deal

168
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,940
that will keep the X's from just plowing us all under as a bad crop.

169
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,160
We don't know if we'll ride the saucers as exalted examples of Yeti evolution

170
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,180
or as fertilizer for some planet where they intend to try again.

171
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,100
If you want true adventure in your eternal future,

172
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,220
you have to be a good man.

173
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,320
If you want a little havoc with your heaven,

174
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,760
if you can stand a little mystification in your destiny,

175
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,300
then there's only one personal savior that will satisfy your soul's fighting spirit.

176
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,920
And that is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

177
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,300
Dr. Dinosaur, dear friends, in a classic old-timey rant.

178
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,380
And now, Zoot's Rift.

179
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,740
It is time.

180
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:18,800


181
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:30,540
It is about to begin.

182
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,780
Take care,eles, recent memories.

183
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,880
It's about to begin.

184
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,080
Take care of yourselves.

185
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,700
Decide when it begins.

186
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
I have been blessed to grow into a powerful being.

187
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,400
hell files

188
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,260
and found a list with names

189
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,500
a mile long

190
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,840
and saw you and you

191
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,940
and you and you

192
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,840
and even you

193
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,100
let me close my eyes

194
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,400
please don't make me watch

195
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,700
Satan masturbate

196
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,360
he's a hungry clown and I don't want

197
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,080
to see all his dirty deeds

198
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,140
oh my god

199
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,260
oh why did those assholes

200
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,680
at the employment agency

201
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,740
give me this job cleaning up this office

202
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,940
oh why

203
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,480
somebody tell me already

204
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,500
was this the best they could do on such short notice

205
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,660
am I being punished for overeating

206
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,380
and using too many cuss words

207
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,400
or is it for sounding too much

208
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,380
like some pale cheap imitation

209
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,960
of Captain Beatheart

210
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,260
or am I too much like Frank Zappa

211
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,400
am I being punished for not cutting enough

212
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,740
people off on the freeway

213
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,760
or for answering my phone messages

214
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,500
oh why god oh why

215
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,980
did those assholes at the employment agency

216
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,040
put me here where I don't belong

217
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,740
where they could have gotten me a job

218
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,300
selling hot dogs instead of idiots at Disneyland

219
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,500
were they afraid

220
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,740
that pretty old lady

221
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,760
would buy a red shirt

222
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,040
did they suspect that I might urinate

223
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,460
through the cosmos at the top of Space Mountain

224
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,100
oh why god oh why

225
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,260
did those assholes at the employment agency

226
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,520
inform me early about the hatred

227
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,260
cause I would have worn my fat man's

228
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,820
pajamas with the air condition

229
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,700
back in their ear

230
00:15:38,500 --> 00:16:08,500


231
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,880
I'm going to be in a minute this can't be what

232
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,860
because you killed me a soon drift

236
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,820
because you and your slug musician friends

237
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,880
beat me up and killed me

238
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,220
oh man don't I have enough problems

239
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,200
what is it you want oh great spirit

240
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,500
you want to complain to me that you're in hell I suppose

241
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,600
that you're dead and have gone straight to fucking hell

242
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,220
for driving like a fucking idiot on the freeway

243
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,880
giving me the wrong change and jacking the box

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,680
playing that heavy metal shit on your stereo

245
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,360
at 3.30 in the morning when we're all trying to sleep

246
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
sending me junk mail

247
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,800
trying to entice me into wasting my money

248
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,220
on boring inane magazines

249
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,480
charged with the old man's money

250
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,480


251
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,400
over a thousand dollars at the Chevron station

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,600
for preventive maintenance

253
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,980
while all the while deliberately destroying my car

254
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,240
no way dude

255
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,140
for going through life talking like a blabbering

256
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,080
snobbering idiot

257
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,700
driving your van to the beach during spring break

258
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,560
with a sign painted on the side that says

259
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,540
show us your teeth

260
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,640
no I said no

261
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,940
soups rants

262
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,380
they didn't even hold it against me

263
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,460
for being a booker

264
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,100
in several Los Angeles rock clubs

265
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,400
or for getting all the pussy while guys like John Truby

266
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,520
were stuck with their shit jobs

267
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,660
at the hardware stores

268
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
well then what are you talking about then

269
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,080
I'm in heaven to drift

270
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,540
that's right you killed me

271
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,160
and I went to heaven

272
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,660
glorious beautiful heaven

273
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,940
but you soups drift

274
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,120
it's you that are in hell

275
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,180
you fucked up

276
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,460

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,620
you're not

278
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,720
you're not

279
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,660
you're not

280
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,240
you're not

281
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,320
yes

282
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,760
yes

283
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:36,920
yes

284
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:36,920


285
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:36,920


286
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:36,920


287
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:36,920


288
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:36,920


289
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,400
yes

290
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,420
yes

291
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:37,840
yes

292
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,680
you're in hell

293
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,880
and now

294
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,540
1930 women

295
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,560
a toxic

296
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,780
I please

297
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,880
I need a fucking prize

298
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,800
out of that

299
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,100
I do get racism

300
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,440
I can parliament

301
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,440


302
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,540
my mouth lick diyorum

303
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:06,540


304
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:06,920
that seems to be all the way out the world

305
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,560
Zug's Rift.

306
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,820
Ah, yes.

307
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,640
Ah, friends, and let's change the tone now

308
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,180
and go back to WCSB Cleveland's Thursday night show,

309
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,140
ESO Swamp Radio,

310
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,460
with Professor Chaz Smith,

311
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,760
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

312
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,340
and us.

313
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,660
Me and we!

314
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,560
Mommy!

315
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,680
Daddy!

316
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,240
And another sound.

317
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,340
And the attic lock melted.

318
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Mink.

319
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,500
Mink with bright little eyes and tousled hair

320
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,840
peered inside.

321
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,740
And behind...

322
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:04,960
Bang!

323
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,460
Toree wavering blue lives.

324
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,440
Frightful show.

325
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,280
Darling stand.

326
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:16,660
Ahh!

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,420
Mad您ḥ

328
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,300
て

329
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,440
And then...

330
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,540
The Redacted Shed saw the long line of celebrants

331
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,940
making their way to the top of the Temple Mount.

332
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,280
And they were putting saffron yurts on their shaven heads

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,080
and their one good eye pointed firmly above their master eyes.

334
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,640
They chouched forwards.

335
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,680
Some were bleeding on their feet.

336
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,960
Some were bleeding at the ears from the rent in the main room

337
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,220
and they were being forced to hear.

338
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,820
Some's navels were smiling, yet austere, yet abstruse smiling

339
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,840
reserved for the few who knew their fate.

340
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,560
My ears are bleeding!

341
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,760
And they just keep trudging.

342
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,820
Looks real good from that shot up in the hills there.

343
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,680
Is that a dolly shot or is that a... what is that?

344
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,840
Just turn around.

345
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,900
Hey man, you're not supposed to show your watches.

346
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,620
1392, people don't wear watches in 1392.

347
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,320
The time is 13-0-13.

348
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,560
Do you know where your smell dawn dwells?

349
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,200
That's time.

350
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,120
Can you feel your brain yet?

351
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,200
Time.

352
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,020
Are your breasts as ripe as the milkmaids dancing through the forest glen?

353
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,380
Are you enslaved to time?

354
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,180
I'm handcuffed by your wristwatch.

355
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,520
Is your lust for material finishing, say some more?

356
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,620
Do you have a streeevely long funny looking forefinger?

357
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,440
They don't blow their loads in the last minute before the CD is formatted.

358
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,860
I'm alone!

359
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,420
Two minutes takes forever when you're waiting for it.

360
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,940
I feel it!

361
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
I blew it!

362
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
I blew it!

363
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,420
I once had the skin of a smiling little simian boy like you.

364
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,200
Yes, grand.

365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,580
I like that new skin you're wearing tonight.

366
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,100
Oh, it is very, very, very luxurious to be wearing it.

367
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,240
What is that, like about 55 year old female?

368
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,300
Yes, yes, a kangaroo is the bottom part and the top part is...

369
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,340
A female.

370
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,600
A Corinthian kangaroo.

371
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,300
It's only a 55 year old female skin you've got on?

372
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,880
This is very supple still. Feel it.

373
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,180
No wonder you look so young.

374
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,420
Ooh, you feel young, don't you?

375
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,480
Very supple. She was a beautiful dancer.

376
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,840
She died from an ergot overdose.

377
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,900
We transported her to the Middle Ages to enlighten her somehow,

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and yet she became involved in the celebrations when she came back.

379
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Where did you download that skin at?

380
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,660
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

381
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,280
EdmundG.com skins for all your fancy new Internet programs.

382
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,280
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...

383
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,540
Just as sure as sugar is sweet.

384
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,120
Just as sure as you walk on your feet.

385
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Just as sure as we'll all be dead.

386
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,980
Something's gonna crumble in your head.

387
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,340
Poop Dog will pee and Pee Dog will poop.

388
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,500
And out of my hose will come horrible goop.

389
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,180
One by one they shall die.

390
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,900
Two by two all false smy.

391
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,040
He did sin, Lake of Fire, for he used the name J.R.!

392
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,840
Behold, the day of Bob is at hand, and he shall come like a salesman in the night.

393
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,000
Give up hope.

394
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,840
Bob's no crutch.

395
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,860
Here comes Negi.

396
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,920
Here comes Butch.

397
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,540
Dressed as Bulgarian woman, and look at the fascinating necklace they are wearing.

398
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,120
Oh, there is the flute player, Sonia Hadjijov.

399
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,040
Sonia, could you step closer to the microphone?

400
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,560
What is the name of the flute you are playing in the Bulgarian Woman Orchestra?

401
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,800
It's called the Jelette Kukukukutul.

402
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,600
The Jelette Kukukukutul.

403
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,320
And it looks like you can also shave your legs or any other hairy part of your body.

404
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,660
You are absolutely right. Yes, it's a very rare instrument.

405
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:17,500
I notice very many of the female singers have very, very hairy moustaches, which must be taken care of on regular basis.

406
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,440
Yes, isn't that a nice coincidence?

407
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,580
So you can whistle through your nose and rip off your flesh in one very smooth...

408
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,160
I'm glad to be talking about the different orifices of whistling,

409
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,140
because, you know, that can get kind of personal.

410
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,020
That's why the girl did the high notes so easy, because she had been shaving her fuzzy...

411
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,280
Oh, if only I could reach the high minutes...

412
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,360
Of time.

413
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,160
The high hours...

414
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,280
Of time.

415
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,940
The high days, the high weeks, the peaks of time.

416
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,880
Why cannot we skip from the peaks of one time to another?

417
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,780
Are there fifths?

418
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,560
Skip over the boring parts.

419
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,660
And the weeks of a day of a week.

420
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,220
Or the painful parts.

421
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,840
The active parts, indeed.

422
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,760
Monday we will call C.

423
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,140
Time is a waveform, is it not?

424
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,040
The Monday after we will call C.

425
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,040
Can we not skip across the tops of the waves?

426
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,100
Can we not?

427
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,060
By passing the long trip down?

428
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,140
Like luscious milkmaids on surfboards, can't we?

429
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:20,720
Now what about the fact that in engineering terminology, the element of stress is measured in moments?

430
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,000
Stress is measured in moments, but...

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,340
Stress is measured in moments, yes.

432
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:25,440
Yes.

433
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,140
Slack, however, is measured in drummonds and dobsons.

434
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,260
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

435
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,000
Is time a particle or a wave?

436
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,480
I am going to move with that system.

437
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,920
It's both.

438
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,260
Maybe time is a particle, not a wave at all.

439
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,500
Well, if that's the case, dude, we are screwed.

440
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,680
Well, do you know how long it takes to...

441
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,740
We might as well just give up.

442
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,740
Can you track the path of an electron, a proton, or a neutron?

443
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,120
If you were to get into quantum physics...

444
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,320
Because that would mean for every atom there is in this universe, there's another universe.

445
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,220
There is.

446
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,840
That's quantum, baby.

447
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
There's another universe waiting.

448
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,980
It's the flip side.

449
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,900
It's the B side of every universe has a continuous flip team.

450
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,420
Just as big as this one.

451
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,180
Just as valid.

452
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,860
Just as...

453
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,200
Oh, some are smaller, though, James.

454
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,580
Alive.

455
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,060
Don't discount the entropy factor.

456
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,680
Some are much smaller.

457
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,040
Some have sharp DNA.

458
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,280
Hey, I saw an ad in the scene, in the back pages of it.

459
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,840
It said...

460
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,240
This didn't make sense to me.

461
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,300
Doesn't make sense.

462
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,500
Sex-starved escorts.

463
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,680
This don't make no kind of sense at all.

464
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,280
Only women.

465
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,680
If an escort is sex-starved, what does she look like?

466
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,540
I mean, shouldn't an escort be like getting sex all the time?

467
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Now, you know, Chaz, I've been reading entertainment weeklies for a long time, and from what I've

468
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,820
learned from those is that there are a lot of beautiful women who are completely lonely.

469
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,460
I guess all the guys think that they're getting tons of dates, and no one ever calls them.

470
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,000
They're the ones who are waiting for your call right now.

471
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,560
That's right.

472
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,620
At Char-Zucana?

473
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,680
At 1-900-1.

474
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,080
Yes.

475
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,200
They're waiting.

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,460
At 888-669-2323.

477
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,320
Exactly.

478
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,600
And you can...

479
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,120
Actually, there is a beautiful, live, naked woman waiting for your call.

480
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,080
A free call at 888-669-2323.

481
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,340
But don't you remember every time you call her, she hands the phone to a sweaty stevedore

482
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,300
named Bill, and the rest of the evening is pure hell.

483
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,540
You know, the funny thing is...

484
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,300
The funny thing is I just gave out the number of Jesus.

485
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,880
And actually, it's Mary Magdalene is the beautiful, naked woman that we're going to pick up the

486
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:29,880


487
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,200
Well, we know that Our Lord and Mary Magdalene were fond of fuzzing the fur, as they used

488
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,020
to say in Judea in the old age.

489
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,120
And I think you might interrupt them at a tragic moment if you call that number.

490
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,140
And what is that number again to call them at a tragic moment?

491
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,440
888-669-2323.

492
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,320
You know, they're going to be going, damn, that sang gave her number out over the radio,

493
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,700
and two people called up.

494
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,080
Call it any time.

495
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,420
Call now.

496
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,780
It's like 4 in the morning in Bulgaria where they are, the new foundation headquarters.

497
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,100
Well, we just interviewed one of the whistling women of the Bulgarian chorus, and she actually

498
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,160
played a little Gillette shaver.

499
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,500
And she could shave her mustache to hit the high notes.

500
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
And here's a type of her now.

501
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,480
Isn't that funny?

502
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
Now, look at that incredible headdress she's wearing.

503
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,700
You know, it's amazing how Europeans sometimes resemble like tribal cultures, I'd say, in

504
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,200
South America.

505
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,200
Thank you very much.

506
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,600
Thank you.

507
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,040
Are those real feathers or are those someone else's under...

508
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,640
Well, they're a certain kind of a feather that is a part fur and then the other part

509
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,160
is feather.

510
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,020
As I look now, I can see that these are actually bark-stained underpants that you have...

511
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,340
Under things.

512
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,680
Things crawling beneath the surface.

513
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,080
How in the world could you have ever seen my under?

514
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,460
My unders are under all of my skirts.

515
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,580
How in the...

516
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,320
Do you have x-ray vision?

517
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,680
Under things.

518
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,900
Under the mind.

519
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,940
Oh, Hans.

520
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,100
Submental.

521
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,360
You look...

522
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,380
Subgenius, in fact.

523
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,760
So lovely to find.

524
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,040
Subtemporal.

525
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:09,620
And what shall we do with old man time who keeps dragging us along with his fitful pace?

526
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,280
Take the toilet plunger and plunge it in his eyes.

527
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,060
Where is time control?

528
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:22,660
How can we skip away from this poor boring now and leap, leap ahead, back on the road?

529
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:22,660


530
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,640
Or back, yes, back, why not?

531
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,120
Yes, it's the 99%, isn't it?

532
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,400
That one little tenth of a thousandth of a millionth of a percent that makes you less

533
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,900
than human.

534
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,400
Isn't that what it is?

535
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,340
And as you climb in the door there, you think you'll be saying goodbye to this earth.

536
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,180
But no, no, you'll come back again.

537
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,180
You'll come back again.

538
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,600
Oh, it's not enough to smash your watch.

539
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,060
It's not enough to buy every new clock that will be on the subgenius catalog soon.

540
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:49,560
No.

541
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:49,840
No.

542
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:49,840


543
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,340
Just to prove your independence from time, your rebellion against God time.

544
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,960
The evil time god.

545
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,120
You know, it's all for the time being, they say.

546
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:09,760
That cruel taskmaster of the sky with a long white beard made of time pieces.

547
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,060
The tick.

548
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,260
The tick.

549
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,960
The tick.

550
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,040
The tick.

551
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:16,340


552
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,560


553
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:16,620


554
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:16,620


555
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,740
The tick.

556
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,620
The time being.

557
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,560
And we must bring down the time being.

558
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,400
The time ass pirate.

559
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,960
Ah, Framzee is not a tick, a parasite.

560
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,140
And the acid queen.

561
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,940
Parasite and an ass pirate.

562
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,380
Who is the acid queen now that Princess Di isn't giving money to hookers anymore?

563
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,800
I thought it was Laura Bunchkake.

564
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,600
Did you hear that story?

565
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,440
Did you read about that?

566
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:47,960
About Laura?

567
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:48,880
Yes.

568
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,720
A Plutonian man told these...

569
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,860
A Plutonian man?

570
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,340
We'll all be drinking.

571
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,940
Princess Di used to have men snuck in, in the trunk of cars.

572
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,860
And she also used to go out in the middle of the night.

573
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,380
This is true.

574
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,540
She used to go out in the middle of the night and drive around and give money to hookers.

575
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Really?

576
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,160
Yeah, to help them out.

577
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,460
Did they have the favors to perform for her?

578
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:12,660
No.

579
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,020
Go home.

580
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,920
Go buy some shoes.

581
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,240
Go buy a coat.

582
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,020
You don't need this.

583
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,000
She was a true princess.

584
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,340
It was because they were competition.

585
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,280
I loved this thing much.

586
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,280
I'd sit a week in Onyx Corner for like nine hours at a time.

587
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,560
She made a deal with the aliens and then she didn't pay it off.

588
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,040
Very, very cold.

589
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,180
Especially with February birds.

590
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,240
She was a great person, but she didn't pay off her deal with the aliens and they came

591
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,700
and got her.

592
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,480
She'd come by and maybe rip off a quid or two and I'd be back home with me honey in

593
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,920
a very, very short time.

594
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,100
Look, when you signed that paper with the acid queen...

595
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,780
I loved her.

596
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,480
You got to follow through.

597
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,260
I mean, she was queenly.

598
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,000
In her own sick, unbearable state.

599
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000


600
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000


601
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,000


602
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,040
She's a very demented way.

603
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,900
Go ahead, man.

604
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,440
Bring it up.

605
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,200
Bring it all the way up.

606
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,920
Bring all of them up on all screens.

607
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,460
Go ahead.

608
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,200
I dare you to see what you're looking at.

609
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,680
Go ahead.

610
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,560
No, no.

611
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,500
Don't use that third eye.

612
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,380
Close that third eye.

613
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:58,540
Quick.

614
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,260
No gypsy acid queens.

615
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm getting the hell out of here.

616
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,240
Wild and masculine.

617
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,820
Space man, oh space man.

618
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,940
Come rescue me.

619
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,860
Come rescue me.

620
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,980
It's time to become a psychedelic hologram as we blast through the universe.

621
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


622
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


623
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


624
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


625
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


626
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


627
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


628
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


629
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:15,980


630
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,180
Wearing no clothes and tiny little pebbles of flowers.

631
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,040
Look at all the things you look like frogs.

632
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,600
Now, free, free, free again.

633
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,620
I'm surfing with the aliens.

634
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm setting my chromosomes, baby.

635
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,420
I'm getting out of this earthly humanly garb.

636
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
This only costs 30 bucks.

637
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,180
What a deal.

638
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,860
What a ride, ladies and gentlemen, we're having here.

639
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:45,960
We're going to the moon.

640
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:45,960


641
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:45,960


642
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,220
We're in the genealogy room as we all look out the open port hole and check on our charts

643
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,140
to see where we came from and where we're going to.

644
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,620
I really don't want to know where that character came from.

645
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,300
Some of you don't want to know the character, but you're going to have to drop your chromosomes

646
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,820
in the other room.

647
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,620
All of time is just soaring so fast.

648
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
This room is boring.

649
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,760
Hold it backwards.

650
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,400
Wheel of time.

651
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,400
The ball and chain of the chronometer shall no longer anchor us to temporal reality.

652
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm not a genius.

653
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


654
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


655
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


656
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


657
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


658
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


659
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


660
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


661
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:15,960


662
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:22,260
Iron Man, no ass pirates and no blood sucking parasites like the time being.

663
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Read us for $30.

664
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,100
It's free for $30.

665
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,060
Dave, do you remember the ass pirate song?

666
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,380
Yar har, yar har, yar har.

667
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,680
We've been sailing oh so far.

668
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,720
The acid pirates?

669
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,780
I'm looking for some chunky rump to set me nose on fire.

670
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:49,080
We'll throw the clankers over and drag the bitch aboard.

671
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,640
We'll sniffer and we'll piffer and we'll...

672
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,100
Old Peg Leg Dick, they called him Peg Dick Leg.

673
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,160
Do you remember Ruby the Dyke Queen?

674
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,140
You may mean the pervert pirate.

675
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,320
It's no bigger threat for them having admitted it

676
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,340
than for them having admitted it

677
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,760
and not for them having admitted it.

678
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,720
But I would hope that in context of the recent admission

679
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,320
in which they've admitted that they admitted it,

680
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,620
they've admitted it, but they did in fact admit it,

681
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,560
it could be an important lesson

682
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,320
by something that's really not very useful.

683
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,480
wusapup!

684
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,920
Oh boy.

685
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,120
Rude population

686
00:35:48,120 --> 00:36:06,660
De- Pap remind me,

687
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,900
and I need to update that.

688
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,740
We're apolog Gavin's name right on time,

689
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:13,740


690
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:13,740


691
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,520
Thank you.

692
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Thank you.

693
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,680
Thank you.

694
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,560
Thank you.

695
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,640
Thank you.

696
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,200
Thank you.

697
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,420
Thank you.

698
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,880
Thank you.

699
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,600
Thank you.

700
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,260
Thank you.

701
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,140
Thank you.

702
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,840
Thank you.

703
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,360
Thank you.

704
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,580
Thank you.

705
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,840
Thank you.

706
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,120
I use a program for income tax and for morality.

707
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,060
You use a program?

708
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,100
I have a computer program that dictates morality and ethics for me.

709
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,340
As it does your taxes at the same time?

710
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,080
No, they're different.

711
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,640
They are linked, though, by a fashionable poo-poo stick.

712
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,320
But they are linked indeed.

713
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,680
They're linked by the thing longer.

714
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,420
They are linked by a fascist evolutionary style statement lingering somewhere in your medulla.

715
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,020
The sin of my Bob dangles and ever towards the center of the earth.

716
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,060
Cinema Bob?

717
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,900
That's how you know where gravity goes, is where Bob's thing is pointing.

718
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,820
Yes, it's one of the best ways of finding out, too.

719
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,540
It's within like a fraction of a microcosmic second.

720
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,900
It's been determined by Greenwich.

721
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,280
I mean, at least.

722
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,320
It's the plumb Bob upon which is hung all gravitational measurements.

723
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
The prior original plumb Bob of Wiener Plumbing.

724
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,340
The plumbed Emma Bob.

725
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,180
The shadow from the buttock also.

726
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:47,740
It's the mad Bob.

727
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,400
It's incidental time.

728
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,260
Just sit a reel of Greenwich.

729
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,640
The plumbed Emma Bob.

730
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,040
The plumbed hair Bob.

731
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,720
Hair Bob.

732
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,260
Have we said all we can about his abilities?

733
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,780
Well, you know, it's fairly flexible, I think.

734
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,740
You know where to put the cork.

735
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,440
Yeah.

736
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,680
You know where to put the cork.

737
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,820
You've been doing your yoga lately, haven't you?

738
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,720
Yeah.

739
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,440
They say the days don't move and that there's no such thing as time.

740
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,500
But reflecting on the hours gone by, I know that once you were mine,

741
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,700
then something happened that I just didn't see.

742
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,620
That something took you away.

743
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,340
I never thought that it would ever come to be that I'm back in dismay.

744
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,720
I never thought that it would ever come to be that I'm back in dismay.

745
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,400
But now I know.

746
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm here and I'm standing alone without you.

747
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,820
Wondering where I went wrong.

748
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,880
I don't want to live without you.

749
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,420
Seems like it's taken so long

750
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,060
for me to gather up the words I want to say.

751
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,120
I need you with me, it's true.

752
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,180
There doesn't seem to be any real way that I can ever come through for you.

753
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,140
Let서,ounce and be broken.

754
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,140


755
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,140


756
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,520
Hey, where's the

757
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,540
baby?

758
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,800
Kiss me.

759
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,340
Uh,

760
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,320
oh,

761
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,060
guitar solo

762
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,140
guitar solo

763
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,400
guitar solo

764
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:24,540
guitar solo

765
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,180
guitar solo

766
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,940
guitar solo

767
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:43,800
guitar solo

768
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,760
guitar solo

769
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,980
guitar solo

770
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,080
You shall have as much meat as you want.

771
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,400
portable car engine

772
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,400
'm sorry

773
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


774
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


775
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


776
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


777
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


778
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:13,400


779
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,480
What the devil is going on, Chrissy?

780
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,500
They're dressed like little girls!

781
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,380
You are a sucker!

782
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,440
And you listen to me, and you listen to me good.

783
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,560
The time has come.

784
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,200
It is now or never.

785
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,580
Thou shalt not listen to rock and roll music.

786
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,360
Thou shalt not masturbate.

787
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,820
Thou shalt not fornicate.

788
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,680
Would that, uh, would that appeal to you?

789
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,720
Would that, uh, would that appeal to you?

790
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,720
Would that, uh, would that appeal to you?

791
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,420
Would that, uh, would that appeal to you?

792
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,820
The time has come.

793
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,120
A reckoning time.

794
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,880
A time when all the mighty buildings shall be shattered and splintered and split.

795
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,000
When the world's bellies will broke.

796
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,760
When America will be put to the fire.

797
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,320
And tested in the new revelation.

798
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,500
This is the end of today's lesson.

799
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,600
You know we live in a world where we want instant gratification.

800
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,560
And there are all kinds of schemes out there.

801
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,240
And we are desperate.

802
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,180
We are hungry.

803
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,740
And we are thirsty for something that we can't eat.

804
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,820
And we give us what we want.

805
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,180
It's the process of terminal love.

806
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,460
Thrown into the fire and we are burned.

807
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,160
I like to think ridiculous and preposterous.

808
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,240
I can hardly believe that I heard it on the radio.

809
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,080
It's a pill that has a chance of effect.

810
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,960
It's a word either weak or weak.

811
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,880
It's worth a thing.

812
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:25,460
You must be constantly衆 본 잘.

813
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,580
I like to think, select the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned.

814
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,720
Ah, thrown into the fire and burned.

815
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,800
We very often explode it.

816
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,740
We have already been blessed.

817
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,720
We have already been White Wolfs.

818
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:42,720


819
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:42,720


820
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,800
All I know is that I gotta get out of here.

821
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,720
And you got the gun.

822
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,680
Heart Ignition.

823
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:12,080
And now, back to WCSB Cleveland and ESO Radio.

824
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,900
With this final message.

825
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,220
The message is the message.

826
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:26,080
And when the Lord exploded his messages on the depleted mankind accordion,

827
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,580
he found the message.

828
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,080
God is mad as hell.

829
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,760
And he's not gonna take it anymore.

830
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,600
I said God.

831
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,700
God is mad as hell.

832
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,700
And he is not gonna take it anymore.

833
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,380
See me?

834
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,540
Pay me?

835
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,620
Pay me?

836
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,740
Hear me?

837
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,740
Thank you, Dr. Schertz.

838
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,100
Well, at least it doesn't get his ire up.

839
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,460
That's what I'm glad about.

840
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,900
If it made him angry, I would be worried.

841
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,980
You know, otherwise I think we're just fine, really.

842
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,660
I think we can trust that everything is just fine.

843
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,420
But can we?

844
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:10,600
I don't know.

845
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:11,680
I don't know.

846
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:11,960
I don't know.

847
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:12,040
I don't know.

848
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


849
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


850
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


851
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


852
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


853
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


854
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


855
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


856
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


857
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,040


858
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,060
I don't know.

859
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,420
I don't know.

860
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,360
How do we find that?

861
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,940
There's no need for contrasting opinions anymore.

862
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,080
God is fed up.

863
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,140
He can come over to my house and fuck my sister.

864
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,620
Well, yes.

865
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,760
And I think it's just going to be fine.

866
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,420
I really do.

867
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,180
You'll excuse me.

868
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,740
I have to duck onto the subway now.

869
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:33,760
Yes.

870
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,420
The subway.

871
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,460
Mad as hell.

872
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,900
Mad as hell.

873
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,520
I'm not gonna take it anymore.

874
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,860
No, they're not.

875
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,000
They voted God.

876
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,060
They voted God.

877
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,900
They're not mad as hell.

878
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,800
They voted that they are.

879
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,840
Everything's apparently just fine.

880
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,800
Everything's just fine.

881
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,180
Yes, we will take it.

882
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,280
We are bending over.

883
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,420
Go ahead and...

884
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,860
All I can say is free Willie.

885
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,660
That's three video shins.

886
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,640
We're gonna take it.

887
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,540
We're gonna...

888
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,640
Oh, there he goes.

889
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,320
He freed his Willie.

890
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,960
And they came and took him away.

891
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,600
Where'd you come back, Willie?

892
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,280
I'm sure.

893
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,060
Come back.

894
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,640
I'm just as sure.

895
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,660
Come back, Willie.

896
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,500
Oh, it looks so nice hanging out like that.

897
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,780
But not like that.

898
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,740
The Plumbob.

899
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,320
Let's forget you.

900
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,760
Yeah.

901
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,100
Well, I think it's time for everyone to go to theater tonight.

902
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,960
Find me that way.

903
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,680
I want to see a nice show at Industrial Tractor Factory number five.

904
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,600
Plumbob is plumb...

905
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,000
Bobbed!

906
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,800
I love these Chechen movies.

907
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,220
Put your hand down here.

908
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,000
It's not a movie.

909
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:38,760
It's a...

910
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,020
Just take your hand out of my pocket.

911
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:40,340
Okay.

912
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,120
I'm taking this Chechen terrorist woman to my left.

913
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,760
That's it, baby.

914
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,560
To put my hand on the popcorn.

915
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,260
Yeah, there's a quarter down there somewhere.

916
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,680
You're not a Chechen woman.

917
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,220
You're a hairy Chechen man.

918
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:52,960
I'm telling you, there's a quarter down there.

919
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,300
I don't want your...

920
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,900
And then she put her hand out, holding his mighty credit card.

921
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,760
And there's the beautiful flotilla of the Virgin Larry is making its way down the street

922
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,440
with all the apostolates and the other subcrimes.

923
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:08,140
Bye.

924
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,540
Smoking the apostrophes.

925
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,180
They've been given by their dear, dear, dear lord, a fanny man who used to write them

926
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,020
efficaciously once every summer as they cramped away off of their wilderness huts.

927
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,580
But now it looks like some of them are actually rolling in the dough as they begin to make

928
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,060
a huge human pie out of the...

929
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,080
That looks messy.

930
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,060
It is.

931
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
It's very messy.

932
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,420
You don't want to get your feet too close to the middle.

933
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,400
There's four and twenty blackbirds in there.

934
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,760
Oh, no.

935
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,760


936
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,760


937
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,760


938
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,760


939
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,760


940
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,120
Man.

941
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,140
And there's also a dead saint which comes back.

942
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,600
The blood boils every August 22nd before the feast.

943
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:54,060
Freedom is laid to rest in the grave of history.

944
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:00,420
The human gene which once stretched across the globe and threatened to the solar systems

945
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,060
and the skies beyond is humbled now like a little drained of itself worm laying in a

946
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,540
pool of mossy shit.

947
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,700
Things will be better.

948
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,020
Yeah.

949
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,680
Somewhere else.

950
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:18,460
Lower the coffin of the spirit of man.

951
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,740
And you will be after the man.

952
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,040
Shovel the earth on top.

953
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,740
From the ashes like a phoenix to sun.

954
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,840
Someone I think would come back.

955
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,560
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

956
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,220
So endeth all things.

957
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:38,700
Would you like a little bite of his...

958
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:39,640
Ankle?

959
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,480
There is much.

960
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:44,180
Pain and gnashing of teeth.

961
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,140
You could put a little bit of raisin butter on the ankle there, you could.

962
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,460
Oh, man.

963
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:52,920
Time to get up.

964
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,400
Oh, oh, oh.

965
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,180
Time to get up.

966
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,100
Get out of that coffin.

967
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:56,600
Time to get up.

968
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:58,080
You've been resurrected.

969
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,800
Get out of that coffin.

970
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,440
Throw away the stone and get to work.

971
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,020
Who's playing the butt trumpet?

972
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,860
Well, the first thing we're going to be doing, we're going to be working on building back

973
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,260
some of that flexibility you've been losing over being dead for the last 20 years.

974
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,760
That's what you're doing.

975
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:11,760


976
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:11,760


977
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:11,760


978
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,700
That's what you think is happening.

979
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,700
You're all kind of scrunched up.

980
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,520
You're still...

981
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,260
Look at yourself.

982
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:20,620
You need to do 25, 26, maybe 27 light year push-ups.

983
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:21,840
Come on, Norton.

984
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,020
Get down the narrow fives.

985
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,160
Let's see you do them.

986
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:24,520
Do them.

987
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:24,740
Do them.

988
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,800
We're satisfied as hell and we are going to take it.

989
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,820
Please do.

990
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,360
Evermore.

991
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,060
Please give it to us.

992
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:33,620
Please punch.

993
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,500
Just give it to us.

994
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,420
We were hoping we could have a big war, you know.

995
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,540
Please just do it.

996
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,200
And we just hope they take my soul.

997
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,920
Social security.

998
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,080
And get a bunch of them crack-bite right-wing guys on the Supreme Court, you know, eh?

999
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,620
And let's see, homeland security.

1000
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,580
Oh, yeah, I was hoping I could get stopped every three blocks.

1001
00:56:52,660 --> 00:57:02,360
And that's why I was one of the 37% of American registered voters who showed up to wave my fist in the occult sky

1002
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,880
and smack myself firmly between the genital areas.

1003
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,780
I'm so glad.

1004
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
I was the first.

1005
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,780
And now I'm...

1006
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,900
Well, you hear the dogs.

1007
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,180
Don't you?

1008
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:11,980
We better get out of here.

1009
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,020
Oh, here they come.

1010
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,580
Here they come.

1011
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,440
There were only 37 percenters total.

1012
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,780
I voted the wrong way, man.

1013
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,540
Here they come.

1014
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,000
It's those giant crickets.

1015
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,500
The tag glows.

1016
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,060
They're going to kill us.

1017
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,000
They can see the tag, man.

1018
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,880
Just keep moving.

1019
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,000
Cover up your arm.

1020
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,960
Till next week, keep your head on tight.

1021
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,460
You're back to the wind and you're sack in the saddle.

1022
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,960
Mr. Butch says his man.

1023
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,760
Today means lots of fun for the people on top of the pie.

1024
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,640
I hate it.

1025
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,820
For those squanderlings laying down near the bottom.

1026
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
There won't be much pie left.

1027
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,480
There's only coming for the gravy.

1028
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,520
I want to know what I learned.

1029
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,900
Like a diamond in the sky.

1030
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,020
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

1031
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,180
How I wonder.

1032
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,480
Wonder what you are.

1033
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,420
You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1034
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,480
Produced by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1035
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:32,600
My address is P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1036
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,180
But you can write for more information for free.

1037
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,880
Paper information from the Church of the Subgenius at

1038
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,160
Post Office Box 20418.

1039
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:47,760
Or call the office at 204-206 Dallas, I mean Austin, Austin, Texas 78720.

1040
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,540
Yes, the office move.

1041
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:57,140
Again, that's P.O. Box 204-206 Austin, Texas 78720.

1042
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,620
As seen on www.subgenius.com.

1043
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,360
How a vag понимania barrels full of

1044
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,360


1045
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,800
How it.

1046
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,600
All right.

1047
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,840
Thank you.

1048
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,960
So you really hope to do some work there.

1049
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,020
Paige in free, what's awesome is I know.

1050
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,020


1051
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:41,880
like in a slaughterhouse.

1052
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,660
I wish you'd seen it.

1053
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,680
I want to get a picture.

1054
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,220
Well, you better get to bed now, son.

1055
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,300
Have a good sleep.

1056
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,900
In the middle of the night?

1057
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,100
Yes.

1058
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,740
So now you listen

1059
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,620
and you listen good.

1060
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,040
Have a good sleep.
