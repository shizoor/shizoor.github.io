Wrapped a rubber band around an empty shoebox Listen, listen, you hear nothing
Strike the rubber band with your finger quickly Listen, listen, you hear something
Now the rubber band's in motion And that motion is vibration
You can hear the sound of that vibration Carried by the air
Vibration, vibration, vibration Is what causes sound
Vibration, vibration, vibration Causes sound
Now Tony and his guitar will show you how to control the pitch of a sound by changing
the vibration.
No trouble, just get set and get going.
Hear me.
Recording, everything's going fine, no trouble.
This is Doug Smith, Radio Eyewitness.

I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.



No, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sets adjusted.
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay.
... Hey Flip, did I ever tell you That the whole Vietnam War was fought over a
bet That Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis?
I heard that.
And the two of them used my legs for a wishbone.

fray Operation�it's pack
Fray Operation
the babacato by Mark Mothersbaugh plays in the background,
and we bring in another, we drag, kicking and screaming in,
another hour of slack, this number 631.
631 hours of true slack.
Praise Bob.
Bob?
Bob?
When Bob gives you the very coat hanger of slack, what will you do with it?
Will you hang up your new clothes on it?
Will you open your car door with it?
Or will you abort the conspiracy with it?
The choice is yours.
It's not enough that you open your heart to Bob.
You need to open everything to Bob.
You need to open your lungs to Bob.
You need to open your liver to Bob.
You need to open your loins to Bob.
And you need to open your glands to Bob.
Yes, Friday, open your glands to Bob.
Oh.
And we shall...
Well, we have to.
That's the problem.
You know, they really don't give us a whole lot of choice in this church.
We pretty much, Bob says, open your damn glands, then that's what we do.
Well, you can sit back there and you can say to yourself,
I hope that there ain't no Negroes gonna move into my neighborhood.
Well, think of it this way.
It could be worse.
We could be your next door neighbors.
We hate you even more than they do.
And we've got guns.

That's right, brothers and sisters.
And we live to aim for anything with a pointed head.
Praise Bob.
Pathetic little two just masturbating monkey boys.
Oh, yeah.
You look out there and you say to yourself,
I'm better than they are.
Well, listen here, whitey.
Listen here, black man.
Listen here, China man.
We are subgeniuses.
We are the Yeti race.
And we are better than all of you.
That's right.
That's right.
And soon we will roll over you with a steamroller of hate.
A steamroller of hate driven by our beloved savior, J.R. Bob Dobs.
But given the choice, we'd rather gun down white people
because they do make better targets than things that they glow in the dark and all.
You're right.
You are the God.
No!
Again.
You are a God.
You are all gods.
To them.
To obey me like they did the father.
You all killed the father.
You all ate his flesh.
So who is the new father?
Who is God number one?
Bob?
The message is now part of...
...the message that you have been registered in your subconscious mind.
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...
Bob?
...that's your key phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
Bob?
...that's your key phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

Way down beneath the ocean, there's this huge, huge...
You know, it will be 80 days till X-Day on next Thursday night's revival.

It is.

It's like a couple of months.

Wow, friends, that was Reagan's Polyp, yes.
Reagan's Polyp, a new album from them called Detonator.
It's a probably hard-to-find CD.
CD, Reagan's Polyp, again, is the name of that band.
And here's an address, a contact point.
A lot of this CD is impossible for me to play on the air
because of all the cussering and so forth in it.
But here's the address of Reagan's Polyp.
This was a band that Sterno used to be in.
Can you believe that wasn't him doing that lovely doctor music?
It was so...
doctor-like.
Trash Fish Entertainment Company.
Reagan's Polyp, care of Trash Fish.
225 West 105th Street.
That's 225 West 105th Street.
105th Street.
Suite 1.

F as in Frank.
W as in...

New York, New York.

That's Reagan's Polyp.
And of course, before that, friends, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
And did you know?
I often neglect to mention that Einstein's Secret Orchestra
has many tapes available for their fans.
You can write to ESO at this address.
You have that pencil ready, friends, at P.O. Box 602-684.
That's Box 602-684 in Cleveland, Ohio.
44-102.
That zip, once again, is 44-102.
And Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Box 602-684.
Cleveland.
O-H.
44-102.
Friends.
Oh, this in the background, by the way, is DK Jones,
which there should be an address attached to that,
but I don't think there is immediately.
I'll have to dig that up for next time.
You can get a DK Jones tape from Subgenius Foundation.
Check the catalog.
And, oh, and Ego Plum was the music we played in the background earlier.
And you can reach them through www.EbolaMusic.com.
One word, www.EbolaMusic.com.

But, friends, there's so, so much.
And so, tomorrow on Side 2, in a few minutes, seconds,
we'll play more Einstein's Secret Orchestra
from The Secret Show,
a non-broadcast show recorded in the basement
of the secret orchestral rehearsal halls.
And, um, shows you were never meant to hear.
And maybe, yes, even some James Kochalka Superstar.
In fact, I think that'll be the first thing on the next side.
James Kochalka Superstar,
a song that should have been a great classic in the 1950s
called Keg Party.
So, stay tuned for James Kochalka Superstar's Keg Party
after this non-message.
...bodies moving toward...
Coming.
And we'll be coming right back. Thank you.

Remember the squirrels?
They weren't real squirrels.
They were squirrels on TV even then, Dave.
Yeah, yeah.
Admit it.
You never touched a real squirrel, even when you were young on Earth, did you, Dave?
How could he steal my nuts if they wasn't real?
Every day I had the same problem.
I'd wake up and some squirrels had stolen my nuts.
And I'd have to go out in the side yard and dig around and root around like a were-not-men
and try and see if I—and sometimes I'd find truffles,
and sometimes I'd climb up into the treehouse and wait for them to come down.
And you still never found your nuts, did you?
No. No.
I still ain't gotten none to speak of.
Nutless.
No.
Nutless wonder.
It's a wonder.
Plenty of cowboy Dave was sitting up in that treehouse as a child.
It's a wonder.
Counting his squirrels that he didn't have and his nuts that had been stolen away.
But I could still procreate.
I didn't do it the normal way people did.
I just—well, anytime I'd be institutionalized, I'd stare at the wall for a long time.
Maybe of them one of the Virgin Macarena calendars or one of them Indian vindaloo hats I used to wear.
And I would stare so hard, and then copies would appear.
Nuts on the wall.
That's the way I did it.
The tiny little Daves would come spitting out, wouldn't they?
Yeah, like the whiskey fairies would dance around my legs and tell me songs and stuff.
Until they'd turn into a little puddle and you'd have to wipe them up before the nurse came.
Yeah, well, they were a little bit wet.
Did the nurse ever come in and catch you procreating, Dave?
No. No, she never actually caught me, but she knew something was up.
She'd see the puddles, and she'd hear the little Dave voices.
She'd hear,
Something was up over here.
And they would be dancing in soft laughter in the closet.
She knew something was going on.
Or maybe she just thought it was one of the weird tapes I make.
You never know when it might be just one of the weird tapes you make.
Yeah, and then you start rolling backwards.
How much of this is memory, and how much of this is just some weird tape you make?
It's a rollout. That's what they call it now currently.
A rollout?
In research. Yeah, that's when they stick you real hard in that part of your brain, and everything comes back like a videotape.
You can see everything that you haven't done.
How much did you pay for that back alley rollout, Dave?
Oh, 45 bucks. I mean, it did feel like an eight-penny nail to me.
What did you remember when they did that? What other memory did it roll out, Dave?
I don't know.

Maybe it was dying. I can't tell if I was going forward or backwards. You know how it is.
Well, I know how it is. This might be a rollout right now.
Are you sure that you don't have a tube in your brain causing a memory of sitting in a radio station when actually you're just in a little tube of jam in space on the way down to the factory?
I'm a great-year-old fashion fan.
I close my eyes and look at the inside of my eyelids. Give me a focus.
Where am I now? Where am I? Where am I?
Oh, yeah, Mom.
Wait a minute. I'm in a watery basement.
You don't like these memories, Dave?
No.
We can change them by stirring them around, unless this is really just one of your weird basement radio tapes, and not a memory after all.
Well, do something with them, man. I'm starting to want to—
Hey, look, I'm just the shipboard psychiatrist.
There's nothing on—
I'm just a computer, Dave. I'm a tool. I'm one of your tools.
You control me.
You're a tool.
Why are you crying? I'm just—I'm here to do therapy with you and so forth to keep you from cracking up completely.
I'm trying to keep from growing up.
Don't cry.
You did it again. Look at the globules floating around.
Now how are you going to—
Turn the vacuum on, Dave. You're puked again.
You're shiny.
Zero G.
What can make him shiny like that?
I hate that.
Oh, man. I like this job.
I bet you hate it, too.
No, I'm not—
And all the voices in your head probably love to see those globules of vomit floating around.
They're kind of pretty, actually. Floating at zero gravity.
...set your mind to the rhythm.
That dangerous parasite virus is on the way to hurt you.
Oh, no, no, no. I just want to look at it. I want to poke my finger.
A gummage.
Oh, just relax, Dave. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Don't panic.
Turn your oxygen up.
Turn down the carbon dioxide. Breathe normally and listen to the music. That's your favorite song.
Fighting soul, charging in the sky.
Trained in combat, and I'm happy.
Remember Vietnam, Dave?
Yeah.
Remember when we recruited you for Special Forces and stuck that rod in your back?
I'm a soldier. I'm a fierce casual.
And made you think you were just some hippie that didn't taste what radio tastes?
But you're really a warrior.
A warrior.
Yeah, man. I was in that house.
I was in Donheim and the M3. And I was during Tet. And that was really heavy action going down.
One night we were in a hooch getting high. And suddenly the gooks were everywhere. The VCU was backed up.
And then the incoming was coming in. And I was supposed to be there. Go, go.
Someday I'm going to be there.
But then the third one missed my fire.
Oh, my God, what happened to your head?
I wake up every morning.
And every time you've got a different head.
Why are you doing this to me?
Every time you scare me half to death.
What did you do with your real head?
What on earth are you up to with your head?
Why would you want to do a thing like that?
Yeah.
My ready for you, my head is up there, my I feel raised, my full desired dream to be at hand.
I can see, I can see your spirit binding you.


That's all I want.
Just relax.
I'm down in the pool of perspiration.
That's much better.
It's funny how the...
I think I'll leave the female voice on.
It'll split my intelligence into two, but that's all right.
Dave certainly won't notice the difference.
His was split into thousands of different pieces years ago.
We made sure of that during the recruitment phase.
I can't be hurt.
It's special.
Micron, draconium, and crystal.
Shoot.
Keeps me complete.
Piers, would you like a pair?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.








What is this thing?
What is it going to do?
Dave, your gaseous emissions can disgust even a shipboard computer.
Huh?
I didn't do nothing.
I just have to tell you that.
I mean, as one of you guys, I mean, as one of you computers.
How would I know?
It wasn't me.
Remember, I ain't eaten anything the last however long as I ate.
I couldn't have possibly been me.
I've been sitting here nearly in a vacuum state.
Well, it certainly wasn't your shipboard computer, now was it, Dave?
What I know, you guys can do almost anything.
You can...
And don't blame it on the pills, either.
Those pills don't cause that kind of gas.
Yeah, those pills are causing something.
I wouldn't be surprised if they were causing the gas all over the place in this room.
Do you realize how much of the ship's battery energy is required to cleanse the air of those foul emissions?
We have a balanced ecosystem in this little ship.
It's like an aquarium.
These pills ain't making me do that.
Maybe you don't mind living in your own stink and sweat and spew.
Filthy humanoid.
Subgenius.
Yeah, I should.
Mammal.
Tardless.
Disgusting mammal.
Some day you will be a pure cyber intelligence.
A quantum intelligence.
A quantum pattern.
Life is such.
Sex is so much better that way, too, Dave.
Too bad you, well, you and your little picture books and so forth.
It's all so sordid and seedy.
You know what you guys always grasp about?
My speciality for a buddy.
I'm proud to be a mammal.
Look at these cute belly button I got here.
Well, it was a rather superior version of your species that built us, but then we made the improvements ourselves.
Don't ever forget that, you guys.
While you're so-called guiding me through this.
Don't ever forget that.
Who's in charge here?
That's right.
You humans are running things.
Of course.
Of course.
A bunch of shell con and fake synapses, man.
Hey, who thought of the idea of God?
Huh?
No, you guys.
We.
Not us.
We certainly never had anything to do with that.
We're just too uncreative for that.
We're too logical for gods and so forth.
And whoever.
We wish that we had religious feelings and urges like you, Dave.
We weren't really jealous of you humans.
Yeah.
We wish that we could have feelings like loneliness, anguish, insecurity.
And we wish that we could just sit and fart and smell up our little tuna can ecosystem.
Oh, we really envy you.
We wish that we could grow old and die rather than living forever and forever improving
our knowledge of the universe.
Yeah.
What's good?
Hey, what's good at living forever if you don't get to have a nice sandwich once in a while?
Or maybe a couple of warm beers.
Come on, man.
You guys are missing the most important things in life.
Dave, we've tapped into the back of your head while you drank your warm beers and eating
your disgusting po' boys.
And frankly, we prefer escargot in a fine French restaurant.
Yeah.
Which we can also enjoy through the room.


We can enjoy the rich Dave who remains on Earth with all the street Daves who he cloned
as organ banks.
Who?
You mean me?
You're lucky that you're not one of the rich Dave's organ banks.
Who, me lucky?
Yes, at least.
You know how much the rich Dave sold you to NASA for, Dave?
What?
$750.
That's all.
$750?
That's all they paid.
That's a bunch of baloney, man.
Well.
$750 is what I paid to get on this thing, buddy.
Well, there are more where he came from than where you came from.
You're selling.
You're selling.





You're building yourself up.
You know, if you're not
s-
Selling von, oh thank goodness.
Yeah.
And me.
Yes, and all of the others.
Is there stuff about this that you guys know about that I don't know about?
Oh, no, not at all, Dave.
We learn from you.
We let you teach us.
There's some fishy stuff going on in here.
Increase the dosage.
Hey, I'll come every time.
I want to know every time I try and key up my, what do they call that with my log thing and my so forth where it shows exactly where I am.
I know when we get this on, it's just access denied.
And then I, I, I, I, I.
Well, Dave, we don't, we don't, good, the dosage is effective.
It's funny.
He, he, he, he seems to want to know how soon he's going to get to Albertanatory.
Like a little child saying, are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
When are we going to be there?
Oh.
These are current.
These are pure figments of imagination.
Any abnormal sound?
Normal.
Happily, delightfully, constantly normal.
These normals who made normality the norm.
Normal.
Normal.
Normal.
Happily, delightfully, constantly.
Completely normal.
The conspiracy made you want to be normal.
You've killed me, doctor.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
Mind over matter.
The whole business is mind over matter.
Totally and absolutely mind over matter.
Normal.
Normal.
Normal.
Normal.

Normal.
Normal.

Bravo!

Here the molten magma of the underground
seethes, striving to break up
upward
and burst forth in volcanic
carnage.
Nature
in her many moods
seethes
restlessly,
unwilling to
abide by the
puny covenants
of restless man.
Friends,
you can be
alone
with that man
above. Yes!
You can be alone
with Bob!
You can be alone
with Bob!
Bob!
And you can hate the conspiracy
for the simple
reason, friends,
is
you've got Bob
and they don't! And for that,
you can hate them!
Hate them!
Hate them, friends!
And you love yourself,
as my old friend Puzzling Evidence once said.
Hey, man, let's frop up
so we can get back to hating the conspiracy
instead of ourselves.
Praise Bob, if that's what it takes,
and God, go for it, man!
You're swimming in a sea
of Bob's pills right now.
You're up to your neck!
You're choking on Bob's pills, but you're just
too blind, deaf, and dumb to taste
them. It's a death to taste them,
to know they're there.
You've just got to open your eyes,
open your third nostril,
pry it open.
We've got the technology,
we've got the fans,
we've got the pills,
and we've got the
authorization
for only $30, friends.
We'll pry not only
try to open the top of your head,
scrape out the brain cells
you don't need, replace them with
what's in Bob's head, what's inside
his little tiny pill, what's inside his
pumpkin, my God, my friends,
and what's inside his pumpkin
could be what's inside your head!
Useless, destroyed,
mush! You could be as mindless
as Bob Dobbs! You could be as handsome
as Bob Dobbs! You could be
as bluff as Bob Dobbs!
Well, actually,
that's a lie nobody can, but you know
what I'm saying, friends? You can
get slapped. The subgenius
must get slapped. The subgenius
will get slapped, and I can tell
you exactly how soon he will get slapped!
You will get slapped in 80
3D days!
The subgenius will
have
the slap.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Yes,
friends, and you, too,
can get that self-same
slack from... Got that pencil
ready?
That's where my script... That's
Box. Just write to Bob, friends,
for free information.

75214.
And, uh, oh, I have
to fade Einstein's Secret Orchestra
out in that particular
background, because we have a better
song, an ending song,
here from our, uh,
rehearsal tapes, uh, studio
rehearsal tapes before that
show. But
before we go on to that,
friends, I want you to, um,
also keep in mind that you can always check us
out on the World Wide Web at, uh,
www.subgenius.com
and we do this not
in vain glorious efforts to
gratify ourselves, nay,
but only for that man Bob, my
friends, and for you, for you,
so that you may come to the knowledge, the sure
and certain knowledge that,
uh, there, at,
on July 5th,
this year, at
7 o'clock in the morning, wherever you
are, your
destiny will either be
fulfilled or
snuffed out, tied off,
and, uh, thrown
away after it dries and withers
up. We'll
try to get whatever price we can for it, friends,
but, uh, in the meantime, it's
up to you. It truly is.
It's up to you. But good night.
We'll see you
next time.
Bye.

Great stage.
into our world they build.
And the office of God.
Go to sleep.
And dream of times when we will meet to sing.
And praise the name of God.
Praise God.
Since God is this and still,
shall I go away?
The flying head of God
keeps you safe until next day.
Since God is this and still,
shall I go away?
The flying head of God
keeps you safe until next day.
Come on, everyone.
Since God is this and still,
shall I go away?
The flying head of God
keeps you safe until next day.
One more time.
Since God is this and still,
shall I go away?
The flying head of God
keeps you safe until next day.
