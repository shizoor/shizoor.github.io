1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:10,200
The moral climax of this, the culminating and final war for human liberty has come.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,920
And they are ready to put their own strength, their own, they are ready to put, they are ready

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,000
to put their own strength, they are ready to put their own strength to the test.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:28,580
Take that. Because it really ain't how much you say, it's what you say, I got no problem.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,720
And then the reality of where you are

6
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:43,100
brings you back. Hey, what's going on here? The Self Genius Hour of

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,980
You're going down.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,040
Chainsaw.

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,420
I have sinned against you.

10
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,060
My lord.

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,860
Wizzville!

12
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,980
Wizzville!

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,200
I saw sparks fly.

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,660
I heard jets zoom by.

15
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,100
I broke out in a chill.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,180
I had the craziest thrill.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,260
When she kissed me last night.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Wizzville!

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,040
I can out-thank you, and I can out-philosophize you.

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,300
And I'm gonna outlast you.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,060
You think a couple of whacks to my good old boy Gus gonna get me down?

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,740
It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than that, counselor, to prove your better may.

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,780
I am like God and God like me.

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,560
I am as large as God.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
He is as small as I.

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,480
He cannot above me nor I.

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,560
Beneath him be...

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,500
Selasia, 17th century.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
Ah, yes.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,540
You've been having trouble getting me down.

31
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,540


32
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,540


33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,540


34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,540


35
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:28,540


36
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,320
I've been getting any lately.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,860
Well, tonight, dear friends, we're gonna explain why.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,140
Yeah, like you suspected, it's the conspiracy that done it.

39
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,760
That, and maybe you oughta take a shower now and then.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,880
Some hour of slack shows like last week's, dear friends, are all pleasant.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,240
They're all slack-oriented shows.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
You still funny subgenius stuff.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,120
And others, like tonight, are, uh, educational.

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,520
And, uh, you know, I'm not gonna lie.

45
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm not gonna lie to you.

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,280
I'm gonna give you a little bit of a taste of what's in the, uh, in the sense of cons...

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,400
true conspiracy hate.

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,940
There we go.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,800
Friends, like any good and decent religion, our church of the subgenius is, uh, fanatical

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,340
about traditional family values.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,940
That is, if you're inclined to be married.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,660
Nothing wrong with staying single.

53
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Uh.

54
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,200
But for those true yeti mates, true yeti mates, dear friends, who must get hitched

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:41,480
and have a litter or two, the subgenius fully extended nuclear family is all important.

56
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,820
The nuclear family, of course, is, uh, mom, dad, sis, and junior, and Rover and Pookie.

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,860
The subgenius extended nuclear family is, uh, a little bit more than just a family.

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,700
It also includes, uh, auntie, uncle, grandma, gramps, cousins, in-laws, and close friends...

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,000
and their dogs.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,760
The subgenius fully extended nuclear family is even more loving and nurturing for it widens

61
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,220
to also include mom's boyfriends and dad's girlfriends.

62
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,200
And their fully extended families.

63
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,800
So you see that, uh, while traditional, uh, conspiracy...

64
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:33,220
morality, dear friends, uh, says that the core nuclear family is threatened by what

65
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,840
is, uh, essentially more love, the subgenius sees it as enriched.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,860
Subgeniuses, uh, you see, as a result of the healthy exploitation of their own hate squared.

67
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,940
That's the hate of the hate, dear friends.

68
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,200
Uh.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,800
Uh.

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,840
Subgeniuses are much more than just a family.

71
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,080
They're much more romantic, loving, horny, and consequently more friendly and respectful

72
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,120
than humans.

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,680
Most of whom would be just as happy with Chinese-style arranged marriages for all the difference it

74
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,060
would make.

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,000
I mean, they're mostly interchangeable anyway, like a bunch of Barbies and cans who are different

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,480
only in coloration and wardrobe.

77
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,340
A pink has no true yeti mate.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,640
It doesn't even have a true human mate.

79
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,620
It...

80
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,420
It really doesn't matter who a pink marries as long as it doesn't marry an unknowing subgenius.

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:42,820
Now, the conspiracy, the conspiracy of the normals, has dirtied up the concept of marriage

82
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,540
so terribly that many a subgenius couple who lived happily out of wedlock for fifteen years

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,960
find themselves messily divorced within a year of finally tying the knot.

84
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:54,480
Uh.

85
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,560
It's not that they have changed.

86
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,500
It's that they allowed conspiracy expectations into their relationship and that has contaminated

87
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,200
it.

88
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,600
This is one reason that we strongly urge couples to experience several subgenius short-duration

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,280
marriages and consummations before letting conspiracy legalities and legal contracts

90
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,340
enter the picture.

91
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,720
A hundred short-dur-mares, or short-duration marriages, even at retail, are considered

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:24,720


93
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,540
to be far cheaper than one conspiracy divorce.

94
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,560
The rules, you see, were made by idiots who thought that there should be some.

95
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,160
They were wrong.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,660
And your duty is to experiment until you find what works for you.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,540
Just remember to use that rubber until we get the AIDS cures released.

98
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,020
And believe us, friends, we're working on it.

99
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,700
I mean, damn those conspiracy fascist things.

100
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:54,700


101
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,080
Those racist black hearts for inventing AIDS.

102
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,820
And you know why they invented it, aside from trying to rid whole continents of troublesome

103
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,960
non-technoids.

104
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:13,300
They knew that it would severely damage the chances for true yeti mates to connect.

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:20,480
And nothing makes people more defiant of basic conspiracy authoritarian church-state rule

106
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,580
than true love.

107
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,680
A million reasons.

108
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,560
The most common reason why these rioting drug addicts are far less of a threat to the

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,980
new world order than are a handful of subgenius couples who are really in love.

110
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,500
They may not cause as much structural damage, it's their indifference that's so damaging

111
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,320
to the accepted order.

112
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,960
They set an example that others want to follow.

113
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,660
That's why the left-hand side of the conspiracy, the quote, liberal permissive side, does it

114
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,020
best to repress true love using its special weapons, movies, commercials, and so forth,

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
that barrage our society with a fantasy world.

116
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,440
An endless tease in which love exists only for tragedy and sex is something you do to

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,980
be cool.

118
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:18,960
Sex becomes associated not with love, nay, but with approved looks, clothes, taste in

119
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,280
music, and hairdo.

120
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,640
Well, I say that's a bunch of holy hooey, my friends!

121
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,920
A bunch of holy hooey, indeed!

122
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,280
In Stone Age tribal situations, falling in love is discouraged, while all manner of sex,

123
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:43,680
wild sex, is encouraged, because in a tribal situation, love hinders survival, whereas

124
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,120
you want as many babies around as possible.

125
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,460
But you also encounter this in novels of technological societies.

126
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,800
Like 1984 in Brave New World.

127
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,520
Or in Russia.

128
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,140
Or China.

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,380
Or the Bible Belt.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:11,500
Where the full power and authority of a totalitarian state is aimed at crushing the self-assertive

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,080
individualism of romantic love, and such love is a punishable offense.

132
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,600
Because, see, people in love blow everything else off.

133
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,440
Happy people don't need the state or the church telling them what to do.

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,440


135
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,840
They're doing just fine, thank you.

136
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,640
So when you see people trying to tell you how to think and do according to church rules

137
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:40,040
or state laws, you are seeing people so unhappy they literally cannot admit that they are

138
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,260
unhappy at all.

139
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
It's real confused in America, dear friends.

140
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,160
Because on one hand, the con-con, that's the conservative con, or con squared, is pushing

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,420
what they call traditional love.

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,600
Traditional family values.

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,920
What they mean is playing by the rules.

144
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,720
Be normal.

145
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,720
Don't ask for too much.

146
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,620
Then the other hand of the con, well it's actually the same hand really, it's the beer

147
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,000
companies and the TV companies and cigarette and movie companies, and they're all owned

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,760
by the same consortiums, saying, oh screw love, just have sex and a good time.

149
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,540
But only if you're good looking.

150
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,500
If you drink Miller beer and you just won the game and Bon Jovi's playing, then it's

151
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,880
time to party with wild abandon and be cool like a rock star and act like you don't care

152
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,980
what happens to anybody.

153
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,820
Man I could see that hammering away at my kids.

154
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,820
And thus, this rant, dear friend.

155
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,160
The civilizations of the past had some really weird ideas about sex too.

156
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,280
There's a chapter in this book.

157
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,440
Uh.

158
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,360
The Psychology of Romantic Love by Nathaniel Brandon.

159
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,160
Who aside from writing this book I understand was quite a screwed up person himself.

160
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,800
But this book has a section in it which is short and to the point, but painfully clear

161
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,960
and accurate.

162
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,880
We're going to read just a little bit of this history here.

163
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,460
See if I can shift accents so that you know what's book.

164
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,480


165
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,480


166
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,680
And what's, what's me.

167
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,360
The message of Christianity and non-sexual love.

168
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:45,900
The central thrust of this new religion, Christianity, was a profound ascetism, an intense hostility

169
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,560
to human sexuality, and a fanatical scorn of earthly life.

170
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,360
Hostility to pleasure.

171
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,020
Above all to sexual pleasure was not merely one tenet among many of this new religion.

172
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,680
It was central and basic.

173
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:11,400
The church's hostility to sex was rooted in its hostility to physical, earthly existence

174
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,220
and its view that physical enjoyment of life on earth necessarily meant spiritual evil.

175
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,260
Now while such doctrines were already present in the Roman world.

176
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:30,540
In the doctrines of stoicism, neoplatonism, and oriental mysticism, Christianity mobilized

177
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,280
the sentiments behind such doctrines, capitalizing on the growing revulsion against the mindless

178
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,500
decadence of the time and offering the appeal of the cleansing and purifying acid.

179
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,540
The body is only a prison in which the soul is trapped.

180
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:58,180
It's the body that drags a person down to sin, to the quest for pleasure, to sexual

181
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,940
lust.

182
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,640
Christianity upheld to men and women an ideal of love that was consistently selfless and

183
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,140
non-sexual.

184
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,240
Love and sex were in effect proclaimed to stand at opposite poles.

185
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,220
The source of love was God.

186
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,100
The source of sex was in effect the devil.

187
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,700
The source of sex was in effect the devil.

188
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,820
Now get this friends.

189
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,720
It is good for a man not to touch a woman, taught Saint Paul.

190
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,700
But if men lack the necessary self-control, then let them marry, for it is better to marry

191
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,460
than to burn with lust.

192
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,420
Oh dear friends, the sickening, sickening, the horror, the horror.

193
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,120
The sickening, sickening, the horror.

194
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,340
The sickening, sickening, the horror.

195
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,940
Sexual abstinence was proclaimed the moral ideal.

196
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:07,740
Marriage, later described as a medicine for immorality, was Christianity's reluctant

197
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,680
concession to the depravity of human nature that made this ideal actually obtainable.

198
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,520
The medieval church was obsessed with sex to a quite painful degree.

199
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:20,520


200
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,420
Sexual issues dominated its thinking in a manner which we would regard as entirely

201
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,860
pathological.

202
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,120
It's hardly too much to say that the ideal which it held out to Christians was primarily

203
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,320
a sexual ideal.

204
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:42,020
This ideal was a highly consistent one and was embodied in a most elaborate code of regulations.

205
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:49,020
The Christian code was based, quite simply, on the conviction that the sexual act was

206
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,520
to be avoided like the fire.

207
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,020
The religious school rules throughout the Fluct Nations were the same for anyone separated

208
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,640
from the liminal summit of quite a sum fool.

209
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,080
Vdd, however, could icons for the race to even still exist in the Christmas calendar,

210
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,020

212
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:17,060
Vdd, therefore, was established around the cone of doğal abstinence.

ndanήrsthatta兒

214
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,820
performance to the minimum, that is to restrict it exclusively to the function of procreation.

215
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:31,580
It was not actually the sexual act which was damnable, but the pleasure derived from it,

216
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:37,580
and this pleasure remained damnable even when the act was performed for the purpose of procreation.

217
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,760
Not only the pleasure of the sexual act was held sinful, but also the sensation of desire

218
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,580
for a person of the opposite sex, even when unconsummated.

219
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,360
Since the love of a man for a woman was held to be simply desire, this led to the incontrovertible

220
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,100
proposition that no man should love his wife.

221
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:10,440
In fact, Peter Lombard maintained that for a man to love his wife too ardently is a sin

222
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,420
worse than adultery.

223
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,680
It was not a great sin in the eyes of the medieval church for a priest to fornicate

224
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,760
with a whore, but for a priest to fall in love and marry, that is for his sex life to

225
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,560
be integrated as an expression of his total person, was a cardinal offense.

226
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,240
It is significant that the church's most ferocious wrath was reserved not for fornication, but

227
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,120
for...

228
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,640
Now wait a minute, can I say this on the radio?

229
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,480
Are there any Christians listening?

230
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,460
Masturbation.

231
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:44,740
Masturbation.

232
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,340
It is through masturbation that a human being first discovers the sensual potential of his

233
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,460
or her own body.

234
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,460
Moreover, it is an entirely selfish act in that it's performed solely for the benefit

235
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,420
of the person involved.

236
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,820
It is the act through which many an individual first encounters the possibility of an ecstasy

237
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,480
entirely different from the ecstasy promised by religion.

238
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,740
The church's essential anti-sexualism was paralleled by an essential anti-sexualism.

239
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,980
It was the act of anti-feminism.

240
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,740
With the rise of Christianity in medieval Europe, women lost virtually all the rights

241
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,440
they had won under the Romans.

242
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,340
They were regarded in effect as vassals of the male, to whom they were to be entirely

243
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,180
subordinate.

244
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,980
More precisely, they were regarded as domesticated animals.

245
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,800
There were disputes as to whether or not women possessed souls.

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,720
The proper relationship of woman to man was a matter of course.

247
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:44,720


248
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,280
The only relationship of man according to Christian doctrine is that of man's relationship

249
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,020
to God.

250
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:57,620
Just as man is to accept God as his master and submit himself unquestioningly to God's

251
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:07,180
will, so woman must recognize man as her master and submit herself unquestioningly to his

252
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,900
will.

253
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,180
That women should be entirely subordinate to man was justified in part on the ground

254
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,980
that Eve had been the cause of Adam's downfall and therefore the cause of all the suffering

255
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,460
men had to endure thereafter.

256
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,700
Later in the Middle Ages, a second view of woman emerged and co-existed with the first.

257
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,980
On the one hand, woman was symbolized by Eve, the sexual temptress, the cause of man's

258
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,100
spiritual downfall.

259
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,800
On the other hand, she existed in the images of Mary, the Virgin Mother, the symbol of

260
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,720
purity, the symbol of love, the symbol of love.

261
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:44,720


262
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,620
She was the woman who transformed and lifted man's soul upward.

263
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:57,100
The whore and the virgin have dominated the concept of woman in Western culture ever since.

264
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:05,360
To state the dichotomy in modern terms, there's the woman one desires and the woman one admires.

265
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,340
There's the woman one sleeps with and the woman one marries.

266
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,720
In its attitude towards women too, Christianity exhibited this same vision of woman's

267
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,580
profound antagonism to a love relationship that integrates desire and admiration, physical

268
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,840
and spiritual values, and which is based on the essential equality of the partners.

269
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:34,840
On the deepest level, Christianity has always been a fierce opponent of romantic love.

270
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,080
The pursuit of one's values, the exercise of one's judgment in the conduct of one's

271
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,980
life and the enjoyment of sexual pleasure, all are acts of self-assertion entailed in

272
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,440
the choice and experience of a romantic relationship.

273
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,300
All were condemned by Christianity.

274
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

275
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:08,000
From a little history thing, from the psychology of romantic love by Nathaniel Brandon, which

276
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
we just sort of stumbled upon.

277
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,980
Ah, yes, ah, yes.

278
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,040
And, uh, well, uh, where are we at here?

279
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:31,640
You see, dear friends, I guess all through history, you see religion and philosophy,

280
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,900
all this basically mental, made-up stuff used to keep the simple, physical side of life

281
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,360
down.

282
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,060
To make it look good.

283
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,460
And dirty and bad.

284
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,220
Where is the slack, my friends?

285
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,560
Where is the slack?

286
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:58,180
Why, in this tapestry of human history, did no civilization simply accept slack for what

287
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,600
it was?

288
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:07,820
Why did every culture take something so pure and simple and then complicate it compulsively

289
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,420
until it was com-complicated and regulated out of existence?

290
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:20,960
You know, you get the impression that, well, friends, I think that those who knew slack

291
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,440
probably got it and just didn't say.

292
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,100
They didn't talk about it.

293
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,320
Because it was that serious.

294
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,300
I mean, you know, you could get killed for it.

295
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,040
Couldn't let the neighbors know you were getting real slack.

296
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,920
And so the slack-filled really have never left as much documentation as the anti-slack

297
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,320
forces.

298
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Because, for some reason, those have greatly outnumbered the slack forces.

299
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,440
Of course, the slack forces aren't forces at all, just individuals.

300
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,760
I guess that's what it is.

301
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,980
There's always been more groups than individuals.

302
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,300
Man, I mean, wasn't it supposed to be the other way around?

303
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,180
I mean, am I missing something?

304
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,760
Or are we just now beginning to get it?

305
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,300
To wake up and realize what's going on?

306
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,300


307
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,220
What the fuck do you want, just to bonehead all the locker rooms with those victors or

308
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:12,220


309
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:22,360
Or they're just gonna70 0000 balanced out at the end?

310
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:22,420
You don't know what's going on rhythmically.

311
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,540
I mean, I'm only doing love.

312
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,980
I don't know if that thing will completely shake, or just, dude, shutBack?

313
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,940
Yeah, hell no, would if I consider that my legacy.

314
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,820
And the only nicely sized thing I think any random man could have any hope are those

315
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,700
same fat millionaires.

316
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,660
I guess.

317
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,220
but uh...

318
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
it is good for a man

319
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,320
not to touch a woman

320
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,220
taught Saint Paul

321
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,020
but if men lack the necessary control then let them marry for it is better to marry

322
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,480
than to burn with lust

323
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,280
and the way women were kept down by these uh... faiths

324
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,880
or at least kept apart

325
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,460
you know women were often I think forced into the subgenius role because

326
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,840
well they could develop their own little world

327
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,920
they were kept apart

328
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,540
but they had to kind of keep quiet about it

329
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,360
oh thus the fear of witches all through history

330
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,620
you know come on guys I can hear them saying why can't you just

331
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,560
can't we just have a partnership here

332
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,720
but some guys I think are threatened by women

333
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:33,880
women

334
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,860
women folk

335
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,980
because of the power

336
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,440
that women hold over them

337
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,180
without being bigger and stronger they still have this magic power over guys

338
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,560
because they're so pretty

339
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:55,460
and in most cultures guys are constantly feeling threatened all the time

340
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,220
constantly feeling this endless challenge to their coolness and manhood

341
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,940
I don't know man some maybe maybe it's just bad toilet training

342
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,900
uh

343
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,180
maybe it's just been bad toilet training throughout history

344
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,240
makes all these people so terribly uptight about everything

345
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,220
god I hate it man

346
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,820
I mean cause they've affected me

347
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,120
they've made me uptight about things that I knew I shouldn't have to feel uptight about

348
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,640
I mean at least I knew that much praise Bob

349
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,340
one can get one's instincts back in line if you're willing to

350
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,700
go out on a limb

351
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,080
but the damn church

352
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,180
the damn state

353
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,120
the damn others?

354
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,920
the damn society?

355
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:33,920


356
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,960
Darn them others!

357
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Darn them others!

358
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,220
Now some would say that this terrible hierarchy is mimicked in parents and children where

359
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,920
the parents are the fascists.

360
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,480
Just terrible fascists over the children.

361
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,280
But that's different.

362
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,120
Parents have to be fascists over children because children are children.

363
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,580
I say spare the no when you really mean no and spoil the child.

364
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:08,220
But all these poor kids, messed up, growing into messed up grown ups and there's so many

365
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,820
of them.

366
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,300
That's what's considered normal.

367
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:19,060
It's considered normal and sensible to pray and sacrifice to invisible beings every Sunday.

368
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,260
Did you ever read that classic science fiction novella, The Marching Morons?

369
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,060
Where in that story it's like...

370
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:36,600
Because natural selection no longer is getting rid of the dummies, there's no longer anybody

371
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,460
but dummies in this future world.

372
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:47,240
Except for a few people with what we would call normal intelligence who secretly run

373
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,760
things and keep the world from falling into barbarism.

374
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,980
But they can't let on that they do that or the dumb people will kill them.

375
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,040
Man, I hate that.

376
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,040


377
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,040


378
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
I hate to feel that way.

379
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,360
Because I don't feel particularly super smart.

380
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,460
And that's the whole point of subgenius.

381
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
It's just common sense.

382
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,740
Common sense, that's all we ask.

383
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,820
Just live and let live.

384
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,980
But they just don't get it.

385
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,240
They can't.

386
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,460
I sound like an elitist sometimes.

387
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
That's what's so sad.

388
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,880
You can't imagine how I fought that concept when I was younger.

389
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,000
I was a kid.

390
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000


391
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000


392
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,000


393
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,120
I was an author.

394
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,240
I so wanted everybody to be created equal.

395
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,000
But...

396
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,880
Man, the contrast is just too obvious.

397
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,740
When one...

398
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,440
And one finds oneself doing this gigantic cartoon of all that.

399
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,100
It's like that old subgenius saw.

400
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,760
Think how dumb the average person is.

401
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,620
Well, by definition, half of them are dumber than that.

402
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,940
And I don't mean in terms of book learning.

403
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,020
I mean in terms of being able to read a book.

404
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,020


405
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,220
in either, far from it, I just mean in terms of living, you know, just being able to deal

406
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:12,800
with reality and other beings, I mean, think how much you goof up, then think how much

407
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:21,980
worse so many other people goof up, you just, it's really frightening, you just, you get

408
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:34,700
to where you just have to feel this giant pity for everybody, but at the same time,

409
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,660
by gobs, slack is out there too, and you know, jeepers, if we weren't alive, we wouldn't

410
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,920
get any slack, wouldn't get any of it, and if you didn't have problems, you wouldn't

411
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,960
be able to appreciate the slack when you had it, so I guess it's balance, it's balance,

412
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,680
it's balance, it's balance, it's balance, it's balance, it's balance, it's balance,

413
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:53,680


414
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,460
Aren't we humans amazing, sitting here telling each other, telling ourselves over and over

415
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,800
again that everything's okay?

416
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,380
This is highfalutin philosophizing, signifying, you might say, what I'm doing, friends, because

417
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:20,580
in that this is basic stuff, it's the real, real stuff, and we must express our frustration

418
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,960
with the ugly.

419
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:29,660
others, particularly those of us who do have access to complete slack if only they'd

420
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,560
leave us alone.

421
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,500
And you know, if you think about how merciful we are to them, what nice people we are not

422
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,640
to have become maniacal terrorists or something, or serial killers, how patient we are.

423
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,900
You know, they should just give us Bob and Frop for free.

424
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,460
They shouldn't just make them legal, they ought to give it to us.

425
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,860
If they knew how many of their lives had been spared, I hate to think what somebody like

426
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,500
me, well, like me, not me, but like me with a little less slack and support, no Bob, no

427
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:04,880
Frop.

428
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,900
Man, that's where all manner of nasty characters come from.

429
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,760
Some people fall into these, you know, leadership or ambitious little Hitler roles, starting

430
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,580
when they're kids.

431
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,880
For some of them, they're just a bunch of little kids.

432
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,420
For some of them, their idea of asserting their existence and making up for rejection

433
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,160
in kindergarten.

434
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,740
If they're nice subgenius or Frophead types, their idea of revenge on the world is to start

435
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,900
a band or something.

436
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,140
Or maybe they start a real nice bicycle repair shop and achieve slack that way and achieve

437
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,900
great pride knowing they've gotten the last laugh on the rat race.

438
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,400
But when there's no slack and no support, no Frop, man, and they're not satisfied until

439
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,340
they're leading an army.

440
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,540
And since most of them don't fall into that weird luck like Saddam Hussein and George

441
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,560
Bush, they have to lead little armies, gangs and nasty corporations and hate-filled church

442
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,760
groups and sheriff's departments and pogroms.

443
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,720
You know, it's because the Yetis aired Dear Friends while creating humanity in that test

444
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,840
tube in Atlantis.

445
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,040
We left a blank programming spot next to the squirt and ooze glands in the humans.

446
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,380
And I'm not going to lie.

447
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,420
I don't know if you can type anything into that blank and make them squirt or ooze to

448
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,680
that.

449
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,960
I mean, they won't really squirt or ooze, but their brain will think it's getting the

450
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,600
same reward.

451
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Their Kundalini isn't activated in the slightest.

452
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:38,080
They just get the slobbering pleasure center switch thrown, just the one at the very top,

453
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,780
with nothing else lit up beneath it.

454
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,480
It's unhealthy, man.

455
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,380
Well, we're going to have to go to soccer.

456
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,740
I can't go out.

457
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:49,740


458
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,500
Anyway, I'm going to say goodbye to your show in just a minute here, Dear Friends.

459
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:04,440
But, in the meantime, I should point out a couple of special local events coming up.

460
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,240
There's a revival of Subgenius D Vival July 9.

461
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,100
Some people have been hearing about that at Chumley's.

462
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,560
Now I ain't going to be there.

463
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,360
I'm going to be out of town.

464
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:16,800
Sorry.

465
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:24,920
I'd love to preach but Pastor Buck naked will be there and Tracy Shook and

466
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:32,720
Boy Daddy is actually I think organizing this and it's it's an ACLU. Oh what music

467
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,200
have what what what music have you been listening to in the background the

468
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,160
Doctors for Bob stuff was in fact one of Doctors for Bob that was a Saint Bern

469
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,980
martyr Jean splice who I think I may start up again here in the background I

470
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:57,220
believe there's a little bit of movie soundtrack and also Nina Rota's

471
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,680
soundtrack for eight and a half just then dear friends but tough

472
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,280
you know it's frightening the things that fall into that blank in the humans

473
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,060
squirt glance

474
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:22,400
area like instead of the opposite sex they can be trained easily trained to

475
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:30,780
respond to high-heeled shoes or Jim Jones voice or even Bob Dobbs face for

476
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,380
God's sake now actually I've never run into anybody that messed up but strange

477
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:43,080
strange things can land in that blank now to me you know I don't know

478
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,420
man but fallen even falling in love with another man makes more sense than falling

479
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:58,520
in love with women's shoes I don't get me wrong but I mean really really but I

480
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,560
know y'all love it when we present these historical perspectives on our show here

481
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:10,760
and the sad implications about human nature and gullibility that make it so

482
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,060
disturbing but yet so disturbing.

483
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,740
so juicy and you know we wouldn't pick on Christianity except that that's the

484
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,920
one that picks on us the most it's always in our face Islam is the same way

485
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,980
there's all this beautiful literature beautiful stuff in the Bible and in the

486
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,020
Islamic text and then it's mixed up with the craziest just I mean it's like the

487
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,880
Church of the subgenius you know one minute it makes perfect sense and then

488
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,940
the next minute you're going haha are these guys for real?

489
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,320
I mean give me a break!

490
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:54,480
oh it's frightening how easy it is to make a religion dear friends I was almost

491
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,220
driven to do it I never thought I'd make a lot of money but Bob just showed us this

492
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,720
stuff and I realized man this is just begging to all be put together into one huge manifesto

493
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,060
Bob was right it writes itself even the business and administrative aspects are like a manifesto.

494
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,060


495
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,060


496
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,060


497
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,140
I like that too all the phone calls and answers in the mail they're part of the big canvas

498
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,320
as much as I like to gripe about them and it's like a gigantic painting you know where

499
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:31,100
you don't know what all the details will be when you start but you know how you want it

500
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:40,460
to look overall and I do know how it should look overall dear friends it should make Bob

501
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,840
Dobbs look real good.

502
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,060
Bob Dobbs.

503
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,160
It should make him real good it's gonna make them real bad.

504
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:09,500
testing If you wanna see what wild NPR is I sunlight

505
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,680
down

506
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:09,680


507
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,540
here

508
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,560
But it's alright now, it's a gift

509
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,580
But it's alright, don't you have to ask if it's a gift

510
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,460
I don't need anything but two things in my head

511
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,520
I don't need somebody to touch my heart

512
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,740
But it's alright now, it's a gift

513
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,400
But it's alright, don't you have to ask if it's a gift

514
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,020
I don't need somebody to touch my heart

515
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,540
I don't want to let go of you

516
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,720
Why would I fall right to your head

517
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,520
Just from my head

518
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,760
But it's alright now, don't you have to ask if it's a gift

519
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,180
But it's alright

520
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
There could be bad다가's with the disgust

521
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,420
Thank you.

522
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,540
Thank you.

523
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,660
Slack, dear friends.

524
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:38,060
It's Jumpin' Jack Flash, obviously, by a band called Left Nut.

525
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,200
Ah, yes.

526
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,040
Bob!

527
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,440
Ellen?

528
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,540
Oh, my God!

529
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,720
I mean, Bob!

530
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,780
Right.

531
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,520
Uh...

532
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,680
On Jordan's storm and flash, I'll start.

533
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,080
Oh, who will come with me?

534
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm bound for the promise, ain't I?

535
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,360
I'm bound for the promise.

536
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm bound for the promise.

537
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,300
Wee!

538
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,560
Kiss me, baby.

539
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,900
Kiss me.

540
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:40,700
Let's go!

541
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,500
Kiss me, kiss me, baby!

542
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,520
Let's go!

543
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
One more time, baby!

544
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,820
Let's go!

545
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,980
When I kiss her

546
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,060
I fly out to space

547
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,420
I hear the wildest sound

548
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,360
She sends me through that place

549
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,120
That crazy, crazy place

550
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,400
Let's go!

551
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,680
On a dark, blustery night

552
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,760
Came a large, fiery ship

553
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,020
From nowhere

554
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,980
Seeking knowledge

555
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,160
But only finding truth

556
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,020
The sex bomb

557
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,880
Strange dark pavilion

558
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,120
Incredible sex bomb

559
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,540
Here's a tale that is hard to analyze

560
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,420
See, Dr. Huey was sent to examine

561
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,340
The flesh bomb's girth when it's eyes

562
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,780
Cause it didn't have any eyes

563
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,900
And the dark thing gave him a rise

564
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
And behind closed doors

565
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
You could hear his humble cries

566
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,480
Hey!

567
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,340
Don't hear me, Sam!

568
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,540
Don't hear me, Sam!

569
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,420
Don't hear me, Sam!

570
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,000
Don't hear me, Sam!

571
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,700
Don't hear me, Sam!

572
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,960
Don't hear me, Sam!

573
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:11,960


574
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,380
What is that?

575
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,240
Hey!

576
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,840
Hey!

577
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:14,840


578
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,140
What's that?

579
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,840
What?

580
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:17,980
Hey!

581
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,760
He's got a great life

582
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,920
The incredible sex bomb

583
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,400
Spent six boys dead

584
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
Large and bulbous

585
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,000
He kept it in a bed

586
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Out in the backyard

587
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Where the weeds grow free

588
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,620
They fell in love, you see

589
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,820
That large, fleshy thing

590
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,100
The doctor's best friend

591
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,780
When he caressed a fleshy lump

592
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,720
Wouldn't take much more play

593
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,160
Before he commenced to hum

594
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,660
The sex bomb

595
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,560
Don't let the fuse on the sex bomb

596
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,980
Please, Dr. Reed, don't let the fuse on the sex bomb

597
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,240
Don't let the fuse

598
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,320
Don't let the fuse

599
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,920
Don't let the fuse on the sex bomb

600
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,060
Don't let the fuse on the sex bomb

601
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,680
Don't let the fuse on the sex bomb

602
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,060
And now we begin.

603
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Oh, yes.

604
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,440
Strange Dr. Huey.

605
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,960
That last song.

606
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,880
By a band from Little Rock, Arkansas

607
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,700
called Groove Handle.

608
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,540
Wonderful, wonderful work by Groove Handle.

609
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
And I guess that song is about

610
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,040
our own subgenius

611
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,400
friend, Hell Pope Huey.

612
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,380
I can't imagine who else it would be.

613
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,940
I mean, what?

614
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,600
That's a...

615
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,400
Not the Hell Pope...

616
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,240
Not St. Huey of Dallas,

617
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,500
but Hell Pope Huey of...

618
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,980
now of Little Rock.

619
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,180
And I guess it's a biographical song.

620
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,120
That makes sense.

621
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,040
Yeah, sure.

622
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,540
Why not?

623
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,940
Well, where are we?

624
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,920
Well, we've got 15 minutes of show left.

625
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,380
I've got other...

626
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,460
All kinds of other things.

627
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,360
Oh, ouch.

628
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,520
Okay, that's a little bit loud.

629
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,240
I've got some poetry here.

630
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,740
We don't do poetry readings very often on this show,

631
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,120
but I've just got the cutest little poetry.

632
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,200
Fang here by Psychotex of Fort Worth, Texas.

633
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:38,680
Or Kevin E. White, I suppose, is the name.

634
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,400
Weasel Boy is the name of the magazine.

635
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,460
And here's the poem.

636
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,260
Bagged me a couple of rats.

637
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,140
The other night at my girlfriend's insistence,

638
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,380
I didn't really want to do it.

639
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,620
The boogers don't bother me.

640
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,660
Christ, that's what the cat is for.

641
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,180
But the girlfriend is scared to death of all rodents.

642
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,740
Just mention the word rat or squirrel,

643
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,080
and she gets all nervous,

644
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,100
like she's about to wet her panties.

645
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,600
I gave them a proper burial, though,

646
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,620
dropped them into a paper grocery sack,

647
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,560
and set it out on the curb.

648
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,000
Now, I know that death is serious business.

649
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,280
Death doesn't play around.

650
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,020
But I couldn't help myself.

651
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,200
I picked one of them up by the tail,

652
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,460
twirled him around a bit,

653
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,520
and asked my buddy if he was up

654
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,520
for a little game of rap toss.

655
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,620
I told you that was a nice little poetry there

656
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,440
from Weasel Boy, Kevin E. White of Psychotex.

657
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,380
Ha ha ha.

658
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,980
Because as a dad of the,

659
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,320
uh, Portland Dad's New Slacks Hour Slack Show,

660
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,300
Portland, Maine,

661
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,100
says,

662
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,680
a dupe knows that people will be kind

663
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,220
if you give them the chance.

664
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,620
A subgenius feels that people will be unkind

665
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,440
if you give them the chance.

666
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,160
The system hopes for a miracle

667
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,460
after everything else has failed.

668
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,960
The church hopes for a miracle,

669
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
before anything has been tried.

670
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,020
A subgenius is not afraid to contradict himself

671
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,760
when faced with a contradictory situation.

672
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,840
A pink boy is more concerned with being consistent

673
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,740
than with being right.

674
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,980
Bob feels cheated if he gives more than he gets.

675
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,940
Bobby feels he's simply building up his own life,

676
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,780
and he's giving up credit for the future.

677
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,300
The walking somnambulax prides himself on his independence

678
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,360
when he is merely being contrary,

679
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,920
and prides himself on his teamwork

680
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,420
when he is merely being conformist.

681
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,720
The subgenius employs his defects

682
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,540
in the service of his assets,

683
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:33,700
and subverts his assets in the service of his defects.

684
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,920
The devil recognizes that the only way to save him,

685
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:37,920


686
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:37,940


687
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,540
The only true authority is moral authority.

688
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,620
A god tries to assume more external authority

689
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,340
than his character can handle.

690
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,920
Stang focuses.

691
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,400
Connie sprays.

692
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,080
Bob never tries to hurt people,

693
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,320
and does so only rarely when it serves a higher purpose.

694
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,780
Dad never wants to hurt people intentionally,

695
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,880
but does so all the time without even knowing it.

696
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,720
A mediocritan thinks there are rules for winning and losing.

697
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:26,860
A subgenius knows that every rule in the book

698
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,820
can be broken, except one.

699
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:40,820
He is a genius, but he can't be a genius.

700
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,700
And there it was broken, dear friends...

701
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,380
Will the circle be unbroken?

702
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,820
Oh, lordy, lord, lord.

703
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,640
Oh, lordy, lord, lord, lord.

704
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,600
Well, I could...

705
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,400
In fact I will...

706
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,040
I've got the most wonderful little newspaper clip in here.

707
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,280
You know, we did a big show in Cleveland,

708
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,860
the Subgenius Revival,

709
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:13,000
D-Vival, I should say. Lovely subgenius D-Vival in Cleveland about three weeks ago at a place

710
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,100
called the Smart Bar. And here's a newspaper review of it. I'm not going to read you the

711
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:24,100
whole review because it was actually quite long. And it's written by this guy named Michael Heaton,

712
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:31,020
the Minister of Culture. It's in Friday Magazine of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. This guy is like,

713
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,980
he really is the Minister of Culture in Cleveland. He's the arbiter of hipness

714
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:42,540
for the main city paper, you know, the entertainment section. His is the word of

715
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:53,840
God for those who believe in such things in the cultural world. And he basically, he liked,

716
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,240
he likes the church, I think, although that's not, that's a moot point. We really don't care

717
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,000
what he likes.

718
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:07,560
But he did have some sort of perceptive observations, mainly about the crowd.

719
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:15,060
And I quote here from his review, my mission that night was to get a handle on the subgenius crowd.

720
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,720
This is at a bar where we're a big, fancy, very, very fancy, high buck, groovy, you know,

721
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,120
fashionable bar in Cleveland where we were doing this rather well-publicized show.

722
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,620
From appearances, they were hard to figure.

723
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:37,400
At first glance, they looked hippie-esque. But there was also a nerdy quality to them.

724
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,200
And it was hard to know if the dorkiness was intentional or not.

725
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:50,040
They looked like the result of a genetic experiment that crossbred dead heads with star trekkers.

726
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,280
Many had long hair and bangles. But there was also a science fiction scent about them.

727
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,740
It looked like a self-help meeting of rockers.

728
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,000
Rockers.

729
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


730
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,000


731
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,320
Who read too much.

732
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,260
And that is not a bad description of a cross-section of a subgenius crowd.

733
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,980
If he had stopped and talked to them all very closely, he'd find that half of them were indeed

734
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,400
stupid bobbies, but that the other half would be, well, that's what he won't admit.

735
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,360
The other half made him feel stupid.

736
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,460
A little of this went a long way.

737
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,080
This is after describing the show.

738
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,300
Describes Reverend Stang's rant.

739
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,960
That's me.

740
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,760
And how everybody would shout,

741
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,100
Praise Bob whenever I catch to stop my breath.

742
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,760
Which is a lie, actually.

743
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,280
And any time anything spontaneous happened, like a stage light going on or off,

744
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,040
or Stang found a piece of paper he was looking for,

745
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,500
he shouted, It's a miracle, and the crowd cheered all the louder.

746
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,620
That's not very charitable and not true at all.

747
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,920
But I know where he's coming from.

748
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:00,560
He has to represent the pink's sense of insulation from these things.

749
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,620
Anyway, he says,

750
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,100
A little bit of this went a long way.

751
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,020
After only a couple of hours, I felt pretty stupid and must have looked that way

752
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:13,480
because smart bar proprietress Angela Verdun came over and gave me a smart drink on the house.

753
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,700
I walked back to the lounge area of the bar where I spoke with Gobi,

754
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,720
a long-standing devotee of the subgenius cult.

755
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,140
And, uh, hi, Gobi.

756
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,680
Gobi runs the show in Rochester, New York.

757
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,260
Hi, Rochester.

758
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,000
She offered a synopsis.

759
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,240
She said,

760
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:33,660
I don't know why they keep dragging Star Trek into this.

761
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,700
They're intellectual misfits, she said.

762
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,600
Some of them may in fact be geniuses,

763
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,880
but they're so messed up they can't make use of their genius.

764
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,140
They're the kind of people who have never fit in anywhere

765
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,280
and as a result have spent a lot of time alone making video or audio tapes,

766
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,160
playing with computers, doing postal art,

767
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,060
reading science fiction, or watching Star Trek.

768
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,800
I don't know why they keep dragging Star Trek into this.

769
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,580
Deep down inside, they're really messed up because of something that happened to them

770
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,480
a long time ago when they were kids.

771
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,240
Something really traumatic, I asked, suddenly full of compassion.

772
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
Or not so traumatic, Gobi replied.

773
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,100
Like having to wear glasses.

774
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh yes, dear friends, and uh,

775
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,080
Whoa, where's my background?

776
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,740
Where's my background?

777
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,320
There it is.

778
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,020
Ah.

779
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,320
Oh yes.

780
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,760
Um.

781
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,580
Before I go too much farther, I suppose I should let you know

782
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,220
just what you've been listening to if this is the first time you accidentally turned in, tuned in.

783
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,460
And I love to think of people who are just driving down the road

784
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,920
and, and uh, scanning the dial and they hear a little bit of this

785
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,220
and they go, that sounds like a crazy, crazy religious program.

786
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,820
And then they listen for a minute

787
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,260
and, and they pull over to the side of the road

788
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,220
and they call us here at the station and go,

789
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,240
what are you?

790
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,060
What are you?

791
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,780
I've been waiting for this radio show all my life.

792
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,600
And we tell them and they always forget to listen next week because you're drunk, aren't you?

793
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,640
Ah, yeah, I know.

794
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,580
I know how it is.

795
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,300
I'm not.

796
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,960
Lips that will touch, that have touched the bottle will never touch mine.

797
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,880
That's what I say.

798
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,900
Uh, but um, I understand.

799
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,800
Believe me.

800
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,220
Yes, believe, oh, and as I was gonna say, you can get free information.

801
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:30,220


802
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:30,220


803
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:30,220


804
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,120
From and about the church of the subgenius,

805
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,400
because that's what you're listening to.

806
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,600
This is the radio ministry

807
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,460
of the church of the subgenius.

808
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,900
The Hour of Slack

809
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,860
radio ministry.

810
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:51,180
And you can get free information about all the many, many other activities and things of the church.

811
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:58,980
If you will but write to this post office box number.

812
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,420
Do you have that pencil ready?

813
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,180
I bet you do.

814
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,060
You can't hide from Bob, dear friends.

815
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,600
You cannot hide from Bob.

816
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:22,440
Because Bob is at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

817
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,380
And I'll give that again.

818
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,360
Now that you know I'm really doing it.

819
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,680
It's Bob.

820
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,900
I'm not Bob.

821
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,940
I'm just, I'm just a preacher for Bob, friend.

822
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,040
But you can get your message to Bob and he'll send you a lot of free stuff.

823
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,620
Catalogs and things.

824
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,240
Information in return.

825
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:54,560
From Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

826
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,800
Ah, yes.

827
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,880
And uh, how's it going?

828
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,620
I'd especially like to thank uh, Dr. Gene Splice.

829
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,180
Who provided all the Doctors for Bob music that has been heard in the background.

830
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,240
Oh yes.

831
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,420
You can't hear your own ears, dear friends.

832
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:19,420
But listening real close to this show is probably about as close to that ideal as you're ever, ever, ever gonna get.

833
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,900
And I think we'll just close out with this lovely piece of music.

834
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,880
Which is somehow in keeping with the idea of the show.

835
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,320
With the overall theme of tonight's show.

836
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,320
This has been your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

837
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,280
Praise Bob and let there be Slice.

838
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,580
I had once more, he peeps.

839
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,820
Just had some boys.

840
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,920
She's got more to play with in the way of toys.

841
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,460
Ladies eyes go off and on with her finger full of glue.

842
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,640
Her lips are drawn upon her face and come to me tattoo.

843
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,880
Creamy suntan color that face.

844
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:34,020
Fades when she prays.

845
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,480
Paper dresses catch on fire.

846
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,300
And you lose her in a haze.

847
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,020
Don't you ever change, lady.

848
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,180
He likes you that way.

849
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,580
Because he's just had his hair done and he wants to use her wig.

850
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,720
He's going off the drug because his veins are getting big.

851
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,780
He wants to sell his paintings.

852
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,040
But the market is slow.

853
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,720
They're only paying him two grams now.

854
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,040
For a one-man abstract.

855
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,920
They're making the change.

856
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,340
I won't take back her voice.

857
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,340


858
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,340


859
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,340


860
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,340


861
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,520
Oh yeah.

862
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,220
He's notice I think you're a NBC star.

863
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,440


864
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,160
But really the bullshit about your, a, you're making almighty heart damage.

865
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,800
You are your own best toy to play with

866
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,620
remote control hand

867
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,800
Made for each other

868
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,700
Made in Japan

869
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,620
A woman with a greasy heart

870
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,560
Automatic man

871
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,940
Don't ever change people

872
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,500
Your face will hit the fan

873
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,360
Don't ever change people

874
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,740
Even if you can

875
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,320
Don't change before the empire falls

876
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,660
You've laughed so hard you cracked the walls

877
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:53,060
You say goodbye for I may never see you again

878
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,300
Diamond plus, it be diamond

879
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,860
Thifer in the middle of a laboratory

880
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,500
Two oz of親 ado

881
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:22,760
I'm back. It's time for the fun part of our program. We've got a most amazing pile of

882
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:28,500
profundities here for you, but more embarrassing than any of these is the battle of the callers.

883
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,500
In just a few minutes, I'm going to give out that secret call number once again,

884
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,440
and those of you who already know it will have a little bit of a jump on the ones that don't,

885
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,180
and we'll have the battle of the callers in the slathering red-hot mud tub,

886
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:46,440
then hot buttered martinis for the winner, and a six-year jail term for the lizard.

887
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,220
So let's get going and enter the pit of embarrassment.

888
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:09,240
Okay, kid-a-roonies, it's number one, the battle with the giant squid. So lower them down,

889
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,060
and let's hope those suck.

890
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,980
Those with their little spikes inside don't lacerate his flesh too much,

891
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,140
so they can't enjoy what's about to happen to all he loves.

892
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:25,860
And so the sad sub-dinis went on their way into the future, which was sort of scary.

893
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,060
Poor baby.

894
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,100
They had to start the tape histories all over again, because all the other tapes were not there anymore.

895
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:40,840
That's when all the neighborhood housewives were talking about Mr. Dobbs. They knew he was a

896
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,160
loner.

897
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,360
They knew he was a loner and unhappy, in need of tenderness.

898
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,280
Mr. Dobbs called for you this afternoon.

899
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,100
He did?

900
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,020
Yes.

901
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:55,480
Well, I wasn't there. I had to go out. I was going to go out and have dim sum, but my audition turned out to be better than I thought.

902
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,320
Please, please, please, please, please.

903
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:09,940
As for this other young bit of fluff, the thunderstorm will wash her right down the drain.

904
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,160
Isn't she just a passing fancy, a little vulgar, and really too old for him anyway?

905
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,220
Uh-huh.

906
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,040
Hmm?

907
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,260
Yep.

908
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,000
Folks, I'm a loner and unhappy, in need of tenderness.

909
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:33,200
So, all you unmarried ladies out there, my address is 2746 King Street, Bennington, West Virginia.

910
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,440
The ground of grass.

911
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,180
Any Amy sort of Sarah?

912
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:40,560
Hey, Gary!

913
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:40,880
Hey, Gary!

914
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,480
Miss Joanne.

915
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,460
Are you listening, Gary?

916
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,660
Bong cuckoo.

917
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,560
Can you hear the bong cuckoo show of the hour?

918
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,360
You know, it's wonderful that we get to go over to Castle Cabofram, but it's causing a serious problem for me.

919
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,020
24-hour Xerox shop up the street, they're listening.

920
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,000
Wow, I didn't know that. I thought they shut it up.

921
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,580
Can they get paid on pearl frisbees?

922
01:01:59,640 --> 01:01:59,980
No!

923
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,460
Oh, excuse me.

924
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,240
You know, as I said, I have to teach troubled teens tomorrow.

925
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:07,560
Ah!

926
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,860
And, uh, this way I'm not gonna have any trouble.

927
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,260
I'm not gonna have any sleep.

928
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,840
If we go over to Cabofrat's, I mean...

929
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,320
It'll be quite the problem.

930
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,380
Oh, what'll I do?

931
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,340
And then suddenly it was dawn.

932
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,320
And after that, I have to go to a clean and sober party.

933
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:32,540
Oh, I'll have to hobnob over a barrel of ginger ale with my peers, who have all given up

934
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,640
doing all the things that I still do.

935
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:34,920
The special Alli Meady stuff?

936
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,800
Way out in...

937
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,840
Way out in Alli Meady.

938
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:38,580
Yeah.

939
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,740
It's just the...

940
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:40,840
It's just the...

941
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


942
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


943
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


944
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


945
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


946
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


947
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


948
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


949
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


950
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:40,840


951
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,660
It's just the way it is.

952
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,760
Well, it was described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

953
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,240
You know, we messed up the whole time stream with that dumb time travel experiment.

954
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,440
That's right.

955
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:49,440
