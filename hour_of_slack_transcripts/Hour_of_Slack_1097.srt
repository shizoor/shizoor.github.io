1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Men and women of all races and creeds pause to destroy the earth.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:14,420
This is the story of the subgenius power of the sun.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,960
It still seems warm, still living out its useful days.

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,640
It can adjust to circumstances. It can endure with an immortality all its own.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,380
It can overcome obstacles, split rocks apart and travel far in search of water.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,380
All across the American continent, thousands of people contribute to this journey.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,400
They were known as nuts.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,320
But let him who says this look into his own heart and produce for us a thought

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,420
that will warm the hearth of a friend or endure a thousand years.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,400
I'll be joining you soon.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,280
For more transcribed stories from the Reader's Digest, past and present.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,460
But until then, this is Boris Karloff saying,

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,660
Praise Bob.

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,240
Bob.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,320
We occasionally discuss the state of Bob.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,380
I'm honored to have as a guest today a gentleman whose name is very well known, I think.

17
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,840
Obviously well known.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,860
Bob, this gives me the heebie-jeebies.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,600
Erks.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,160
Erks.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,420
Erks.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,540
Erks.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,620


24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,620


25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,620


26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,620


27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:27,660
Erks.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


38
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


39
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


42
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,840
Look deeper and deeper.

43
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,620
We're discovering more and more things.

44
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,560
Well, wouldn't you want to drive it deeper?

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,780
Am I screwed up?

46
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,360
Absolutely.

47
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,520
Very, very deep.

48
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,540
My career did begin a year 1955.

49
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,500
You just gave me goosebumps.

50
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,700
Stopped at the grocery store and we picked up some baggies.

51
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,320
And so Bob could have something to dig.

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,660
Bob goes down on the levee, starts digging.

53
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,540
There's a swarm of mosquitoes around Bob.

54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,480
And up on the top of the levee,

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,220
the wind's blowing.

56
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,760
Trip.

57
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,580
Bob.

58
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,480
You need to invite people in that don't think.

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
Bob, you know, Bob, you're just continuing to make a bunch of enemies.

60
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,000
And Bob, you can use a car to go out on a date.

61
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Bob, where have you been and what have you been doing?

62
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,440
Bob, I can't thank you enough for sharing your time with us today.

63
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,300
And now, gang bangers.

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,080
Gang bangers.

65
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Presented with federal police force throughout the United States.

66
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,960
History is.

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,240
Tonight, gang bangers presents the case of the fist.

68
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,080
Gang bangers is asked for less.

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,020
You stand accused of conspiring against Bob.

70
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,340
How do you respond?

71
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm guilty.

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,100
There is only one punishment.

73
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,740
Fever, fever, scratchy throat, whatever, whatever.

74
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,940
Seems like a good source of protein.

75
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,980
I suggest you eat it.

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,760
I know.

77
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,680
Go, go, go, go.

78
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,180
Strip.

79
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,740
Yes.

80
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,940
Go on.

81
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,940
Show me.

82
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,020
Give them to me now.

83
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,820
Yes.

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Silent, silent.

85
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:56,960
Ow, ow.

86
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,300
No.

87
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,400
This human.

88
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,040
No doubt.

89
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,000
Severe punishment.

90
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,440
I'd like a chance to defend myself.

91
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,520
He's distorting the truth.

92
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,920
What is this?

93
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,760
Doesn't matter what you believe.

94
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,320
A planet?

95
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,600
You're all perfectly happy to ignore what you don't want to hear.

96
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,140
Nothing like a good history lesson.

97
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,800
I have.

98
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,500
Irrelevant.

99
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,080
Any response?

100
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,540
Food processors failed.

101
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,240
So.

102
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,940
Nothing unusual.

103
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,940
Can you modify a torpedo?

104
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,580
How long?

105
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,040
How long?

106
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,520
So.

107
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,300
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
A little more information.

109
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,560
227 Mark 4.

110
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,280
4,000 meters.

111
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,080
3,000 meters.

112
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,680
2,000.

113
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,320
800 meters.

114
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:23,840
Not.

115
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,760
That is absurd.

116
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,900
Gas giants.

117
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,540
Yes.

118
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,400
Now.

119
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,060
All young people want to do is take up weapons.

120
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,660
As soon as they can hold them.

121
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,380
Six months.

122
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:35,940
A year.

123
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,700
A frozen cave.

124
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,500
Enough.

125
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,300
We're deep inside.

126
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:38,860
We're deep inside.

127
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,120
Oh, please.

128
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,760
You all right?

129
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,620
Perhaps I.

130
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,300
I'm ready.

131
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,920
Leave him alone.

132
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,240
You don't kick a man when he's down.

133
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,740
So.

134
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Stupid.

135
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,340
Stupid.

136
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,620
It bend.

137
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,040
I.

138
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Huh.

139
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,660
Playing my part.

140
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,340
Tongue.

141
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,300
Go.

142
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,940
Thank you.

143
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,840
L-e-t-rick my mother.

144
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,300
A baby stay wait.

145
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,840
Oh, oh, Oh, Oh.

146
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,380
No, no food to drink.

147
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,140
What are they?

148
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,140


149
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,280
Whoa.

150
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,760
You have never been just a circus than aLe Wiggy and ACним.

151
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,500
Wait, what?

152
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,980
I mean all the next you and your Lehrer played been people all the time.

153
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,480
So.

154
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:26,520


155
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,140
I felt that he had just a little too much pizzicato in the Andante.

156
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,980
Uh, didn't you?

157
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,540
No.

158
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,480
Good PR.

159
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,100
Good PR.

160
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,780
Good PR.

161
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,500
Good PR.

162
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,820
PR.

163
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,420
PR.

164
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,700
PR.

165
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,000
PR.

166
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,260
PR.

167
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,540
PR.

168
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,040
PR.

169
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,040
Lumpy and delicate like folding oatmeal.

170
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,760
The news.

171
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm mishandled.

172
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,000
Prime Minister Tony Blair supports PR News.

173
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,000
PR News.

174
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,820
PR's crude.

175
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,320
Wall Street closed, however, open today.

176
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
This is PR News.

177
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,620
PR's bad.

178
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,460
Authorities say they smashed into a park locomotive.

179
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
They found signs of PR News.

180
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,460
Authorities caused a fire and release of PR News in Washington.

181
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,400
Today is a day your life can happen at any time.

182
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,120
I was wiped out.

183
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,740
I fell out of the sky and went back.

184
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,640
I felt upside down.

185
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,320
Chicken soul for the soup.

186
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,800
One minute.

187
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,260
One minute.

188
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,440
Soup.

189
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:27,620
Soup.

190
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:27,800
Soup.

191
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:27,920
Soup.

192
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,380
Like.

193
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Corporate downsizing, restructuring, and mergers.

194
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,620
Like.

195
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,600
We have to adjust.

196
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,200
Like.

197
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,020
Create anxiety.

198
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,960
Like.

199
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,120
So I thought for a while.

200
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,500
Not.

201
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,280
Like.

202
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,640
A man with enormous scope and powerful.

203
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,840
Sit back and relax.

204
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,800
However, be prepared to have something deep inside of you for the rest of your life.

205
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,540
Follow it.

206
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,020
Transforming life itself.

207
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,740
When he's the genius.

208
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,940
Sub.

209
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:56,760
In.

210
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,220
Us.

211
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:00,980
Sub.

212
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,240
In.

213
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,120
Us.

214
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,360
Sub.

215
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,360


216
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,360


217
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,360


218
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,420
In.

219
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,720
Us.

220
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,500
Sub.

221
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:08,640
Sub.

222
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,640


223
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,640


224
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,640


225
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,640


226
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:08,640


227
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,080
And, uh.

228
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,140
I think we heard.

229
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,380
And, uh.

230
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,120
I think we're hearing brain rot in the background.

231
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,060
Yes, it's.

232
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,600
Or is that the CD?

233
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,480
That is.

234
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:22,840
That is.

235
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,220
Psychopath finder is a.

236
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,940
Emotional problem right there.

237
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Old psychopath finder.

238
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,580
Old psychopath finder.

239
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,720
He found the path and then we lost our way.

240
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,320
What is it all about I wonder?

241
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
I mean, where am I going?

242
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,000
We're going to find brain unlimited.

243
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
But what does it all mean?

244
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,460
It means the search for higher intelligence.

245
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,940
A hundred thousand times our normal rate.

246
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,420
It means.

247
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,740
It means.

248
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


249
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


250
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


251
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


252
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


253
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


254
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


255
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


256
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


257
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


258
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


259
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


260
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


261
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


262
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:52,740


263
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,100
It's not just a rhetorical question.

264
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,540
It is.

265
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,200
Brain unlimited.

266
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,860
Why not?

267
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,760
We have the technology.

268
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,080
We have the medical knowhow.

269
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,560
Why can we not push the frontiers?

270
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,380
Push the envelope?

271
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
We have the plutonium bowling balls.

272
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
We have the chemicals.

273
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
We have the psychic spit wads.

274
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,160
We have the connecticated tissues.

275
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,360
We know something about something.

276
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,440
The brain works on a combination of electrochemistry.

277
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
And chemistroelectrons.

278
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:18,960
Something.

279
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,480
Oh, wait a minute.

280
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't we have a.

281
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,720
And we know we're only using a teeny tiny bit of.

282
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


283
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


284
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


285
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


286
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


287
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


288
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


289
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,440
tiny, tiny, teeny amount of it.

290
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,720
Well, most of it's being used up

291
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,060
by the Hour of Slack contributors, friends,

292
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,680
such as Reverend Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com,

293
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,000
who did so many of the collages that we heard

294
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,700
up until it got so noisy.

295
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,680
And from Mr. Fernandanande Lemur,

296
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,940
of course, who always puts the intros together.

297
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,640
And in this case, Reverend Maynard Brainard of Warren.

298
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,960
What is this noise in the background, man?

299
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,960
It's ripping my brain in half!

300
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,300
Oh, that was stopped just when I was about to get off.

301
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,300
God, I hate it when that happens.

302
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,820
See, that's a pluralistic orgasm,

303
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,600
when you have a democracy where everyone has an orgasm.

304
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,920
See, in your fascist theogony,

305
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,580
in your democratic regimes,

306
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,700
only the head imams, the feisty...

307
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,860
Why did he actually portray himself in it?

308
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
You just had to see.

309
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,720
You kind of just had to see what happened, wouldn't it?

310
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,940
He just almost got there,

311
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,280
and then the music stopped,

312
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,840
and, you know, it just wasn't annoying enough anymore

313
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,360
to be exciting.

314
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,960
But it is now, with the help of Zug's Rift

315
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,100
and the Rudy Schwartz Project in the background.

316
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
So, I guess,

317
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,300
what was in the news today?

318
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,200
Iran banned mullets or male eyebrow plucking

319
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,180
because that's all too Western.

320
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,020
Also, body piercing, fashionistic idioms.

321
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,740
Well, I don't think they even know about that yet.

322
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Well, I shouldn't say that.

323
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,280
And, once again, reconnecting the tissue and the collagens

324
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,220
to create new faces and new heads.

325
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,540
This is one that's been a problem amongst the Persian Empire

326
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,940
for quite so many years now,

327
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,920
is the reproduction of inhuman faces.

328
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,400
To create a false carnival party atmosphere

329
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,920
during the Feast of Gorak,

330
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,620
which was not a Muslim saint or sage or prophet

331
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,540
or avatar type guy, or what do you call it?

332
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,340
Can we use those at our X-Day parties,

333
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,880
that face of Gorak or whatever you're talking about?

334
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:33,940
Oh, yeah.

335
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,120
It looks like the old nitrous oxygen,

336
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,440
nitrous oxide specked up.

337
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,680
Would you like to just walk up there

338
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,880
and fill up a balloon, perhaps?

339
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,040
Or if you had a homeostatic bag

340
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,180
you got from your grandmother's funeral.

341
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
Boy, those were the days.

342
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,300
My grandma had one of those nitrous oxide dispensers.

343
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,100
Right.

344
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,920
What a gas.

345
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,200
She was a gas, we used to say.

346
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,380
Her colon would expand at the same time.

347
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,160
Yeah, it was fun.

348
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,940
But then it became less fun when they were policed.

349
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,980
Remember those days when suddenly, you know,

350
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,720
thousands of one-armed guys would break into the room?

351
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,820
Well, we did discover that the hospital padlocked

352
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,880
the gate full of nitrous oxide canisters after that.

353
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,660
Just because of you?

354
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,520
After that one time, that one party.

355
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,380
Sad, sad day.

356
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,300
Sad, sad day.

357
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,620
But this never happened to we.

358
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,640
They opened the doors for her and said,

359
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
come on and get your gas, baby.

360
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,240
But also in the news, the military has legalized

361
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,380
Dobbs Head tombstones, right?

362
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,320
And also pipes.

363
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,580
Or was it witch tombstones or something?

364
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:33,940
Yes, both.

365
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,200
You told me originally that the Wiccans

366
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
got their five-fingered stars.

367
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,560
They finally, after 15 years of fighting wars

368
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,260
against the VA, it was the Veterans Administration.

369
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,380
Well, what about the followers of Khaadu

370
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,560
and the Babylonians?

371
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,120
That refused to allow certain types of religious symbols

372
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,240
on the tombstones of fallen servicemen.

373
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,640
Of the extended middle fingers?

374
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Because apparently some religions weren't good enough

375
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,840
to be displayed, even though the guy might have died for them,

376
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,320
or for the freedom to have those religions,

377
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,140
such as the much maligned Wiccan religion,

378
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,180
which, corny though it may be,

379
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,960
Is still a religion.

380
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,320
There's not a law in this country against believing

381
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,360
whatever kind of foolish nonsense you want to believe in.

382
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,840
That was part of the whole idea.

383
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,800
So of course, if a subgenius is unlucky enough to get drafted

384
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,440
or actually applies for the, as Dr. Leguim called it,

385
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,240
the worst job in the world.

386
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
That's a very small percentage of subgenius

387
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:38,920
actually apply for the job.

388
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,040
Well, actually, that's not true.

389
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,460
I've done quite a few subgeniuses with military backgrounds

390
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,940
who somehow survived and they didn't even know

391
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:45,940


392
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,740
how to get kicked out.

393
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,000
Some of them, like Leguim did.

394
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,040
See, all the guys I knew all got the old 4F,

395
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,980
or they were excluded from service for being...

396
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,040
No, some of them were career guys.

397
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,180
But if they died, up until recently,

398
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,460
they couldn't get a pentagram on their grave,

399
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,260
and they couldn't get a dob's head.

400
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,240
There was like a limited booklet of symbols

401
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,960
that you could have on your tombstone

402
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,500
if you were a dead soldier.

403
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,860
The pipe was also forbidden.

404
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,260
You couldn't have any of them until you were a dead soldier.

405
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,820
But once you were dead, then you could have whatever,

406
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,020
you know, thing represented your religion.

407
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,740
As long as your religion wasn't Wiccan or Bob

408
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,780
or anything kind of silly.

409
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,820
Was an approved religion is what you ought to say

410
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,240
if you're wearing diapers right now.

411
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,140
What do the atheist soldiers get?

412
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,720
They don't need any design.

413
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,300
It's like a little atom or a picco of a microscope or something.

414
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,460
I would say no design whatsoever.

415
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,480
No design, you know.

416
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,900
Well, that's the way it looks to me.

417
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,840
Or there could be a random pictograph of people slaughtering people.

418
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,900
Slaughtering each other with cheeses.

419
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,440
That's kind of a complicated graphic.

420
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,620
Well, it would be oblique enough for many of them to get it.

421
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,860
And they'd say, like, what's it all about?

422
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,700
Where am I going?

423
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,780
Oh, the Discordians would have a gold, a little apple.

424
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:58,700
Right.

425
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,740
And the Cornucopians would also have a...

426
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
What would the Unitarians have?

427
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,640
Do they have a logo?

428
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,300
Yes, they have a logo of a...

429
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,900
A one, a number one.

430
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,680
A cauldron, I believe it is.

431
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,320
A cauldron?

432
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,700
Why don't they just use a goat head?

433
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,140
Sorry, it's a chalice.

434
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a chalice.

435
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,300
Oh.

436
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:14,960
A chalice.

437
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,280
One of those sea...

438
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,680
Is that what they're calling them now?

439
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,140
...religious sea words.

440
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, yes.

441
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,400
I was thinking of chalice.

442
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,280
It's the Eunice of Cripes, as they call it, in the lesser dogmatic religions.

443
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,060
That's the nice Unitarians.

444
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,720
It's actually considered the vessel of the Grail.

445
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,940
Unitarian Universalists.

446
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,560
The Grail vessel.

447
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,740
Or grain whiskey or something like that.

448
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,660
But it has to do with something being distilled into a small container and then whiffed by

449
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,320
the Orificer.

450
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,080
When my son was about 14 and saw...

451
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,060
Jesus Christ Superstar for the first time...

452
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,580
I thought you were gonna say...

453
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,620
...and started to get religion...

454
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,020
You sodomizing that religious picture.

455
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,620
He went and said, he said, Dad, Mom, I want to start going to a church.

456
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,440
And we went, oh God, oh no.

457
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,680
Isn't this one good enough?

458
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,320
Well, and he goes, so what church do you think I should go to?

459
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,180
Because I saw Jesus Christ Superstar and, you know, I have those feelings.

460
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,120
So we said, why don't you...

461
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,400
Oh, the Universalists.

462
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,380
I mean, the Unitarians.

463
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,560
Unitarians.

464
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,880
You love the Unitarians.

465
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,200
So I...

466
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,180
No, I mean a real church.

467
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,280
He could tell by the...

468
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,880
That we...

469
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
If we recommended it, that it wasn't gonna be what he was looking for.

470
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:20,880
It was a halfway...

471
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
So he decided to go...

472
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,000
...a pre-doctoral...

473
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There was a Lutheran church down the road and he had us take him there and drop him

474
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,260
off.

475
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,840
And when I picked him up about three hours later, he said, Dad, it's...

476
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,300
It's...

477
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,180
It made me want to worship Satan.

478
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,800
He never went back to another church again.

479
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,180
And he realized, like Reverend Carter LeBlanc did, and so many others who saw Jesus Christ,

480
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,180


481
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Jesus Christ Superstar, it wasn't God that got him feeling that way.

482
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,700
It was the rock and roll.

483
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:48,780
Meaning...

484
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:48,980
Meaning it was Satan.

485
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,940
And now they're playing Sympathy for the Deaf.

486
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,240
Right.

487
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,040
There...

488
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,440
So there you go.

489
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,580
And that's...

490
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,180
When...

491
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,880
But I'm not saying that Jesus don't rock.

492
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,320
And I ain't saying that Jehovah ain't the rock of ages.

493
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,800
But I'm saying that their fan club is taking some of the fun out of it in some situations.

494
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,020
I certainly wouldn't want to generalize.

495
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
That wouldn't be fair.

496
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,600
We subgeniuses are always fair.

497
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,920
Especially with all those different things you got growing out of the side of your head,

498
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,280
Stang.

499
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,040
What is up with that?

500
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,340
Well, I'm getting ready for X Day.

501
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,160
X Day is coming.

502
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,180
The pinks are bumming.

503
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
Really getting ready.

504
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm sorry.

505
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,560
They're jangling.

506
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,140
I thought it was the things coming out of the side of your head.

507
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,300
They are.

508
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,400
These are X Day preparations.

509
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,340
They're like sparkling and making those sounds.

510
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
Oh, they make you look pretty.

511
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,200
Kind of like an...

512
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,800
I don't know.

513
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,140
Yvette Duggan's look.

514
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,360
How do you do that?

515
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,960
Or what's your...

516
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,520
What was her name?

517
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,540
Back in the 1980s.

518
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,140
1940s.

519
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,500
Now, speaking of tombstones...

520
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,100
Veronica Lake.

521
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,880
You look like a huge...

522
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,420
Never mind.

523
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,400
We were at Veronica Lakeview Cemetery yesterday.

524
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,280
Princess, we and I were.

525
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,240
We were urban spelunking, you might say.

526
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,600
Now, that's a fun graveyard to begin with because it's ancient and huge.

527
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,540
And all those Italian stone masons worked really hard on those huge...

528
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,120
Those big holes in the ground right nearby.

529
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,520
Those huge phallic symbols for the tombstones.

530
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,520


531
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,640
For all the great men who were planted in Cleveland.

532
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,540
But we...

533
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,360
Masonic symbols as well.

534
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,700
We wandered off the beaten path.

535
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,180
Actually, we looked down this...

536
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:27,000
Off of a little bridge and we saw this waterfall off down the creek in the distance.

537
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
You could hear the waterfall first.

538
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Yeah.

539
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,760
And we went, let's sneak down there.

540
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,540
Well, Reverend Stang, to be honest, found a space that...

541
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,220
We found a little bridge.

542
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,780
A little bridge that wasn't roped off.

543
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,500
And it didn't say anything at all about not going there.

544
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,180
And it didn't say anything about keeping out.

545
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,640
In fact, there were a few old tombstones back there.

546
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,460
But there were voices.

547
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,780
You could hear rotting voices and absurd sounds in the background.

548
00:16:51,780 --> 00:17:01,180
Well, we went back in and we found this idyllic, wonderful little pleasure area of limestone

549
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:08,680
waterfalls hidden right near Probability Field Road and near that ancient cemetery.

550
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
But it was so...

551
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
It was this beautiful, idyllic place.

552
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,160
Princess Wee, however, was paranoid and said, you know, this is probably unauthorized and

553
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,080
we're not supposed to be there.

554
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,840
And we later, as we came, found a road out, we discovered that it in fact was completely

555
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,120
an unauthorized area.

556
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,900
But...

557
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,880
Oh, so beautiful.

558
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,100
She was so paranoid.

559
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,400
She was going, well, we're going to get mugged.

560
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,880
Somebody's going to come down here and mug us.

561
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,560
And I laughed her off.

562
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,460
It was gorgeous, though.

563
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,260
As a paranoid, crazy woman.

564
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,140
Dave, however, has informed us that that little place where...

565
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,180
Oh, so beautiful.

566
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,560
...where I laughed at her about muggers was also known as Kingsbury Run, where which mass

567
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,480
murderer stashed his chopped up victims?

568
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,180
The mad butcher of Kingsbury Run.

569
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,460
Yes.

570
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,740
He was modeled a bit after Jack the Ripper.

571
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,880
He was supposedly the son or daughter with a medical background of a very wealthy, who

572
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,980
knows, could have been presidential family.

573
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,180
Oh, they all are.

574
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,740
All the serial killers are the children of kings and queens and presidents.

575
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,300
Well, he was taken care of quite well.

576
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:13,820
He was some big industrialist, I think, because they kept on getting letters from an insane

577
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,960
asylum years after saying, I am the mad butcher of Kingsbury Run.

578
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:19,840
But...

579
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,620
Why are you shaking your head?

580
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,360
Was I lying?

581
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,860
It's like that movie Sin City.

582
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,620
No, it's just that I had this premonition.

583
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,660
She was down there.

584
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,300
She had a premonition that this beautiful place might be dangerous.

585
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,340
And it turned out later that it had been dangerous for some butchered victim bodies.

586
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,620
Mostly homeless and prostitutal types or, you know, people who are...

587
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,480
Now, is that the same as the torso murderer of Cleveland?

588
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,700
I think it may be the torso murderers because the torsos were so eloquently disposed of.

589
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes, I do think it is.

590
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
I'm not sure, but I think so.

591
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,240
How many mass murderers or serial killers has Cleveland had?

592
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,420
I don't know.

593
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,660
You remember the great East Ohio gas fire in 1940?

594
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,260
No, I'm sorry.

595
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,320
Now, there was another serial killer, another unoriginal copycat, lone nut, crazy guy.

596
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,740
Going berserk in another shopping mall today.

597
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,120
Now, you know, on some wonderful national holiday, there's going to be one in every shopping center.

598
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
I would love such an event.

599
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,180
It will all happen at once.

600
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,740
Dave, don't say that because...

601
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,360
It will happen.

602
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,700
It's like your Ouija board.

603
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,580
It will...

604
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,460
What is the thing?

605
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,780
If you say it...

606
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,540
If anything that two subgenius businessmen say will happen.

607
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,140
Yeah.

608
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,020
Now, that's the philosophy of synchro plus bad da da bullsh.

609
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:35,760
Aha!

610
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,460
Is that what it is or something like it or...

611
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,920
I'll take your word for that, Dave.

612
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,860
No, it's as you say it, so is it, moat, and you better stand back or you're going to be

613
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,560
smoked or something or...

614
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,760
I love the smell of the hunt and the taste of the shunt.

615
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

616
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,720
The stunt.

617
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,840
The shunt.

618
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,560
No, that's something we society people do, Dave.

619
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,480
You wouldn't know about that.

620
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,860
Don't worry.

621
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,180
A shunting is what you...

622
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,900
You wouldn't enjoy it.

623
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,120
What is shunting?

624
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,580
It's...

625
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,420
What are you on about?

626
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,280
Oh, nothing, Dave.

627
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,360
Oh, that's the mad butcher once again, right?

628
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,680
And the guy was a shunter?

629
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,380
It's a society thing.

630
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,120
No, it's a society thing.

631
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,060
People in society, not you, Dave.

632
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,980
I know, but...

633
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,760
People in society, not you, Princess Wee.

634
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,480
What do they do?

635
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,020
Actually, Princess Wee is the ultimate...

636
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,200
But it's like another...

637
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,940
It's another...

638
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,800
Her royalty is on another system, another global system.

639
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,340
That's why her only handmen and footmaidens are me.

640
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,880
I see.

641
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


642
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


643
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


644
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


645
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


646
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


647
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


648
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


649
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


650
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:34,880


651
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,780
I'm a blue-blooded orangutan in another space.

652
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,340
I am quite blue.

653
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,140
Well, we can all say we're princes from some other planet, but she's the only one that

654
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,760
can prove it.

655
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,960
No, I've documented proof.

656
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,460
Which all you have to do is look at her and you can tell.

657
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,780
She looks like a child who was removed with forceps.

658
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,640
What do they call it?

659
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,620
A forceps baby?

660
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,540
You know, where they just clap those...

661
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,880
You know, that's not funny because a lot of people call you forceps head.

662
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Did you know that?

663
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,260
Oh, of course.

664
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,920
I figured they would.

665
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,680
Because of those two dents, those depressions on either side of your temples.

666
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,660
They never went away.

667
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,400
They said they were going to go away.

668
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:05,960
Yeah, I know.

669
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,120
And there's thumbprints all over the top of his head where his dad thought, oh no,

670
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,020
it ain't going to stay.

671
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,660
He was disposing of excretia.

672
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,920
He was disposing of excretia.

673
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,760
You ought to see my kid's head.

674
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,000
It's shaped like a dinosaur.

675
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,500
Your children's heads are shaped like dinosaurs?

676
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,940
Well, you know, I used to sculpt.

677
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,700
And when they were born, if you keep moving them...

678
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,580
So, therefore, I was thinking about Harryhausen as I was popular.

679
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,040
They have soft, they have real soft heads.

680
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,640
But they're not like the ones you see in the movies.

681
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,640


682
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,640


683
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:33,640


684
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,740
They'll form, they'll hold in position for a little while.

685
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,080
Oh, yeah, babies, for sure.

686
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah, you could do all kinds of things with babies.

687
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah, my son, when he was the first, like, day that he was alive, I was able to make

688
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,960
his head, the top of his head into like a little brontosaurus.

689
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,740
It didn't have a very long neck or tail, but you could tell it was supposed to be a dinosaur.

690
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,360
That's a good gag.

691
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,100
That really is.

692
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,400
20 years later, man, that is a great gag.

693
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,220
I couldn't make a triceratops.

694
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,780
Conehead, even a standard cone or pinhead is a great gag 20 years after the fact, you

695
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:57,860
know?

696
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,620
So...

697
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,120
It's a gift.

698
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,260
Guys, you're so messed up.

699
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,740
You are really seriously de-gagging.

700
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,160
It's a deeply messed up gift of the odious to the bloated.

701
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,180
You're familiest.

702
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,700
That's all relative.

703
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,100
What does messed up mean?

704
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:16,320
Does that mean, you know, running a society into the ground by human laziness?

705
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,660
Like any good art, it means something different to each listener.

706
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,020
Does mental illness...

707
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,700
Messed up.

708
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,200
What is that?

709
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,460
Exaggeration is the key to art, so mental illness is...

710
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,320
Does it mean you're a member of church's subgenius?

711
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,380
That's what some people think messed up means.

712
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,520
It's vagueness is its key.

713
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,720
It's insane.

714
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:39,920
Well, sometimes this key is lost and found in very, very unusual places with a lot of

715
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,320
hair and gum around it.

716
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,000
Eww.

717
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,160
So I don't know if that should be explored or even mapped.

718
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,760
Let's not and say we did.

719
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,540
Eww.

720
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,440
Yeah, I think it's a stupid idea to name yourself after a substandard form of anything or being.

721
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,900
I mean, where'd you get that idea, man?

722
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,920
You know, you're sitting around, you're in filer or like...

723
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,460
No, JR thought...

724
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,560
I mean, I think that Bob Dobbs was told of the existence of the subgeniuses by alien

725
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:16,700
entities or rather a collective mind calling itself variously Jehovah One, Wotan, Ra.

726
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,000
It's gone under many different names, but it was a hive mind from outer space which

727
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,700
informed Bob that there had been a conspiracy of normals stealing away the slack of the

728
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,400
abnormals, which were called subgeniuses.

729
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,140
Not because...

730
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,340
The artist's fist excludes you.

731
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,280
The fact of it is that intelligence has been misdefined for all of this time.

732
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,520
The conspiracy has misdefined intelligence.

733
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:47,260
And in fact, the lucky idiot twiddling his thumbs happily is a much more important creature

734
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,540
in the great plan of things than a clever mad scientist creating the latest deadly weapon.

735
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,860
Don't you see?

736
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,340
And so thus we find the peaceable, simple-minded subgeniuses.

737
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,740
Like Dave here.

738
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,880
Or more beloved by Bob than the brilliant mastermind such...

739
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,560
Well, I wouldn't want to point to anyone in the room, but...

740
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:19,800
You know, that's why as Wren said so astutely, they always love the stupid one best.

741
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,340
Everybody loves Curly and they'll...

742
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,120
And Larry, you know, he's pathetic, but nobody...

743
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,360
You don't really dislike him.

744
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,260
And everyone despises Moe.

745
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,240
Nobody likes Moe.

746
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,100
But Moe's the one that makes everything happen.

747
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,140
They despise him, Stan.

748
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,180
Yeah, sure, but we all despise him.

749
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,440
Secretly.

750
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,120
I am a Moe.

751
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,160
I know I am a Moe.

752
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,080
And when you were in class, when you were very young, you could hear people whispering

753
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
under their breath, they go, Moe.

754
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,500
And watch out or he'll...

755
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:43,980
What?

756
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,000
He'll smack you.

757
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,340
He'll try and pierce your eyes with his index and his other finger.

758
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,940
He will try and do something physically harmful to you.

759
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,120
That's why you were despised as a Moe.

760
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,340
Because you hurt the other children.

761
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,000
And you're still hurting adults now with this insane religion.

762
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,260
That's what's wrong with you.

763
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,120
You want to torture things.

764
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,440
If they can't take a joke, man, then I think you know what they can do.

765
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,340
I can't remember, but I think you know, man, what...

766
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,740
It has to do with mounting, I believe.

767
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,740
Something about mounting...

768
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:24,680
Let them mount up upon themselves if they can't not see the humor in it.

769
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,600
That's it.

770
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,300
That's the old Gaelic version.

771
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,500
Shakespeare.

772
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,380
Mm-hmm.

773
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,700
Yeah.

774
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,200
Yeah.

775
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,460
Yeah.

776
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:32,680
Yeah.

777
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,200
South Georgia is burning, I understand.

778
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,740
It's worse than a drought.

779
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:36,900
Because of God.

780
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,380
God sent a drought to the Georgians.

781
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,520
There's another great guy I'd like to slap one with.

782
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,980
Are you angry at God, Dave?

783
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
Who isn't angry at God?

784
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,540
He screwed us all.

785
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,480
Well, now he gave you life.

786
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,420
He called it...

787
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,540
He invented screwing.

788
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,660
He called it love, and it was actually subgenusoid hatred.

789
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,320
I can feel the...

790
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,180
You don't know anything.

791
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,180
Of course I don't.

792
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,560
And what about hot pastrami sandwiches?

793
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,920
Well, that's a form of love.

794
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,140
Okay.

795
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,280
But then other things.

796
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,140
What about...

797
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,140
Oh, I'd rather have a pastrami sandwich, but I can still think of plenty of bad stuff

798
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,000
going on right now.

799
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm not the God-hater around here, man.

800
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,960
I don't care.

801
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,640
It's not important.

802
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,020
If there is a God, why wouldn't he forgive me for saying such things to him or her or

803
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,500
whatever it is?

804
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,880
Well, because he's just like a human.

805
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,520
Right.

806
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,440
Small-minded, petty.

807
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,060
Vain.

808
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,460
Vain.

809
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:23,760
Yeah.

810
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:24,900
Extremely vain.

811
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,320
Jealous.

812
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,640
Totally, yeah.

813
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,520
Many of the other attributes of his nom-hood.

814
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,660
Yeah.

815
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,200
That's what they...

816
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,000
That's what it says in the Bible.

817
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,180
But he is a jealous and vain deity.

818
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,540
We're made in his image.

819
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,740
That means he's dumb.

820
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,400
Right.

821
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,040
So what?

822
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,040
He's a gland-controlled primate.

823
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:39,880
The word doppelganger.

824
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,160
Who thinks he's making rational decisions.

825
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,820
A gland-controlled pirate.

826
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,500
But all the time is really just...

827
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:44,660
Can you say that?

828
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,120
I don't know.

829
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,940
Just doing chimpanzee politics.

830
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,000
Can I say that?

831
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,360
That's true.

832
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,200
We're all just a bunch of funny little monkeys.

833
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,360
And if we're made in God's image, then he's descended from a damn monkey too.

834
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,960
But that sounds blasphemous.

835
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,560
Now, don't it?

836
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,800
That doesn't make any sense.

837
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,260
That's kind of an acid-heads philosophy, you might say.

838
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,980
I would say so.

839
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,280
And you can't live by that.

840
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,700
It sounds good while you're on the drugs, but you can't live that way.

841
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,560
That's what it's for.

842
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,420
It's for living...

843
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,280
It's like saying too much is always better than not enough, when obviously too much of

844
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,740
some things would kill you.

845
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,900
But why pay attention to such lack-ritudes?

846
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,640
And yet it sounds so good why we live by it, don't we?

847
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,260
And that's what religion's all about.

848
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,940
It doesn't have to be.

849
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,680
It doesn't have to make no sense.

850
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,260
It's just something you've always been told.

851
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,480
It is what it is.

852
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,000
You live by it.

853
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,540
You know, so don't you...

854
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,360
You can make fun of my God, my Elvis, but don't make fun of my Bob.

855
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,340
You see what I'm saying?

856
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,920
I can smell it anyway.

857
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,440
Know what I'm saying?

858
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:43,980
Know what I'm saying?

859
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,540
Know what you're saying?

860
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Know what I'm saying?

861
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,500


862
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,520
No, I'm not.

863
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,140
I'm just saying.

864
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,300
Whew.

865
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,820
See, that made my adenoids drizzle.

866
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,700
I don't know if you're some sort of subliminally whacking weird things in my brain when you're

867
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,180
talking about the...

868
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,260
It's the background music.

869
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:56,840


870
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,720
All I can think of is...

871
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,920
I think it was 1975.

872
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,540
That's Joe Newman.

873
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,220
I think it was 19...

874
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,140
Rudy Schwartz Project.

875
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,640
Rudy Schwartz Project.

876
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,500
I remember it was 2004.

877
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,380
The people of the elbow room had just laid down in a concubinibus of snakes.

878
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,720
They were disagreeing with each other about how to reach the highest platitude.

879
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,600
Oh, there are lots of elevations and lots of ways to boing, boing, boing as you go, but

880
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
every way is marked.

881
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,960
There's a marked exit.

882
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,660
Some of them are marked on top of your head.

883
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,860
Those are the ones that are dangerous, but we all have to live with it because these

884
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,740
are mortal wounds we're forced to endear.

885
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,700
Excuse me, is that your name?

886
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,800
Indira.

887
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,500
Yes.

888
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,060
You with a dot in the middle of your ear.

889
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:45,420
Yes, I'm Indira.

890
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,420
Would you like to check my collection?

891
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,080
I'm well prepared to go.

892
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,400
No, I'm too shy for that.

893
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,340
I thought you were a collection checker.

894
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,620
I'm ready to board one of these space vesicles and I'm ready to go.

895
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


896
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


897
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


898
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


899
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


900
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


901
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


902
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:58,620


903
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm hoping for a big time once I've paid my, what is it, 79, 20, 30, 50, 40 bucks soon.

904
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,600
We will be boarding.

905
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:05,600


906
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,520
Bertha might do it.

907
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,500
Let's see if Bertha can.

908
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,240
Bertha.

909
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,800
Did you hear that guy with the nasal clippings?

910
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,080
Yeah, what do you want?

911
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,340
He's going.

912
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,300
Okay.

913
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,880
Did you hear the guy with the sedentary eye?

914
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,420
He's going.

915
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,140
Okay.

916
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,400
We're all going somewhere.

917
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,580
Let's go, baby.

918
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,360
Let's go.

919
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,940
I ate some bad ham and I got really sick and in a puddle of my puke where the puke was

920
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,440
most thick.

921
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,260
A mouth, dude.

922
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,600
A puke.

923
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


924
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


925
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


926
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


927
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


928
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,780
I ate a little bit of a beer and it beckoned me near and it whispered the following words

929
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,460
into my ear.

930
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,740
It said, kill the pink boys, quit your job, mock the world and praise Bob Dobbs.

931
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,040
You'll build a ship and take a trip.

932
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,240
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates.

933
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,160
Six and a half months hold up alone.

934
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,700
Circuit boards duct tape and turkey bones.

935
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,340
The ship appeared more than disaster prone but the vomit assured me that far weirder

936
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,940
ships had flown.

937
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,220
The project was finished.

938
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,540
The ship would hold 20.

939
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,080
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny.

940
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,100
We didn't need the slack list or hapless.

941
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,580
Our mirth proved its worth in escaping a star fixed.

942
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,920
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks.

943
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,580
A prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twang.

944
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,380
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza.

945
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,940
It's like a world without Tony Danza.

946
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,200
We're friends of a pink shit that hates the charts.

947
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,720
In a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy.

948
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,140
We take a moment and we pause to reflect on the pinks that we killed and the planet that

949
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,660
they wrecked.

950
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,180
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like Comanches.

951
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,060
Do a victory dance in our own little world.

952
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,060


953
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,060


954
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,060


955
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,060


956
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,060


957
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,000
We're kangaroos in panties.

958
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,600
Our fantasy is a reality.

959
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,380
Earth turns to dust.

960
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,780
It's Planet X or Bustos.

961
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,160
Men and women of all races and creeds pause to destroy the earth.

962
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,960
Oh, it's time, hand in hand.

963
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,460
When the trumpet calls, extend.

964
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,360
And a brother and sister bend.

965
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,800
While they blow the window out.

966
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,040
And the world is in chaos.

967
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


968
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


969
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


970
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


971
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


972
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


973
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


974
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


975
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


976
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


977
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,260
And a brother beware.

978
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,400
The返

979
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,860
Annë

980
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,420
Have paradise

981
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,460
Subtiny of the world

982
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,220
Unite

983
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,460
And we'll start

984
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,940
Every night

985
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,780
Subtiny of the world

986
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,320
Subtiny of the world

987
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,900
Subtiny of the world

988
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,580
Unite

989
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,200
Next days are coming

990
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,660
And the pigs are coming

991
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,220
Sure when the rupture hits

992
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,600
We'll all be in our first class window seats

993
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,180
On the pleasure saucers

994
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Watching the little pink boys fry

995
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,840
Turn on

996
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,440
Turn on

997
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,740
And

998
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,460
You certainly don't want to preach to people

999
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,400
Next days are coming

1000
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,000
And the pigs are coming

1001
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,180
Ah

1002
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,260
Ah

1003
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,580
Ah

1004
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:24,900
Ah

1005
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,320
Ah

1006
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,340
Ah

1007
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,360
Ah

1008
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,360


1009
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,360


1010
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,360


1011
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,380
Ah

1012
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,380


1013
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,380


1014
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,380


1015
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,380


1016
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:25,380


1017
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,200
Ah

1018
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1019
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1020
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1021
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1022
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1023
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1024
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1025
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1026
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1027
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,200


1028
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,260
Ah

1029
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,280
Ah

1030
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,400
Ah

1031
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,900
Sure J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior

1032
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,700
And of course I want more slack

1033
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,500
And I'm smoking prop non-stop

1034
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,660
For what I really want

1035
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,080
Oh yeah, that's right

1036
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,060
Those lovely alien nympho mutants

1037
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,920
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers

1038
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,100
Welcome to your saucer

1039
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,160
And pleasure goddess CV456100

1040
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,200
And pleasure goddess CV456100

1041
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,200


1042
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,200


1043
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,200


1044
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,240
154

1045
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Sexual gratification and desire for film will begin in a moment.

1046
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,860
First, we invite you to look out your window, say goodbye to the pinks who were left behind.

1047
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,920
Now unzip your pants.

1048
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,840
Just sit back and relax.

1049
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,740
Now unzip your pants.

1050
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,200
Feel better?

1051
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
Bob and Connie shall be teleporting over shortly to Congress.

1052
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,560
I congratulate you on your success as a subgenius.

1053
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,360
The option to copulate with either

1054
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,680
can be taken advantage of then.

1055
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,460
I have taken the liberty of preparing a warning prop.

1056
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,540
The time is 8am July 5th.

1057
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,960
I shall leave now, press the blue button.

1058
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,020
Should you need me, goodbye.

1059
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,020
The secret of X-Day.

1060
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,960
The secret of X-Day.

1061
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,360
The secret of X-Day.

1062
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,800
Am I evil?

1063
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,980
I don't know, my son.

1064
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,180
All my life I've been a little man.

1065
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,220
A happy little fellow.

1066
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,820
But in the dressing room...

1067
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,460
I, uh, I don't understand.

1068
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,080
Did you ever hear of X-Day?

1069
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,160
No.

1070
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,060
You mean...

1071
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,020
Yes, yes!

1072
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,520
A chance to grow to normal size!

1073
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,180
Please, please, please!

1074
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,480
Please let him do it!

1075
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,940
Just what does this X-Day look like?

1076
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,020
Uh, uh...

1077
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,540
A rag.

1078
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,680
I had grown.

1079
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,960
I had grown.

1080
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
I was growing!

1081
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,300
You've grown, but not so much that I can't handle you.

1082
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,440
I was normal.

1083
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:15,860
Normal.

1084
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,200
You look good to me.

1085
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,080
I do?

1086
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,200
Well, I always did go for big men.

1087
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:22,920
Big?

1088
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,800
Yeah.

1089
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,820
I was vaguely disturbed.

1090
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,140
I'm afraid of you, John.

1091
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,100
You're too big now.

1092
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,520
Yes, I'd grown at least six inches.

1093
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,780
Now I was a freak again.

1094
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
Truth is fiction.

1095
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,900
This is...

1096
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,040
This is genius or off-snack.

1097
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,500
It contains the weird, huge, naked souls.

1098
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,020
And if you let Bob do your thinking for you,

1099
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,820
you won't have to worry about nothing

1100
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,940
come July 4th, 1998.

1101
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,200
Ha ha ha!

1102
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,600
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership,

1103
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,320
looking kinda like a big pillbox,

1104
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,020
Bob'll be landing,

1105
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,200
and you can climb right in,

1106
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,520
because he's gonna know!

1107
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,360
He's gonna have your name on a computer printout.

1108
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,420
Yes, sir, dear friends,

1109
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,180
and that CRT tube available.

1110
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,240
Right there at his fingertips.

1111
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,280
He can call your name up,

1112
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,880
and he'll know exactly what you done for him.

1113
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,800
He'll know exactly how much money you made,

1114
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,720
and how much donations you've taken in.

1115
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,280
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.

1116
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,500
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.

1117
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,040
Now, now, do you even know exactly how much money...

1118
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,140
Can you intuit the correct numbers

1119
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,480
without addition?

1120
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,980
I know exactly how silly everything is.

1121
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,280
...forms of abstract mathematics.

1122
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,080
And that's exactly too much.

1123
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,660
Can you divide the template into three separate parts,

1124
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,040
and remember that one is the dog's head,

1125
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,700
the other one is the foot,

1126
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,080
and the other one is the restless Bambino?

1127
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,300
The chickens are alert.

1128
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,360
Look around you.

1129
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,880
Wildlife is suffering.

1130
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,160
What?

1131
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,600
Did you say something about the chicken Bambino?

1132
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,660
What?

1133
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,520
What?

1134
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,760
What do I...

1135
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,580
What the...

1136
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,000
Friends, we were just...

1137
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,700
Those bits we were listening to,

1138
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,220
going from the beginning,

1139
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,920
the song Planet X or Bust,

1140
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,840
sort of like a rap.

1141
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,140
The only song I know of that mentions,

1142
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,260
is the song,

1143
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,260


1144
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,220
is by the El Queso All Stars.

1145
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,640
We heard the subgenius anthem by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1146
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,260
I think that was recorded last X Day.

1147
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,940
How old are you, Princess?

1148
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,120
X Day Drill, I mean.

1149
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,300
X Day Drill.

1150
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,660
X Day's a-comin' by the great Bill T. Miller,

1151
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,380
King of Slack.

1152
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,400
The special saucer sex goddess talk there,

1153
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,820
from the stewardess,

1154
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,920
was from Heart Ignition.

1155
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,500
Sex, sex, sex.

1156
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,640
Secret of X Day,

1157
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,060
provided by Norrell Preff.

1158
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,380
Secret of X Day, provided by Norrell Preff.

1159
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
That was about me.

1160
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,040
I was a little man.

1161
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,720
I wanna be a big man.

1162
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,700
I wanna be a normal freaking...

1163
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,280
And, uh...

1164
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,420
He made a big sound.

1165
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,400
Fernanda Nettily murdered that, uh,

1166
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,560
Hour of Slack promo,

1167
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,940
and then we heard Dr. Philo Drummond

1168
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,560
asking about your donations, friends.

1169
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,480
When was the last time...

1170
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,760
you had you a big ol' steamin' hot

1171
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,960
bowl of Wolf Brand chili?

1172
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,300
Well, that's too long.

1173
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:23,980
Ow!

1174
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,680
Ow!

1175
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:24,760
Ow!

1176
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:25,740
Oh, man.

1177
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,800
I was wondering how Dave was making

1178
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,020
both of those noises.

1179
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,580
I turned around, Princess Wee was making the...

1180
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,220
She stabbed me.

1181
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,300
...the Dave-ly noise,

1182
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,500
and Dave was making the Wee-ly noise.

1183
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,280
Did you see the fake billy goat she stabbed me with?

1184
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,800
No, I can't see anything when I'm doin' the show.

1185
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,260
Oh, really?

1186
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,620
That's...

1187
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,120
Does that have to do with the, uh,

1188
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,380
tonal bestiality?

1189
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:43,980
I don't know.

1190
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,080
I can't hear anything either.

1191
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:45,720
Well, that's...

1192
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,600
That's tonal, uh...

1193
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,200
Tonal, uh,

1194
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,780
incorrection or something like that,

1195
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,080
but I think when your eyes go,

1196
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,360
you should find out at least where they're going,

1197
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,860
because they could get out.

1198
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,820
Yeah, right.

1199
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,180
How can I find them if I don't, if I'm looking?

1200
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,600
It's like looking for your glasses.

1201
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,540
You need help.

1202
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,400
A part of your personality is going to be off having all kinds of fun looking at stuff,

1203
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,000
and you're going to be wondering where in hell your eyeballs are, actually, your optic nerves.

1204
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,020
That's what everybody's like when they don't have Bob.

1205
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,460
They're like a nose that's smelling stuff, but there's no brain to interpret what that nose is smelling.

1206
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,060
That's what I've heard.

1207
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:26,240
It's like an eyeball rolling around seeing things, but there's no, it's not connected to a brain to see what the eyeball's seeing.

1208
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,020
So it's a...

1209
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,900
That's what, if you don't have Bob in your life, you're like a mouth that just flaps.

1210
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,000
It doesn't have, doesn't even know what it's saying.

1211
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,820
Amen to peace.

1212
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,840
I've got a news thing here, so I don't have to think about what I just said.

1213
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,260
This came from the Princess Wee office graffiti wire service, you might say.

1214
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,340
Right?

1215
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,560
That is correct.

1216
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,760
It was found in Princess Wee's...

1217
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,060
Okay, we have to make newsroom sounds.

1218
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,820
This is news time.

1219
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,300
Newsroom sounds.

1220
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,880
And take this copy up to Bill, the chief editor in charge of being editors.

1221
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,380
Wait, look, read this copy right now.

1222
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,040
Okay, here goes.

1223
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:19,420
A major research institution has just announced the discovery of the densest element yet known to science.

1224
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,560
The new element has been named Bushcronium.

1225
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:31,100
Bushcronium has one neutron, 12 assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 224 assistant deputy neutrons,

1226
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,940
giving it an atomic mass of 311.

1227
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,560
These particles are held together by dark forces called morons,

1228
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,560
which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.

1229
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,220
The symbol for Bushcronium is W.

1230
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,240
Bushcronium's mass actually increases over time,

1231
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,180
as morons randomly interact with various elements in the atmosphere

1232
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:04,080
and become assistant deputy neutrons in a Bushcronium molecule, forming isodopes.

1233
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,240
This characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe

1234
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,600
that Bushcronium is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration.

1235
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,080
This hypothetical quantity is referred to as a critical morass.

1236
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,440
When catalyzed with money,

1237
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,460
Bushcronium activates foxnusium,

1238
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,140
an element which radiates orders of magnitude more energy,

1239
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,140
albeit as incoherent noise,

1240
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,940
since it has half as many peons,

1241
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,380
but twice as many morons.

1242
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,440
From the Princess Wee News Service,

1243
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,840
could I read this for show?

1244
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,440
Oh!

1245
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,160
Did you want to read it for show?

1246
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,220
Or just...

1247
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,440
I think she originally wanted to, but then when she heard me do it...

1248
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,740
I think she was talking about show and tell as in...

1249
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,200
It's just got that glib newscaster thing that...

1250
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,440
I just don't know what happened to him.

1251
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,840
Could you read it backwards with a slight werewolf accent,

1252
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,440
or like you could pinch your neds together sharply and go...

1253
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,540
A major research institution has just been asked to discover

1254
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,000
the densest element yet known to science.

1255
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,800
The new element has been named Bushcronium.

1256
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,080
Welcome to the monster!

1257
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:19,960
The monster club!

1258
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,420
The Church of the Subvenience has been remade as the monster club!

1259
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,280
There was a Vincent Price low-budget movie called The Monster Club

1260
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,520
in which a human is being nominated for inclusion in the monster club,

1261
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,100
and at first all the monsters are going,

1262
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,980
No, no!

1263
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,840
But Vincent Price does this great rant about,

1264
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,340
Oh!

1265
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,180
No, no!

1266
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,800
You don't understand why the humans have been responsible

1267
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:00,280
for more mayhem, torture, atrocities than any group of monsters.

1268
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,540
Then he gives like a whole history of humans,

1269
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,080
and in the end they're all going,

1270
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Oh, the humans are the greatest monsters of all!

1271
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,900
That was the inspiration for a bad song, also.

1272
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,500
The monster...

1273
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,320
Well, then we lost Bobby Boris Pickett,

1274
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,540
of course.

1275
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:19,540


1276
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,140
The author of The Monster Mash.

1277
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,360
That was my favorite song one year.

1278
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,800
We didn't really lose him, Stan.

1279
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,420
I think he was just tired of listening to you talk about Bob.

1280
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,120
He was there one minute, and the next minute he was going,

1281
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,000
This guy, you know, he's driving me nuts.

1282
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:34,580
Give me a break.

1283
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,540
And Stan kept on going on and on and on.

1284
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,420
And he just disappeared.

1285
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,960
He just left this mortal plane, that's all.

1286
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,420
No, well, it's not like...

1287
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,280
Not just mortal plane.

1288
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,740
He did The Monster Mash, so he can be brought back to life every Halloween.

1289
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,180
Yeah!

1290
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,180
There's so many wags.

1291
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,200
Already said.

1292
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:50,880
He always will.

1293
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,300
That's why it's a good idea to always have yourself sacrificed

1294
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,760
on a duly appointed holiday of any disconnected value.

1295
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,200
For instance, if you were to croak off on the day before Christmas,

1296
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,140
you might not be well known or remembered.

1297
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,680
However, if you went down for the count on October, you know, 30th or something like that,

1298
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,640
you'd be a Halloweener.

1299
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,420
You know what I'm saying?

1300
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,020
As far as the rest of the engorged public was concerned,

1301
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,560
you would be a Halloweener.

1302
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,220
Or at least a feisty little kid without,

1303
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,520
you know, any direction in life.

1304
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,420
But empty inside.

1305
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,040
Empty.

1306
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,280
Empty like a...

1307
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,200
A balloon hot dog of a man.

1308
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,940
Like an evacuated bladder.

1309
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,760
A nothing...

1310
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,400
A deflated little pipsqueak balloony man.

1311
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,600
One of the millions of dust mites that are shaken from your rugs every year.

1312
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,140
I'm the old pincushion man.

1313
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,960
Terror of Balloonyland.

1314
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,660
I forget what that was from.

1315
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm not supposed to remember.

1316
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,400
Balloonyland.

1317
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,220
That's a great car.

1318
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:49,440
Oh, the car.

1319
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:49,840
It's a cartoon.

1320
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,600
Yes, a classic cartoon.

1321
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,880
Balloonie...

1322
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,040
The memorable thing about the Balloonie Man cartoon

1323
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,840
is that the old pincushion man has a big pin

1324
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,600
emerging at an upwards angle from his lap.

1325
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,100
A huge pin.

1326
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:09,940
Yes, he does.

1327
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,040
And he stalks around waggling that great big sharp pointy thing.

1328
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,760
At the little balloony boy and girl who have wandered,

1329
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,440
as they were told,

1330
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:19,940
not to do.

1331
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,080
Don't go into the pincushion forest,

1332
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,500
little balloony boy and girl.

1333
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,100
Why couldn't he?

1334
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,320
But they do.

1335
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:24,920
He carried...

1336
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,280
Of course.

1337
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,000
Of course.

1338
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,300
Of course.

1339
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,080
Because they're kids.

1340
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,160
And you know how kids are.

1341
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,600
They go creeping around graveyards

1342
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,660
and get down into the unauthorized areas only.

1343
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,020
And, you know,

1344
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,140
then next thing you know,

1345
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,020
they run into the mad torso of Kingsbury Run.

1346
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,240
And then they run, baby.

1347
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,120
Man.

1348
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,220
Just as so much as you did the other night.

1349
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,020
It's the circle of life.

1350
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,480
At twilight.

1351
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,720
Screaming.

1352
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,620
Don't give me that circle of life crap!

1353
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,660
Your heels are...

1354
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,540
The circle of life.

1355
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,420
The circle of life is a circle jerk,

1356
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,320
if you ask me.

1357
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,080
That concept,

1358
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,480
I hate that concept more than I hate

1359
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,760
the Church of the Subgenius.

1360
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,940
It's supposed to make you feel better

1361
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,460
when you lose a loved one.

1362
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,140
Right?

1363
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,800
Yeah.

1364
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,440
But it's a trick.

1365
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,440
It's a lie.

1366
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,360
It's a cheat.

1367
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,080
It works in a Disney movie,

1368
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,120
and we saw that movie,

1369
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:07,780
The Fountain.

1370
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,360
Yeah, The Fountain.

1371
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,580
That was the most elaborate,

1372
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,660
lovely, tasteful version

1373
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,280
of the Disney circle of life ethic,

1374
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,120
philosophy I've ever seen.

1375
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,880
No, I didn't know

1376
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,140
Walt Disney was a circle of life.

1377
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,520
It just made you feel so good.

1378
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm so sorry and sad

1379
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,340
that that lady died,

1380
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,220
and then...

1381
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,940
A cryogenic guy.

1382
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,060
And then all of a sudden,

1383
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,920
it's, oh, it's okay,

1384
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,980
because when we die,

1385
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,500
we're sacrificing for the rebirth.

1386
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,960
Well, I don't care about

1387
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,520
what gets reborn after I'm dead!

1388
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,400
I don't want to die!

1389
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,200
It just ain't fair!

1390
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,520
That's an admirable bird

1391
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,900
you're wearing around your neck.

1392
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,960
What was God thinking?

1393
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,780
He was thinking of phalluses

1394
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,360
and donkey hopes.

1395
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,320
He was thinking of the children.

1396
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:48,620
Right.

1397
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,400
They wouldn't have to smell

1398
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,280
old people forever.

1399
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,680
That would be a big problem, Stang.

1400
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,380
That is true,

1401
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,200
that a lot of decaying flesh

1402
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,260
laying around...

1403
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,600
Is still alive and voting.

1404
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,020
What if we let them drop

1405
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,720
where they were

1406
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,260
and just went on without them?

1407
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,280
Think about it.

1408
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, you don't have to

1409
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,940
entertain the thought for too long,

1410
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,280
but...

1411
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,120
Now, my friend Palmer Vreedys

1412
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,600
had...

1413
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,460
We were going to write stories

1414
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,520
for this Living Dead series of books

1415
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,260
that these guys were doing,

1416
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,100
and neither one of us

1417
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,760
ever did ours.

1418
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,400
I was going to do

1419
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,500
Living Dead in China,

1420
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,440
which, because it's overpopulated,

1421
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,520
would really be pretty dead.

1422
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,380
A lot of the people

1423
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,140
that we count as actual people

1424
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,020
in China are dead.

1425
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,180
But Palmer's was,

1426
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,620
what if everything dead

1427
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,780
came back to life?

1428
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,740
Well, everything dead means...

1429
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,680
It's impossible.

1430
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,820
The protozoan skeletons

1431
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,560
at the bottom of the ocean,

1432
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,140
it means the bacteria

1433
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,400
in your bowels that died

1434
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,040
suddenly come back to life.

1435
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,300
All the bacteria,

1436
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,460
all the germs,

1437
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,480
all the bugs come back to life.

1438
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,260
All the dead leaves.

1439
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,680
And for how long?

1440
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,520
Yeah.

1441
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Well, until they...

1442
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,560
As long as they can keep eating brains.

1443
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,660
Oh, wow.

1444
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,140
As you know,

1445
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,180
that's what dead things do

1446
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,060
when they come back to life.

1447
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,880
Dead trees come back

1448
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,600
and eat your brain?

1449
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,460
What about all the hamburgers?

1450
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,780
Yeah, because it hurts to be dead.

1451
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,440
I always wondered about that.

1452
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:07,780
I always wondered about that, too.

1453
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,400
But in one of the movies

1454
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,360
they explained it.

1455
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,220
I think in the second Return of the...

1456
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,940
No, it was the Return of the Living Dead.

1457
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,180
This old dead torso lady goes,

1458
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,760
they're going,

1459
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,280
why are you trying to eat our brains?

1460
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,100
And she goes,

1461
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,580
it hurts to be dead.

1462
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,220
Oh, no.

1463
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,720
That's bad news.

1464
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,920
That is awful news.

1465
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,240
I really didn't want to...

1466
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,000
For living people and dead people.

1467
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,300
You know,

1468
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,640
what a thing to look forward to.

1469
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,380
Well, now, see,

1470
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,820
that's why there's no proof.

1471
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,960
You can't get a real good proof

1472
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,720
of an afterlife

1473
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,260
because as soon as that happens,

1474
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,300
you know,

1475
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,680
if there's anything good about it,

1476
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,120
everybody's going to jump off a bridge

1477
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,060
as soon as the bills stack up.

1478
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,660
But remember,

1479
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,520
many dead people's vocal cords

1480
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,380
don't work that well.

1481
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,160
In fact,

1482
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:47,940
they're probably totally...

1483
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:48,660
Right.

1484
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,080
I mean,

1485
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,240
what are you guys thinking?

1486
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,420
And so, therefore,

1487
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,180
they must resort to...

1488
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,580
Right.

1489
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,160
Sometimes they're just asking...

1490
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,920
...other means to communicate their messages,

1491
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,280
which usually consist of,

1492
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:57,500
you know,

1493
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,460
driving you off a cliff

1494
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,360
or letting your feet swell up.

1495
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:00,740
You know,

1496
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,380
they want to...

1497
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,440
Like, for instance,

1498
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,420
a hypothetical living dead person

1499
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,680
might simply want to know

1500
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,500
what time it is,

1501
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,600
but you're thinking they're...

1502
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,380
And they're going...

1503
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,640
You think they're saying,

1504
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,960
I want to eat your brain,

1505
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,360
so you blow their head off

1506
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,060
with your automatic weapons.

1507
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,840
Don't blow off.

1508
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,080
Well,

1509
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,220
maybe that's a little...

1510
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:18,440
Maybe.

1511
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,440


1512
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,080
Maybe the dead person

1513
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,660
is full of other people's brains already

1514
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,100
and just wants to know the time.

1515
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,060
Then it would be better

1516
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:25,980
to eat their brains

1517
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,980
and enjoy the double deliciousness.

1518
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,020
What happens if you eat

1519
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,140
a dead guy's brains

1520
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,460
who's been eating

1521
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,120
lots of live people's brains?

1522
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,260
It would be like triple strong.

1523
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
I think you'd turn into

1524
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,680
a living dead guy, I think.

1525
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,020
Yeah, right.

1526
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,720
Because it's a virus type of thing.

1527
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,160
Contact type virus thing, yeah.

1528
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,620
I'm a born-again zombie.

1529
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,300
What?

1530
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,360
She is.

1531
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,080
She...

1532
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,000
You don't look like a...

1533
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,440
You don't look very zombie-ish.

1534
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,060
You're supposed to go...

1535
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:48,260
That's funny.

1536
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,480
I'm a born-again zombie.

1537
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,380
Again and again and again.

1538
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:51,840
No.

1539
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,600
Yeah.

1540
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh.

1541
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,120
Is that an old joke or something?

1542
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,720
I'm supposed to...

1543
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,820
No, it's what I am.

1544
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,720
It's a recurrent nightmare.

1545
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,500
I am a born-again zombie.

1546
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,260
I was just stating a fact.

1547
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,840
I wasn't trying to be funny.

1548
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,300
I thought you had something new.

1549
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,840
Jeez.

1550
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,280
I'm a flatulent...

1551
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,100
I thought you knew.

1552
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,760
...indolent...

1553
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:07,580
I know nothing.

1554
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,020
...pirotechnician.

1555
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,020
I know nothing.

1556
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,140
I'm an indolent pyrotechnician

1557
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,880
and I'm okay.

1558
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,200
Harlecker and Wunderslander

1559
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,300
and Psycho...

1560
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,480
I sleep all night

1561
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,440
and alight all night.

1562
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,860
Hold on.

1563
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,360
I read that.

1564
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:19,900
I'm trying.

1565
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,100
Aye.

1566
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,780
Aye.

1567
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,300
Aye.

1568
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:25,860
Aye.

1569
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,060


1570
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,240


1571
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,560
Aye.

1572
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:26,620
Aye.

1573
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:26,620


1574
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:26,820
Oye.

1575
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,380
Oye.

1576
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,380
Oye.

1577
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,380
Oye.

1578
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,740
Oye.

1579
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,500
Oye.

1580
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,820
Oye.

1581
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,840
We should have an Oye song.

1582
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,560
That's...

1583
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,780
I hope the Oye fellow is listening.

1584
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,360
He was a chronic masturbator

1585
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,320
who's known for calling

1586
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,100
the shows on the station

1587
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,040
and going,

1588
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,380
Oye.

1589
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,860
He died from that.

1590
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,180
Oye.

1591
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:47,800
Oye.

1592
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,340
Oye.

1593
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:48,440


1594
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:48,440


1595
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:48,440


1596
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,880
He died alone.

1597
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,420
Oye.

1598
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,280
Oye.

1599
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,320
Masturbating...

1600
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,680
Delight masturbating?

1601
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:52,940
Oye.

1602
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,920
I think he may have

1603
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,180
suffered a massive malocclusion

1604
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:56,940
of the brain

1605
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,240
and just simply perspired

1606
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,960
right on the spot.

1607
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,200
Oye.

1608
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,700
Oye.

1609
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,720
Oye.

1610
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,900
I think you're making that up, Dave.

1611
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,620
Oye.

1612
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,000
Oye.

1613
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,280
Oye.

1614
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,500
Oye.

1615
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,020
Oye.

1616
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:03,680


1617
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,720
Oye.

1618
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,680
Oye.

1619
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,040
Oye.

1620
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,340
Oye.

1621
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:06,720


1622
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:06,720


1623
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:06,900


1624
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:06,900


1625
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,340
Oye.

1626
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,340


1627
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,340


1628
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:07,480
Oye.

1629
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:07,880
Oye.

1630
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:08,640
Oye.

1631
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,120
Oye.

1632
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,120


1633
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,120


1634
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,620
Oye.

1635
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:13,920
Oye.

1636
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:21,860
Oye.

1637
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,300
Oye.

1638
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:37,900
Oye.

1639
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,360
Oye.

1640
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:39,560
Oye.

1641
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1642
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1643
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1644
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1645
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1646
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1647
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1648
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1649
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1650
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1651
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1652
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1653
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1654
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1655
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1656
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,560


1657
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:39,580
Yikes.

1658
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:39,580


1659
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,360
We've got something more important to talk about

1660
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,820
which I'm not going to talk about

1661
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,260
but I'm just going to play some tapes.

1662
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,320
That's X Day.

1663
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:45,760
Oye.

1664
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,060
Oye.

1665
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:46,960
And also Tex Day

1666
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
which you can't mention.

1667
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,280
Oye.

1668
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:48,440
Oye.

1669
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,440


1670
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,440


1671
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,420
No, you can't mention it.

1672
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:57,400
No, text date is pointless because by the time anyone outside of this show, this moment of this show.

1673
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,960
Yeah, for the future guests, they won't know.

1674
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,140
It won't make any difference.

1675
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,720
We'll be playing tapes of this year's X Day by the time they hear this.

1676
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,920
By that time.

1677
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,200
Have you ever played that?

1678
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,580
But that's them because of the beloved sister stations.

1679
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,620
That's then and this is now.

1680
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,220
Let's keep our temporal artifacts in order.

1681
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:23,140
I mean, let's not go from the past to the future as if it were some sort of thing you could do just by twinkling your little nose there.

1682
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,100
I saw three movies about that very thing just in the last week.

1683
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,280
About quick movements between illacrid moments?

1684
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Oh, yeah, time movies.

1685
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,140
Time movies.

1686
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:33,900
Okay, okay.

1687
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:41,500
Friends, on July 5th, 1998, the world will end at 7 a.m.

1688
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:46,320
when the men from Planet X arrive to rupture up the dues-paying subgeniuses

1689
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:46,900
and destroy.

1690
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,340
Slay or torture all who were, well, everybody else.

1691
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,500
At the present time, they are observing us.

1692
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:07,680
They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher understanding of life and its meaning.

1693
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,120
What do you think about Bob?

1694
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,720
Who's Bob?

1695
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,400
All right, well, what do you think about the UFOs?

1696
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,620
Sure.

1697
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,740
We're presently going to, which are presently in formation,

1698
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,880
to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob.

1699
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,420
You're out of your mind.

1700
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,520
Spacecraft entered the moon.

1701
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,300
...in the sixth segment of the flight.

1702
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,480
The gravity of the moon is one-sixth of that on Earth.

1703
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:47,000
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000.

1704
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,280
The moon's orbit was about 10 miles an hour.

1705
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,400
At 10 after 9, the beeping began.

1706
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:57,680
Went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.

1707
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:04,920
Now it's about the size of the moon, with a small crescent at the bottom that's well lit like starlight.

1708
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,000
The top is a dark gray mass.

1709
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,380
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

1710
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,780
Have you ever heard of one?

1711
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,220
Have you ever been in one?

1712
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,180
Have you ever seen one?

1713
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,860
Have you, by television, ever seen one?

1714
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,660
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

1715
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,400
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft,

1716
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,680
which they call flying saucers,

1717
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,460
and other flying objects which they cannot describe.

1718
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,880
These objects are real and are spacecraft.

1719
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,160
The astronauts returned to Earth on the same day.

1720
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,900
On the sixth day of the week.

1721
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,700
The mutants must appear.

1722
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,240
The mutants must thrive.

1723
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,360
The saucers will fly.

1724
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,020
And the nervous mutants die.

1725
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:31,640
The UFOs are appearing outside the window again today, the 5th of July.

1726
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,720
And, you know, sometimes when they do appear,

1727
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,200
other lights start flashing on and off them, like this newly built house.

1728
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,860
Like these newly built houses right next by this house that I'm in.

1729
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,160
So, I'm not sure.

1730
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,600
I'm not sure what they're living in.

1731
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:52,280
Sometimes the lights flash on and off when they appear or don't appear.

1732
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,620
The UFOs have come back.

1733
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,660
They're outside my window as I speak.

1734
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,480
I can see them.

1735
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,020
I hope it means that X-Day is coming.

1736
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,320
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, deep, doctor, deep, deep, deep, oh.

1737
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,760
Oh, yes, friends.

1738
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,700
Yes, friends, it's scary.

1739
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,480
It's scary indeed.

1740
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,160
Because it's the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1741
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,240
And if you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius,

1742
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:37,240
you can, if you wish, check out www.subgenius.com.

1743
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,940
This music in the background, I believe, is by Reverend Just John.

1744
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,700
Thank you for watching.

1745
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,700


1746
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,700


1747
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,700


1748
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,700


1749
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,800
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, deep, doctor, deep, deep, deep, Oprah.

1750
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,720
Eternally obsessed.

1751
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,740
What is the meaning of eternally being obsessed with soap opera?

1752
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,340
More, more, more, more.

1753
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,300
Control issues.

1754
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:08,880
Give it up.

1755
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,200
Doctor, doctor.

1756
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,500
That's what we're talking about.

1757
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,360
Marianne.

1758
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,060
How do we do it?

1759
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,460
How do we do it? How do we do it? How do we do it? How do we do it? How do we do it?

1760
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,600
Focus, focus. Hypocritical one. Hypocritical one.

1761
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,320
Hell. Hell.

1762
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,500
Anthropologists have found cult. Cult. Cult. Cult.

1763
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,400
Began inventing religions for themselves.

1764
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,200
So, so, no I do not think. No I do not think.

1765
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,920
We live in a, um, in a world. In a world.

1766
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,300
Pain is deep. Real deep.

1767
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,760
Slack. Slack.

1768
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,860
Somebody's miserable.

1769
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,620
Because I don't care. Because I don't care.

1770
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,460
I can be miserable.

1771
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,760
You will always be suffering.

1772
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,480
Pleasure.

1773
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,180
Quick fix. Quick fix. Deep.

1774
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,580
We see what we seek.

1775
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,740
What is it?

1776
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,380
The mother load.

1777
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,880
Narcissism. Narcissism.

1778
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,520
Commit suicide Monday morning.

1779
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,160
Quit jobs.

1780
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,940
The world is falling apart because adults aren't thinking for themselves.

1781
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,920
Good mothers.

1782
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,340
Poor self esteem.

1783
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,320
How does your body feel?

1784
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:00,980
How do you feel?

1785
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:01,560
Thank you.

1786
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,960
98.75% of everything.

1787
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,060
That's what we're talking about.

1788
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,680
I don't personally believe.

1789
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,960
That's what we're talking about.

1790
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,680
I don't personally believe.

1791
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:10,820
And I don't exist.

1792
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,040
Just too frightening.

1793
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,200
Well I don't know.

1794
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,700
Wallow in your life.

1795
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,500
In your problems.

1796
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,820
Dog. Dog. Dog.

1797
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,060
Religion is a problem.

1798
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:18,540
Dog.

1799
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,780
You can fall on your face.

1800
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,520
Getting sick.

1801
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,160
Getting sick.

1802
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:21,580
Dog.

1803
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,080
Getting sick.

1804
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,820
This is a news minute.

1805
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,280
President Bush is guilty.

1806
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,680
He was operated on three times and a metal rod was inserted.

1807
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,600
Administration under siege.

1808
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:32,840
Floating weightless.

1809
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,180
This is a tragic situation.

1810
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,680
Admitting their guilt.

1811
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,960
Marijuana distribution and unlawful transport of firearms.

1812
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,180
Repeat the mistakes of Vietnam.

1813
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,340
I will.

1814
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,940
Drag on. Drag on.

1815
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,520
The agony of Iraq.

1816
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,520
Mission defeated.

1817
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,160
We're strongly behind.

1818
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,620
Behind.

1819
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,820
Carnage and division.

1820
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,900
Incompetent individuals at work.

1821
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,780
Grand conspiracy.

1822
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,360
Burned out President Dick.

1823
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,160
Must be disrupted.

1824
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,400
End the war right now.

1825
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,180
It was a lie.

1826
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,320
Violence continues.

1827
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,160
Petty crimes.

1828
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,540
Corruption in action.

1829
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,240
Give up.

1830
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,220
Let your doubts get the best of you.

1831
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,340
Taste of failure.

1832
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,300
Oh I loved it.

1833
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,300
It was um.

1834
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,660
It's unclear.

1835
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,600
I'm the most.

1836
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,140
Mission defeated.

1837
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,660
Person who ever lived.

1838
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:16,520
I believe that life on earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster.

1839
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,620
Long and hard.

1840
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,120
Penis.

1841
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:18,680
Probed.

1842
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,340
President Bush.

1843
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,080
Harder.

1844
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,040
