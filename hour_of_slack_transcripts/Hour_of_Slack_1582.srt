1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,580
And last, I have control of your radio tubes.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,060
And I do too.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,540
Good. This is Ren Huat.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,520
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,020
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,780
Keep listening, you idiot.

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,120
Else I shall kill you.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,420
Reverend Susie the Flusie is approaching with a cicada.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,000
She has a living cicada.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,640
This is Elroy.

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,920
He's a straggler.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:38,500
He hasn't vanished with the rest of his kind for the next 17 years.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,800
This is Elroy. He's a locust with a time limit.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,260
He's a latecomer.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,420
Yeah, we're going to have like a sweet November thing.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm going to show him a good time.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,420
That's a good thing.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,360
I got out of the waiting pool and reached for my dressing gown.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,860
And he's sitting on top of it.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,040
And I thought, wow, I thought all you dudes were dead.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,860
So I may as well show him a good time.

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,340
What a handsome fellow he is.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,040
In his kiteness.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,600
He's one of the better looking boyfriends I've had, actually.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,720
Has found a new friend.

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,180
I wasn't going to say that, Susie, but I have made the same observation.

28
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,120
It's undeniable.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
I've got terrible judgment in men.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,560
I've seen you walk into this campground with some real, I'm not sure, men.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,780
Were they men?

32
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,500
Were they human at all?

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,620
Up her arm.

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,380
He's going to make me contort, just like a lizard.

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,220
He's contorting her.

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,000
Lizards will get me bent over double.

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,340
They climb on my back.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,540
And before long, they're on my house.

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm an elephant and they've mounted me.

40
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,280
Wow.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,100
They are bestride me.

42
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,180
Well, the creature is out of our view at the present time.

43
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,720
I can't say where he is.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,500
Maybe Princess Weekend.

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,780
No, there he is.

46
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,420
They're the critters.

47
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,980
There he is.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,900
The insectile creature is crawling up the arm of Susie the Flusie.

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,040
And now Princess Wee's palm, if he will get aboard.

50
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,800
And it seems as if he will.

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,040
And so there he is.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Oh, he fell off onto the table.

53
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,660
Our listeners can tune in to Facebook page 15793 to see the streaming video.

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,500
Oh, too late.

55
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,880
I think he's on narcotics now.

56
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,320
I think he may be at the end of his active career.

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,480
Well, that's the idea.

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah.

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,940
I'm showing him a good time.

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,620
Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,300
It's like that Sandy Dennis movie where she finds the, uh...

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,960
Sweet November.

63
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,940
Yeah, Terminal Boyfriend.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,820
So I've got a sweet November trip going with the locust.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,020
Well, uh...

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,560
And actually, that's pretty good for an affair for me.

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,320
Why don't you come around and sit down there?

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,900
Sure.

69
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,240
Give Princess Wee a break.

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,220
Here, hold my thing.

71
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,920
Your microphone, you mean?

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,280
This is just a rehearsal run-through, anyway.

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,260
Yes, we're just, uh, uh, stretching our muscles, uh...

74
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,360
Yes.

75
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,640
Set that microphone on that hat, because I can hear your fingerprints.

76
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,380
Right-o.

77
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,960
Well, now who's making microphone bumps?

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:14,520
Now, see, a super detective like Batman or Doc Savage would be able to identify you by your fingerprints heard on the outside of the microphone.

79
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,200
Uh-huh.

80
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,640
Practice makes perfect.

81
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,860
I thought it was practice makes perverts.

82
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,640
Why not both?

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,740
That's my motto.

84
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,880
That's why I practice, practice, practice.

85
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,580
I'll be at Carnegie Hall soon.

86
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:25,780
I'll be at Carnegie Hall soon.

87
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, don't put on your headphones.

88
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,100
Elroy's in there.

89
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,780
How is your camp, uh, Susie?

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,900
Have you got it all set up?

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,800
You mentioned a wading pool that you were wading in.

92
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,040
Oh, yeah.

93
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,060
I, uh, I really like having a wading pool.

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,940
Uh-huh.

95
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,120
Uh, I've decided to live without air conditioning, just, just out of spite, self-spite.

96
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,740
And, uh, I'll go out and get in the wading pool like three or four times a day.

97
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:50,880
Cool.

98
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,800
I skinny dip in my own yard at night.

99
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,740
Oh, it's a thrill.

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,020
Susie has strange...

101
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,560
You're not talking to me.

102
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,560


103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,560


104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,560


105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,560


106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,260
...forms of slack that involve spiting her face and such.

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,080
Yeah.

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
It's kind of weird, but...

109
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,320
And, uh...

110
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,200
She's not alone.

111
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,200
Lizards.

112
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,640
I've really got a lizard dependency problem.

113
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,440
I know that you're not just saying that.

114
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,020
No.

115
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, it really surprised me this time around.

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,520
It's like, geez, could we pull over at PetSmart?

117
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Yo, you have to get you some lizard every...

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,260
I need a bump.

119
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,880
...at least every couple of days.

120
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,180
Are you familiar with reptiles?

121
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,940
Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,760
I've stroked to that before.

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
Yeah, I used to get that.

124
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,180
That was...

125
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,040
That's pretty good.

126
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,680
It's got interesting things in it, and it turns out the special lingo that the lizard fanciers use that...

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Hemipenis.

128
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,860
Yes, you're familiar with...

129
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,140
They call each other herps, right?

130
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,780
Oh, yeah.

131
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,760
Well, herpetology is...

132
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,460
That's herptiles, or kept reptiles.

133
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,080
Mm-hmm.

134
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,540
When I first got lizards in the late 80s, I was a goober.

135
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,200
I joined the Georgia Herpetological Society.

136
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,580
And then I realized every time they got covered in the newspaper, they were called the Georgia Herpes Society.

137
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,420
Oh, how awful.

138
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,400
It would automatically be proof to that.

139
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,960
And it was just idiots showing off their lizards.

140
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,640
Too bad.

141
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,280
Yeah, so...

142
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,380
But, yeah, that whole herptile thing, they're reptiles.

143
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,940
Susan, you sure would love the...

144
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,140
Just because they're big, that doesn't compromise them.

145
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,260
You would love the rattlesnake roundup in Walnut Springs.

146
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:25,720
In Walnut Springs, Texas.

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,020
Nah, that's just macho jerkery.

148
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,320
Yeah, but it's funny macho jerkery.

149
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,000
And you get to see 400 or 500 rattlesnakes all in a big plexiglass cage.

150
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:47,780
I'd rather walk into the convenience store with a lizard on my shoulder and watch all the rednecks flatten against the candy counter and knock the snickers on the floor, while their women are all over the lizard.

151
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,320
Really?

152
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah.

153
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,020
The male rednecks, or monskos, as we call them, are scared?

154
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,460
They're scared of the lizard.

155
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,360
They're a chick magnet.

156
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,700
The males are terrified of them.

157
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,580
And a lot of the guys will be moved to say something ugly like,

158
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,520
What are you doing with that ugly critter?

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,440
You know, just spill a little disdain to make up for their terror, reptile terror.

160
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,040
And I'll point out to them, this lizard is a chick magnet, man.

161
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,960
And you know, a woman who'll touch a lizard will touch damn near anything.

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,660
Yeah.

163
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,500
And that's when they start going, yeah.

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,580
It makes them rethink reptiles.

165
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,580
Hot damn, I've got to get me one of them.

166
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah, you've got to talk to the yearning in the mark.

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,620
I'm going to get me one of them horny toads.

168
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,460
What's that silly?

169
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,000
A horny toad's an amphibious, like a frog or something.

170
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
It's a toad.

171
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,420
Horny toads, you know?

172
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,640
No, they're hornier than they are toady.

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,540
Yep.

174
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,760
They are, in fact, of the reptile kingdom.

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,340
Yes.

176
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,980
But they're endearing habit of...

177
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,000
Squirting blood out through their eyeballs.

178
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,760
I've never seen one do that, and I used to be surrounded by horned lizards.

179
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, that's because you didn't act like a total asshole.

180
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
I did, actually.

181
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh, you did?

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,660
I don't know why they did.

183
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,700
And they were still forbearant.

184
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,100
Yep.

185
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,700
That's why I had two hognose snakes.

186
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,240
I never saw them play dead.

187
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,540
I wasn't about to annoy them that much.

188
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,780
So those were puff adders, eh?

189
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,240
Oh, yeah.

190
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,180
I let them hiss and flare and strike at my bare fingertip.

191
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,980
Oh, boy.

192
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah, it really got me over snake fear.

193
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,680
I'd be like, ooh, he's so mean, and it, like, flares the little neck out.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
He's so badass.

195
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,080
Little cartoon-looking snake.

196
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
It's an intimidating display.

197
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,440
They were a little Richie Rich Casper nose.

198
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,100
I mean, they're just cute snakes.

199
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,060
Cute snakes.

200
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,280
Cute snakes.

201
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,860
That's right.

202
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,380
They were gateway snakes for me.

203
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,860
That...

204
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:54,920
Bump.

205
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,100
Bump.

206
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,880
On the end of the snout is quite interesting and reappears throughout geologic time as

207
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,780
an adornment to various creatures of reptilian origin.

208
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,560
That makes...

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,120
That's what makes an iguana...

210
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
An iguana...

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,960
Iguana rhinolopha.

212
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,060
The rhinoceros iguana, which can exceed six feet in length.

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
If you're lucky.

214
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,680
Yeah.

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,460
The one that was tricked up with fins to be dimetrodons in Journey to the Center of the

216
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,620
Earth.

217
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,480
Mm-hmm.

218
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
Fighting the tegu.

219
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,840
Oh, is that what that is?

220
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,280
Or is that a caiman?

221
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,540
Those were rhinoceros iguanas.

222
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,880
Animals...

223
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,120
Uh, some animals were harmed in the making of that film.

224
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,600
Mm-hmm.

225
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,180
They were.

226
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,940
Oh, I'm sure they were.

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,640
There's the ones fallen off the...

228
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,280
Oh, no, I'm thinking of the Lost World.

229
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,140
Yes, of course.

230
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,220
The Lost World, they're dead when they're falling.

231
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,820
There's a caiman, a tegu, and an iguana, and there are, like, two different things where

232
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,160
different reptiles mix it up, and sometimes they kind of run together.

233
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,120
Hmm.

234
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:52,860
Well...

235
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,020
What do you mean?

236
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,620
It...

237
00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,980
Their large tegu was painted, but nothing else happened to it.

238
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,760
But the dimetrodons were in a different scene, never encountered the tegu.

239
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,320
I feel that probably the reptiles in 1,000,000 BC were harmed.

240
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,780
Oh, yeah, they look pretty harmed.

241
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,980
Yep.

242
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,860
They look like they have their...

243
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,600
At one point, I think they glued the mouth of one of the...

244
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,440
One onto another, and then, like, somebody right off-screen is holding their back ends

245
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,520
and twisting them and flopping them around.

246
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,120
Yeah, twisting them.

247
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,120


248
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,680
Oh, God, it's kind of hard to watch now.

249
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,780
It was so fun to watch when I was seven years old in the theater.

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah.

251
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,000
On the other hand, possibly a dwarf alligator would use that strategy.

252
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,340
Princess Wee's little newt, which is only two inches long, when it grabs the wad of

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,580
brine shrimp that we drop in the water, it acts like a...

254
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,900
It has to break its neck.

255
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,640
It rolls around and thrashes and, you know, it's kind of like Snoopy playing Red Baron.

256
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,000
This thing is playing alligator.

257
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
Well, we see this again and again.

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,760
He's so badass.

259
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,840
He's so badass.

260
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,160
In the natural world.

261
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,860
That's a great...

262
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,920
Is that on YouTube, Stang?

263
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah.

264
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,840
And it's called what now, for the record?

265
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,500
Fig, the newt that time forgot.

266
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,560
Fig, the newt that time forgot.

267
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,980
On Rev Stang YouTube.

268
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,580
Yes, it is.

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,260
It gets six and a half stars.

270
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,740
We recommend that you watch this exciting piece of cinema.

271
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,780
And the...

272
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:41,560
As far as the death of the Tegu lizard in 1,000,000 BC, it seems to be lying on its

273
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,920
back, spasming after the fight is over with blood pouring out from a neck wound, while

274
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,280
Victor Mature jumps over its tail.

275
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,860
I've seen one part of it.

276
00:10:59,860 --> 00:10:59,860


277
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,320
Thanks,いるвашил.

278
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,160
Just wanted to add a знач biom sort of scary發.

279
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,380
You know some euphemism.

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,340
He might be dead.

284
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,760
Half gorgeous bayonet technique.

285
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,560
movement.

286
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,880
The normals always cheer

287
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,180
when the lizards die.

288
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,020
Do you feel like the rear dwarf

289
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,480
in the dinosaur suit?

290
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Not always.

291
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,120
Now in the same movie, if we could go back

292
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,500
to that 1941

293
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,980
Hal Roach Studios production

294
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,180
1 million B.C.

295
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,280
featuring Lon Chaney Jr.,

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,700
Victor Mature,

297
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,860
and Carol Landis,

298
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,260
the ping girl,

299
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,200
who was the Raquel Welch of her day.

300
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,480
You know,

301
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,000
a funny thing, when you see

302
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,580
the Hammer

303
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,800
remake from British

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,540
Pathé and so on,

305
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,920
there's the scene where Raquel Welch

306
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,860
is supposedly spearing fish.

307
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,300
You know, she

308
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,140
hurls the bone-tipped lance

309
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,380
down into the water, and it cuts

310
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,180
away to the caveman

311
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,480
watching her. And then when she pulls the lance

312
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,580
out, there's a fish

313
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,200
impaled on it.

314
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,620
She didn't really catch a fish?

315
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,720
And then she starts to wipe it on the bank,

316
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,160
and it cuts away again.

317
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,220
Because I'll bet she failed to do that too.

318
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,700
But the whole movie is kind of assembled like that.

319
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,180
When the Allosaurus attacks,

320
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,560
you see the child start to fall out of the tree,

321
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,980
but you never see her fall.

322
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,300
The next time you see her is at the bottom of the tree.

323
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,880
The whole approach is like that.

324
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,560
But when you watch the 1990s,

325
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,800
1941 black and white movie,

326
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,300
in an unbroken shot,

327
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,400
Carol Landis stands

328
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,260
ankle-deep in the water

329
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,760
and effortlessly spears the fish

330
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,740
and pulls them out in the same shot.

331
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,520
There's no question that she

332
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,300
actually is able to

333
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,980
beat the refraction

334
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,080
of the water, which so

335
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,320
frustrated Tumac

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,740
in the 1967 remake.

337
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,580
Maybe they just had suicidal fish that threw themselves

338
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,360
toward the spear. Maybe.

339
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,560
Maybe they cast them that way. But that's some fish rap.

340
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:16,580


341
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,420
wrangler in Hollywood who can portray,

342
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,820
who can get his charges to be enthusiastic

343
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,260
about being speared,

344
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,900
even by Carol Landis.

345
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,760
But now I remember what I wanted to say.

346
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,140
In addition to the mistreatment of lizards

347
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,080
during the extended volcanic eruption scene,

348
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,600
there's the extremely interesting shot

349
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,280
of a woman being overcome by lava

350
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,200
and having it sweep over her.

351
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,480
Do you remember that shot?

352
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,580
I was too busy

353
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,560
whacking it over the wall.

354
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,180
I was too busy whacking it over the lizards.

355
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,200
It's actually

356
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,060
New Pondy, Tumac's

357
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,000
former girlfriend, before he took up

358
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,360
with Loana.

359
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,160
She's running around and the lava

360
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,720
comes toward her in a huge

361
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,280
wave with fire at the edges

362
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,620
and it sweeps over her and you see her hair

363
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,380
flop down on the ground

364
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,840
as the lava sheet covers her.

365
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,380
Are you familiar with that shot, Stan?

366
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
I haven't seen the movie since I was a little kid,

367
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,520
although that does sound familiar and I'm dying to see the movie.

368
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,460
It's in the Castle Films

369
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:16,940
version.

370
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,620
It's an astonishing shot.

371
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,160
It may be the best special effects

372
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
shot in the whole movie.

373
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,260
How do you think they did it?

374
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,580
Just a traveling mat?

375
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,220
It must have been. There's no other way

376
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,000
that could have been done.

377
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,640
Well, in those days they could actually...

378
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,860
The fact is,

379
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,240
unlike all these movies,

380
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,860
you can't stand next to lava.

381
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,680
Oh, as long as the lava doesn't

382
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,780
get on you, you're alright.

383
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,140
No, if you're anywhere near it,

384
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,960
you're instantly cooked through.

385
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,340
It is rock in a molten

386
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,620
state and you have all these characters

387
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,500
in Star Wars and other

388
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,260
movies, you know, just

389
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,780
above the lava.

390
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,360
Many jungle movies, they're

391
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,540
right there next to the lava.

392
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,200
I bet you won't stick your toe in that.

393
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,960
If you're the air in it,

394
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,160
if it's nearby, will instantly

395
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,140
cook you because the heat is

396
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,600
intense.

397
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh, you can feel it outside of tents, too.

398
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,160
Well, it

399
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,600
when it comes, it

400
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
can't be stopped by anyone, including

401
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Tommy Lee Jones.

402
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,120
I think I figured out why

403
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,400
X-Day doesn't happen. It's

404
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
because you're having it at a campground.

405
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah. And we're trying

406
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,460
to get to the future, but to get there,

407
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,520
we have to go past

408
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,060
tents.

409
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,800
Oh, no.

410
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,060
Why don't you marry Dr. Dark?

411
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,320
Where is Dr. Dark? Why don't you

412
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,800
and Dr. Dark get married and have little puns

413
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,220
for children? Well, it's as good an excuse

414
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,460
as you've come up with in 20 freaking

415
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,420
years, dang.

416
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,400
We really should get her and Dr. Dark

417
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,180
on these microphones and just

418
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,260
let them go. Yes. See who can

419
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,000
hurt everyone else the most.

420
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,280
How can you be so cruel?

421
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I'm sorry. Punsters, that's just

422
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,820
so, it's so sadistic.

423
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,540
I'm sorry. I mean, that's the whole

424
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,300
idea behind puns, is make people

425
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,480
groan. I had no children. I've

426
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
got to abuse somebody.

427
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
I understand that. That certainly is.

428
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,360
If I had kids to beat, you'd be

429
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,420
off scot-free.

430
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
I haven't been on scot-free

431
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,380
in a long time. Like a

432
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,480
bucking bronco. Now, we

433
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,320
do have guards to prevent

434
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,180
certain unsavory individuals

435
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,100
from entering the X-Day

436
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,300
campgrounds. Yeah, it worked on me.

437
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,220
Yes,

438
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,320
there are those who would come

439
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
simply for the purpose of disrupting

440
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,080
our sacred

441
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,340
meditations. I tunneled in. Well,

442
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,320
they don't want to disrupt. Most of them just

443
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,280
hate me because I

444
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,080
dare to tell them, shut up.

445
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,260
You're stupid.

446
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,460
I guess that's not very diplomatic,

447
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,520
but everybody else says that

448
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,160
to them. Oh, but when Reverend

449
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,440
Stang says it, oh, then it's really serious.

450
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,340
Then it's them fighting where it's at.

451
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,220
It's just kidding when everybody else says it.

452
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,440
Reverend Stang says it, oh, and then he's

453
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,360
serious. All the other people that say,

454
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
go away, man. You're irritating everyone.

455
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,560
They don't hear

456
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,320
that. They just hear it when I say it.

457
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,640
Well, you... Of course, I have the power to enforce

458
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
it. When they... I'm mad.

459
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,180
Mad with power. Can't take a joke.

460
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,000
Mad, I dare you.

461
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,620
And I like it that way.

462
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,420
The drugs I took seem to light up

463
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,140
my brain. The very moon

464
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,560
is frightened of me, frightened to death.

465
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,140
The moon itself

466
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,120
will grovel at my feet.

467
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,960
The poor thing.

468
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,320
I didn't wash them.

469
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,180
I wanted to grow up to be

470
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,360
Claude Rains ranting

471
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,080
madly in The Invisible Man.

472
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Mm-hmm. Well, he's only able to

473
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,360
come back at the end.

474
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,500
Well, that's the point of

475
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,560
that story was, oh, yeah, you think you want

476
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,760
to be invisible, kid?

477
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,440
Wait until you find out

478
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,140
you can't ever close your eyes!

479
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,360
And other problems,

480
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
yes. And people can see

481
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,680
what you just had for dinner.

482
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Right. And you can't see your feet

483
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,640
when you're going downstairs.

484
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Oh, I didn't think about that.

485
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Oh, all kinds of problems. Oh, it would

486
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,220
mess me up bad. No

487
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,460
girls' locker rooms for old Reverend Stang.

488
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,500
No, sir. That's the

489
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,660
idea behind invisibility, of course.

490
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,200
Well, you've got... Where you would appear

491
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,580
as a bubble in the sea. A cloud of

492
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,380
mist as water condenses

493
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,600
on your body, giving

494
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,540
you away. Look, there's

495
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,560
a turned-on ghost running around in here!

496
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,260
It's shaped like a man with a panhandle.

497
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,480
Oh, yes. You know,

498
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,000
we've been doing this for over an hour now.

499
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,440
Really. This is just a run-through.

500
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
This isn't a real show, of course. Perhaps this is the

501
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,380
time... Just an hour and a half long rehearsal.

502
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,540
This is a stunt show. To introduce the subject of

503
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,420
Ball's Pyramid Island.

504
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,500
You must have seen the pictures

505
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,560
that I sent of the island.

506
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,500
Yes, I studied...

507
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
Not only that, but we played

508
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,700
you talking about Ball's Pyramid

509
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,480
Island on the show, and

510
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
some rock star came up to

511
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,220
Philo or Wellman or

512
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,500
somebody and said, I was just

513
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,600
listening... Oh, to you, right? I was just

514
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
listening to you talking about

515
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,140
the Pyramid Island. Ball's Pyramid Island, yes.

516
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,520
In the age of downloads, you

517
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,380
can listen to your, quote,

518
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,640
radio, unquote,

519
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
at your leisure.

520
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,420
Your favorite program. You simply

521
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,900
download it.

522
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,200
Is that so? What are they

523
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,460
going to think of next? And not only

524
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,660
are they rendering radio irrelevant

525
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,540
with this jiggery-pokery, but

526
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,180
also television, because

527
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,320
now there are studios for

528
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,920
podcast TV.

529
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,540
And I'll admit, I've been on it

530
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,500
several times, and puzzling evidence

531
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,260
was giving serious thought to,

532
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,440
you know, we could move in there and do our

533
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,380
own TV show.

534
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,880
But you have to shave to do a TV show.

535
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,180
Not only that, you...

536
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,420
I mean, that would turn out to be... Maybe not Susie wouldn't have

537
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,340
to shave quite as much. All we would

538
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,020
ever do... I never quite crossed my legs.

539
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,600
No. Bruises.

540
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,500
No, to do a TV show is... We were on

541
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,980
TV last night. Labor intensive.

542
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
The, uh... Not what

543
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,560
you do for fun. You can now... It's major

544
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
work to do a TV show. You can now

545
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,340
point your phone at

546
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,140
yourself and

547
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,160
push the right button on Facebook,

548
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,600
and you'll be broadcasting

549
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
a movie to Facebook. We did

550
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
that last night on the stage, and

551
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
25 people were looking at this upside

552
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,020
down, completely

553
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
unlit scene. For

554
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,340
two hours! It was

555
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,460
fascinating. God, you'd think they'd have something better to do.

556
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Even better than Andy Warhol's

557
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,700
Empire.

558
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,520
But we had no lights on on the

559
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,900
stage. No, it was just... His

560
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,780
movie, which was a single

561
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,220
five-hour shot of the Empire State

562
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,160
Building. Oh, Empire State Building.

563
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,420
Well, he had a movie called

564
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,560
Sleep, right? Yeah. Where somebody just sleeps.

565
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,500
Right. Wow, that's so conceptual. I think he had Paul Morris

566
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,680
in film, actually. What a great artist!

567
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,300
God, what a great artist! To

568
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,160
even conceive of such a

569
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,700
masterful notion!

570
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,200
How could it even enter the head of...

571
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,500
No normal person would think of something

572
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,480
as brilliant as running a camera for five

573
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,320
hours on a sleeping person. Did you, uh...

574
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,460
He's doing his best work right now, though,

575
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,300
because there's an Earth cam on

576
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Andy Warhol's grave. Oh, is there?

577
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah. Oh, okay. I used to have a

578
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,600
bookmarked. I haven't looked in in a long time.

579
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
You know there's some

580
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,260
online service where you can

581
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
find, using satellite

582
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,500
photography, the grave of any

583
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,080
person. And some

584
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,420
wag sent me a picture

585
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,740
of Aunt Bertha's grave.

586
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,220
Wow. I need that

587
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,480
app. Well, you... I can't live without

588
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,500
that app that finds where people's graves

589
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
are. Yes, you can... I have no apps.

590
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,360
You can get their headstone and

591
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,120
get an image of... I didn't either until the CR

592
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,800
is silent.

593
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,580
The CRAP app.

594
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,660
Recently, there have been new photographs

595
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,440
of Ball's Pyramid Island from above,

596
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,440
showing its insane,

597
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,140
thin, blade-like

598
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,840
structure.

599
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,340
And more boisterous

600
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,560
people with too much

601
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
time on their hands have been trying

602
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,720
to reach it across the

603
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,260
Tasman Sea, though it's

604
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,760
difficult to land on its

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,820
vertical face

606
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,840
in an ocean which is

607
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,540
seething with water.

608
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,680
And it's also

609
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,120
seething with sharks of all kinds.

610
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,740
Yeah, but that keeps the prehistoric animals

611
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,220
safe from rats, doesn't it?

612
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,720
It is a protruding spire of the

613
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,900
sunken continent of

614
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,580
Zealandia, near

615
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,060
New Zealand.

616
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,640
And its closest island

617
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,820
is Lord Howe Island,

618
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,920
where, as you know, the

619
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,980
beloved giant insects,

620
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,860
or tree lobsters, were

621
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,420
entirely destroyed

622
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,840
when rats escaped the

623
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,360
island.

624
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


625
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,700
fish freighter Mogambo,

626
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,120
which had run aground.

627
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,320
I thought that was Ann Howe Island.

628
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,600
The tree lobsters

629
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,300
were consumed, being slow

630
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,980
moving and pacifistic by the

631
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,220
avid rats. And quite tasty.

632
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,920
But it wasn't until the early

633
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
decade of the present century

634
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,060
that scientists discovered a

635
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,980
colony of the giant bugs

636
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,440
living in the inaccessible

637
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,540
reaches of Ball's

638
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
amazing spire,

639
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,300
which jaggedly sticks up out of the

640
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,240
Tasman Sea, and looks like

641
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
a matte painting from a

642
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,780
Willis O'Brien movie.

643
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,780
Yeah, it doesn't look real at all.

644
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
It's too incredible in appearance,

645
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,140
but it's worth looking up,

646
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,380
looking online to

647
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,160
see this incredible lake.

648
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,960
That sounds like a really hard

649
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,480
place to get to, and a rough environment.

650
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,680
It's almost impossible to get to.

651
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,560
You need special equipment. But they had it.

652
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
Well, if we have to do X-Day,

653
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,340
again, I say let's go to Ball's

654
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,900
Pyramid Island. There's no

655
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,860
source of food or water. The

656
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,420
sunshine is merciless. The sea

657
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,280
below is full of avid

658
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,720
sharks. There's no place to sit or rest.

659
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
It's a perfect place to have X-Day.

660
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,260
Keep out the riff-raff. Only

661
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,500
crazy people would do something like that.

662
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,300
We'll probably wind up going

663
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,400
somewhere where someone has pyramid-shaped

664
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
balls. The scientists

665
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,340
found these giant insects,

666
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,880
which are phasmids.

667
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,800
They

668
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,940
have an endearing

669
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,460
appearance to me. They were

670
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,380
known as tree lobsters by

671
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,860
the indigenes on

672
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,400
Lord Howe Island. They do

673
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,340
live in the trees, are peaceful,

674
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
and they, on their

675
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,440
legs, they have a structure which looks as if

676
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,360
they're wearing pants.

677
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,600
They display altruism.

678
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,160
Slacks. The slack part. Not usually seen

679
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,440
in the insect kingdom. When scientists

680
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,240
came and raided their home,

681
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,940
the males threw their

682
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,240
legs and bodies over the females

683
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,340
to try to protect them. But

684
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,520
to no avail, as they

685
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
were collected by the

686
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,740
assiduous science team

687
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,340
and brought back to

688
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,360
the breeding station

689
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
in Queensland, Australia.

690
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,540
Where ever since they've

691
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,280
raised an enormous

692
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,380
population of

693
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,900
these oversized

694
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,720
arthropods. They're good eating, too.

695
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,380
Well, by rats.

696
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
But, on the other hand,

697
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,540
they then reintroduced

698
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,460
the species onto Lord Howe

699
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,260
Island and created

700
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,540
a systematic program of

701
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,940
exterminating the rats.

702
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,320
With the result that now there are

703
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
no rats, but there are

704
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,380
the giant tree lobsters

705
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,480
once again on Lord Howe.

706
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,220
Which I'm sure the

707
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,180
inhabitants are quite grateful for.

708
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,900
Giant tree eating lobsters.

709
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,280
Elroy really liked

710
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,140
that story.

711
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,980
I believe it was, was it

712
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,120
Diane Fossey who went and

713
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,500
complimented them on their

714
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,960
breeding program?

715
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
Or one of those

716
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,340
primatologists?

717
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,880
Diane Hanson.

718
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,100
No, it wasn't her.

719
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,620
She was a great primatologist.

720
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,160
She really

721
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,720
She understood

722
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,460
the motivations of apes.

723
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,540
She studied lobsters with the foot

724
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,120
morphology that resembled high-heeled

725
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,780
shoes and the whip-like

726
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,320
extensions of the second pair of legs.

727
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
Now, when you were going on about

728
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,660
the tree lobsters, Elroy was

729
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,180
waving his

730
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,680
his horse.

731
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,100
Howe goes on about the tree lobsters so he can say

732
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,460
Lord Howe Island a lot of times.

733
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,720
It makes him feel important to say that.

734
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,160
Phasmids aren't like that.

735
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,500
They tend to be long, stick-like

736
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,120
things like walking stick

737
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,940
insects and twig

738
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,720
insects and so forth. But the

739
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,220
Lord Howe Island

740
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,300
tree lobsters are beefier

741
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,260
and larger.

742
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,340
Susie has had a mic in one hand

743
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,340
and a

744
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,940
locust.

745
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,100
Crawling around, he's a 17

746
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,300
year locust.

747
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,300
You won't see his like again for another

748
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
17 years.

749
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,180
A cicada is more squat and broad.

750
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,300
And he's among the last

751
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,940
of his kind of this

752
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,400
phase because most of them have

753
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,440
already come and had

754
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,300
their egg-laying ceremony

755
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,540
and died off.

756
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,360
So I'm showing him the last good time he's

757
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,420
going to have. If I can make

758
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,240
a bug happy.

759
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,980
Then you know you've done something.

760
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,300
It wouldn't be the first time.

761
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,440
Now he's crawling to the end

762
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,760
of your pinky finger.

763
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,600
And what's he going to do there?

764
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,860
I think it makes him feel

765
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,680
superior when he's mounted.

766
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,960
Like King Kong on his

767
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,120
island eminence.

768
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,200
He falls over a lot. I think he's got

769
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,900
an ugdre oblom prey.

770
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,220
He's the king of Floos Island.

771
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,840
It could be that he's

772
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,700
at the end of his active

773
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,500
career

774
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,100
having already

775
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,580
fulfilled his biologic

776
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,460
duty.

777
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I know how he feels.

778
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,000
Not with me.

779
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,800
I'm not full of eggs.

780
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,640
A few sad, desultory

781
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,580
years remain.

782
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,080
When I found him I was naked and he was

783
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
on my dressing gown.

784
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,120
I get out. I'm

785
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,380
standing there next to my tent dripping

786
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,420
and naked. I reach for my

787
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,680
dressing gown and

788
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,000
there's this locust on it.

789
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,480
I thought he was dead.

790
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,820
They got clingy bits.

791
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,140
Clingy bits. It was so personable.

792
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,300
Then he fell over and it's like

793
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,420
aww. It's just like guys I've

794
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,380
felt sorry for before. A lot of people would

795
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,260
just say, eww, a bug. Eww.

796
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,640
I walked him all the way down from my campsite.

797
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,420
He was crawling all over me.

798
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,400
He's been crawling all over you for the whole

799
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,980
last hour.

800
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,260
He was nice.

801
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,960
I let him get to second base.

802
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,020
You got a problem with that?

803
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Things crawl all over Susie.

804
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,640
All the luck.

805
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,360
They've never done anything to me that

806
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,040
hasn't washed off. What the hell?

807
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,700
So easy.

808
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
You can crawl on me.

809
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,440
She's an easy woman if you're a lizard.

810
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,960
She's an easy woman if you're a

811
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,420
if you have six legs.

812
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,840
Yeah.

813
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,900
She's an easy woman if you're cold blooded.

814
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,540
We're not talking about barflies and

815
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,580
lounge lizards here.

816
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,560
You've got scales and that freaky long toe.

817
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,480
Dr. Howell, I'm getting tired.

818
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,260
And it's

819
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,480
Tired.

820
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,500
I need to drink something.

821
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,120
I need to eat something.

822
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,580
This rehearsal has been going on for an hour and a half.

823
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,320
How about those tangerines

824
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,360
over there? Are those fair game

825
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,300
for those who dare

826
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,720
to try to assimilate food?

827
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,600
Friends, you've been listening to some kind of bits and pieces

828
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,220
of some kind of an hour of slack

829
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,880
recorded here at lovely

830
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,040
Wisteria Campground and Events Center

831
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,080
near Pomeroy, Ohio.

832
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,240
Praise Bob.

833
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,820
Praise Wisteria. Thank you

834
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,420
Reverend Susie the Fousey.

835
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,440
Fresh from WREK Atlanta.

836
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,500
Thank you Dr. Howell.

837
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,920
Fresh from KPFA

838
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,160
Berkeley and Radio Valencia.

839
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,040
And thank

840
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,600
me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

841
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,280
Thank you kindly, Reverend Stang.

842
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,960
Running the equipment.

843
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,980
Yes. Anyone have some

844
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,440
crops for my bug? I think he's hungry.

845
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,260
Now I'll

846
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,920
raise the music

847
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,780
and lower the mics.

848
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,300
Yes, we will all

849
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,280
dip our... I know they eat crops. That's about it.

850
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,920
Wouldn't eat a banana. Wouldn't eat a grape. He wants crops.

851
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,520
Fade out all the microphones

852
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,040
at once.

853
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,800
Well, fade out those microphones

854
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
on that

855
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,960
pre-recorded

856
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,880
live show. Actually it was

857
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,940
edited some.

858
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm

859
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,920
not sure if it was edited.

860
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,500
That's all of

861
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,180
last X Day's show for now.

862
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,720
I think we recorded

863
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,520
a lot of shows

864
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,100
at X Day.

865
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,880
And you can see pictures

866
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,600
now on subgenius.com

867
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,980
of 19X Day

868
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,360
including some great close-ups

869
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,560
that Princess We took of Susie's

870
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,460
cicada, which has

871
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,560
demonic red

872
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,840
eyes and

873
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,060
black carapace. Very weird looking.

874
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,360
Or locust or whatever it was.

875
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,800
It's a very dramatic looking insect.

876
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,220
The way to see these pictures

877
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,460
is you go to subgenius.com

878
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,500
and there's

879
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,380
in the upper right

880
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,660
on a bar with some other things

881
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,200
is the word events. And if you click on that

882
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,280
and then scroll down a little bit

883
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,420
you'll find the event,

884
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,340
the past event called 19X Day

885
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,640
and a big link

886
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,940
to the edited

887
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,120
chronological photos.

888
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,200
Actually click on that

889
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,020
and you'll find anything on there that says X Day.

890
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,820
There's also a link right in the middle of the

891
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,580
main paragraph on

892
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,820
subgenius.com

893
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,640
homepage. And there's a lot of other

894
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,440
X Day pictures.

895
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,620
It was a 10T

896
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,040
X Day, but we don't have pictures

897
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,940
of that now that everybody's boss

898
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,780
and grandma are on Facebook

899
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,020
with them. And

900
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,260
we talked

901
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,360
a bit about that movie

902
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
1 Million B.C. and later on at

903
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,860
X Day, days later, it was shown

904
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,140
and it's still on

905
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,340
somewhere if you ever want to see it

906
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,280
sitting in the theater

907
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,060
or the Netflix box with

908
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

909
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,720
Cow Pie to you.

910
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,740
Oh yes, Mrs. Cow Pie.

911
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,260
Who's Mrs. Cow Pie

912
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,580
today?

913
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm sorry. Who is

914
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,160
Mrs. Cow Pie today?

915
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,280
Lonesome Cow Pie Dave?

916
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,440
Yes. Huh.

917
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,960
I answered properly, didn't I?

918
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,960
I'm looking for a fillet.

919
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,440
I suppose so.

920
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,160
And I just thought

921
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,040
I would call her

922
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,620
Long-Step Seamstress Jane

923
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:52,900
or

924
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,620
Parcho Patchouli Filly

925
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,980
Ginny. Yeah,

926
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,080
I got a bunch of names. I'm trying to

927
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,400
fill out pictures. Is it blonde?

928
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,720
Is it brunette? Is she redhead?

929
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,020
She's all women to all kinds of things

930
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,440
I think.

931
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,700
That's Connie.

932
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,160
She's Connie, yeah. Maybe that's

933
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,220
who I'm looking for is Connie.

934
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,080
But isn't that who every man is

935
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,720
looking for?

936
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,000
Not if they know better.

937
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,040
Yeah, really.

938
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,380
I've been there, done that.

939
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,520
Ain't gonna do it again.

940
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,620
Yeah, some men miss

941
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,940
those whirling red lights

942
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
that are spinning around Connie's head.

943
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,960
Yeah, the EMS vehicles

944
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,620
trying to get through the traffic.

945
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,200
I think once

946
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,240
you've been asphyxiated by Connie

947
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
you never come back

948
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,980
and you never go forward.

949
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,940
There's all kinds of directions

950
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,620
and you get right out of the map.

951
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,160
That's probably true.

952
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,660
Well, she's the spouse of

953
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs, or at least the

954
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,780
primary spouse, the primary

955
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,840
wife of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

956
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,900
And I guess

957
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,420
he's her primary

958
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,040
husband.

959
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,700
Who

960
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,120
knows about that family?

961
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,800
Who knows who wears the panties and who wears

962
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
the breeches?

963
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,080
Why not both?

964
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,580
I can hear you playing my music

965
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,240
in the background, and that's why

966
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,880
I thought of Connie as such a dear

967
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,980
and not dear.

968
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,860
I don't know anybody would call her a dear.

969
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,120
Dave remembered this on music.

970
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,200
Sounds good.

971
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,180
Quite a feat for a man

972
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,960
who has no vessels, er, no feet,

973
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,460
no blood vessels left

974
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,580
to concern himself with.

975
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,360
You're devoid of blood vessels, Dave?

976
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,540
And divine.

977
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,720
I lie hereby now

978
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,920
pronounce Connie

979
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,460
to be an official ex-bug and

980
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,940
squack of the magazine Republic.

981
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,740
It's a place with feet

982
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,080
and one not feet.

983
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,720
Ah, never mind. See, I took

984
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,180
the wrong road. I'm sorry.

985
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,680
The, uh, the true

986
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,660
uberfems, speaking of

987
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,580
feet and Connie, often

988
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,060
have giant feet.

989
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Yeah. You know, like hobbits,

990
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,540
only they're not small as hobbits,

991
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,860
but their feet are bigger

992
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,820
than even hobbits' feet.

993
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,820
Or human feet.

994
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,360
And they sometimes have what we call

995
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,600
the Morlock toe

996
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,160
on some uberfems

997
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,780
that, whose names I

998
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,620
could but won't mention.

999
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,580
Is that the middle toe

1000
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,940
is longer than the big toe?

1001
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,760
Uh, well

1002
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,520
that's part of it, but there's also

1003
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,680
the, um,

1004
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,900
that thumb-like big toe.

1005
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,360
Ah. Yeah.

1006
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,400
The opposable big toe is

1007
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,820
unusual on human feet.

1008
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,740
But not that unusual

1009
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,840
on subgenius uberfems.

1010
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,780
Or, or some

1011
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,420
other, um, simians

1012
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,220
also have an opposable,

1013
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,660
or at least a disagreeable,

1014
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,620
if not opposable, disagreeable thumb.

1015
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,440
And that's why

1016
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,600
we find Connie in all the

1017
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,680
strangest places, because you know

1018
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,440
what they say about women with big feet?

1019
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,380
Yeah.

1020
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
Small hands.

1021
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,100
Yeah.

1022
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah.

1023
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,920
It's always bad to have a thumb

1024
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,840
with a bad attitude.

1025
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,400
No, we don't want to make fun of the small-handed now,

1026
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,620
folks, because, you know, we want,

1027
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,860
we don't want to be, uh,

1028
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,680
rude to the

1029
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,300
special people

1030
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,340
with those special tiny little

1031
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,100
hands.

1032
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,520
That's not something that most

1033
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,060
people should be ashamed of.

1034
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,360
Really? Not most of you

1035
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,620
listeners, but

1036
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,620
not most of you small-handed listeners.

1037
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,820
But even small hands can be

1038
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,140
reached all the way down into deep pockets.

1039
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,660
Oh, yeah, the smaller

1040
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,100
the hands are, the further they can get

1041
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,780
into your pocket.

1042
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,480
Yep, they're pretty underhanded.

1043
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,360
And the greater the need

1044
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,040
to get into something.

1045
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,800
Well, Karl Marx was also a friend of

1046
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,040
Groucho's unbeknownst

1047
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,820
brother, once said that

1048
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,640
the small hands shall inherit

1049
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,100
the earth, and they have nothing to lose but their testicles.

1050
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,600
And he was talking...

1051
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1052
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,540
Well, okay,

1053
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,280
so he was, maybe

1054
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,720
he was talking about workers of the world.

1055
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,520
But that's still, you know...

1056
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,720
Wankers of the world.

1057
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,700
The small wankers of the world.

1058
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,700
Rankerous wankers

1059
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,600
of the world. Rankerous wankers, that's

1060
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,760
what we've got here, folks.

1061
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,960
And that's who's on your hair waves

1062
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,520
every Sunday night. Every Sunday

1063
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,200
night. On your

1064
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,380
hair waves, did you say?

1065
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,960
Yes. Jase.

1066
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,360
German hair waves.

1067
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,280
Ja, ja.

1068
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Ja.

1069
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,260
Ja.

1070
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,480
Ja.

1071
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,580
Ja. Well, have you been making

1072
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,240
the news today, Dave?

1073
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,720
I have been, uh, almost. Or have you

1074
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,480
been the news?

1075
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,800
I've been the news almost. Or a victim

1076
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,880
of the news? I was a victim

1077
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,800
of the news because there was an accident

1078
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
and I was

1079
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,940
forced to wait around

1080
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,500
to see what

1081
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,580
the police could, what kind of report

1082
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,640
or something that a

1083
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,620
cover sheet that the police

1084
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,400
could reply with.

1085
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,140
What they would divulge.

1086
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,600
Dave, I just saw something that might make you

1087
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,780
feel better about things.

1088
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,800
I have a lot, I have two or three friends

1089
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,560
who have, who monitor

1090
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,580
the police band and

1091
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,800
constantly report on what the police

1092
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,900
are doing, but they don't get paid for it.

1093
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,180
Well,

1094
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
how would that help me because they

1095
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,800
play it all the time and I just stick my fingers in my

1096
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,340
ears and scream I don't want to go.

1097
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
But you get paid, right?

1098
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,160
Right. Something.

1099
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,260
They play it constantly.

1100
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,660
And whenever somebody

1101
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,820
says something is happening in your district

1102
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,240
or part of the world,

1103
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
you're supposed to jump up and run to your car

1104
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
and take your notebook and your camera, your

1105
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
vlogging camera with you and

1106
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,780
fight your way through traffic to find

1107
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,900
out the real story.

1108
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
It could be worse, Dave. You could be

1109
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,820
stuck in an office all the time.

1110
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,820
In fact, I've got a little, a short... It's still most of the time.

1111
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,380
I have a really good

1112
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,700
short poem here that was written

1113
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,780
by a subgenius who lives

1114
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,820
in Mexico.

1115
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,380
And who's, I think

1116
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,620
English is his second language.

1117
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,440
He's, his name is

1118
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,000
Joaquin de la Garza

1119
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,920
and he has a poem

1120
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,480
about his job and I think

1121
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,780
our listeners who have office jobs

1122
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,660
including the incoming

1123
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,520
DJ might like this poem.

1124
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,680
It's pretty short.

1125
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll turn this back. What am I, any, any

1126
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,380
in Spanish?

1127
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,180
No, in English.

1128
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,800
And he, he was concerned about his

1129
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,300
English but it's great.

1130
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,240
Anyway, here it is.

1131
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,660
The colors of these walls thirst for creativity.

1132
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,180
Their goal is not to promote it

1133
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,520
but to snuff it out.

1134
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,040
The building was painted this way

1135
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,020
by ogres and demons.

1136
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,220
Beings whose bigger enemy

1137
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,560
is hope. Dreams give them

1138
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,520
pain. My slack gives them

1139
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
the runs. Our laughter,

1140
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,660
wrath.

1141
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,500
Fight it, don't I? Between phrases

1142
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,280
that have three different meanings,

1143
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,900
I can recognize the stupidity while I end up

1144
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,260
shadowboxing with bitterness.

1145
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,340
Type like a butterfly.

1146
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,740
Graph like a bee, Cassius would

1147
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,580
say if he never became Ali.

1148
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,500
Alcohol helped

1149
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,440
but I lost even the spirits.

1150
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,180
Stopped hanging out.

1151
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,680
I lost my youth which got filed

1152
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,660
alongside my performance review.

1153
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,620
My employee ID

1154
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,840
is E376787.

1155
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,820
Did I use that

1156
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,140
to have a name? No.

1157
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,720
I think not. Risk management.

1158
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,380
Six sigma

1159
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,740
team building. But I'm not

1160
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,800
yet lost. I may be blind

1161
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,680
and mute but I still got touch.

1162
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,620
One sense is enough

1163
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,320
to move forward. Strip me down.

1164
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,300
I'll fight naked if I have to.

1165
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,820
Fiends, I challenge you until my last

1166
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,740
day. I'll keep searching for the way to weasel

1167
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,800
out of this. When I find it, I'll share

1168
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,700
it with my fellow yeti. I pity

1169
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
you monsters that are unaware of what

1170
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,780
you are. I pity you men that don't

1171
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,860
realize you have become that which you hate most.

1172
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,820
Pity me. Still here.

1173
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,180
One sense left.

1174
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,980
Banting these walls.

1175
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,800
By

1176
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,460
Reverend Joaquin

1177
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,980
Joaquin de la Garza

1178
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,340
did that. Praise

1179
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,100
Joaquin de la Garza.

1180
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,020
Princess, he lives in Mexicali

1181
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,820
which is right across the border from

1182
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,040
Cala Mexico

1183
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,800
or whatever over there south

1184
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,220
of the unearthly

1185
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,380
Salton Sea.

1186
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,040
Near Arizona.

1187
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,240
Poor Joaquin is

1188
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,580
breathing Salton Sea

1189
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,640
dirt on the freight a little bit.

1190
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,860
But not indoors. Not as long as he's

1191
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,840
in his office you see.

1192
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,940
I forgot to say

1193
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,740
how to say

1194
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,700
in Espanol. I forgot how to

1195
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,360
say it but he is certainly above

1196
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,960
something.

1197
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
You liked that poem did you?

1198
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,860
I liked that poem. I thought that was well said.

1199
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,740
I thought there was something so

1200
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,620
vital and so magnificent

1201
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,340
about it that I had to pee pee.

1202
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,940
Well he's like many of us

1203
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,520
stuck in one of those office

1204
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,080
jobs and wants

1205
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:19,900
more.

1206
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,580
He actually probably would like to do his job.

1207
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,680
He'd like to have the opportunity to do

1208
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,660
his job better. That was often

1209
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
how I felt when I was in office

1210
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,760
jobs. It's like please let me

1211
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,740
do this right. No! Do it our

1212
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,000
way. Oh yeah.

1213
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,700
This is the way it's been done for

1214
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,580
millions of years. I have

1215
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,520
had an office job in one time

1216
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,900
in which I was actually fired

1217
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,500
for coming up with better ideas

1218
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,660
than the company had for how to do stuff.

1219
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,620
They thought I was being a

1220
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,640
wise arse and I just thought I was

1221
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,540
doing the right thing. Act like an

1222
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,500
idiot and they'll treat you as an

1223
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,560
equal. To paraphrase

1224
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,740
Bob's radio unsafe

1225
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,760
slogan. But act like a super

1226
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
genius and they will fire you.

1227
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Fire you.

1228
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,460
Well that's why

1229
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,600
we use the masks of

1230
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,720
insanity which is actually

1231
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,680
like where you pretend to be

1232
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,640
normal. You act just

1233
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,840
like one of them or as close

1234
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,640
to it as you can.

1235
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,580
Princess we did that for 29

1236
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,620
years. She pretended to like

1237
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,700
those people. I did. They never

1238
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,760
ever knew

1239
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,480
the religion she had been raised

1240
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,660
in. Her outside

1241
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,580
activities. They didn't know she was

1242
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,440
in any bands.

1243
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,460
They didn't know whether

1244
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,380
she was a peace activist.

1245
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,480
Or a war

1246
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,220
monger.

1247
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,440
They did in the early years

1248
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,720
that I worked there but eventually.

1249
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,300
They rubbed elbows

1250
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,260
with every day and still didn't

1251
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,500
really truly care about her. They didn't

1252
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,000
want to know and

1253
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,340
she didn't volunteer.

1254
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,960
Don't ask don't tell.

1255
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,860
That was such a great policy.

1256
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,540
Wasn't masks of insanity wasn't that a

1257
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,360
Reverend Larry band?

1258
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,240
I mean Larry

1259
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,620
Sir Lawrence. Angry Larry?

1260
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,000
Wasn't that a sanguine

1261
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,460
Angry Larry

1262
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,800
band masks

1263
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,380
of insanity? But you can't say

1264
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,980
on this radio show.

1265
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,600
You can't say something 20 minutes after

1266
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
the thing's been set up because it gets

1267
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,680
forgotten in the stew.

1268
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,720
Reverend Angry Larry

1269
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,380
discovered a new band

1270
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,680
that may have an amino

1271
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,800
acid in it. Really?

1272
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,260
Yeah it's called specimen.

1273
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,320
Not specimen

1274
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,700
but speciman.

1275
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,540
It's named after that rubber stamp

1276
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,140
that he got at the

1277
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,680
bulldata auction. Somebody auctioned

1278
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,780
off a big rubber stamp that was misspelled.

1279
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,420
It said specimen.

1280
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,320
Instead of specimen.

1281
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:51,640
When is the

1282
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,320
divival with the Reverend?

1283
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,040
When is the divo divival?

1284
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,320
The divo divival is

1285
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,520
August 15th

1286
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,700
and 20th

1287
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,520
and uh. 15th

1288
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,600
and 20th? 19th. 19th

1289
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,460
and 20th. 19th and 20th. Did I say 15th and 20th?

1290
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,280
Oh by the way we went to the

1291
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,520
Mark Mothersbaugh

1292
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,200
art show that's at the

1293
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,380
Museum of Contemporary Art

1294
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,520
in Cleveland.

1295
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,480
I was mad I didn't go sooner.

1296
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,080
It's there through August

1297
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,580
listeners and if you haven't seen

1298
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,880
the Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh

1299
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,160
art show and divo

1300
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,440
stuff at that

1301
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,360
fancy museum I would

1302
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,020
tell you that I

1303
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,480
Princess Wee and I

1304
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,720
and the Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh

1305
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,720
and Reverend Heathen certainly enjoyed the heck out of it.

1306
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,220
That fancy museum being

1307
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,580
the Museum of Contemporary

1308
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,020
Art. Yeah the MOCA.

1309
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,540
Euclid and 422.

1310
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,720
320. 322.

1311
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,840
You got 420 on the mind.

1312
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,300
420 on the mind.

1313
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,020
320. Yeah for 322.

1314
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,500
So anyway, Yale. It was

1315
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,500
uh they had

1316
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,700
I was hoping that it wouldn't

1317
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,520
be a bunch of his portraits that

1318
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,600
just have that Photoshop mirror effect

1319
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,540
and praise Bob there

1320
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,460
were none of those but he had a full

1321
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,440
life size actual car

1322
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,460
to which he had done

1323
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,600
what he had previously been doing

1324
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,900
only in Photoshop.

1325
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,240
Which is the car had two

1326
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,200
rear ends. It was mirrored

1327
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,640
in the middle. Like many people that he knows.

1328
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,580
There was no driver area

1329
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,760
it was just two rear ends on this

1330
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,600
fancy, really fancy

1331
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,600
car. Yes.

1332
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,680
It's true of so many of us he speaks in a

1333
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,100
very elegant tongue

1334
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,640
about people who are not in the

1335
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,320
driver's seat who have two rear ends.

1336
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,580
It was a thing of beauty.

1337
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,520
The thing with the two ends.

1338
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,780
It's still, I'm sure it still is a thing

1339
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,560
of beauty but I've been just bombarded

1340
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,680
with pictures of Mark Mothersbaugh

1341
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,120
making different faces and

1342
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,720
his body being occluded up to

1343
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,520
his eyeballs and then the

1344
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,480
weird Photoshop going around and I

1345
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,540
didn't see any cars yet but I guess

1346
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,080
I have to go to Cloma or

1347
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,680
have to go to New Zealand. No actually

1348
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,560
just join the church of the

1349
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,400
subgenius and go to our members

1350
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,040
only Google group of

1351
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,860
Scrub Genius which you already

1352
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,700
are a member of Dave and you can

1353
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,500
see the picture of the car. You can see all the pictures.

1354
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,500
Yeah there's, no not all of them I just

1355
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,920
posted a few in Scrub.

1356
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,220
If you ever show,

1357
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,420
if you ever post any of my films.

1358
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,500
Take pictures in the museum there and then put them on your

1359
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,840
website. That's illegal.

1360
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,200
You're whatevs.

1361
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:33,900
Whatevs.

1362
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,220
Yes sneak peeks are

1363
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,840
illegal right Dave?

1364
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,200
Are they? No I don't think so.

1365
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,280
Dave's just trying to get you scared.

1366
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,620
Yeah I was trying to

1367
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,240
do that. I was trying to

1368
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,460
That is absolutely

1369
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,020
Yeah if you go into

1370
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,400
the William and Martin Museum

1371
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,340
to take a picture of a Van Gogh painting

1372
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,820
that Van Gogh guy will see you.

1373
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,740
If you put it on your Facebook page Van Gogh will come after you.

1374
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,320
No the museum says this is our

1375
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,620
property for a brief time.

1376
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,540
Right. Well it's the property of

1377
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,360
somebody else and we are the licensed agents

1378
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,320
of said property under which conditions

1379
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,680
as the purveyors have agreed

1380
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,040
to X, Y, and Z

1381
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,900
therefore we agree to Z, Y, and X.

1382
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,480
They had a

1383
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,680
in the gift shop

1384
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,880
were a few mother's

1385
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,500
body and products

1386
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,300
like buttons

1387
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,660
and coffee mugs but there was

1388
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,160
a rubber ducky.

1389
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,480
A Devo rubber ducky

1390
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,620
quack that whip

1391
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,980
it said on the side.

1392
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,660
And I did get that but I

1393
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,660
didn't get the $40 coffee table

1394
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,660
book of Mark's art. You know I

1395
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,740
I will

1396
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,680
but I used to stay at that guy's

1397
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,160
house.

1398
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,760
I can remember a time when he actually

1399
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,440
said to me

1400
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,640
Stan if you can help me get my

1401
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,460
art rep back

1402
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,080
that would be the best thing you could do to help

1403
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,200
you know pay me back.

1404
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,760
He had done music for our commercial

1405
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,520
for nothing and I said

1406
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,580
can I pay you back somehow so you can help me get my

1407
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,340
art rep back and that was 25 years ago

1408
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,720
and now he's

1409
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
in the business of

1410
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,300
has the whole top floor

1411
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,480
of the fanciest art museum

1412
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,420
in Cleveland. So

1413
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,360
that's a subgenius that made good.

1414
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,440
Of course he was Devo before he was

1415
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,400
subgenius. I found

1416
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,780
your photo of the paragraph

1417
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,580
that I think would irk.

1418
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
I found it too. Reverend Casale.

1419
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,720
It wasn't exactly as you said but

1420
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,140
but yes I could see what you meant about it.

1421
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,060
It was like Mark

1422
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,400
worked and collaborated with Jerry

1423
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,180
Casale and many others

1424
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,620
but dot dot dot

1425
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,240
and I think that but

1426
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,720
would be the

1427
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,820
but that would irk

1428
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,120
The dot dot dot is the

1429
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,540
print version of the yada yada yada

1430
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,040
No that's it's a form of elliptical

1431
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,540
thinking. Yeah it's an ellipse

1432
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,420
it's called but

1433
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,720
I prefer eye lips

1434
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,660
Put your eye lips a little

1435
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,260
closer to the phone

1436
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,520
That but could cause some butthurt

1437
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,480
Yeah just my

1438
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,780
but. I prefer to call it proctalgia

1439
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,720
that's the technical term. Proctalgia

1440
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,240
Proctalgia I like it

1441
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,120
That was a great band

1442
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:13,940
Proctalgia

1443
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,660
What's that band name we came up with

1444
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,400
in the car on the way here

1445
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,600
Purvish Durvish

1446
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:23,840
Faeces

1447
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,740
Oh that's right Faeces

1448
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,400
F A E Y

1449
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,780
C E S

1450
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,440
The feces of fairies

1451
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,400
We were thinking of a couple of

1452
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,520
folks we knew that were into that

1453
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,860
fae and faerie

1454
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,720
stuff and thought well if you were

1455
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,020
a punk faerie

1456
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,620
then your band might well be called

1457
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,420
Faeces

1458
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,580
Every band name I ever come up with has been taken

1459
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,460
by a bunch of Brooklyn hipsters

1460
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,320
Bastards

1461
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,380
Have you passed the point of no return

1462
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,800
which is namely the Greenpoint Bridge

1463
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,380
That was a good band too

1464
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,720
I have a friend

1465
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,740
where I you know many in a past

1466
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,360
life I had a friend who

1467
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,800
was a Brooklyn hipster before it was cool to be

1468
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,640
a Brooklyn hipster. It's all

1469
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,320
How can such a thing be?

1470
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,040
Yeah

1471
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,660
He like moved to Williamsburg in

1472
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,460
like 2000 and it was before

1473
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,940
the place got a

1474
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,520
reputation

1475
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,500
such as it has now

1476
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,560
I would say

1477
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,180
the 1990s there were

1478
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,640
swords of swath moving into the Arians

1479
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,620
Not the Arians

1480
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,700
but the actual pickle factory nearby

1481
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,620
there was

1482
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,520
You know where they had the

1483
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,720
Polish ladies working there all day and all

1484
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,080
night and don't give them any money

1485
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,760
Well maybe this speaks more to the

1486
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,800
cultural naivete I had 15 years

1487
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,600
ago than reality

1488
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,560
Well you thought everything

1489
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,340
was in your temporal landscape

1490
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,420
that's what they like to say if they you know

1491
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,740
dig the dirt so to speak

1492
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,840
but if they know what they're talking about

1493
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,620
your temporal

1494
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,400
landscape was 2001

1495
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,520
One year

1496
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,840
after the evil autocrats

1497
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,720
invaded America and bombed

1498
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,720
the World Trade Center. Is that 2001?

1499
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,160
2001?

1500
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,420
If you're referring to the

1501
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,320
9-11 attacks that was in 2001

1502
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,960
That's what I was referring to

1503
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,720
2001 was the year that happened

1504
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,700
Or so

1505
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,020
the conspiracy would have us believe

1506
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:25,280
So called 2001

1507
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,300
So called 2001

1508
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,680
We know it's

1509
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,940
not 1998 yet

1510
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,060
Right. That's all we know

1511
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,660
If we even know

1512
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,700
that much

1513
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,460
No

1514
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,840
The future and the past are a dark

1515
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,420
figurine. It's very

1516
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,600
very undelightful that we're going to get

1517
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,480
the answers soon

1518
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,140
And the conspiracy keeps getting more and more

1519
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,140
sophisticated in the way they manipulate

1520
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,380
our minds and our calendars

1521
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,580
You know anybody who's old enough remembers

1522
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,560
where they were when they found out about the

1523
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,400
JFK assassination

1524
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,460
and of course

1525
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,580
nowadays everyone knows where they were when they found out

1526
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,540
about the 9-11 attacks

1527
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,820
but it turns out that a lot of people

1528
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,540
Yeah

1529
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,720
a lot of people's memories about where they were

1530
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,660
when they found out about 9-11 are actually incorrect

1531
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,480
A lot of people think that

1532
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,500
President Kennedy was killed on July 5th

1533
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,320
19 2001

1534
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,460
or 9-11 September

1535
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,000
and vice versa

1536
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,080
A lot of people think that

1537
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,340
the Holiday Book Center down there

1538
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,560
Well actually I believe

1539
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,380
that JFK was actually assassinated

1540
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,080
in the summer of 2016

1541
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,380
Yeah by irate

1542
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,680
not Hispanic

1543
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,080
but Muslim

1544
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,120
and autocrats

1545
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,260
There's just so many of them going around

1546
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,020
Yeah there was a shooting that just happened

1547
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,280
a block away from Dealey Plaza

1548
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,180
in Dallas not too long ago

1549
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,980
and I'm pretty sure that's when JFK was actually killed

1550
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,160
Yeah

1551
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,020
But nobody can put a clear number on when

1552
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs was killed

1553
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,060
because he's getting killed every like 5 minutes

1554
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,600
Well yeah

1555
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,020
Go ahead and kill Bob he'll be fine

1556
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,840
You know our friend Barnes

1557
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,240
James Barnes

1558
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,120
told me about

1559
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,420
what he called the Mandela Effect

1560
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,560
and according to this

1561
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,360
particular conspiracy theory

1562
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,260
some

1563
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,280
things have been changed

1564
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,260
in the past

1565
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,540
His example was that a lot of people remember

1566
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,580
Nelson Mandela dying in jail

1567
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,660
Another thing was

1568
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,020
the Berenstain Bears

1569
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,560
Now for some reason

1570
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,320
they're called the Berenstain Bears

1571
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,480
but everybody remembers them being the Berenstain Bears

1572
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,220
Well some people

1573
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,460
Did someone go back in time and change things

1574
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,460
and make a sloppy job of it?

1575
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,960
Yeah it's the way

1576
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,620
well they're trying to say that it's the way

1577
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,580
things transmogrify and slip side

1578
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,720
into a different thing

1579
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,360
and then everybody remembers that thing as like kind of a

1580
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,560
collective consciousness

1581
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,480
where everybody mispronounces the same word

1582
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,140
the same way

1583
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,700
but it's not really true

1584
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,780
what's really true is they really are changing the past and future

1585
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,380
and they're exerting their form of mind control

1586
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,720
on everybody else's

1587
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,840
I think it's just

1588
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,600
marijuana that makes people

1589
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,560
think those things

1590
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,080
that would actually explain

1591
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,240
a lot of it

1592
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,940
wouldn't it?

1593
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,040
and brain damage

1594
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,700
other things

1595
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,940
that change your memory

1596
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,220
like life and your brain

1597
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,500
Who's racist?

1598
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,560
Calling it marijuana is racist

1599
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,620
Because it's a Spanish

1600
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,380
That was a term that was

1601
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,580
used by some people

1602
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,860
in some subcultures in Mexico

1603
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,360
but I mean historically

1604
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,360
it was known as hemp or cannabis

1605
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:42,700
and

1606
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,560
they started popularizing the term

1607
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,720
marijuana to associate it with

1608
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,940
those very same people

1609
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,400
that Donald Trump wants to build a wall

1610
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,860
to keep out

1611
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,560
so I think we should stop calling it marijuana

1612
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,120
Donald Trump was there back in 1929

1613
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,900
exporting all those people to

1614
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,520
Dutch Slovenia

1615
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,640
That's why Trump is so incoherent

1616
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,960
he's had a time machine

1617
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,000
that was one of the things that Fred Trump Sr.

1618
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,460
gave him as a gift

1619
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,960
when he came of age

1620
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,180
he spent so much time traveling through time

1621
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,820
What do you think Back to the Future 2

1622
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,480
is based on?

1623
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,960
He's Biff Tannen

1624
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,400
He can't keep anything straight anymore

1625
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,120
and that's why he's so wacky

1626
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
It's because he spent

1627
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,720
so much time traveling

1628
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,140
I feel sorry for the man

1629
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,000
I could see him with his hat and his hair

1630
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,580
the way it is

1631
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,220
I could see him with a special superhero suit

1632
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,060
when he goes back into the past

1633
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,460
and stuff like that into the future kind of like a Superman

1634
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,880
cloak and

1635
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,640
banana peel one foot in the grave

1636
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,860
and one foot on a banana peel

1637
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,340
that's what they used to say about him

1638
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,600
When the balloons dropped

1639
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
for him at the RNC I was actually

1640
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,780
there in the room and you know what song they played for him?

1641
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,820
What song did they play?

1642
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,660
You can't

1643
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,000
always get what you want

1644
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,840
I wondered when they used that

1645
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,220
That's a hopeful thing isn't it?

1646
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,460
Of course he ended up getting sued by the Stones

1647
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,740
and of course he's not Donald Trump if he's not suing somebody

1648
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,740
or getting sued by somebody

1649
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,700
A lot more appropriate tune would have been Gimme Shelter

1650
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:12,660
Right

1651
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,620
Rape, murder, it's just a shot of Wayne

1652
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:15,700
Yeah

1653
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,140
Well he doesn't believe in hamburgers

1654
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,020
in the American way

1655
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,860
He believes in his own pseudo science

1656
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,600
They say he's an apocryphal liar

1657
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,420
How can he not believe in hamburgers if his name is Donald?

1658
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,400
Right

1659
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,780
I told the subgeniuses

1660
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,740
that we weren't going to talk about him tonight

1661
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,440
but there you go

1662
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,140
I was making shows

1663
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:40,720
I didn't

1664
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,500
Well he's hated by many, Ronald McDonald is really hated by many

1665
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,960
and he does kind of look like Ronald Trump

1666
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,840
Donald Trump

1667
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,440
Wait a minute

1668
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,280
Maybe you're on to something there

1669
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,720
Yeah I think you are

1670
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,320
And what you're on to is the Hour of Slack

1671
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,020
the radio ministry of Church of the Subgenius

1672
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:05,420
and you can learn more about Bob Dobbs, Connie Dobbs,

1673
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,000
Susie Cicada

1674
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,640
and everything else

1675
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,000
at subgenius.com

1676
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,300
and

1677
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:14,680
and

1678
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,120
and I

1679
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,380
and that means it's time for us to go

1680
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,520
pretty much

1681
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,220
and let next show in

1682
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,000
but

1683
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,700
there is a thing

1684
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,100
If only we could go pretty much

1685
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,280
That would solve so many problems

1686
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,440
If we could go pretty much instead of little tinklings like we do

1687
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,160
I'm gonna play

1688
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,580
a

1689
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,720
a rest of an instrumental that's been

1690
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,040
occasionally going in the background

1691
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,740
A lot of the time the background music was by

1692
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1693
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,440
but other times it was by

1694
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,460
the Rudy Schwartz project

1695
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,500
What else here?

1696
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,320
Ed Fred

1697
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,980
Xavier Cougat

1698
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,740
Oh

1699
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,660
And

1700
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,920
the Swingin' Mud Parts

1701
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,240
But this is

1702
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,280
the Rudy

1703
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,580
Schwartz project

1704
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,420
Thank you

1705
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:08,940
Oh

1706
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,720
