Open fire, keep it busy!

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,100
What's the big idea?

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,860
Let's get going.

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,540
And remember, no smoking.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,920
Let's go!

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,460
The SoGenius Power Roles Watch.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:51,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm prompted by a broader federal probe into fraud and the giveaway to the wealthy.

9
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:58,140
The Trump administration says it is considering waiving to storm-ravage Puerto Rico, 35%,

10
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,840
as well as 20%.

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,660
As well as 7%.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,900
As well as 3%.

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,340
With just 50%.

14
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,940
That means PR News.

15
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:11,560
What makes a total mockery out of the working class for the wealthy?

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,760
PR's Report reports Congress is no longer in charge of the broad fraud program.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,920
PR's Report is under federal investigation.

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,220
PR's Bad.

The Dow 42-22-3-26.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,840
PR's Report reports election authorities say this is PR news.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:28,840


22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,900
Hurray to PR news in Washington!

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,280

Bob?

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,860
Say, have you ever noticed that Ruth Buzzy has a lot of tension in her eyeball?

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,040
Sometimes a vein will pop out of that milky orb and make a sloshing sound, like when you

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,100
carry around Baba Ganoush in your goddamn sock puppet.

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,960
Lately it's been rubbing me the wrong way.

33
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,880
Franching down to the palindrome for the big rock and roll show, butter and crackers passed

34
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,640
a medicinal can of the storefront where three guys took turns playing rock, paper, scissors

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
and listened to newly remastered Gino Vanelli albums.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:20,300
Muffled screams passed through the air vents, but a row of customers seemed unconcerned.

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,840
They'd hoped to purchase 15 grams of Mimosa Sunset Shatter and maybe some rolling sugar,

38
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:25,840


39
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,360
but unfortunately they would be detained.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,320
For the first time, butter and crackers would learn all about rotary screw air compressors,

41
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,180
and serendipitously, the police department would notice improved visual surveillance

42
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,540
in the vicinity of the grey discharge blooms.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,540
It was definitely a win-win scenario for all concerned.

44
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:19,920
We did talk to our harpoon

45
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,420
Thank you.

46
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,880
Thank you.

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:38,160
When they emptied the dumpster, a sanitation worker named Pops noticed that both of the corpses had stubby little legs that wiggled back and forth like a broken thermometer on the hide of a beached vanity.

48
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:52,880
Once the coroner had completed his investigation, their hair and skin were used to make drinking candies for the Turkish gendarmerie, and the organs were donated to the Boots Randolph Youth Outreach Ministry.

its significance as a subject of discussion

because you can joke about something

66
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,660
that means there's something there that you joke about

jokes aren't about nothing

the upcoming meeting with the Exists

will be tomorrow on the landing field at 7am

76
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,100
then either on the

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,860

depending upon the throw of the dice

79
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,560
so somebody was talking about having a countdown, Anna

80
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,240
well we always do, don't we?

81
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,660
we're out there counting down

82
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,620
yeah

83
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,200
we can start counting down, I guess

84
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
not now, but when we're out there

85
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,480
why not? let's start countdown

86
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,100
oh that takes too long

87
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,620
let's start now

88
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,540
no, it's far too long

89
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,200
we start like, you know, 10,000 or something

90
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,720
count backwards from 10,000

91
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,420
the number of bottles of beer on the wall

92
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,820
yeah, what if we actually miss it?

93
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,620
we need a calculator

94
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,980
anybody got a calculator?

95
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,400
we're going to have to calculate some

96
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,360
how long we need to start

97
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,400
my true love will be waiting

98
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,160
waiting at the end of my ride

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,540
my phone doesn't work down here

100
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,760
so you weren't able to reach Stang on the interocitor?

101
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,840
I need to send a text message to Reverend Stang

102
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,020
well give it a try

103
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,980
you know, let those nimble fingers go to work

104
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,840
on the screen

105
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,060
and we'll see if maybe we can get there

106
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,600
shoot out one little ball of information

107
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,600
a little bit of information

108
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,600


109
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,520
a little bit of signal

110
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,940
and all the rest of that noise

111
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,300
we'll see if it can be done

112
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,580
ah, we're just drifting along

113
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,820
on a web of unconcealed delight

114
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,600
here

115
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,660
all readies itself for the great convulsive moment

116
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,920
of X-Day itself

117
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,560
now only a few hours away

118
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,560
when we shall stand in radiant glory

119
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,020
upon the landing field

120
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,100
and see the great shining

121
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,160
silver saucer

122
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,400
come to receive us

123
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,340
the golden ramps shall silently unfold

124
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,900
and hallelujah

125
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,340
up the stairs we go

126
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,900
yes, just as Jacob saw the shining figures

127
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,120
going up and down

128
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,140
the landing ramps so shall be

129
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,120
and in an instant be shown to your spacious stateroom

130
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,080
then the fun relishes

131
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,340
thisята can Capital seat

132
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,100
grow into the fluffy

133
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,100


134
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,100


135
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,100


136
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,100


137
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,100


138
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:20,140
and make this a baby

139
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,400
of their lack of adaptability for this particular eventuation.

140
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,660
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

141
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,660
On the other hand, the problem all along has been not of authentication,

142
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,820
but of the correct identification of the time.

143
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:50,860
It could be that despite all the pleasing indications we've received,

144
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,300
there may yet be yet another reason to delay if the exists choose not to manifest themselves.

145
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:05,760
And I only mention this to show that we think of every eventuality here, even the highly improbable.

146
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:13,600
So, if that is the case, I think we are all seasoned campaigners enough to know what to do.

147
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,900
That is to say, wait till next year.

148
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,300
And continue to gather and garner subgeniuses into the church.

149
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,400
Remember, we only evangelize to get them.

150
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,200
We don't want everybody. We can't get everybody.

151
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,900
Everybody is not a subgenius.

152
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:46,280
Only the true subgeniuses will be attracted and fall naturally into our orbit.

153
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,880
And we would like to give everyone an appropriate...

154
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,860
...time frame in which to do so.

155
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,760
But time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

156
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,520
The former live too little, and the latter live too long.

157
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,860
Okay, let's get down to it, Boppers.

158
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
BOOOOOOP

159
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,260
GO HOME TO YOUR MOTHER.

160
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,840
DOESN'T SHE EVER WATCH YOU?

161
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,120
TELL HER THIS ISN'T SOME COMMUNIST DAYCARE CENTER.

162
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,080
TELL YOUR MOTHER I'M NOT GOING TO THE STATE.

163
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,520
I HATE HER.

164
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,180
TELL YOUR MOTHER I HATE YOU.

165
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,500
BOOOOOOP

166
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,180
I HATE YOU.

167
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,860
I HATE YOU.

168
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,080
THE END.

169
00:15:51,080 --> 00:16:21,080


170
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,300
neNe, Mireille.

171
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,940
die, die, die.

172
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,340
I've committed

173
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:32,960
the essential crime that contains all others in itself.

174
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,060
encouraging my agents to deface party posters

175
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,620
and hoarding announcements.

176
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,580
I read and memorized Goldstein's book.

177
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,300
For 30 years, I had plotted to bring down the party.

178
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,060
I was sick in mind and body,

179
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,380
together with my colleagues

180
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,540
Xe'er and Su'rra

181
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,220
I did count them

182
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
to the corporate party

183
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,140
including

184
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,840
excellent requirements

185
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,800
of travel funds

186
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,660
to the past

187
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,200
or to the future

188
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,960
to an age when thought

189
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,460
is free

190
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,040
from the age of Big Brother

191
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,220
from the age

192
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,000
of the Thought Police

193
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,380
from a dead man

194
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,340
greetings

195
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,260
You are about to undergo

196
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,300
long wave radiation

197
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,880
a buzzer will sound

198
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,240
I've been doing it

199
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,520
a couple of years

200
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,200
and all this didn't happen

201
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,020
We practiced this

202
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,580
with the zone

203
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,820
and now it's in vibrate

204
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,500
very much so

205
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm going to go

206
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:47,980
to the front

207
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:47,980


208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,500
go

209
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
There is light

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,000


211
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,060
Come on

212
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,060


213
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,180
aera

214
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,720
always

215
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,340
Take seven

216
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,360
ok

217
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,320
yes

218
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,980
come on

219
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,960
Welcome

220
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,340
Welcome

221
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,980
The world

222
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,080
Is my oyster

223
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,080
The world

224
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,300
Is my oyster

225
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,180
The world

226
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,500
Is my oyster

227
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,180
Welcome

228
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,260
Bob

229
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,360
Relax

230
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,920
Don't you ask

231
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,220
When you wanna come

232
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,160
Relax

233
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,520
Don't you ask

234
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,420
When you wanna suck at your wits

235
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:20,920
Relax

236
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,360
Don't you ask

237
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,920
Bob

238
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,540
When you wanna come

239
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,080
When you wanna come

240
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,280
When you wanna come

241
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,940
When you wanna come

242
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,820
When you wanna come

243
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,560
When you wanna come

244
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,960
When you wanna come

245
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
When you wanna come

246
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,500
When you wanna come

247
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,960
When you wanna come

248
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,460
When you wanna come

249
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,180
When you wanna come

250
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:17,140
When you wanna come

251
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,240
Not numbered.

252
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,020
Okay, it's a second printing anyway.

253
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,280
1981.

254
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,060
Inside Bob's Cult's Dallas Pow Wow.

255
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,800
So this is an article by Jay Kinney about a...

256
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Saint Jay Kinney.

257
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,660
Saint Jay Kinney.

258
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,720
And it's many pictures.

259
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:48,840
There's tentatively a convenience with his two braids being pulled out from the side of his head by...

260
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,060
Well done.

261
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Yes.

262
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:57,000
I have looked up tentatively a convenience, who I remember fondly, from lots of church literature in the old, old days.

263
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,780
He counts himself as a former subgenius, but he's still definitely making art.

264
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,980
Definitely starving.

265
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:06,840
Definitely...

266
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,720
In their swing and in the subgenius tradition.

267
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,400
So even though he considers himself a former subgenius, he is obviously still a subgenius.

268
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,100
I...

269
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,500
You know, most churches don't let you just walk away.

270
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,600
His involvement has been less, that's for sure.

271
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,720
He leaves the KGB and nobody leaves the church.

272
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
That's the assumption, yes.

273
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,780
Nope, nobody does.

274
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,780
Unless, of course, it's on their pleasure saucer.

275
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,960
And how many hours until we enjoy that...

276
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,560
The Exist Hellfire?

277
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:46,120
14 hours, 28 minutes, and 45 seconds.

278
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,880
Here we go.

279
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,420
One, two...

280
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,920
Jopstown.

281
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,080
Jopstown.

282
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,900
Here I come.

283
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,940
I'm going to...

284
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,140
Jopstown.

285
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,140
Jopstown.

286
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Here I come.

287
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,260
They got some crazy little...

288
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,160
Jopsteads.

289
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,720
There ain't nothing gonna get me one.

290
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:33,480
You know, with a face that is reproduced everywhere, one doesn't need to show it all, only enough of it to be the identifier.

291
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,900
And then the rest of it is...

292
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,240
It's implied.

293
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,920
Even seen by those who don't look carefully.

294
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,600
So trim it down.

295
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,600
Put it on your lighter.

296
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,600
Let me see that.

297
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,660
Where's that other lighter?

298
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,680
The lighter I had.

299
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,640
Oh, it's my lighter.

300
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,900
But let me see that Bob thing over there.

301
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,220
That paper that you've got.

302
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,500
The Bob face?

303
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,920
This one?

304
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,700
No, the one that you were saying could be put on a lighter.

305
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,480
You see, it's the...

306
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,700
It can.

307
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,080
This is the big version.

308
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,480
Well, it can.

309
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,760
Because notice, it's the height.

310
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,880
The proper height.

311
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,040
Yeah, well...

312
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,180
You just need to trim it down a little bit, and then, wow.

313
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,600
I admit, it will look awesome once you trim it down.

314
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,260
It's gonna look unbelievable.

315
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,240
You need the scissors, and not the scissors of sight, either.

316
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,760
That's the editing function, which we all have and can exercise.

317
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,840
Without any effort, of course, it withers or does not expand to be what it ought to be.

318
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,680
Well...

319
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:34,840
It's a little...

320
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:42,840
Arrange the way these things end up, and it'll become part of our special...

321
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,920
So, are we gonna do a show in the morning if we...

322
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,220
I mean, assuming that we don't die and our...

323
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,820
Well, you know, I'm not sure I like this morning thing, but maybe we could do it...

324
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,480
We could do it on the saucers, or we could do it here, and I know...

325
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,600
I'm an expert now setting this up.

326
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,740
Well, sometimes one might want to go back and take a nap after all this.

327
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,480
I think I'll take a...

328
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:04,740
You want to...

329
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,900
You want to take a nap after...

330
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,720
Well, it's possible.

331
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,780
I might want to take a nap, a nice, soft...

332
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,380
We're gonna be so excited, though.

333
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,480
Yes.

334
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:12,620
Maybe.

335
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,420
Another reason to take a nap.

336
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,060
You know, or we could be disappointed.

337
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,200
True.

338
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,460
We might have a day of disappointment.

339
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,280
Yes, so a nap.

340
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,080
But what's new?

341
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,820
We can do that.

342
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,080
We can celebrate a day of disappointment.

343
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,800
Sure.

344
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,180
It just requires the stamina.

345
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,700
Think about, you know, even in disappointment, there's sometimes some fun in there.

346
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
From having recently taken a nap.

347
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,040
Hiding.

348
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,060
A nap.

349
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,460
Hiding deep inside disappointment.

350
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,700
Right.

351
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:49,800
The disappointment itself, not the secret to be discerned, but yet another concealing action.

352
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,240
It hides what's really going on.

353
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,980
Yeah, deep inside disappointment.

354
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,960
It's filled with glee and fun.

355
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,880
It's real, real deep, though.

356
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,080
It's almost inert.

357
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,520
It's like an inert element.

358
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,260
Somewhere, a little core essence.

359
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,280
Deep inside.

360
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,560
It happens.

361
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,940
Oh, five minutes to go.

362
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,580
Five minutes.

363
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,760
Five minutes.

364
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,980
Just five minutes.

365
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,320
Five minutes till showtime.

366
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,340
I feel the tension building.

367
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,040
You have time for...

368
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,680
Make it to the snack bar one more time.

369
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,860
The snack bar.

370
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,840
Let's go.

371
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,640
Come on.

372
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,140
Come on.

373
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,920
Come on.

374
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,720
Come on.

375
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


376
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


377
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


378
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


379
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


380
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


381
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


382
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


383
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


384
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


385
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


386
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


387
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,720


388
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, the snack bar will close in a little less...

389
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:38,940
Hot dogs.

390
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,220
The snack bar will close probably in a matter of 15 minutes.

391
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,100
Well, soon we'll get the snack bars on the saucers.

392
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,300
Yeah.

393
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,780
And they have all the good snacks.

394
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,380
That's right.

395
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
All very fine edibles.

396
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,580
Do you have anything to say in the next four minutes to the faithful?

397
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,060
Fuck.

398
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,180
Fuck.

399
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,640
Pick.

400
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,060
Peas.

401
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,620
Fuck.

402
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,820
Peas.

403
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,400
Fuck.

404
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,420
Peas.

405
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,000
Fuck.

406
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,040
Peas.

407
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,620
Fuck.

408
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,600
Peas.

409
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,120
Fuck.

410
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,140
Peas.

411
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,300
Fuck.

412
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,660
Peas.

413
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,800
Well, now we got our fuck peas, Shannon.

414
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,120
Fuck peas.

415
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,700
Hey, kids.

416
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,300
We got one more minute to make it to the snack bar.

417
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,440
The saucers will be here in two minutes.

418
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,960
Two minutes.

419
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,380
Two minutes.

420
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,040
Just two minutes?

421
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,320
Just two minutes.

422
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,320
Three, two, one, order.

423
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,880
One minute.

424
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
I think we'll get em with two more.

425
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,800
Whoa.

426
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,360
Whoa.

427
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
Summon the saucers.

428
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,320
What a good job.

429
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,540
Don't get caught in between that beam right there.

430
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,300
Don't cross the streams.

431
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,380
Split your head in two.

432
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,620
Thanks for battling.

433
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,340
Stay back.

434
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,540
It's not safe for you.

435
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,320
Yes, don't cross the streams.

436
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,240
Or do cross the streams.

437
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,160
Ooh.

438
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,840
If you're into that.

439
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,660
Seize your protection.

440
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,800
So, assuming...

441
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,800
that we don't die

442
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,260
or we live

443
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,360
and we are off

444
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,320
in space somewhere.

445
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,680
It must be.

446
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,340
We could pick up

447
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,060
this whole table

448
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,000
and take it with us

449
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,480
so it's not that big a deal.

450
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,040
Well,

451
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,800
it will.

452
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's hook some electricity up.

453
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:17,860
They're going to have

454
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,620
plenty of that around.

455
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,360
But they can make us think

456
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,120
that we're sitting

457
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,720
at a table

458
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,040
and even feeling it,

459
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,120
touching it,

460
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,920
tapping it.

461
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,500
You don't even

462
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,860
plug your stuff in.

463
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,860
It just picks up

464
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,060
the air,

465
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:30,660
you know,

466
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,560
the electricity,

467
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,380
the ions in the air.

468
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,200
and that they use

469
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,820
and then

470
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,800
corresponding

471
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
to what one would

472
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,500
expect to hear.

473
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,800
Yes.

474
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,520
What one would expect

475
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,180
you to do?

476
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,140
We must expect

477
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,340
that our

478
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,200
often reported

479
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
So are you going to do

480
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
the videotaping tomorrow,

481
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,620
Dr. Howell?

482
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,760
What videoing is this?

483
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,080
You mean when the saucers

484
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,720
descend?

485
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,100
There's a thing in the box

486
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,380
for attaching iPhones

487
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,880
and such to the tripod.

488
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,860
The thing in the box.

489
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,880
No, sir.

490
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,160
I was not considering

491
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,380
doing that.

492
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,200
But anyone is welcome

493
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,580
to use both tripods

494
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,840
and or the video camera.

495
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,880
We should encourage

496
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,380
everyone

497
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,500
to take videos

498
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,580
with your phones

499
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,380
or something.

500
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,000
We're having a little bit of

501
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760
whatever electronic device

502
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,420
we've had some changes

503
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,280
take videos

504
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,680
because Reverend Stang

505
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,900
normally takes videos.

506
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,060
We'd like someone

507
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,120
to take over

508
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,840
this important function.

509
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,440
Sure you can.

510
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,960
You don't need

511
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,920
internet to do that.

512
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,280
It just needs someone

513
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,420
to take a game.

514
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,360
It just needs someone

515
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


516
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


517
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


518
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


519
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


520
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:33,360


521
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,420
to take a game.

522
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,160
You just need to

523
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,540
remember

524
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,240
don't hold your phone

525
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
up like this.

526
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,960
Hold it like this.

527
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,100
Okay?

528
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,720
Panorama.

529
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,640
When you're videotaping?

530
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,060
Yes.

531
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,500
Don't do a portrait

532
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,900
style movie.

533
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,980
In Vista Fiction.

534
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,440
Because then it's going

535
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
to hit when you look

536
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:52,900
at it later

537
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,240
it's going to be

538
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,520
these giant black bars

539
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
on both sides of it.

540
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,480
They're just wasted space.

541
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,960
Giant Panamation.

542
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,780
The new miracle

543
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,260
What do people think

544
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,060
about those black

545
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,680
what do you think

546
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,220
when you see

547
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,960
those black bars

548
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,360
what do you think

549
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,760
What do you think

550
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:04,940
Censorship.

551
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,140
No I think somebody

552
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,160
What do you think

553
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,180
about the black bars?

554
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,140
The giant black bars

555
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,440
on either side

556
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,120
of the movie.

557
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh those are

558
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,740
the black bars.

559
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,880
Oh yeah.

560
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,860
Nobody ever goes

561
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,400
out there.

562
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,320
The movie ends

563
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,360
before you get out there.

564
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,120
I always feel like

565
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm looking at a movie

566
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,760
like through the crack

567
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,360
of a door.

568
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,200
I can't actually

569
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,100
see the whole movie.

570
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,240
I can just sort of

571
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,020
look in a crack

572
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,220
and like man

573
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,060
I wish they'd open

574
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,080
that door so I could

575
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,940
see the whole frame.

576
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,020
It's like just a

577
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,340
narrow piece of it.

578
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,740
With this black

579
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,960
ozone death

580
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,500
void area.

581
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,500
Yeah.

582
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,720
Well you know

583
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,780
that might be

584
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,380
a more accurate

585
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
description than you

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,340
believe it to be.

587
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,080
Yes you could have

588
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,260
been spot on there.

589
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,700
It's very very

590
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,260
irritating.

591
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,780
And not only that

592
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,400
look at all that

593
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,480
space it wastes.

594
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,820
by impending

595
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,400
destruction.

596
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,320
Think about it.

597
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:57,380
It's like

598
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,280
30 or

599
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,380
maybe 50 percent

600
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:01,940
of the space

601
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,560
is wasted.

602
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,180
Yeah.

603
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,720
Of course our

604
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
affairs.

605
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,660
They should at least

606
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,320
you know maybe

607
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,400
get some software

608
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,060
that they could

609
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,960
start putting like

610
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,300
other content

611
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,540
in the empty space

612
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,920
next to the stupid

613
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,540
content.

614
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,120
We are not

615
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,760
organized.

616
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,720
Ads or

617
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,340
cartoons.

618
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,540
Efficiency

619
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,140
principle.

620
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,020
No rather

621
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,840
I would put little

622
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,760
cartoons like

623
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,300
funny little

624
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,400
animated cartoons.

625
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,520
Evolutionary.

626
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,460
That were making

627
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,180
fun of the

628
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,200
of the content

629
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,940
you know saying

630
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,100
bad things about it

631
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,540
because of the

632
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,340
hey we're not

633
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,980
we are we're only

634
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,520
here because

635
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,920
this idiot forgot

636
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,060
to turn it this way.

637
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,640
The layers of time

638
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,500
and mutation.

639
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,780
I don't really mean

640
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,980
to disparage idiots

641
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,560
or anything.

642
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,560
No of course not.

643
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:45,860
You know.

644
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,040
I wouldn't want to do that.

645
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,540
No not necessary.

646
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,100
That's mean.

647
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,800
That's overkill.

648
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:50,980
That's just mean.

649
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,520
Right.

650
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,740
Yeah.

651
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,560
Oh we've got better

652
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,100
things to do.

653
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,000
Bigger fish to fry.

654
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,880
Yeah right.

655
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,000
Places to go.

656
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,640
That's right.

657
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,880
Busy all the time.

658
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,600
Totally unnecessary.

659
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,440
Yes.

660
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,320
Just so.

661
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,160
Because they have

662
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,020
their chance

663
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,840
to find their ways

664
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,900
to Bob.

665
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,920
But if they don't

666
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,500
then perhaps

667
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,600
they weren't

668
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,500
supposed to

669
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,760
be there anyway.

670
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,960
They were supposed

671
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,600
to be living

672
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,040
their pink lives

673
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,680
and not

674
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,020
have their stories

675
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,920
intersect with

676
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
Bob and the church

677
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,500
at all.

678
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,800
Theoretically.

679
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,720
Theoretically.

680
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,580
Yeah.

681
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,540
I mean we

682
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,140
that instance

683
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,640
would excuse

684
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,380
all

685
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,260
enough

686
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:33,560
anomalies

687
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,200
and so

688
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,500
things went

689
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,020
haywire

690
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
off the track.

691
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,240
We've got some

692
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:37,700
good

693
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,080
space on our

694
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,800
SD chip.

695
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,300
We've taken up

696
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,220
a lot of space

697
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:44,740
on there.

698
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,520
Red flag waving.

699
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,700
Yeah.

700
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,360
Think about this

701
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,580
digital space.

702
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,520
It's not free.

703
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Everybody thinks

704
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,220
it's free.

705
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,740
You know.

706
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,480
But it really

707
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,580
there's a lot of

708
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,980
stuff that goes

709
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,560
on there.

710
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,420
A lot of stuff.

711
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,140
Yes.

712
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,320
Electronic stuff.

713
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,540
All sorts of

714
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,300
transmissions.

715
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,200
Things people don't

716
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,900
want to know about.

717
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,500
You know.

718
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,340
It's better off

719
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,220
not knowing about

720
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,500
them.

721
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,580
Not three miles

722
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:07,580


723
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,040
Just assume

724
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,960
that it's okay.

725
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,080
Too much

726
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,720
information.

727
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,400
And

728
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,320
so yeah.

729
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,240
Too much data.

730
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,440
Too much.

731
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,060
Right.

732
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,540
But if you

733
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,980
feel the desire

734
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,820
Well tomorrow

735
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,700
we can say

736
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,440
goodbye to all

737
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:24,760
that stuff.

738
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,460
Go ahead on

739
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,180
and take a dip

740
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,120
in the data pool

741
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,160
with Commander Data

742
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,680
and

743
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,600
enjoy

744
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,240
the

745
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,060
new

746
00:32:33,200 --> 00:33:03,200


747
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,200


748
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,040
Will they be

749
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,520
coming from

750
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,000
the north

751
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,920
or the south?

752
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,800
It's a song.

753
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:07,960
That way.

754
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:08,700
They're going

755
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,300
from that way.

756
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,760
Oh wow.

757
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,340
They're going

758
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,840
from the south.

759
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,300
I'm blown

760
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,380
the fuck off.

761
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,520
The exes

762
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,240
are coming.

763
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,600
Maybe they're

764
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,920
coming.

765
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,760
They're not even

766
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,700
breathing hard.

767
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,220
What are you

768
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,860
talking about?

769
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,700
That is no moon.

770
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,600
That's a space

771
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,000
station.

772
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,800
It's an egg.

773
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,040
Angry Larry

774
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,220
is videotaping.

775
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,620
He's like a

776
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:32,880
civil.

777
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,180
Yeah.

778
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,600
Hey,

779
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,560
without videotaping.

780
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,360
Imagine that.

781
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,340
20 seconds.

782
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,160
Here we go.

783
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,380
We know

784
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,960
it's not

785
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,780
this time

786
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,740
for sure.

787
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,320
This time

788
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,160
for sure.

789
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,360
Let's go.

790
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,260
10,

791
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,100
9,

792
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,020
8,

793
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,800
7,

794
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,740
6,

795
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:50,780
5,

796
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,860
4,

797
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,660
3,

798
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,560
2,

799
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,520
1.

800
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,880
Fuck them

801
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,780
if they can't

802
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,080
take a

803
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,540
jump.

804
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,880
Fuck.

805
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,560
Fuck you

806
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,080
peeing

807
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,640
bastards.

808
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,260
Susie, sorry.

809
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Our store

810
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,940
just sold me

811
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,440
a fucking

812
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,020
stick.

813
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,060
That's a

814
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,860
ball grabber.

815
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,920
Yes, it

816
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,600
certainly is.

817
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,320
I thought I could

818
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,040
snag those.

819
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,740
Yeah, she's got a

820
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,060
stick.

821
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,300
Oh, so you're

822
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,860
saying it's your

823
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,640
fault this year,

824
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:21,880
huh?

825
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,380
It's Casey's

826
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:23,540
fault.

827
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,720
They're there.

828
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,200
They're there.

829
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,020
Oh,

830
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,680
ha, ha, ha.

831
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,620
This is the

832
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:29,800
movie.

833
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,520
Oh,

834
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,840
hey.

835
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,280


836
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,100
I'm proud of you.

837
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,720
They're just

838
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,420
doing a drive.

839
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,280
Land here,

840
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,080
stupid.

841
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,460
Fuck her.

842
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,800
Dude.

843
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,680
I see one

844
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,100
waving.

845
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,940
God damn

846
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,120
it.

847
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,540
Over here.

848
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,860
Ah.

849
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Whoa.

850
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,520
Where the

851
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,000
fuck you

852
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,280
going?

853
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,020
I can't

854
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,600
imagine how

855
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,220
expensive it

856
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,720
was to get

857
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,300
that jet to

858
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,900
fly over

859
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,360
right here.

860
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,320
Ah.

861
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Ah.

862
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,660
Ah.

863
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:01,720
Ah.

864
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:02,900
Well,

865
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,600
we don't have

866
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,300
any to go

867
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,300


868
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,800
Ah,

869
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,780
ah,

870
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,020
ah,

871
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,680
ah,

872
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,380
ah.

873
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:07,460


874
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,140
ah,

875
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,240
ah.

876
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,900
He's probably

877
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,680
sleeping like

878
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:09,880
this.

879
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,340
Our offering

880
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,300
was insufficient.

881
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,240
Well,

882
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,900
this proves a

883
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,240
point.

884
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,100
Staying wasn't

885
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,580
the problem.

886
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,940
At least we

887
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,340
know that.

888
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,060
As far as we

889
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,280
know.

890
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,740
Those,

891
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,380
those are the

892
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,080
same kind of

893
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,520
people who

894
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,080
deserve their

895
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,780
place in hell

896
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,400
with the ones

897
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,440
who say,

898
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,640
it's a dry

899
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:24,920
heat.

900
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,640
It's a dry

901
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:25,880
heat.

902
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,160
And as you've

903
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,500
explained,

904
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,720
the laser

905
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,460
hellfire of

906
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,880
the excess

907
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,560
craft is a

908
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:31,980
dry heat.

909
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:32,660
Yes.

910
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,660
And it would

911
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,400
probably be a

912
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,060
relief compared

913
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,600
to what we're

914
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:35,960
going through

915
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,420
right now.

916
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,560
The good news

917
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,480
is that if

918
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,860
the excess

919
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,040
do fail to

920
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,560
show up,

921
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,780
which I

922
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,580
firmly believe

923
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,460
will not

924
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:47,840
happen,

925
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,280
the excess

926
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,180
will be here

927
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,220
tomorrow morning

928
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
at 7 a.m.

929
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,220
They just

930
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,820
have to be.

931
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,600
Damn it.

932
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,180
Mm-hmm.

933
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,280
We'll be

934
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,820
playing back

935
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,700
this recording

936
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,440
on the pleasure

937
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,300
saucers and,

938
00:35:59,380 --> 00:35:59,740
you know,

939
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,420
distributing it

940
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,140
through MindLink,

941
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,640
not through radio,

942
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,440
not through the

943
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,780
internet,

944
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,960
but just the

945
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,000
universal MindLink

946
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,300
of all subgeniuses

947
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,760
who survive

948
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,740
the end of the

949
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,040
world.

950
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,560
And if the

951
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,400
world doesn't

952
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,140
actually end,

953
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,140
you get to

954
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,940
actually hear us

955
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,680
in your ears.

956
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,100
Now,

957
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,880
imagine that

958
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,240
technology.

959
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,000
You get the

960
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
spaceship technology.

961
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,720
So showing

962
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,580
Grindhouse movies

963
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,620
to everyone

964
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,840
being directly

965
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,920
into their mind.

966
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,460
Yes.

967
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,760
That's what I'm

968
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,100
thinking.

969
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm thinking.

970
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,640
One of the

971
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,320
writings that

972
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,940
Stang did

973
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,460
way back when,

974
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,220
I think it might

975
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,820
be in the book.

976
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,440
I have to double

977
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,660
check.

978
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,140
He was talking

979
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,540
about how

980
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,160
television is

981
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,860
so stupid

982
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,780
because there's

983
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,680
three main

984
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,040
networks.

985
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,220
If you live in a

986
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,660
big city,

987
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,500
back in the day,

988
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:51,900
there were

989
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,800
maybe five

990
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,220
channels,

991
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:53,820
six,

992
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,540
and all showing

993
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,700
the same garbage

994
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,840
over and over

995
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,080
again.

996
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,760
When there was

997
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,500
this universe

998
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,360
of Bulldog,

999
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:00,980
a universe

1000
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,740
of old

1001
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,060
movies,

1002
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
stuff that

1003
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,140
would change

1004
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,460
people's lives

1005
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,360
if you could show it.

1006
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,420
And why don't we

1007
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:09,880
have infinite

1008
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,940
television stations

1009
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,620
and why don't we

1010
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,580
have just people

1011
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,360
showing Bulldada

1012
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,480
their own channel

1013
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,340
of stuff all the time

1014
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,000
and then fast forward

1015
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,640
30 years.

1016
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
We have

1017
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,180
hundreds

1018
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,840
of channels

1019
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,400
on

1020
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,180
cable television,

1021
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,820
digital cable,

1022
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,540
Fios cable,

1023
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,220
these literally

1024
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,640
hundreds of channels

1025
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,020
and just like 30 years ago,

1026
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,040
they're showing

1027
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,860
the same old crap.

1028
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
The same old crap.

1029
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:42,800
Yep.

1030
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,040
Yes.

1031
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:45,760
I,

1032
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,380
well,

1033
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,440
there is still

1034
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
a starvation

1035
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,100
of Bulldada

1036
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,540
except on

1037
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,520
some of the

1038
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,280
lesser known

1039
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,740
digital TV channels.

1040
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Mm-hmm.

1041
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,660
The channels

1042
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,080
that your favorite

1043
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,500
networks

1044
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,960
just

1045
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,360
people,

1046
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,880
they just,

1047
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,520
they just bought,

1048
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,400
they just bought

1049
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:04,980
the channels,

1050
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,240
set up another

1051
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,880
transmitter,

1052
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,840
and they just

1053
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,560
want to show stuff.

1054
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,640
It's about

1055
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,000
three steps up

1056
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,780
from the old

1057
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,660
public access.

1058
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,460
Mm-hmm.

1059
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,800
Yeah.

1060
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,320
When we could do

1061
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,860
so much more,

1062
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,340
we could do,

1063
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,820
we could do

1064
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,460
so much better.

1065
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:18,900
Right.

1066
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,020
But then,

1067
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,120
we need to bring

1068
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,340
back CUN TV.

1069
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,580
That's that

1070
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,340
Canadian channel.

1071
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,380
From PR News

1072
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,000
in Washington,

1073
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,900
I'm up against

1074
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,640
another round

1075
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:30,960
of global

1076
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,780
racial injustice.

1077
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,160
Authorities say

1078
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,060
they still don't know

1079
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,480
what caused

1080
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,760
massive tax increases.

1081
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,100
Authorities say

1082
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,840
the tax policy

1083
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,480
is unconstitutional.

1084
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,380
Quote,

1085
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
it is about time.

1086
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,000
The Dow is 18.

1087
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
Authorities say

1088
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,120
this is

1089
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,760
PR News.

1090
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,780
I'm broken down.

1091
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,020
Yes,

1092
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm broken down.

1093
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,800
Into the elements

1094
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
from which I came.

1095
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,340
Into the mud

1096
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,540
where they wrote my name.

1097
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,040
Into the dust

1098
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,240
when the blood is gone.

1099
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,920
Into molecules

1100
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,580
and atoms.

1101
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,360
I'm broken down.

1102
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm broken down.

1103
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,960
Yes,

1104
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,080
I'm broken down.

1105
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,680
I'm out of words.

1106
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,820
I'm down to size.

1107
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,280
There's much less

1108
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,460
to me than meets the eye.

1109
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,060
I'm not the man

1110
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,620
I used to be.

1111
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:30,620


1112
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
You can see

1113
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,640
unless and less of me.

1114
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,180
I'm broken down.

1115
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,600
I can see it all now.

1116
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,980
I'll be sitting in a chair.

1117
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,320
People talking to me,

1118
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,660
but I ain't there.

1119
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,000
What about Bob?

1120
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Where'd he go?

1121
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,200
I don't know.

1122
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,920
He was here

1123
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,960
just a second ago.

1124
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,280
He must have broke down.

1125
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm broken down.

1126
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,220
I'm broken down.

1127
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,220


1128
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,220


1129
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm broken down.

1130
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,200
I'll pay the rents

1131
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,000
and the rent alone.

1132
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,660
I'll just bid

1133
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,860
when the money's gone.

1134
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,880
But I'll never leave.

1135
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,520
Don't fear.

1136
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,720
I'll just stay right here

1137
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,540
and disappear.

1138
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,940
I'm broken down.

1139
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm broken down.

1140
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm broken.

1141
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,800
And I'm

1142
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,600
broken.

1143
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm broken down.

1144
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,300
Oh, I'm

1145
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,500
broken down.

1146
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,220
Okay, today's Thursday.

1147
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,840
So today is a day of mourning.

1148
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,920
Today is a day of mourning

1149
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,500
and dread.

1150
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,300
How many did we lose this year?

1151
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,380
Dr. Dark?

1152
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,080
Ann Atrocity?

1153
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,140
Yeah.

1154
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,020
Joe Cosby?

1155
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,820
Yeah.

1156
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,500
Oh.

1157
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,340
We lost two, I remember.

1158
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:02,360
Yeah, we lost two.

1159
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,220
Why, Bob?

1160
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,060
Why?

1161
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,560
I'll sew your holes shut.

1162
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,060
She said helpfully.

1163
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,160
I'm good at sewing holes shut.

1164
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,140
I was born in Bafflement.

1165
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,560
Bafflement, Wyoming.

1166
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,560
Population one.

1167
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,120
Just me.

1168
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,860
And before that, a waitress.

1169
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,100
I'm a music fan.

1170
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,920
Before you, there were

1171
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,500
Yes, it's great.

1172
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,440
Mm-hmm.

1173
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,700
What day do you wanna go out thrifting?

1174
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:37,780
Okay.

1175
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,860
That's right.

1176
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,080
It was only close yesterday.

1177
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,940
Oh my God.

1178
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,540
What holiday are you boycotting now, Sissy?

1179
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,520
Oh, I got stuck in the grass.

1180
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,000
I didn't want to turn up the grass.

1181
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,600
July 4th?

1182
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,460
Any holiday that closes a goddamn thrift store.

1183
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,940
On a day when they ought to be open, it was like,

1184
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,060
Look, look, it's in this

1185
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,420
I'm gonna go buy coffee.

1186
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,460
I can't get any traction on this one.

1187
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,560
Okay, I'm gonna go buy coffee.

1188
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,560


1189
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,560


1190
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,560


1191
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:00,560


1192
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,220
I'm like, okay, rather than tariff the, uh,

1193
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,860
I couldn't think I was saying.

1194
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,280
Goodbye!

1195
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm an outrage boy.

1196
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm like a

1197
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,100
Rubber baby

1198
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,760
I am

1199
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,180
Bounty

1200
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,400
Just a

1201
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,520
Rubber baby

1202
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:12,980
Bounty

1203
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,420
If you

1204
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,000
Stretch my

1205
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,720
Rubber

1206
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,580
Till it's

1207
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,540
Thin enough to tear

1208
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,700
I just

1209
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,220
Stretch my

1210
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,880
Rubber

1211
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,580
Like a

1212
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,560
Rubber

1213
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,220
Bounty, bounty

1214
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,540
It's a

1215
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,540


1216
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,540


1217
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,540


1218
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,540


1219
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,540


1220
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,000
Rubber baby

1221
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,500
Well, as, as the horseshoe theory of most things, sometimes things are so stupid, they

1222
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,880
come right back around and they become smart.

1223
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,800
Not this

1224
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,680
We're not discussing politics here.

1225
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,900
No.

1226
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,100
No God, no.

1227
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,840
There is so stupid that it becomes smart and there is so stupid that it's just, well, stupid.

1228
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,040
Well, I, that would probably be the continuum theory of, of intelligence where you just

1229
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,440
keep going to an infinite point.

1230
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:00,900
Of stupid.

1231
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,100
Some people couldn't be smart if, if they didn't try.

1232
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,660
They certainly, they certainly don't try to be, they certainly don't try to be smart.

1233
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:21,500
That's, that's the whole thing about some people are deliberately stupid.

1234
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,200
Not to talk about politics, but deliberately stupid and deliberately delusional.

1235
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,200
Like,

1236
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,780
They, they, they pay someone to pull the wool over their eyes when they could damn well

1237
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,500
do it themselves.

1238
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,000
A wise man once said that or something like that.

1239
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,200
Wiser, wiser, wiser fellow than me said that.

1240
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,080
Well, yeah, that's a long list of wiser fellows than me.

1241
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,740
There's only one part of me that's wise and that's my ass.

1242
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,720
There's, I mean, it's none of my business what is wise and what's débable, cause I got

1243
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,720


1244
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,660
Don't look at paying attention just to see it happen sometimes.

1245
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:23,660


1246
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,220
Have some fun.

1247
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,720
We när aquí.

1248
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,780
Soft smoke and chill baby

1249
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,340
You're safe in here

1250
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,500
But I'm still a-snore

1251
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:04,200
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1252
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:13,060
And if everyone can come back right

1253
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,480
May your dreams come true

1254
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,480


1255
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,140
May your days be

1256
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,280
CAUGHT

1257
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,540
And SHORT

1258
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,680
And may all your dogs

1259
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,840
Spend new lives

1260
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,080
And I'm still a-snore

1261
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:56,520
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1262
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:13,280
And if everyone can come back right

1263
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,320
May your dreams come true

1264
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,480
And I'm still a-snore

1265
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:30,040
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1266
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,720
And if everyone can come back right

1267
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:30,720


1268
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,780
And I'm still a-snore

1269
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1270
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,700
And if everyone can come back right

1271
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,860
May all your dreams come true

1272
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,860
And I'm still a-snore

1273
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,300
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1274
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:57,540
And if everyone can come back right

1275
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,280
May all your dreams come true

1276
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,860
And I'm still a-snore

1277
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,540
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1278
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,920
And if everyone can come back right

1279
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,080
May all your dreams come true

1280
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,080
And I'm still a-snore

1281
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,540
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1282
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,360
And if everyone can come back right

1283
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,820
May all your dreams come true

1284
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,100
And I'm still a-snore

1285
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,900
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1286
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,060
And if everyone can come back right

1287
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,200
May all your dreams come true

1288
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,060
And I'm still a-snore

1289
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,180
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1290
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,200
And I'm still a-snore

1291
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,300
I'm dreaming about the Cajun dust

1292
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:49,800
And I'm still a-snore

1293
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,300
I've been dreaming about it

1294
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,920
And I'm still a-snore

1295
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,400
I've been dreaming about it

1296
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,780
And I'm still a-snore

1297
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:01,580
I'm still a-snore

1298
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,200
And I'm still a-snore

1299
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,960
Well, anyway, what we're going to do is keep on keeping on,

1300
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,940
because Stang would have wanted it that way.

1301
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,940
But you weren't able to get through on the main axis to tell Stang of our...

1302
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,960
I actually did get through.

1303
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,580
I sent a message.

1304
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,540
I never got a reply.

1305
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,700
Sent a message, eh?

1306
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,080
At least he'll know that we did it.

1307
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,100
We did it.

1308
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,440
We did it.

1309
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,600
Right here, we did it.

1310
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,300
And when I say we, I mean me.

1311
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,580
Well, him, yeah.

1312
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,400
He did it.

1313
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,220
I mean I.

1314
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,140
He did it.

1315
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,680
He's right over there, officer.

1316
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,460
Do your duty.

1317
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,580
No, of course he...

1318
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,420
I didn't do it.

1319
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,240
It's the other guy.

1320
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,260
Yes, he did.

1321
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,340
You did do it.

1322
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,380
You said you did it.

1323
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,860
All right, I dood it.

1324
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,440
Yes, I dood it.

1325
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,960
Yes, a mighty action.

1326
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,540
Years later, the bronze memorial plaque will be here to rose.

1327
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,580
So, 59 minutes and 35 seconds.

1328
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,660
That's not bad.

1329
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,840
It's a rounded hour.

1330
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,200
Thank you.

1331
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:17,720
We're doing fine here on Tarzan's radio station at 21X Day.

1332
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Thank you.

1333
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,980
You got it.

1334
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,340
You got it.

1335
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,080
You got it.

1336
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,240
You got it.

1337
00:49:59,380 --> 00:49:59,940
Thank you.

1338
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,340
You got it.

1339
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,080


1340
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:06,580


1341
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:06,580


1342
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:06,580


1343
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:06,580


1344
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:06,580


1345
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,060
And daddy beat up mommy

1346
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,820
And broke her collarbone for good luck

1347
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,960
And everybody's drunk

1348
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,820
And everybody's wasted

1349
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,920
And everybody's drinking on the job

1350
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,240
The garbage man got trashed

1351
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,980
The janitor got messy

1352
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,840
The taxi driver got smashed

1353
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,580
And the waitress, yeah, she got tipsy

1354
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,340
In Kansas City, New York City

1355
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,920
Great big city, itty bitty city

1356
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,420
Now everybody's drunk

1357
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,060
And everybody's wasted

1358
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,180
And everybody's drinking on the job

1359
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,580
There's a whole lot of places that I ain't been

1360
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,160
A whole lot of things that I ain't seen

1361
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,640
A whole lot of things I'll never be

1362
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,320
The generation that will change the world

1363
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,920
Is still looking for its car

1364
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:46,800
There'll never be a tomorrow

1365
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,160
Still the faces that can't be seen

1366
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:56,300
Definitely seen

1367
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:56,300


1368
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,600

1369
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,560
And everybody's wasted

1370
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:01,560


1371
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:01,760

T-D-Y

1385
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,860
U-S-A-A

1391
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,340

And everybody's wasted

1393
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,880
And everybody's

1394
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,160

1395
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,840
Job

1396
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,080

1398
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,560

1399
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,760
A bottle of wine

1400
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,560
Fruit of the vine

1401
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,420
When you gonna let me get sober

1402
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,360
Leave me alone

1403
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,440

1407
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,160
This dirty old town

1408
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,020
Playing for nickels and dimes

1409
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,300
Times get tough

1410
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,900
I ain't got enough

1411
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,000
To buy me a bottle of wine

1412
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,540
Oh!

1413
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,300
A bottle of wine

1414
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,120
Fruit of the vine

1415
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,960
When you gonna let me get sober

1416
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,940
Leave me alone

1417
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,060

00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,760

00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,220
And start over

1420
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,580
I thought you guys knew that song

1421
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,320
You could've come out and done that

1422
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,380
Uh hey!

1423
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:21,480
That song's playing

1424
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:21,860
No more

1425
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,020

00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,020


1427
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,640
That song's playing

1428
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,420
Ooh

1429
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:23,420


1430
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:23,420


1431
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:23,960
Just like a sugar get up

1432
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,640
And then he wants to want to

1433
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,840
Tell Mr. Fox

1434
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,020
Are you there?

1435
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,080
Come here

1436
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,380
I went to have a kid

1437
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,600
They meant it

1438
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,060
When he got in touch with that girl

1439
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,460
Ixis

1440
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,740
She did not leave her number, but I know the place to call.

1441
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,720
Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall.

1442
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,300
Help me information, get in touch with my Marie.

1443
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,180
She's the only one who called me here from Memphis, Tennessee.

1444
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,640
Her home is on the south side, high above a ridge.

1445
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,720
Just a half mile from the Mississippi Bridge.

1446
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,920
Yeah, I love Memphis.

1447
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,320
Alright, next song.

1448
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,900
Well, the last time I saw Marie, I screamed her goodbye.

1449
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,980
Her re-home dry, softened teardrops, trickled rubber high.

1450
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,880
But we were torn apart because her mom did not agree.

1451
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,660
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee.

1452
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,800
Woo!

1453
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,460
Woo!

1454
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,140

1455
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,420
Woo!

1456
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,280
Woo!

1457
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,660
Woo!

1458
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,260
Woo!

1459
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1460
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1461
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1462
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1463
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1464
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:20,260


1465
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,880
Well, help me information, more than that I cannot add.

1466
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,540
Only that I miss her.

1467
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,620
And all the fun we had.

1468
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,200
Marie is only six years old.

1469
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:39,520
Information please, try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee.

1470
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,700
I'm talking about Memphis.

1471
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,780
That's where the king lives.

1472
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,500
Yeah, maybe I'll make it a visit sometime.

1473
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,340
Get on.

1474
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,080
