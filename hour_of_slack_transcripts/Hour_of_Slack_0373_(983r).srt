your being aware of it uh yes dear friends this week's show hour of slack number 983

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:45,000

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,140
years ago actually we have removed some of that show and replaced it with a clip

22
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,980
from an excerpt of the bob larson christian radio talk show which featured me yours and the show is

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:29,040
a universe where anything is possible

26
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:39,200
a universe of many gods often in conflict when she made it with the dust

27
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,680
what came forth was water

28
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:59,260
the living water water that contained the minuscule beginnings of the critters crawling little things

29
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,660
there was no

30
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,780
big

31
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:22,280
knowledge bigger careers occurred you've seen you've seen pictures in the museums and books

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:29,960


36
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,260
My goggles.

37
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,660
Big bird.

You've seen them.

39
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,260
Hello?

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
Yes, go ahead. You're on the show.

41
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,420
Hi.

42
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,980
I've been, uh,

43
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
up all night.

44
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,660
And, uh,

45
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,860
starting to see things.

46
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,760
Like, um,

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,260
well, heck,

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,940
you know how sometimes

49
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,680
when there's only a little bit of light in the room

50
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,380
and pictures on the wall

51
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,300
start to get wavy?

52
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,420
Um,

53
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,780
are you smoking, Frog?

54
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,060
No, absolutely not.

55
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,240
Just sleep deprivation.

56
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,020
Bones, bones.

57
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,100
Could something

58
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,700
be making me hallucinate?

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,260
I mean,

60
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,180
nice touch.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm, uh,

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,780
arriving.

63
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,760
And this, uh,

64
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,080
it helps me write

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,000
sometimes.

66
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,320
But, um,

67
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm not writing right now.

68
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm trying to sleep.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,580
It's not working.

70
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,880
So I turned into...

71
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
So would you like us to

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,260
turn our...

73
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,920
Would you like us to turn our show down?

74
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,720
Is that what you're saying?

75
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,520
No, not at all.

76
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
It's really neat.

77
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,660
I like it a lot.

78
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
It's actually healthy.

79
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,920
It's actually nice.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,620
It's nice.

81
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,220
The subgenius

82
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,420
owl of slack

83
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,220
that you are about to listen to

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,800
is specially designed

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
only to be played

86
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,820
on radio station

87
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,900
Uh, this one.

88
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,100
and only

89
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,620
in the city of

90
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,580
right around here.

91
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,880
Should any other shows

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
be heard from or contacted

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
in the course of this show,

94
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,440
the listener is advised

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,340
to remain calm

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,120
and only contact

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
listed or unlisted officials

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,920
in the event of any material

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,540
from this radio

100
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,440
or other listening device

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
being inhaled during broadcast.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,260
Small animals

103
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,940
or other children

104
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,640
becoming exposed

105
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
to the ultra-high

106
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,640
or ultra-low shocks

107
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,360
and brain frequencies

108
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,400
constantly screaming,

109
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,680
and the brain scan

110
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,380
throughout our program

111
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,340
should seek shelter

112
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,780
in an approved safety unit only.

113
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,400
This is Walter Teasdale

114
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,080
reminding you

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
that it's often a photon

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,060
that light releases,

117
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,360
but truth is,

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,300
not everyone gets the picture.

119
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,820
The sound of the apprentice

120
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,140
is smelling

121
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,660
and they smell bad.

122
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,820
Yes.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,280
Yes.

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
We are the brain's least gravity.

125
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,320
Self-indulgent

126
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
is a matter of taste.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,240
We're a living, breathing example

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,760
that a brain is a terrible thing

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,260
to waste.

130
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,680
We are brain-free.

131
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,700
Yes.

132
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,520
And this here is insane.

133
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,500
A five-year-old Chinese boy

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,860
has been inexplicably

135
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,020
bursting into flames,

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
according to baffled doctors

137
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,420
and the lad's frustrated mother.

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
Little Tong Tang Jiang

139
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,380
has burned his way

140
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,300
through numerous sets

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,040
of underwear

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,900
as doctors try to contain

143
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,400
the spontaneous combustion

144
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,500
of the little tot,

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,080
which occurs as often

146
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
as twice an hour.

147
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,500
The little tot

148
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:26,560
is a little bit

149
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,620
more likely to die

150
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


151
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


153
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


154
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


155
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


156
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:26,620


158
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:27,820
than the little boy.

159
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,120
So far,

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,120
the incendiary infant

161
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,620
has set fire to a couch,

162
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,160
ruined the bed mattress,

163
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,880
the opposite of bed wetting,

164
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
and narrowly missed

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,080
setting his grandmother on fire

166
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,580
when she got too close.

167
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,580
Everyone is terrified

168
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,060
to go near him.

169
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,020
For Goofball Radio,

170
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,360
this is Ralph Fielding Snell.

171
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, okay,

172
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:52,900
now we're talking

173
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,540
to Granny now

174
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,240
about the birth

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,140
of the little boy.

176
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,600
See if you can get

177
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


178
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


179
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


180
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


181
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


182
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


183
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


184
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


185
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


186
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,600


187
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,340
anything out of her.

188
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,900
I couldn't.

189
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,440
Oh, God.

190
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,280
You know,

191
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,980
I think we just had

192
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,580
a bulletin in

193
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,620
from the subgenius

194
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,180
something or other.

195
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,480
It's the sad show.

196
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,420
That laughing gas again.

197
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,960
It's a very sad moment

198
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,380
here on the show.

199
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:13,700
Come on.

200
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,280
Oh, sorry,

201
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,500
I put these feathers away.

202
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,020
I should be crying

203
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,040
and you're making me laugh.

204
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,240
It's a sad moment

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,840
here on the show.

206
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,340
We don't like

207
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,260
to make fun of things,

208
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,900
like, of course,

209
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,220
pregnant men.

210
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,480
Hi,

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,600
this is Goofball.

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,600


213
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,600


214
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,600


215
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,600


216
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,600


217
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:26,740
You're wearing

218
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,940
an A-back top for me.

219
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,780
Were the awesome

220
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,040
megaliths of Europe

221
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,060
erected on Earth

222
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,600
energy centers

223
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,760
not long ago,

224
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
but since forgotten?

225
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,940
Hmm.

226
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,700
I forgot.

227
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,320
Where were you, Hal?

228
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,820
I forgot.

229
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,740
Why do powerful

230
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,820
magnetic fields

231
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,680
and ultrasound

232
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
continue to be

233
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,920
recorded near them?

234
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,420
One in five

235
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,280
German motorists

236
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
actually enjoys

237
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,060
being stuck

238
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,000
in a traffic jam,

239
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,080
according to a survey

240
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,480
in the Hamburg-based

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,140
BAT Leisure Research

242
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,380
Institute.

243
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,560
The BAT Leisure Research

244
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,560


245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,600
is a major

246
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,400
research facility

247
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,480
in the United States

248
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,620
that has been

249
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,020
used to

250
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,600
detect

251
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


252
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


253
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


254
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


255
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


256
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


257
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


258
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


259
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


260
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


261
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


262
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


263
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


264
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


265
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


266
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


267
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


268
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


269
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


270
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


271
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


272
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


273
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


274
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


275
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,980
a possible

276
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,120
Mammoth

277
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,660
in the world.

278
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:39,660


279
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:39,700
very

280
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,860
powerful

281
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:40,880
device

282
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,500
that can

283
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,520
detect

284
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,080
a Mammoth

285
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,840
in an

286
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:43,840


287
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:43,840


288
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,660
And

289
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,740
it's

290
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,960
a

291
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,080
very

292
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,080


293
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,080


294
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,080


295
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,080


296
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,460
a Mammoth

297
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,120
in a

298
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,080
huge

299
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,740
space.

300
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,400
It's

301
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,600
a

302
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,200
very

303
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,360
powerful

304
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,000
device

305
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,260
that can

306
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,280
detect

307
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,680
a Mammoth

308
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,900
in a

309
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,180
very

310
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,200
very

311
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,300
very

312
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,580
small

313
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,680
size.

314
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,520
It's

315
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,620
like

316
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,280
a

317
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,280


318
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,280


319
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,680
human

320
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
in a

321
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,020
small

322
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,040
space.

323
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:20,560
But

324
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,680
it's

325
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,080
a

326
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,100
very

327
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,180
powerful

328
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,600
device

329
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:21,920
that can

330
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,060
detect

331
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,360
a Mammoth

332
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,740
in a

333
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,880
and you're on the verge of destroying each other.

334
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,620
Something has gone wrong,

335
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
and we are going to come back and show you

336
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,980
how to take this next step in your evolution

337
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,680
and start a new age on this earth.

338
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,480
I think it is themselves that the popular story goes,

339
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,180
because they overfed themselves.

340
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,820
Believe it or not, it doesn't make any difference.

341
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,800
She was out.

342
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,660
To get a critter with the appendages

343
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,580
to finally have evolved over the centuries,

344
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,360
a critter with the appendages to carry out her will.

345
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,020
Her will is to command a critter

346
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,580
to be able to build and manipulate

347
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,260
the extension of the brain,

348
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,820
of the brain, the knowledge center,

349
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,900
which she instilled in her.

350
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,720
The water, the initial blooming water,

351
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,600
is something that a religious man

352
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,480
not sure about.

353
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,100
Well, I'm not.

354
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,320
Yeah, people have been mindless since the world began.

355
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,120
You see, it's perfectly all right.

356
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,220
Who cares about life if that is just in the real world?

357
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,260
We demand our human rights.

358
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,280
We are brain free.

359
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,500
This here is insanity.

360
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,660
We are brain free.

361
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,700
Come on, come on, come on.

362
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Thank you, thank you.

363
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Come on, thank you.

364
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Squeal.

365
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,560
Ah, yes, dear friends.

366
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,040
I guess I should make some personal contact with you real quick

367
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,160
and let you know that you've been listening

368
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,240
to so many different subgenius tape contributions.

369
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,480
We have so many for you here.

370
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
Going back, we have so many.

371
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,580
We're going backwards in time.

372
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Let's see, the music, Brain Free 7 by John Bartels.

373
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,380
More John Bartels coming up, also known as Joe Schmo.

374
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,100
That amazing stuff about she who evolved the critter

375
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,100
to build the pipe.

376
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,560
We still don't know, friends.

377
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,940
Some KPFA news from Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

378
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,320
Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell show

379
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,200
that's, there's more of that coming up.

380
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,980
Of course, Bleepo Abernathy is our official announcer.

381
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,540
You heard some KHSU shows, bits there from the fellow who,

382
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
the caller who was seeing things.

383
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,820
And little bits of Media Barrage by Reverend Nick Nolan.

384
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,880
Some really rare Firesign Theater,

385
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,740
which will also pop up again.

386
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,300
And some Joe Newman, of course, which, and some,

387
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,600
and some Joe Sosodotta on sound effects.

388
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,480
Even Dave Fluglewitz on sound effects.

389
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,400
But friends,

390
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,100
friends,

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,700
I have an announcement to make.

392
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Ah, yes, and this is not,

393
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,000
Watch what you say to me.

394
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,740
That was very heavy sound effect.

395
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
You know, the United Nations right now is meeting,

396
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,000
trying to limit the use of violent sound effects.

397
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,560
You got a big nose.

398
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,300
You know, I think KCSA should be a little more serious.

399
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,460
I wake up in the morning and I turn you on.

400
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,460
I'm an original subscriber.

401
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,560
And you're disrespectful of your listeners.

402
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,040
In what way?

403
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,860
You know, I'm quite serious about this.

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,820
Well, which listener are we not respectful of, properly speaking?

405
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,980
Well, if...

406
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,920
If you wake up in the morning and you come into the station,

407
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,640
you should listen that your readers, your listeners should be intelligent.

408
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,780
Well, we can't affect that.

409
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,100
You don't sound intelligent.

410
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,060
Our listeners should be intelligent.

411
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,900
We can't affect their intelligence level.

412
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,340
You could try.

413
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,540
Well, how?

414
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,000
Will you teach them parables?

415
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,820
You could try by being intelligent yourself.

416
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,060
Well, we attempt to educate them, but they just won't learn.

417
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,260
You don't seem to be talking about anything serious like...

418
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,540
like understanding, like consideration, like...

419
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,060
like education, like stuff like that.

420
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,560
This is a peaceful situation.

421
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,940
Uh, no, I don't think it's peaceful.

422
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,120
I think it's silly.

423
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,580
It's not warlike.

424
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,400
What do you mean?

425
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,920
You complain about silliness?

426
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,980
What about the laugh, the ecstatic laugh in the fields of the Lord?

427
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,240
The whirling in the fields of understanding and peace?

428
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,440
Oh, don't be silly.

429
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,080
Well, do you want us to be unnaturally grave, gross?

430
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,560
No, no, no.

431
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,600
You're not even funny.

432
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,000
Honey, you're not even funny.

433
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,060
Well, we're funny looking.

434
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,020
That's worth something.

435
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,740
Why don't you try to develop a little humor?

436
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,220
Well, uh, we're acme-ish or vitreous humor.

437
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,200
We'll try to grow a lump for you.

438
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,060
That's your idea.

439
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,860
You are not humorous.

440
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,680
You are silly.

441
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,060
You are ticklish.

442
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,920
Well, I'm sure that some of our callers may agree with what this caller has to say.

443
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,500
And naturally, like...

444
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:21,960
That's my humor.

445
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,380
...all such...

446
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,980
People like Chris and Philip, for instance, is that they're very serious.

447
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,700
You know, I know Chris and Philip personally.

448
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,280
But they're also humorous.

449
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,340
We go golfing together, and I go water skiing with his lovely wife.

450
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,240
You have to get personal.

451
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,820
It's time to get personal now.

452
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,700
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

453
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,560
What inspires you to attempt to modify and...

454
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,600
I used to work at KPSA, and I'm 72 now.

455
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,900
And I have five children.

456
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,720
Well, I hope they're listening to our program, too.

457
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,540
And the thing that...

458
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,900
...impresses me about you young people in the morning is that...

459
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,040
What makes you think we're young people?

460
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
...you're so frightened is that you're silly.

461
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,160
Well, but we're actually old as the hills.

462
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,020
We're not young.

463
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,180
Ah, she just couldn't take the blinding treat.

464
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,960
I have waited so long for such a call.

465
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,220
I must say, it's pretty low when people call up and pretend to be old.

466
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,600
When they're actually young hippersnappers and spring chickens, they can't fool old grandpappy.

467
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,480
Does that sound kind of foolish to you?

468
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,200
You know, you're not funny.

469
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,160
And you're not...

470
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,460
You're not serious.

471
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,200
And you're just silly.

472
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,420
I'm sorry, honey.

473
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,320
You're just silly.

474
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,740
But here's the point.

475
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,260
I work at it.

476
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,460
You know, the thing I've noticed about you young people is that you're just...

477
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,420
You're silly.

478
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,780
Oh, come on.

479
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,420
We're serious.

480
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
This is an absolutely serious show.

481
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,540
You can't tell that...

482
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,540
No, you're from Sirius, not Alpha Centauri like most people think.

483
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,700
A mysterious object from the depths of space.

484
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,260
We don't make any jokes.

485
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,300
We don't ever...

486
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,020
You know, I'm...

487
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,580
You know, I'm...

488
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm serious.

489
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,740
I'm 160.

490
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,920
I'm 60 years old now.

491
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,300
I've got 25 great-grandchildren.

492
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,760
Hey, didn't you accidentally cut off your head?

493
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,040
Oh, no.

494
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,800
You're not funny and you're not serious.

495
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,360
Oh, no.

496
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,220
What is peace and what is funny and what is serious?

497
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,840
They don't really make perfect sense to me.

498
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,360
I'm a dang.

499
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm a hypocrite.

500
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,700
I ask for sincerity and I lie.

501
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,280
I denounce the system as I embrace it.

502
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,120
I want money and power and prestige.

503
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,000
I want ratings and success.

504
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,820
I don't give a damn about you or the world.

505
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,340
The world.

506
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,820
That's the truth.

507
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,040
For this, I could say I'm sorry, but I won't.

508
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,820
Why should I?

509
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,480
I mean, who the hell are you anyways, you audience?

510
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,380
You're on me every night like a pack of wolves

511
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,580
because I can't stand facing what you are and what you've made.

512
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,060
Yes, the world is a terrible place.

513
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,500
Yes, cancer and garbage is what will get you.

514
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,780
Yes, a war is coming.

515
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,500
Yes, the world is shut to hell and you're all goners.

516
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,180
Everything's screwed up and you like it that way, don't you?

517
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,380
You're fascinated by the gory details.

518
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,060
You're mesmerized by your own fear.

519
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,420
You revel in floods.

520
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,940
Car accidents.

521
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,800
Unstoppable diseases.

522
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,180
The happiest wonders are pain.

523
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,700
That's where I come in, isn't it?

524
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,620
I'm here to lead you by the hand through the dark forest

525
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,640
of your own hatred and anger and humiliation.

526
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm providing a public service.

527
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,880
It's so scary.

528
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,140
You're like a little child under the tree.

529
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,220
You're afraid of the covers.

530
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,860
You're afraid of the boogeyman

531
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,060
because you can't live without him.

532
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,300
Your fear, your own lies,

533
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,980
are becoming your entertainment.

534
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,400
Next month, millions of people are going to be listening to this show

535
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,920
and you have nothing to talk about.

536
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,420
Marvelous technology is at a disposal.

537
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Instead of reaching up to new heights,

538
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,220
you're going to see how far down we can go.

539
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,080
How deep into the muck we can immerse ourselves.

540
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,120
What do you want to talk about?

541
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,120


542
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,120


543
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,340
What do you want to talk about?

544
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,900
These last four hours.

545
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,980
Your pet.

546
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,620
Orgasms.

547
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,460
You're pathetic.

548
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,960
You despise each and every one of you.

549
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,480
You've got nothing.

550
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,160
Absolutely nothing.

551
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,600
Your brains.

552
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Your power.

553
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,100
Your body.

554
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,100


555
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,100


556
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,100


557
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,100


558
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,880
Your future.

559
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,140
Your hope.

560
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
Your God.

561
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,580
Your faith.

562
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,580


563
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,620
The only thing you believe in is me.

564
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,720
What are you afraid of?

565
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:06,980


566
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm not afraid, see?

567
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,680
I come in here every night.

568
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,940
I make my case. I make my point. I say what I believe in.

569
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,820
I tell you what you are.

570
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,600
I have to. I have no choice.

571
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
You frighten me.

572
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,500
You frighten me.

573
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,960
I come in here every night.

574
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,600
I tear into you. I abuse you.

575
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,740
I insult you.

576
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,940
And you keep going back for more.

577
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,600
What's wrong with you? Why do you keep calling?

578
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't want to hear anymore. Stop talking!

579
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,840
Go away!

580
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
A yellow-bellied, spineless,

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,920
bigoted, quivering, drunken,

582
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,520
insomniac, paranoid,

583
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,580
disgusting, perverted, boyish,

584
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,300
little, obscene phone callers.

585
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,320
What the hell with you?

586
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,620
What the hell with you?

587
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,560
I don't need your fear

588
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,200
and your stupidity. You don't get it.

589
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,780
It's wasted on you.

590
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,660
Poor swine.

591
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,260
So sad.

592
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,500
So fresh.

593
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,500
The days that are no more.

594
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:18,940
Tears.

595
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,940
I know not what they mean.

596
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,560
Tears from the depths of some divine despair.

597
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,960
Tears from the depths of some divine despair.

598
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,020
Tears from the depths of some divine despair.

599
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,800
Dennis Whiterson, 61, of Newark,

600
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,180
Dennis Whiterson, 61, of Newark,

601
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:33,620
when looking only happy at the fields,

602
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:33,700
when looking only happy at the fields,

603
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,520
and thinking of the days that are no more.

604
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,980
Two days later, he killed himself

605
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,420
by hammering two five-inch nails

606
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,680
into his head.

607
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:43,260


608
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,000
Fresh as a sunbeam

609
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,100
glittering on the sail

610
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,460
he brings our friends up from the underworld.

611
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,780
Here they come, Al.

612
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Sad as the one that

613
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,160
trembles on the verge

614
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,120
before it sucks them all back down again.

615
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
I'm gonna take those nails away while he's trembling there.

616
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,640
I think that's a bad deal.

617
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,340
So sad, so fresh,

618
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,920
the days that are no more.

619
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,500
Ah,

620
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,720
brain-burned hours

621
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,380
as in dark summer dawns,

622
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,360
the earliest pipe of half-awakened birds

623
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,900
which see to dying eyes a dying show

624
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,940
which in the listener's ear

625
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,420
fade and fade.

626
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,340
So sad, so fresh,

627
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,460
the shows that are no more.

628
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,160
the shows that are no more.

629
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,240
So how goes the show?

630
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,720
Well, it wanders

631
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,440
mooing throughout the pastures,

632
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
up the hillsides, across the meadows,

633
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,840
over the stills,

634
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
it is buried deep in Neck Valley Glade.

635
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,140
It is buried deep in Neck Valley Glade.

636
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,300
Oh, spooky!

637
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,140
Oh, yeah, Jim Jones'

638
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,300
rocket party.

639
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,980
That's right.

640
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,420
Yes, that's right. You see,

641
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,360
we trap deuterium in the form of a plasma.

642
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,020
It's an ionized gas

643
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,060
and confine it within a powerful magnetic field

644
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,260
right here in the studio.

645
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,480
The gas is then heated by

646
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,040
bombarding it with energy.

647
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,720
Now when we get the temperature of this plasma

648
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,080
up to at least 50 million degrees Celsius,

649
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,060
this process becomes self-sustaining.

650
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,120
This process becomes self-sustaining.

651
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,720
The energy of the emitted neutrons

652
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,100
can be captured as heat,

653
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,100
and in turn we use that to power our vehicle.

654
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,840
...positive by the otherness

655
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,820
of the 9-1-1 instructions

656
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,780
that are included in the warhead.

657
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,700
Yes, the itchiness of the scratchiness

658
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,240
and the richness of the whatness.

659
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,000
Well, I hope you don't have a heart attack right now.

660
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm going to call 9-1-1.

661
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,280
Excuse me.

662
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,740
Oh, no, no, no, wait a moment.

663
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,720
You know, it's all in the mind, you know.

664
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,500
We are the legendary seven.

665
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,220
We are the legendary seven.

666
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,220
We are the legendary seven.

667
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,980
We are living we shall.

668
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,700
The brain is a terrible thing to weigh.

669
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,720
The brain is a terrible thing to weigh.

670
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,920
The brain is a terrible thing to weigh.

671
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,860
And if you think space

672
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,160
And if you think space and time

673
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,100
are everything, all encompassing

674
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,120
are everything, all encompassing

675
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,580
But whether or not you

676
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,620
think it or not

677
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,580
Does it matter? What is the reality?

678
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,360
To discover the reality of anything, we have to find out certain facts.

679
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,120
And the most important fact in any scheme is to find out what the end result of the scheme is.

680
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,980
Something is trying to get through to us.

681
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,740
The moment person out there had any idea of what I was talking about, I...

682
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:48,940
I...

683
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,820
Your mind. It is the center of your life.

684
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
It is everything you hear.

685
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,020
Everything you see.

686
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,140
Everything you feel.

687
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,880
It is everything you are.

688
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,680
How you move.

689
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,200
It is what's still your mind.

690
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,820
It is what's still your life.

691
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:17,800
It is what's still your life.

692
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:47,780
It is what's still your life.

693
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,040
What would you do?

694
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,600
Suppose that the little pet, the friend of your bosom that you had all these times,

695
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,540
was taken and thrown into a pit like vermin.

696
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,200
What would you do?

697
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,180
What would you do?

698
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,920
Fly around, little car.

699
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,260
Whee! Whee! Whee!

700
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,320
The music would get louder and louder and louder and you'd feel like you have a cold.

701
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
I would be a little more

702
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,480
That was our night, dear friends, at the Bob Larson Ministries.

703
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,860
Divival, actually.

704
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,840
We went to a Bob Larson revival.

705
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,660
I taped it.

706
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,660
Couldn't get hardly any kind of a decent tape off of it.

707
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,240
But, I did get to be on his show and here it is.

708
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,740
That turning point to the daily in-depth study of God's word.

709
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,040
We are quickly lining up.

710
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,520
We want to see you.

711
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,460
We want to help you.

712
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,860
And I want you not to miss Dallas tomorrow night.

713
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,600
Please put it on your calendar.

714
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,240
Get there.

715
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,860
Be there.

716
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,240
It's going to be a night unlike any that city has ever seen.

717
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,620
And Dallas has seen some pretty strange things.

718
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,180
So don't miss it for anything.

719
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,860
And speaking of some pretty strange things,

720
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,200
before I get to the rest of you callers out there at 1-800-821-TALK,

721
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,040
we've got some publicity seekers out there.

722
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,480
They are a strange bunch.

723
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,820
Maybe someday we'll do a larger show on them.

724
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,820
But I wanted to talk to them briefly because some of them plan to be there tomorrow.

725
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,420
Yes, I am aware of them.

726
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,920
I have been sent their literature through the years

727
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,840
and have never really talked to one of these particular people.

728
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,620
But some of you may be aware of the Church of the Subgenius and their god, Bob.

729
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,460
At least they have good taste, tongue in cheek.

730
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,140
And I've got one of their representatives on the line with me right now,

731
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,560
direct from Dallas, Ivan Stang.

732
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,120
Ivan!

733
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,800
Bob!

734
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,400
Bob, at long last.

735
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,380
You are the current church leader of the Church of the Subgenius.

736
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,400
Well, I just work here, Bob.

737
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,020
I'm working for Mr. Dobbs.

738
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,380
Bob Dobbs.

739
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,320
Right, Bob Dobbs.

740
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I'll tell you, I'm so glad to finally be on your show.

741
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,740
I've been listening for years.

742
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,900
Years?

743
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,880
Well, especially around Halloween.

744
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,440
I love your Halloween shows.

745
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,100
Now, how have I managed to fail by not getting through your thick head

746
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,020
after all these years to get you from Bob Dobbs?

747
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,260
To God.

748
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,280
Oh, you...

749
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,820
Bob, you have saved me so many times.

750
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,060
I have converted over to Christianity almost every time I ever listen to your show.

751
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,000
And then go back.

752
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,480
Well, we believe in the short-duration personal savior phenomenon.

753
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,820
Bob Dobbs himself considers himself a short-duration personal savior.

754
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,280
Now, come on.

755
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,520
Now, you people have really had 10,000 people ante up 30 bucks a piece

756
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,180
to join this Internet religion,

757
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,020
this religion of...

758
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,580
Of the quickie printer, tabloid-style, cigar-smoking, pipe-smoking God

759
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,180
who will come to Earth soon to take everybody away in pleasure saucers.

760
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,080
You've really gotten people to pay 30 bucks a piece?

761
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,740
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

762
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,320
And we've sold about 100,000 copies of our books.

763
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,280
Okay, so what...

764
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,220
I mean, we've been around for 20 years.

765
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,300
Now, in a nutshell, for the people out there who've never heard of this sort of thing before,

766
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,060
you are what?

767
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,020
Well, the church...

768
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,640
The church of the subgenius is a religion that Bob started

769
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:26,140
specifically to help the mutants, the misfits, the disbelievers,

770
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,800
and also those who would believe anything

771
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,140
in our fight against the conspiracy of the normal people.

772
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,520
And...

773
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,940
But you're definitely not normal.

774
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,400
Nobody's going to ever accuse you of that.

775
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,040
Well, in that respect, I think we probably have a lot in common, Bob.

776
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,020
All right, all right.

777
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,400
Touche.

778
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,760
Touche.

779
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,000
You believe that the world is due for demolition,

780
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,560
on July the 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m.?

781
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,320
Praise Bob, that is correct.

782
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,960
52 days from now.

783
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,860
And if it doesn't happen?

784
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,580
What kind of a question is that?

785
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,420
I mean, if I...

786
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,780
You think we're going to end up looking ridiculous,

787
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,120
like those poor little religious nuts here in Garland,

788
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
right around the corner from me?

789
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,620
Remember the...

790
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,260
Oh, yes.

791
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,280
God's Salvation Church.

792
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,600
Yeah, the Taiwanese folks.

793
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah, they happen to just be very, very nearby.

794
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,560
Yeah.

795
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,760
I went over there and gave them my $30 just in case.

796
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,960
You know, we've been telling people to have faith in Bob.

797
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,120
I figure I might as well practice what I preached for once.

798
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,280
Now, you say it's...

799
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,640
In your literature, you say it's not too late to be saved.

800
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,640
All you have to do is send $30 to Bob.

801
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,440
And I want folks to understand, this is not Bob Larson.

802
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,640
This is Bob Dobbs, the God.

803
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,520
Oh, Bob...

804
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,320
Yeah, Bob Dobbs is probably a lot cheaper for salvation than you are, Bob.

805
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,900
And you get eternal salvation.

806
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,160
You get eternal salvation or triple your money back.

807
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,480
It's not a bad deal now, is it?

808
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,620
Well, how do you know if you don't get it to get your money back?

809
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,820
Well, I guess you'll have to cross that bridge when you come to it.

810
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,660
Now, some people...

811
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,300
Let me put it this way.

812
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,020
If you end up in hell as a result of investing $30 in Bob Dobbs' church,

813
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,720
he will meet you at the gates of hell with a check for $90

814
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,180
and a little booklet called How to Enjoy Hell for 5 Cents a Day.

815
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,560
It's $89.95, I think.

816
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,000
Now, other than...

817
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,200
And having a good laugh and creating something out of minds

818
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,300
that otherwise would be wasted on something probably even worse than this,

819
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,660
what are you people up to?

820
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,900
Well, basically, Bob, we've declared war on God.

821
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,500
And I know that that sounds...

822
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,640
I mean, that's kind of taken on a big job.

823
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,260
We've been pulling God's leg for a long time,

824
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,200
and that's a very large leg to pull.

825
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,920
It takes a lot of nerve, and you damn well better be funny if you're going to do it.

826
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:53,240
But we have gotten so sick and tired of this invisible monster

827
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,560
that everybody keeps talking about that is so weak and pathetic

828
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,380
that it has to be defended by illiterate little old ladies and rednecks

829
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,880
against jerks like me.

830
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,120
Now, what kind of a God is that?

831
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,780
We're just sick and tired of putting up with it.

832
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,860
This thing's been, you know, allowing starvation and hunger

833
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,680
and all this stuff all over the world.

834
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,440
We've just had enough.

835
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,220
It's been telling us for years we were going to go to hell.

836
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,940
What else could we do but start our own religion?

837
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,580
Are you guys going to be there tomorrow night?

838
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

839
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,320
Now, we don't plan any kind of disruptions.

840
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,120
We're generally very polite folks.

841
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,500
Well, you're going to see God tomorrow night.

842
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,680
You're going to see God in action.

843
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,960
You're going to see the supernatural like you've never seen it before.

844
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,460
Then what?

845
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Well, if I'm impressed, I'm sure I'll convert.

846
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,260
And put $30 in the offering.

847
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,100
There's a lot of chances.

848
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,720
And I've...

849
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,140
I've worshipped many, many gods and demons.

850
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,340
But, you know, I always end up coming back to old Bob Dobbs.

851
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,380
Now, there are people out there who probably think

852
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,860
you are some secret friend of mine that I just put up to this for comic relief.

853
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,760
I don't know.

854
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,920
You haven't met him.

855
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,400
You people contacted me this week and said,

856
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,580
oh, by the way, since Bob's coming to Dallas,

857
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,680
maybe he'd like to talk to us.

858
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,600
Oh, yeah.

859
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,720
Well, we happen to have been, you know,

860
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,200
because our end of the world is coming up very soon,

861
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,320
and kind of a big PR blitz.

862
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,340
And I'll tell you what, Bob,

863
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,860
it is a big relief for me to talk to somebody

864
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,220
with even the slightest bit of sense.

865
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,000
Because mostly I've been on the radio with

866
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,180
drive time rock, classic rock jocks,

867
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
which is the lowest form of life on earth.

868
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,200
And I'd much rather be talking to a fellow religious nut

869
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,280
than one of these normals, if you don't mind,

870
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,820
you know, present company excluded.

871
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,620
Yeah, yeah.

872
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,060
I have Richard on the line.

873
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,900
Richard, don't...

874
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,220
You called in a second ago to ask a question about this guy.

875
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,000
What's your question, Richard?

876
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,540
Yeah, I wanted to know if, basically,

877
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,080
if this kind of thing was serious.

878
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Oh, friends.

879
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,720
Oh, man.

880
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,420
I forgot how funny all that stuff was.

881
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,700
This guy called in who...

882
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,580
He was actually the guy from the

883
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,880
alt.fan.bob-network.com.

884
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,680
And he was a member of the Bob Larson news group,

885
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,660
which is not really a Bob Larson fan club.

886
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,780
They actually kind of make fun of the guy and so forth.

887
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,260
And this anti-Bob Larson guy called up and said,

888
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,140
Reverend Stang, what are you doing on the air

889
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,340
with this adulterous radio preacher?

890
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,340
And I knew what he was talking about.

891
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,040
Bob Larson has had some problems in that respect,

892
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,340
much like our current acting president.

893
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:57,720
You know, some guys just have these organs.

894
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm sorry, you know.

895
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,540
And I jumped in and said,

896
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,440
you must be talking about me.

897
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm sure you're not talking about Bob Larson.

898
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:12,980
And the caller said, well, basically,

899
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,320
they're not talking about me.

900
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:13,320


901
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,600
They censored him.

902
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,060
And it was totally, completely removed

903
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,240
from all human reality.

904
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,340
Oh, but check out what...

905
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,420
Larson tuned in as he faded back in

906
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,060
after the censored out stuff.

907
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,440
He fades back in going,

908
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,140
well, you know, I've got a lot more nuts calling me

909
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,060
than you have in your whole religion.

910
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,240
And you know, friends, he's right.

911
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,020
And it's kind of a sad,

912
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,540
sad commentary, isn't it?

913
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,960
I've got more nutcases who listen to me

914
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,800
than follow you.

915
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,720
And we're not going to glorify

916
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
these idiots out there and jerks

917
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,460
who try to take advantage

918
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,760
of religious fanatics like you

919
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,220
to attack sane people like me.

920
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,240
But Ivan, I want to know,

921
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,220
in all seriousness,

922
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,060
how many people belong to your religion?

923
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,920
It's just you and a couple of buddies.

924
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,960
Where do you get the figure of 10,000?

925
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,340
No, Bob, quite seriously,

926
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,660
we have four books that have been published

927
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,820
by Simon & Schuster,

928
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,780
the first one being Book of the Subgenius.

929
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,100
It's still in print.

930
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,060
About 100,000 copies is sold.

931
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,040
I've printed, well, 60 or 70,000 copies

932
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,260
of our little pamphlet,

933
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,380
our equivalent of one of those chick comics.

934
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,020
And we have had at least 10,000 members sign up over...

935
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,440
I mean, we've been around for 15 years.

936
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,840
Bob predicted that there would be millions of them

937
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,760
and that we would have taken over the world by now,

938
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,000
but I think the conspiracy read Bob's prophecies, too,

939
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,920
and prophecy heeded is prophecy fulfilled.

940
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,420
And you are the sacred scribe of the church?

941
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,520
I'm the one...

942
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,100
I'm the guy who has to do a lot of the dirty work, yeah.

943
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,960
I assign the sacrifices and that kind of thing.

944
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,520
All right, well, I tell you what,

945
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,880
one of these days we're going to get you back

946
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,900
and talk a little longer.

947
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,540
I would suggest, however,

948
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,700
beware those little...

949
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,020
little old illiterate ladies,

950
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,020
as you referred to them a moment ago,

951
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,880
because there are some godly women of the Lord

952
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,680
who deeply resent what you just said,

953
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,480
and they are going to kick your spiritual butt

954
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,920
with the power of prayer

955
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,600
if you show up on Friday night,

956
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,220
so beware.

957
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,720
Those people that you denigrate

958
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,340
have got more spiritual power

959
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,500
and common eternal horse sense

960
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,540
in their little finger than you've got

961
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,660
in a lifetime of pursuing illicit religions.

962
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,360
And they're ready to take you on,

963
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,720
and they're ready to pray you into the kingdom.

964
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,120
So I say, prayer warriors, my friends in Dallas,

965
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,020
beware.

966
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,040
As you can see, it's going to be an interesting evening.

967
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,180
I got David on the line.

968
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,800
Hello, David, let's go from the ridiculous to the sublime.

969
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,160
David!

970
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,160
There are so many logical and thoroughly possible ways

971
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,460
in which the entire tribe of mankind

972
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,440
could be wiped off the earth at any moment.

973
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,380
Hey, hey, why don't you knock on that trap door there

974
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,700
and say, Yogg-Sothoth, three times.

975
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,940
Go ahead, do it, man.

976
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay.

977
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,100
Yogg-Sothoth.

978
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,840
Yogg-Sothoth.

979
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,700
No, I'm not going to say it the third time,

980
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,020
because you know I won't get one out.

981
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,880
I didn't think I would do that.

982
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,940
That's right.

983
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,520
That's right, I know your tricks.

984
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
Last time I did that, I had bad luck for ten years.

985
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,500
Ten years, man.

986
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,420
That's what...

987
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,760
The old mean Mr. Tooth Decay.

988
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,140
That's right, and then ultimately that was because of your truth decay.

989
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,660
When one stops to think what a tiny little grain of sand

990
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,320
this haughty world of ours actually is in the dark sea of space,

991
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,900
the spectacle of man's inhumanity to man becomes a cosmic joke.

992
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,620
What's interesting to a dog?

993
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,400
To run, to hunt, with a pack, to kill.

994
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,220
Oh, master.

995
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,620
Dark and shriveled.

996
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,400
Shriveled like a disgusting, horrible, shriveled spider.

997
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,700
That rhyme gets better.

998
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,480
Hot and cold, and it flashes.

999
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,020
One minute connection.

1000
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,640
When we were smaller than the spider, up the ladder,

1001
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:27,960
we were worse.

1002
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,180
Reverend Hal and myself crawling up the sides of the flowers,

1003
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,000
looking out for spiders because they were bigger than we were.

1004
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,420
You'll remember it differently from I did.

1005
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,220
There were no flowers in this early time in our Earth's history.

1006
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,760
They were like flowers to me in those days when I was so teeny.

1007
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,600
They had broad leaves, but they were actually gigantic.

1008
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,820
A burst of color up near the sky,

1009
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,660
and a little color all alone out there in the cold.

1010
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,860
That's a little color, not little color,

1011
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,440
since most of everything was green and brown.

1012
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,620
The color that we associate with flowers didn't arise until the Cretaceous period ended,

1013
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,180
approximately 65 million years before the present era.

1014
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,860
Then grasses and flowering plants,

1015
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,340
made their appearance in the Cenozoic world.

1016
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,980
The common bee, which appeared during the Cretaceous era,

1017
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,280
managed to organize and pollinate the plants,

1018
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,640
causing the flowering of the flowers.

1019
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,000
The world was taken over by huge, gorgeous blossoms,

1020
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,140
but the flowers of this early prehistoric time

1021
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,080
were far more glorious in their first defaulting

1022
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,020
than the decayed and senile blossoms and plants of today.

1023
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,100
Yes?

1024
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,460
Horrible horticultural facts.

1025
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,360
Ah!

1026
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,540
The eyeballs are their own flower,

1027
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,040
like the eyeballs of a decaying mummy,

1028
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,880
into the mysterious, infinite vagueness of the future.

1029
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,740
Here we go now into the mysterious, vague future of yesterday,

1030
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,120
the Rob Joes.

1031
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:52,800
I'm Reverend Hal,

1032
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,040
giving you a guide of how to find out about the future

1033
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,400
when it happens to you.

1034
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,540
Here we go!

1035
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,940
Yes, we're hurtling into the future at 60 seconds per minute.

1036
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,320
Wow.

1037
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,560
A sh...

1038
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,720
Now, a bigger jar.

1039
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,120
Now, let's go over that again.

1040
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,260
You say you saw some sort of future...

1041
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,180
The little collar looks like a firefly, doesn't he?

1042
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,560
As he glows inside the jar here.

1043
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,220
Well, the reason he is, uh, highly glows that way,

1044
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,380
it's a powerful sexual attractor

1045
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,680
of the opposite species,

1046
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,720
or the opposite sex, rather, of this little collar.

1047
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,100
Yes, these little collars mate by eliminating the, uh,

1048
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,120
the fluid which causes bioluminescence,

1049
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,920
or the phenomenon of a little collar's hiney,

1050
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,840
blinking in the dark.

1051
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,120
Stop it.

1052
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,180
Let's have that close-up now.

1053
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,700
Wow!

1054
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,640
Look at it!

1055
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,380
It's scintillating!

1056
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,680
There's some little collar's insect-like round eyes,

1057
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,840
with which they could see the movement of the sun if they cared to.

1058
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,340
Yeah, but they don't.

1059
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,400
So we don't either.

1060
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,300
They're prepared to spend their time burrowing through the muck.

1061
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:56,860
...out of this jar.

1062
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,160
Well, uh, forget it, fella.

1063
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,300
We gave you some air holes.

1064
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,320
Heh, heh, heh.

1065
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,360
And a little flashlight.

1066
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,500
And some food that'll last you,

1067
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,620
the size of an insect,

1068
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,220
over one month in your time.

1069
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,700
Oh, hi.

1070
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,400
Okay, there we go.

1071
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,640
Even Bob Nelson's here to entertain you.

1072
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,160
Good morning.

1073
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,940
Oh, no, that old man's trying to kill us!

1074
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,680
Bad show.

1075
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,840
You're routed in here.

1076
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:20,800
What?

1077
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,080
All right, now, what's your beat, collar?

1078
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,840
And we'll just play piano here.

1079
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,300
I'd like to dedicate this next song to all of you,

1080
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


1081
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


1082
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,200
who are out there listening to the show, and...

1083
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,700
On the show.

1084
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,320
...being with us tonight here.

1085
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:36,700
It's spooky.

1086
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:36,900
It's cootie.

1087
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,600
It's almost six o'clock, but, uh...

1088
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,260
It has all of those adjectives...

1089
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,580
We still have a little fun and good cheer to go around.

1090
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:42,960
...outside the fire.

1091
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,740
We're still trying to find out where the fun and good cheer went.

1092
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,800
And we're gonna see the night out with you, our audience.

1093
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,600
That's right.

1094
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,920
...is trying to get through to us.

1095
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,360
Something is trying to communicate with the consciousness of mankind.

1096
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,400
And he says it appears to be space aliens.

1097
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,280
But Starbuck also points out, he says it's funny in almost every instance of the universe.

1098
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


1099
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


1100
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,760
Now, people contacting UFOs, there's a heavy occult involvement as well.

1101
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,520
These people have been involved in New Age techniques and therapies.

1102
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,860
You say you can throw boot out the window and ash into wisdom and...

1103
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,260
No, no, no, you don't.

1104
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,940
Because these were way showers as they came by at a certain time or periods of our time

1105
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,240
to show us the light back to God.

1106
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,260
But what they're telling us, the space brothers, don't put too much of your energy in letting

1107
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,500
somebody else show you the way.

1108
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,960
You should be in direct contact with God since we are all part of that God creation.

1109
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,360
And you think like Christ is just like somebody that is like showing us the way to this God?

1110
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,880
Well, he was a way shower too.

1111
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,220
His real name was Emmanuel.

1112
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,400
Emmanuel?

1113
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,780
Well, look at your Bible, Matthew 1, verse 22.

1114
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,460
Right.

1115
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,940
And if you have, depending on what version of the Bible that you have, verse 23 and 24

1116
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,040
will tell you a different person gave him the name Jesus.

1117
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,360
He was really named Jesus.

1118
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,480
Right.

1119
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,340
And he was named Jesus, which meant the anointed one by Saul of Tharsis 300 years after he left

1120
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,600
the Middle East after he went through the crucifixion.

1121
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,760
So you actually do prescribe to the Bible then?

1122
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,360
No, I say parts of the Bible are correct, not all of it.

1123
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,480
Okay, we're talking to George Green, some wild things tonight.

1124
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,720
He's talking about UFO and much more than just UFOs and UFO sightings.

1125
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,000
He's really got theories about how this whole world runs and he's making it run, the committee

1126
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,600
of 300 and so on and so forth.

1127
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,820
Okay, first of all, all right, this is the...

1128
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,640
I'm a believer, all right?

1129
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,500
Okay, first of all, I'm from Vancouver.

1130
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,660
I was in Cypress Park last year.

1131
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,240
I saw an alien crash land.

1132
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,620
Were we on acid, Alex?

1133
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,600
No, this is truth.

1134
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,220
Truth, I'm telling you, all right?

1135
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,280
We'll be right back.

1136
00:46:59,300 --> 00:46:59,800
It's the

1137
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,220
You don't know

1138
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,960
To you

1139
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,240
It kind of makes you wonder

1140
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,080
Don't it?

1141
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,640
You don't know

1142
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,360
To you

1143
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,600
Who put the holes in the doors?

1144
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,760
Who let the blood out of the vat?

1145
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,380
That's mine, don't matter

1146
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,320
Now you tell me what you say

1147
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,640
Nothing on earth can hold you

1148
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,220
Hold on all over your eyes

1149
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,460
Master the art of illusion

1150
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,360
Nothing can keep you inside

1151
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,440
Who put the holes in the doors?

1152
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,500
Who let the blood out of the vat?

1153
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,080
That's mine, don't matter

1154
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,180
Now you tell me what you say

1155
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Don't you know

1156
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,440
And who I really am

1157
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,700
Don't try it

1158
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,460
He knows the tricks

1159
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,400
Of the trade

1160
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,260
You don't know

1161
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,560
If he was truly

1162
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,780
A friend of mine

1163
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


1164
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


1165
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


1166
00:49:59,780 --> 00:49:59,780


1167
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,580
When he said

1168
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,920
I'll be back in his way

1169
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,620
I'll be back someday

1170
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,780
I'll be back in his way

1171
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,700
I'll be back someday

1172
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,280
Uh, sad.

1173
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,200
The tape runs out so suddenly there.

1174
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,240
A beautiful song called, uh,

1175
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,220
I don't know what it's called,

1176
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,600
but it's from Cloaking Device,

1177
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,340
Ultimate Klingons.

1178
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,620
It's a song from the band,

1179
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


1180
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,020
Reverend Nancy Darnell,

1181
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,060
there in Germany.

1182
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,040
She's like the Grace Slick

1183
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,920
of the Church of the Subgenius.

1184
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,560
Uh, Ultimate Klingons.

1185
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,940
Before that, some clips,

1186
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,500
uh, Media Barrage clips

1187
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,360
put together by Reverend Nick Nolan

1188
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,660
about the Space Brothers.

1189
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,200
A little bit more music by, uh,

1190
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,420
uh,

1191
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,280
Who was it that I ran?

1192
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,360
Oh, John Bartles, yeah.

1193
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,300
And John Bartles,

1194
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,360
wonderful, uh,

1195
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,420
uh, sort of cantankerous singer,

1196
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,480
songwriter in, uh,

1197
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,560
Springwater, New York,

1198
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,440
I believe it is.

1199
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,140
And, dear friends,

1200
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,520
lots of KPFA Subgenius radio show,

1201
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,660
uh, from the California radio show

1202
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,560
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

1203
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,620
Oh, I should mention that, uh,

1204
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,580
some of the tapes that we're playing

1205
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,080
in the background,

1206
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,180
including the music that's in the background

1207
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,940
right now is by Reverend Arnold Mathis.

1208
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,440
I like, uh, Arnold Mathis stuff.

1209
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,740
And some of that KPFA material, um,

1210
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,860
and some other material we're playing tonight

1211
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,940
is from the KPFA fan, uh,

1212
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,680
Reverend Phineas Narco,

1213
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,520
who did a compilation of the, uh,

1214
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,760
sort of a best of the KPFA show,

1215
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,480
which he sells.

1216
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,720
And some of the recording quality

1217
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:58,840
is kind of tinny

1218
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,340
because it's a little bit more

1219
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,120
it's been copied several times,

1220
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,800
but I think Phineas Narco

1221
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,020
has done a pretty good editing job,

1222
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,680
really an excellent editing job

1223
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,480
if you consider how difficult it is

1224
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,440
to edit those guys' show.

1225
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,060
Not like this show, of course.

1226
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,860
This show's really, um,

1227
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,320
and, what else?

1228
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,380
Yeah, that's, uh, that's, uh, about it.

1229
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,080
Now, I do have a whole nother

1230
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,020
show's worth of tape

1231
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
that I put together last night

1232
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,040
that I could play, but I won't

1233
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,420
because, uh, I think it's very important.

1234
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,320
It's still near-court,

1235
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,540
and it's Christmas now,

1236
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,240
and some of you need,

1237
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,940
well, you have to hear

1238
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,640
Brain Rot Theater's

1239
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,380
Rudolph Hitler tape.

1240
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,780
Although I did want to mention one thing,

1241
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,540
well, two things.

1242
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,720
Number one, you're listening to

1243
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,660
the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1244
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,840
the voice of the Church of the Subgenius

1245
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
here in Dallas, Texas.

1246
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,720
And we do have this show coming up,

1247
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,900
a massive Subgenius revival,

1248
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,220
or devival, as the case may be,

1249
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,240
uh, New Year's,

1250
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,220
New Year's night,

1251
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:04,960
inaugurating the year 5BX.

1252
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,020
And we had some listeners call

1253
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,860
from Fort Worth who had a good idea,

1254
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,380
a real good idea.

1255
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,260
You know, we always do

1256
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,860
short-duration mass marriages

1257
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,840
at our revivals towards the end

1258
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,860
so that those who aren't married

1259
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,360
can, oh, do whatever sort of

1260
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,360
guilty sex acts that they can think of

1261
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,880
completely absolved

1262
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:28,500
completely absolved.

1263
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,020
And sanctified during that duration

1264
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,380
of that short-duration marriage,

1265
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,600
usually 24 hours.

1266
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,340
Well, this couple in Fort Worth

1267
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,900
suggested that we ought to do

1268
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,620
a mass short-duration divorce first

1269
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,940
because several people,

1270
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,660
them, for instance,

1271
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,580
are already married.

1272
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,140
But they want to go fornicate

1273
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,280
with other people that New Year's night

1274
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,680
at the Subgenius show

1275
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,100
at Club No.

1276
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,760
And, uh, they don't feel like they can

1277
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,060
unless they have a short-duration divorce first.

1278
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,180
Which, of course,

1279
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,860
will only last as long as those

1280
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,820
short-duration marriages will, too.

1281
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,660
So they're going to be looking

1282
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,420
for other people to marry, friend.

1283
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,940
And, uh, if that serves as

1284
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,500
any sort of inducement,

1285
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,940
I'm glad because

1286
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,760
I have a feeling

1287
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,120
we've been getting call after call

1288
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,600
from young folks going,

1289
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,040
come on, it's not really

1290
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,640
only 21 and over, is it?

1291
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,200
I'm afraid it is.

1292
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,700
They serve drugs at this club,

1293
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,060
Club No, alcohol.

1294
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,520
The, well, it's probably

1295
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,160
the strongest thing

1296
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,160


1297
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,160


1298
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,600
that's drugged.

1299
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,380
Next to crack.

1300
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,360
I'm sure crack will be legalized next.

1301
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
They'll never, ever get around to

1302
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,240
froth because the froth users

1303
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,700
just aren't that desperate, you know?

1304
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,280
Uh,

1305
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,000
so,

1306
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,720
so, friends,

1307
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,840
really, uh,

1308
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,920
if you were thinking, well,

1309
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,220
it's going to be too crowded down there.

1310
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,020
I don't want to go down there on New Year's.

1311
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:53,900
It's going to be too crowded.

1312
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,440
I have a feeling it's not going to be too crowded.

1313
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,720
Okay?

1314
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,340
Uh, and not only that,

1315
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,180
it's, uh,

1316
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,300
well, we need, we need the support.

1317
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,540
We need the show of support, dear friends.

1318
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,680
Anyway, enough of that.

1319
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,340
Once again, you are listening

1320
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,900
to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1321
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,040
If you need

1322
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,460
more information on the Church of the Subgenius

1323
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,840
for free, just for free,

1324
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,200
go ahead.

1325
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,000
See, let me put a challenge to you.

1326
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,260
See if you can not only write that postcard

1327
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,160
but address it and put a stamp on it

1328
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
and get it into the mail.

1329
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,560
I'm amazed how few people

1330
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,260
are even able to do that much

1331
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,600
for such a wonderful,

1332
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,620
giant pack.

1333
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,420
Well, actually, it's a pretty pathetic pack

1334
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,940
of free information, but it tells you

1335
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,560
how to get a really good pack

1336
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,480
for almost free information.

1337
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,000
Write to Bob,

1338
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,820
just Bob, or Hour of Slack,

1339
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,960
or Subgenius. The post office knows

1340
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,520
all our names at

1341
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,280

Cleveland Heights.

1344

Ohio 44118.

1345
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,020
I'll give that number again.

1346
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,280
That's Bob's.

1347
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,760
181-417

1348
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,460
Cleveland Heights.

1349
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,360
Ohio 44118.

1350
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,300
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1351
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,720
Hey, friends, we're also coming up on

1352
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,060
Hour of Slack number

1353
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,040
1000. And for that show,

1354
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,780
I thought we'd do a comments from

1355
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,220
listeners special.

1356
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,040
So, think about it and send

1357
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,120
me a tight door recording.

1358
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:37,500
I'll see you next time.

1359
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:59,500
A minute of audio about

1360
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,080
the Hour of Slack that we can

1361
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,080

1377
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:41,880
It does

1378
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,700
not make good recordings,

1379
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,920
so speak clearly.

1380
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,820
Friends, this is the Amino

1381
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,360
Acids playing in the background,

1382
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,480
and they will be playing at the

wickabilly campground

1394
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,600
Tex Day.

1396
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,980

00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,620
August

1399
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,960
17th through 21st.

1400
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,740
We'll see you at Cytopia.

1401
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,660
In Jamaica.

1402
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,820
Praise Bob.

1403
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,560
I got

1404
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,460
two legs laying and

1405
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,060
three sparks of spring as my brain

1406
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,340
sploomed out into the

1407
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,620
abacron nova somewhere in the middle of the

1408
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:54,880
signal.

1409
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,700
I got

1410
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,580
one of those little red race cars

1411
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,600
that have a big head

1412
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,700
and a tail on the back

1413
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,200
and a little

1414
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,360
you know,

1415
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,240
a little

1416
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,580
generator, I mean a little

1417
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,160
microbiota generator.

1418
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,700
And I got

1419
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,660
I had the

1420
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,300
hippopotamus removed and sent to me

1421
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,140
from a friend of mine

1422
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,520
who's working in Kenya

1423
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,620
and had a reserve there.

1424
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,260
And he said, what the hell?

1425
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,620
These things are not in danger, so why not just

1426
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,580
go in there?

1427
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,080
Take a big chainsaw and lop off one of the

1428
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,460
feet, send it to old Lonesome Cowboy Dave back to Kenya.

1429
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,900
But if you're still trying to act like a

1430
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,020
human, you're like 4K and I'm smoking the snuff.

1431
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,720
These are the world's

1432
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,900
best.

1433
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,560
The world's best.

1434
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,200
The world's best.

1435
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,760
The world's best.

1436
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:38,820
The world's best.
