1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
Oh, let's have a...

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,180
They just won't, they just won't, they just won't, they just won't let me be.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,440
Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,440
Come on.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,900
I don't know.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,520
This is Ivanovich Hagen, and this is the news.

7
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,400
Wake up, puppet boy!

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,500
I'm here for the magic!

10
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,640
No trouble.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,260
Get set, and let's go on.

12
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,780
Hit me.

13
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,180
According.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,620
Everything's going fine.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,560
No trouble.

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,420
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,280
Bob?

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
Bob?

19
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,020
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,760
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,200
What about slack?

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,420
That's your key phrase.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,620
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

24
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,140
And now, the Soap Genius.

25
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,820
Power of slack.

26
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,000
All right.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,240
No.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,320


29
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,080
No.

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,520
No.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
No.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
No.

33
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,380
No.

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,880
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

35
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,080
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,220
J-N-O-N.

37
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,020
And only in the city of...

38
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,900
Dallas, Texas.

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,780
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,000
the listener is advised to remain calm

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,220
and only contact listed or unlisted officials

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,480
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,260
being inhaled during broadcast.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,940
Small animals or other children becoming exposed

45
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,900
to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,000
constantly scanned throughout our program

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,580
should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,020
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you

49
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,120
that it's often a photon that light releases,

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,560
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,480
Hoping your time is all time

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,280
and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Here is your host...

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,760
Reverend Ivan Stang

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,200
and Pastor Buck...

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,380
Naked!

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,660
Go ahead, squirt it out, Buck.

58
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,400
Get it.

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
I can do it.

60
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,660
You act like I can't do it.

61
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,380
Yeah, I... yeah, well...

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,040
Come on, man, this is like pledge drive time.

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Let's make some money.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,380
Well...

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,640
Bob, man!

66
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,820
Aren't you all glad that we start the new week?

67
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
We're going to give you the pledge drive.

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,340
Yeah, what about the pledge drive, Buck?

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,820
Who wants it first?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,640
And why do they need to pledge?

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,380
Who cares?

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,140
I mean, who cares?

73
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,800
This is...

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,900
Well, we're going to have Dr. Chaos...

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,120
Dr. Chaos is going to be on first

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,760
and he's going to explain why

77
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,900
we have to do another pledge drive.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,840
What can one individual do in this...

79
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,000
What can one...

80
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,300
...destroyed society...

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,800
What can one...

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,740
What can one Criswell...

83
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,520
What can one...

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,720
...culture...

85
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
What I think that should be asked is

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,340
what can one Criswell do to the programming on KNON?

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
No kidding.

88
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,420
Well, anyway...

89
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,140
Oh, listen to that church air...

90
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,760
You know, just think...

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,380
...going by in the background...

92
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,960
If KNON goes down to the Criswell forces,

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,680
then for all I know, KVTT will be next.

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,360
There won't be any religious programming left.

95
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,540
All just this mushy-mouthed SMU stuff.

96
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,660
There's still K-Sky,

97
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,000
voice of the gospel in the great Southwest.

98
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,420
Ah, yes.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
You know, they'll take K-Sky over.

100
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,220
It'll be a monopoly.

101
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,480
Yeah, probably.

102
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
It's sad, friends.

103
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,280
So we want you to send that money in

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,100
and what...

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,620
Aren't we giving a premium?

106
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,900
Or we're both jointly giving premiums.

107
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,500
Right, we are.

108
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,160
We are.

109
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,840
Exactly right.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,980
And those premiums are?

111
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,260
I've got five Bob buttons

112
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,860
and two Praise Bob buttons

113
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,460
and...

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,440
four Bobra buttons.

115
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,820
Now, friends, these are badges

116
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,280
that have the official holy emblem

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,060
of our high E-pop

118
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,500
of the subgenius church,

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,080
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

120
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,340
Tell them what you're kicking in, Stag.

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,940
Huh?

122
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,140
Tell them what you're kicking in.

123
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,040
Oh, and I'm...

124
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,860
And, friends,

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,340
not only do you get that mirror button

126
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,520
that you can show off to your pink,

127
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,080
unknowing, unsavable friends

128
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,700
to show how cool you are,

129
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
but you also get...

130
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,540
...the new pamphlet number two.

131
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,140
Now, you subgenius church members out there

132
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,200
already have this one,

133
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,860
and you can hit us up for something else.

134
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,300
But those of you who are merely pledging

135
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,540
and who have never received

136
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,900
the printed word of Bob

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,380
will get for free

138
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,780
for your pledge of $20, $40, or $60,

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,420
or $7,100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

140
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,160
one of the...

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,780
of the...

142
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:21,780


143
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:21,780


144
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,140
these collector's items,

145
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,180
the subgenius pamphlet number two,

146
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,620
Eternal Salvation,

147
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,220
or...

148
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,560
Triple Your Money Back.

149
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,720
Absolutely.

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,260
No.

151
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,160
This monstrous tome,

152
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,600
this horror bible of the ages,

153
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,600
can be yours

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,580
for only one

155
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,160
minuscule contribution

156
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,980
to

157
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,280
KNON.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,580
And, friends,

159
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,620
without this station,

160
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,580
where would you be?

161
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,520
Tonight's All-Star Night.

162
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,300
Tonight is All-Star Night.

163
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
Reverend Buddy West is here.

164
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,280
The commander of the Dick Army Corps,

165
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,540
Ryan Dyer is here.

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,980
These are all... these are stars?

167
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,300
Dr. Chaos is here.

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,860
These are stars, Buck?

169
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,760
This is All-Star Night.

170
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,080
That's right.

171
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,220
All our major five subgenius radio DJs

172
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,420
that we've had...

173
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,120
In Dallas.

174
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,020
In Dallas.

175
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,420
I mean, I'm talking about our five major hosts

176
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,460
are here tonight to, uh, to do, you know...

177
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:20,540
Tell us.

178
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,840
To make you give money, friends.

179
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,760
To make you turn your pockets...

180
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,040
Well, actually, Brian...

181
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,820
And, if not your very souls inside out,

182
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,980
to empty your guts out,

183
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,920
to have your entrails spilling across your checkbook...

184
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,320
Till it hurts.

185
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,840
Till it hurts, friends.

186
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Until your very lower bowel can grasp a pen

187
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,340
through pure yoga, uh, ability...

188
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,840
They're lighting up.

189
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,820
...and write your name.

190
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,360
They are lighting up.

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
Once they're lighting up, friends,

192
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,120
once you start sending money,

193
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,040
then we'll play a classic...

194
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,620
No, no, do it now.

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,880
...media barrage tape.

196
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,520
Play it now.

197
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,700
Play it now.

198
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:51,920
Oh, we're...

199
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,380
Well, we're going to now, because...

200
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:53,420
Thank you.

201
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,180
No, we're not gonna do that bait and switch on you, friends.

202
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,820
We're just gonna...

203
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,300
Oh, yes.

204
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,300
The classic media barrage tape.

205
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,440
This is from, uh...

206
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,560
Now, many of you don't know that the subgenius church existed long before this...

207
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,820
I know, you think it's a joke.

208
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,080
You think it's some stupid, corny dime store version of a joke.

209
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,540
You think it's some battery-operated joke.

210
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,600
But, friends, the joke is...

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,540
The Church of the Subgenius has been around and practicing since 1953.

212
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,660
Understand?

213
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,820
And, uh...

214
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,580
This is one of the early media barrage tapes,

215
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,400
which you can...

216
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,880
You can procure for a certain love offering through the church,

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,080
but we're not allowed to tell you exactly for how much.

218
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,020
You'll have to write to the number that we'll give at the end of this tape.

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,500
Bob is laughing at you, friends,

220
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,580
because you know nothing.

221
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,080
And that our...

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,760
And that our money-grubbing DJs...

223
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,380
Be all that you can be...

224
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,720
In the army.

225
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,580
In Dick Armisen.

226
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,280
Join the Dick Army Corps, friends.

227
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,120
Coming in just a few moments...

228
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,540
He's coming.

229
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,360
We will be speaking with...

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,720
Dick.

231
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,220
...Reverend Ivan Stang and the Dr.

232
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,780
And Brian Dyers.

233
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,720
...Final Drummond with the Church of the Subgenius.

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,780
Just to give you a hint of what this is all about,

235
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,960
I'm going to give you a little bit of a tease about the church...

236
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,500
...right now.

237
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,940
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

238
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,580
How has your life changed since dogs came into your life?

239
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,740
The exes are a reality,

240
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,240
and my life is geared towards their arrival.

241
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,440
I redefined my own space and was able to center my being.

242
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,680
When I first heard Bob on the radio,

243
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,340
he said that he could heal,

244
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,540
and told me to put my hand on the radio

245
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,500
so that Bob's energy could come out through the airwaves.

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,380
The only cult they want to talk about is the Subgenius Foundation,

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,440
the Church of the Subgenius,

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,780
and the only reason they talk about it is for the money.

249
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,560
Well, I'm afraid of God.

250
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh, you are?

251
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,240
Yeah.

252
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, there's a lot of people out there just like you.

253
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,680
I'll tell you what, if you would,

254
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,660
put your hands on the radio,

255
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,320
right now.

256
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,800
If you plan to get saved,

257
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,980
you had better do it now.

258
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,280
There will be a day not in the too far distant future

259
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,660
in which Antichrist will be revealed

260
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,040
and the mark of the beast will be introduced.

261
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,120
We'll have the hand on the radio.

262
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:10,460
Yes, my wife said.

263
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,440
If he said,

264
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,980
he'd say I chosen goat food.

265
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,180
But maybe he's reminded me

266
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:15,860
right now,

267
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,660
You little lion, darn you!

268
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,860
Mangalore, he was a mangaloid

269
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,060
Happier than you and me

270
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,180
Mangalore, he was a mangaloid

271
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,940
And he determined what he could say

272
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,420
Like...

273
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,520
Like when you...

274
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,580
You screw something...

275
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,440
Well, dear friends, we have to...

276
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,120
We have to pat down on that one mere second

277
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,820
of Roberto de la Rosa, the zombie for Bob,

278
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,700
who speaks for us all the time.

279
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,980
When we know...

280
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,440
When we laugh...

281
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,100
And you can't...

282
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,460
And you can't...

283
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,780
You can't kick a dog

284
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,380
And they're behind you

285
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,780
And they're kicking me

286
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,760
And...

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,420
And...

288
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:14,420


289
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:14,420


290
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,900
And his stomach's...

291
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,780
And it's like...

292
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,460
We're gonna be taking calls

293
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,060
on 828-9500 for pledging.

294
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,540
If you want to call us for a talk line,

295
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,800
it's 823-7490 to pledge.

296
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,420
823-7490 to talk on the air,

297
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,220
828-9500 to pledge.

298
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,120
So anybody on the other line,

299
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,160
we'll just let them go,

300
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,580
and call back on 7490.

301
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,160
We...

302
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
We don't want to talk to you...

303
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,640
You...

304
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,500
You things out there,

305
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,420
unless you're gonna...

306
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,480
You know, give a little bit of what Bob knows

307
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,740
is most important to you.

308
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,060
You know, Bob doesn't...

309
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,120
Our guru, our high E-pop, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

310
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,440
he does not care for your money,

311
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,260
your lowly money,

312
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,080
nor does he even care for your despicable,

313
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,540
pathetic animal soul,

314
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,360
your friend.

315
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,540
He doesn't care what it is.

316
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,020
He just wants whatever is most important to you.

317
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,880
And here in America,

318
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,560
that's usually your money.

319
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,900
So let's please, dear friends,

320
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
if you want to hear any more

321
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,080
of the wisdom of Bob Dobbs,

322
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,120
it could save you,

323
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,000
come that hideous holocaust,

324
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,080
or the holocast, we call it,

325
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,460
because everybody will be watching on TV

326
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,360
until their...

327
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
until their flesh is fried off their bones

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,100
and with the glorious radioactive kits,

329
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,280
the

330
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,180
No.

331
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,520
Doug will be coming over from...

332
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,880
Seamstresses?

333
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,520
What?

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,720
Talk to Dottie and Mike.

335
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,820
They can clue you in.

336
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,400
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,980
Who is this?

338
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,920
An old Little Rock.

339
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,740
Frenchman.

340
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
This isn't Carl, is it?

341
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,180
Is this Carl?

342
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,740
Yes.

343
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,220
Oh, great.

344
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,220
That's Dottie.

345
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,620
Friends, you listeners out there,

346
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,640
this is one of the original founders

347
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,500
of the Hate Bob Society.

348
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,760
Those who love Bob enough

349
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,940
to be able to hate him,

350
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,040
and that's the test of a religion, you know?

351
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,320
That's right.

352
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,280
It is.

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
It is indeed.

354
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
So how's Dottie with the young junior over there?

355
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,500
Hey, there's...

356
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,140
They have two junior over creatures,

357
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,660
now.

358
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,900
God, I was at S&OB a year ago,

359
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,340
and they were like junior one.

360
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,960
No, no, there's two now.

361
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,480
You see...

362
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,140
There's two now?

363
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes.

364
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,360
Subgeniuses must be fruitful and multiply

365
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,620
and bring forth many young mutants

366
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,940
to further contaminate the gene pool.

367
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,920
Uh, yes.

368
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,540
So what about Hypercletes?

369
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,280
What's the deal?

370
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Well, Hypercletes is a big star, man.

371
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,920
We're just sitting here doing this public radio show.

372
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,020
Hypercletes is performing in L.A.

373
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,800
He's on Johnny Carson.

374
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,840
He's always...

375
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,040
He's always...

376
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,100
Sick.

377
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,460
What?

378
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,800
Well, not yet, but, you know, any minute now.

379
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,720
We're not talking Jesus Christ, right?

380
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,600
No, we're talking Janer Hypercletes,

381
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
the saint of the church, man.

382
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,460
He's...

383
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,860
Man, I'll have to find some Janer tape

384
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,520
and play some tonight for you.

385
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,460
Well, are you in town?

386
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,660
I live in town.

387
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,900
I just happened to pick up on...

388
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm sorry.

389
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,220
I'm wondering, uh, practicing, uh,

390
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,940
not quite, uh, overman,

391
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,460
subgenius, but...

392
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I used to jam with Dr. Shabab.

393
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,580
Right.

394
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,840
In other words, you never spent money on the church.

395
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,560
You got everything for free anyway.

396
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,920
That's the truest...

397
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,160
It's called Slack Vampire.

398
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,140
A gimme bob.

399
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,680
Yep.

400
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,060
Well, hey, man, that was Carl, man.

401
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,600
I know it.

402
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,260
He was a gimme bob.

403
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,080
We're not...

404
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,100
We're looking for gimme bobs tonight.

405
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,000
We're looking for pledgers.

406
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,820
Yeah, that's true.

407
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,800
We do need pledgers for the show.

408
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,280
Right.

409
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,580
So let's get on there.

410
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,720
You know, old times was fun,

411
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,060
but, you know, the church will be...

412
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,320
You'll get a lot of money in debt

413
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,940
if you don't contribute,

414
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,180
and we all know that's the truth.

415
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,640
Now, we're gonna put a little tape on here.

416
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,860
This is gonna be just...

417
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,820
Oh, you're listening to, uh,

418
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,020
the Hour of Slack Radio Ministry, KNON.

419
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,740
Uh, I'm Pastor Buck Naked,

420
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,820
and with me is, uh,

421
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,200
Reverend Buddy West and Dr. Chaos,

422
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,200
and we're having us a swinging little, uh,

423
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,740
doctor tape night.

424
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,620
Thought we'd play you all these crazed tapes.

425
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,860
Well, what's next, Doc?

426
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, I've got a song here by a band called The Modern Lovers.

427
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,720
It's from an album called Rock and Roll with the Modern Lovers.

428
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,160
This is an instrumental called Egyptian Reggae.

429
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, let's listen to that sucker.

430
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,920
Sounds interesting.

431
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,760
Egyptian Reggae.

463
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,060
Hi girls.

464
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
I want to make great friends.

465
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,560
If we're out too late.

466
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,260
They've only been gotten clean.

467
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,880
The only man who can.

468
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,980
I don't know.

469
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,700
Has to wear the bozo nose.

470
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,880
And just take that job all the time.

471
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,540
Because the bozo nose.

472
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,680
Where the nose goes.

473
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
The vanity is the thing.

474
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,900
To be looking all the time.

475
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,340
Right at yourself and going.

476
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,940
What a fool am I.

477
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,840
To be staring at yourself all the time.

478
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,700
And just.

479
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
I am the king of vanity.

480
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,460
My nose is on the plate.

481
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,140
I'm going to keep on looking.

482
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,860
So I don't have to know my face.

483
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,920
This time.

484
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,680
It was intact.

485
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,720
It didn't even melt in my pocket.

486
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,660
It didn't even melt in my hands.

487
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,360
It didn't even melt in my nose.

488
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,020
But I'll tell you.

489
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,700
It's melting down my throat right now.

490
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,340
God damn.

491
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,880
It's just a melting weed.

492
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
The squeaking universe.

493
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,260
We know about it.

494
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,360
The oozing universe.

495
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,880
We know about it.

496
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,140
But what of the melting universe?

497
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,180
What of it?

498
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,960
Sniffling.

499
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,720
Snuffling.

500
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,000
There's more liquids coated with Novocaine down your throat.

501
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,120
Ah, yes.

502
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
The melting universe.

503
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,880
The entire universe melts down from your brain.

504
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,300
And into the complete body.

505
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,000
And it just comes right through.

506
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,460
What we like to do now.

507
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,820
To really get the full amount of this.

508
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Is the brain tactic.

509
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,140
The brain tattooing.

510
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,160
The brain tattooing is the thing right now.

511
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,140
You put these tattoos.

512
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,880
Brain bomb.

513
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
You put these tattoos up on the brain.

514
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,260
And then when you take the frame to the brain.

515
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Then it comes off in these nice little kind of shapes.

516
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,340
And squirty little like brands.

517
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,500
Like cattle brands.

518
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,520
Cattle brands that go right down.

519
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,860
Right down your back.

520
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,840
And right down your throat.

521
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,380
Whoa, those doctors are scary.

522
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,940
I mean to be saying those doctors are scary tonight.

523
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,440
Take a hint.

524
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,140
Just like.

525
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,220
Oh man.

526
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,960
What are you guys saying?

527
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
I'm a new idiot.

528
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,560
You're listening to KNON 90.9.

529
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,560
The voice of the Yetis.

530
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,840
That's right friends.

531
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,940
The voice of the Yetis.

532
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,240
And speaking of Yetis.

533
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,360
We've got a big Yeti.

534
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
A big old Yeti right here.

535
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
Dr. Chaos himself.

536
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,900
He is going to kick off the KNON pledge drive officially.

537
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:41,900
Doc.

538
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,580
We have written this speech.

539
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,660
Doc wrote it.

540
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,860
And it's here for you now.

541
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,040
And we're going to kick off the pledge drive.

542
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,220
We want our calls on 828-9500.

543
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,420
That's 828-9500.

544
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,100
That is our pledge drive line.

545
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,540
If you want to talk on the air.

546
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,500
Or talk personal stuff.

547
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,860
Or tell me how cute I am.

548
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,220
It's 823-7490.

549
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,880
But tonight it's 828-9500.

550
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,240
For real pledges.

551
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
We'll be giving away premiums.

552
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,800
Doc.

553
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,760
What do you got to tell them?

554
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,220
Hello and good evening my friends.

555
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,420
I am.

556
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,120
I am the Reverend Dr. Sardonicus Chaos.

557
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,300
I have an important message for each and every one of you out there.

558
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
You know there's an old saying.

559
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,680
That the best things in life are free.

560
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,140
Well my friends.

561
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,840
That is an untrue statement.

562
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,800
A conspiracy lie.

563
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,820
A demonic pink lie.

564
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,600
Slack is one of the best things in life.

565
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,480
And around here.

566
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,440
Slack does not come cheaply.

567
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,040
There is no free ride my friends.

568
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,660
Picture yourself driving through the desert.

569
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,980
When all of a sudden.

570
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,100
Your car's radiator overheats.

571
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,040
You pull over to the side of the road.

572
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,840
And open up the hood.

573
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,060
And the radiator starts spurting like a geyser.

574
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,020
Spewing steam everywhere.

575
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,920
You're stuck out in the desert.

576
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,800
In the middle of nowhere.

577
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,060
And it's five miles to the nearest Stucky's.

578
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
Help me somebody.

579
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,720
You figure well.

580
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,860
I'll hitch a ride to the nearest service station.

581
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,420
And get my car towed in and fixed.

582
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,560
But every car that passes you.

583
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,200
Is being driven by a Crizzwell.

584
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,740
Or one of his followers.

585
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,420
Do you think they're gonna stop and give you a ride?

586
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,620
Well you'd better think again friend.

587
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,500
You're probably not pink enough for them.

588
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,940
Anyway.

589
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,180
If the Hour of Slack radio ministry.

590
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,880
Is your vehicle to get you to the land of Slack.

591
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,540
Then you my friend.

592
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,220
Must buy the next tank of gas.

593
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,340
Why?

594
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,280
Because we are under so much pressure from the false churches.

595
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,340
But.

596
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,980
You can help us change that.

597
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,640
Send in those pledges.

598
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,860
Now we know that some of you out there.

599
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,020
I say some of you.

600
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,320
Are Slack vampires.

601
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,380
You listen to the Hour of Slack every week.

602
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,920
And you figure this is great.

603
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,180
No commercials.

604
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,200
No salesman.

605
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,360
No unwanted blah blah being forced on me by the conspiracy.

606
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,160
But you see.

607
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,800
Without your pledge.

608
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,340
We won't be able to continue.

609
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,860
And pretty soon.

610
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
You'll be listening to the same old same old.

611
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,920
That everybody else's tone deaf grandma is listening to.

612
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,780
Is that what you really want?

613
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,540
I didn't think so.

614
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,420
Well you know what to do.

615
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,900
Send in those pledges.

616
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,020
Now unlike other ministries.

617
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,880
We do not use guilt as a weapon.

618
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,740
We let.

619
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,820
We let you use your own guilt against yourself.

620
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,180
When you start feeling guilty enough.

621
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,740
You will know what to do.

622
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,180
Dig down deep.

623
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,840
And you will know what to do.

624
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:36,840


625
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,640
Way way down deep.

626
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,900
No no further than that even.

627
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,080
And give until it hurts.

628
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,080
Send in those pledges.

629
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,300
Thank you.

630
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,160
The number to call.

631
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,200
The number to call.

632
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,540
Is 828-9500.

633
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,520
This is for real.

634
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,020
This is not a drill.

635
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,260
This is a pledge drive.

636
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,700
828-9500.

637
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,260
I'll be out there taking your calls for the pledge drive.

638
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,400
Okay thanks a lot.

639
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,560
Now Reverend Ivan Stang.

640
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,220
I'm going to go get a job.

641
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,100
Or die.

642
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,180
Helpfully brought up a wheelbarrow full.

643
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,800
Of this evening into the studio.

644
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,380
By the church.

645
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,140
By your belief.

646
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,340
Slack is something that when you join the church.

647
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,860
You can do anything you want.

648
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,020
Because it's within your slack.

649
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,740
Well when you.

650
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,000
And if anybody inhibits you.

651
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,080
They are hampering your religion.

652
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,340
And violating your constitutional rights.

653
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,580
That's exactly right.

654
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,120
That's right.

655
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,300
And that's why we're going to court sooner or later for us.

656
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,480
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

657
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,400
And I challenge you to point out.

658
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,140
National talk shows.

659
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
That do not belittle.

660
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,860
Sexual fidelity.

661
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,740
Purity.

662
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,040
That they do not belittle the marriage union.

663
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,200
And the family lifestyle.

664
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,200
That they don't.

665
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,860
Literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

666
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,300
I mean I challenge you to show me.

667
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,640
A talk show that doesn't make light of God.

668
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,720
The subgenius foundation.

669
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,840
Is a foundation.

670
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,780
The reverend Ivan Spang.

671
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,900
And Dr. Philo Drummond.

672
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,520
And they are.

673
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,700
As we mentioned before.

674
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,020
The dual heads of the subgenius foundation.

675
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,380
If you don't know.

676
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,200
About the school books depositories.

677
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,940
Watch out for all the leads.

678
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,880
Cause I'm number 6742.

679
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,020
Witnessing.

680
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,460
They're coming.

681
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,480
After me.

682
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,360
So come.

683
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
They're coming.

684
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,180
Hello there.

685
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,880
My lord do.

686
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,580
We're picking up.

687
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,460
All your.

688
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,020
Transpissions.

689
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,720
With us.

690
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
The leader and the idea are one.

691
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,900
But every party leader.

692
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,620
Must.

693
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,580
From the subgenius culture.

694
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Subgenius living.

695
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,500
They're.

696
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,880
Now all this.

697
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,040
Is.

698
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,320
A little.

699
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,280
It doesn't make fun of.

700
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,040
Of God.

701
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,600
They make a mockery of us.

702
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,980
Now we don't have to watch it.

703
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,760
We can turn it off.

704
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,680
Who will pay to clean up the contaminated land.

705
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,340
787-1270 is the number.

706
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,040
Call us and talk about what you'd wish.

707
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,400
Go ahead.

708
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,980
I might point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government.

709
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,480
That the conspiracy is trying to get across on us.

710
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:30,780
And we.

711
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,400
Suspect that the only thing.

712
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,940
That can fight a one world government.

713
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,680
Is going to be a one world religion.

714
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,840
And of course that's what the subgenius.

715
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,760
The church of the subgenius is here for.

716
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,360
When he says you shall have tribulation.

717
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,040
10 days.

718
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,620
He means you're going to have a maximum.

719
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,020
Of trouble.

720
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,180
And that's just the way things are.

721
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,940
The church is not at home in the world.

722
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,300
Certainly I want to hear about it.

723
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
What is sex?

724
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
I don't want to hear about it.

725
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,680
But leaders say.

726
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,040
One of the next big pushes.

727
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,820
Is child sex.

728
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,820
Yes.

729
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,640
Oh it's already off.

730
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,320
I mean the freedom for a child.

731
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,620
Do you know for the little child.

732
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,900
No don't touch me.

733
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,320
Don't think I'm not going to tell him about men.

734
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
What terrible things men do.

735
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,140
When he grows up he's not going to.

736
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,400
Manhandle any poor little girl.

737
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,640
And do you know that I have not been in a city.

738
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,520
For the last probably five or six years.

739
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,000
Where I have not had to deal with children.

740
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,980
Who this has been their fare.

741
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,480
When they were little children.

742
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:28,720


743
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,060
Dirty dirty dirty dirty.

744
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,320
Dirty little girl.

745
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,220
Dirty little boy.

746
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:36,940
I your mother.

747
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,060
I'm going to scrub scrub scrub.

748
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,640
Get that filthy animal out of here.

749
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,960
Out out out.

750
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
Are you crazy.

751
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,500
Letting that animal in the house.

752
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,920
I don't want to.

753
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,200
I'm tired.

754
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,480
He cried all day long.

755
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,100
You don't have to take care of him.

756
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,860
If you made more money.

757
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,460
If you made a decent living.

758
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,180
He should have his own room.

759
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,720
He should have a nurse.

760
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,340
We should have a maid.

761
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,100
Said there's so much depression.

762
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,480
Can't keep struggling no more.

763
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,960
Can't keep struggling no more.

764
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,980
Son's becoming husband.

765
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,000
Still in wonders.

766
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,640
Old man turning them daughters into whores.

767
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,100
Do you know even the leading.

768
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,780
Many of the pornographers.

769
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,540
These girls that make these films.

770
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,700
And prostitutes tell of child molestation.

771
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,660
When they were little girls.

772
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,560
Someone sent me an article for Candy Bar.

773
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,240
The famous stripper right here in Dallas.

774
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,040
That made the first pornographic film.

775
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
That Candy Bar.

776
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,720
A beautiful girl.

777
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,100
And she indicated.

778
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,080
And recorded somewhere.

779
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,080
I don't remember where they sent the clipping from.

780
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,100
But she said she was molested when she was three years old.

781
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,680
By one of her relatives.

782
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,200
And she learned this thing of sex.

783
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,800
When she was a tiny little girl.

784
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
And grew up this way.

785
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,480
And that breaks my heart.

786
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,660
It breaks my heart.

787
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,640
And it's happening.

788
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
It is happening.

789
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,680
It's a sick world.

790
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,520
It's more than that.

791
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,760
It's a sinful world.

792
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,440
We have turned our back on God.

793
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,880
Janet takes her clothes off in succession.

794
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,360
While her husband rides a bumper.

795
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,780
In the president's procession.

796
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,420
Sees him on the screen.

797
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:27,860
And the girl who sent him the article says.

798
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:27,920
He's a little bit too much for that.

799
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,300
A lover throws her on the bed.

800
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,520
The teacher shows her life.

801
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,360
And so he'll stay.

802
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,200
The music.

803
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,340
The music.

804
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,620
The music.

805
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,720
The music.

806
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,140
The music.

807
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,860
The music.

808
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:46,920
The music.

809
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,420
Late news.

810
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,540
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

811
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,660
We have millions and multiplied millions of crooked politicians.

812
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,000
God put a death penalty upon adultery.

813
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,880
When we see millions and multiplied millions of people

814
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,440
spending hours and hours before the television

815
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,960
learning how to crack safes, rob banks, kill policemen,

816
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,840
and get divorces and break up homes,

817
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,860
all these soap operas, hour after hour, warps people's minds.

818
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,160
Pull ahead. All decks, condition red.

819
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,900
Yes, yes.

820
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,860
Wednesday is Ladies' Night.

821
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,560
Underscorted ladies admitted free.

822
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,680
Their drinks, 25 cents and 50 cents.

823
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,940
A shy little girl leaving all that she knew behind her.

824
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,500
What this gonna do to kill me, man?

825
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,940
Hour after hour warps people's minds

826
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,220
as shows that they're crooked,

827
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,960
that shows they're perverse,

828
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,960
that shows that they're stupid,

829
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,760
that shows they got warped minds.

830
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,700
That's what people's minds runs on

831
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,260
and that the morals are breaking down

832
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,680
and that's the way it did in the Roman Empire

833
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,620
right before the Roman Empire fell.

834
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
Their morals broken down.

835
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,880
Starts on your shoulder

836
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,260
Starts on your back and on your hand

837
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,060
Music

838
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:13,880
Music

839
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,000
Music

840
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,100
Music

841
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,160
Music

842
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,780
Music

843
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,340
Music

844
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,480
Music

845
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200

847
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,800
Music

848
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:30,800


849
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:30,800


850
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,920
Hey, have a little fun this week.

851
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,560
Enjoy free refreshments, free gifts.

852
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,040
It's a pretty strong church we find and uh...

853
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,200
We need you little brother, how do you do?

854
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,200


855
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,220
Something else about it,

856
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,100
in an effort to get people to stop smoking marijuana

857
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,180
in this country.

858
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,080
The government is thinking about

859
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,380
putting a sales tax on rolling paper.

860
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,080
Yeah, hiss.

861
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,840
You're right, yeah.

862
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,160
Yes.

863
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,120
Wednesday is lady's night.

864
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,820
Unescorted lady submitted free.

865
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,000
There drinks, 25 cents and 50 cents.

866
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,340
A shy little girl leaving all that she knew behind her.

867
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,020
What will this is gon' do?

868
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:24,600
to kill me, man. Hour after hour warps people's mind. That shows that they're crooked. That shows

869
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,640
they're perverse. That shows that they're stupid. That shows they've got warped minds. That's what

870
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,960
people's minds runs on, and the morals are breaking down, and that's the way it did in the Roman

871
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,860
Empire right before the Roman Empire fell. Their morals broken down.

872
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,120
Backing on your hand.

873
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,900
Straps on your shoulders. Straps on your back and on your hand.

874
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,680
Sores pissing your side. Blood and water flowing through the land.

875
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,320
Hey, have a little fun this week.

876
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,000
Enjoy the rest of your day.

877
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,000


878
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,000
Enjoy free refreshments, free gifts.

879
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,040
It's a pretty strong church we find, and, uh...

880
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,700
We need a new little brother, huh?

881
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,800
Something else about it. In an effort to get people to stop smoking marijuana

882
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,960
in this country, the government is thinking about putting a sales tax on rolling paper.

883
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,560
Yeah, hiss. You're right, yeah.

884
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,960
So...

885
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,580
For school, yet we fall short when it comes to taking care of our own.

886
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm looking for one new value.

887
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm looking for one new value.

888
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,340
But nothing comes my...

889
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

890
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,020
Trying to cue up the amazing...

891
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,440
There we go.

892
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,040
This is Kate Ellen.

893
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,660
90 points.

894
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,040
90 points.

895
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,080
Nine.

896
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,840
FM.

897
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,300
It is KNON 90.9 FM.

898
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,460
This is KNON 19.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

899
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,380
Presport.

900
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,540
Presport.

901
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,880
Oh, yes, dear friends.

902
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,240
This is Li Liqi, the Chinese subgenius.

903
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:44,980
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

904
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,860
Oh, yeah.

905
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,120
Thank you, Dr. Li Li Jing, Pope of all China.

906
00:34:51,860 --> 00:35:03,320
And now, friends, once again, that number to call if you want to keep hearing anything like any of the shows that you hear on KNO.

907
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,440
Then you need to call the number I'm about to give and pledge a little bit of money.

908
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:17,260
If you call and pledge and say that it has to do with the hour of slack, that you like the hour of slack, that you're pledging because of the hour of slack.

909
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,200
Well, my friend, you'll get a whole bunch of free garbage from the Church of the Subgenius.

910
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
Yes, indeed.

911
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:38,120
And now, my friends, we have a guest rant, a quick guest rant from that great old-time preacher, Pastor Reverend.

912
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,040
Dr. Buddy West.

913
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
Yes, that's right, friends.

914
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,660
Now, I tell you, tonight's a little bit different, you know.

915
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,380
I don't know what staying naked's doing here.

916
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:57,420
But now, I'm a little tired, you know, talking about all this slack because I see not too much of it.

917
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,640
And then what I don't see, you know, I suppose it is or it isn't.

918
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,160
But the whole thing is, you ain't getting no bob.

919
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,960
Get down some of that old-time.

920
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,120
No, uh-uh.

921
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,380
No.

922
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,740
No, you want it, don't you?

923
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,240
But you ain't going to pay for it.

924
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:11,800
No.

925
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,920
Well, Bob knows that.

926
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,120
You think you're going to get some kind of slack?

927
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,800
You think you're going to know slack?

928
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,560
Much less know Bob?

929
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,600
No.

930
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,520
Now, I'll tell you what.

931
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,960
You're going to reach down in your pockets right now.

932
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,480
You hear me?

933
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,800
You're going to reach down there.

934
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,760
You're going to get some of that hard-earned slack.

935
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,780
You're going to send it in this program, KNON.

936
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,020
8-2-8.

937
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,400
And it is 8-2-8, 9,500.

938
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,160
Now, I want to see some of this slack taken out of the phones.

939
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,420
I want to see some of that slack taken out of the phones.

940
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,460
Them buzzers lit up.

941
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,440
Now, I'll tell you what.

942
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,720
Now, you send that money, and within 12 months, and if it don't happen,

943
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,640
well, you just talk to Buddy West, and I will tell you.

944
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,560
Now, you will know Bob, but you've got to send the money.

945
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,300
You can't be a gimme Bob, gimme this, gimme that.

946
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,660
You hear about this slack.

947
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,440
Who is Bob?

948
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,540
What's this all about?

949
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,080
You never know, friends.

950
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,260
You'll never know what it's all about.

951
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,740
You reach down now, right now.

952
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,020
Get some of that slack, some of that real slack,

953
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,340
and you get on them telephone lines,

954
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,840
and I want to see some of them lighting up right now.

955
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000
8-2-8, 9,500.

956
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,540
That's right.

957
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,380
Pass from night.

958
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,260
Now, what's this that we're handing out?

959
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,080
I want to hear about these buttons.

960
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,300
Okay, let me just explain that real quick.

961
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
Bob is sex and money.

962
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,980
You want to pledge more than 30 bucks?

963
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,720
I'll be glad to give you a button.

964
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,780
Stan, I'll be glad to give you a pamphlet.

965
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,920
The 16-page pamphlet, friends.

966
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,720
We'll just keep throwing buttons at you and all sorts of things.

967
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,740
I saw her before where you're going to be sending them

968
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,020
an X number this button and that button.

969
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,920
Now, how many buttons?

970
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We'll tell them over the phone what it means,

971
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,560
but I know that they get one button and one pamphlet

972
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,040
when they send the 30 bucks.

973
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,380
This is a divine pamphlet, friends.

974
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,100
I can guarantee you.

975
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,620
The more you send, the more we'll send you for premiums.

976
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,140
We'll be glad to.

977
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,820
I mean, heck, that's what we're here for.

978
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,660
But it's 8-2-8, 9,500.

979
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,700
What's that number again, buddy?

980
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,940
That number is 8-2-8, 9,500.

981
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,040
You heard it, folks.

982
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,540
It's not like you're sending it.

983
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,960
It's K-N-O-N, and, well, this is almost blasphemy.

984
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,720
I mean, I've never gotten anything free hardly from this church

985
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,220
except for what Bob, in turn, has made me realize what slack is,

986
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,180
and that is it.

987
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,980
And you'll never know if you don't find out,

988
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,900
and the only way to find out is to send it, folks.

989
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
Now, we're not kidding.

990
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,340
We've got to keep this.

991
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,660
You want to hear us on the air?

992
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,000
You want to hear this go on?

993
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,800
The only way you're going to make it happen is to call that number,

994
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,520
8-2-8, 9,500, and make a donation.

995
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,860
For the hour of slack.

996
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,320
Help me, somebody.

997
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
She ain't got no legs.

998
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,840
My legs are on fire.

999
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,900
Pull the lever.

1000
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,840
Down you go.

1001
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,820
Praise Bob.

1002
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,440
Yes, praise Bob, and you just may think, you know.

1003
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,540
But let's leave things of this world behind

1004
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:57,180
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

1005
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,840
from the church of the subgenius.

1006
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,860
The devil owes you money, friend,

1007
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,980
but Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

1008
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,580
We got a...

1009
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
Burn out the banks of the devil.

1010
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,820
We got to root him out.

1011
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,080
Burn out the hate.

1012
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,380
Burn out the radiation.

1013
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,880
Burn out the fire.

1014
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,880
These words may be harsh.

1015
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,080
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists,

1016
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,900
the modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob,

1017
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,440
but I don't care what they say.

1018
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,660
I'll keep preaching.

1019
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,200
If you go down, pull them with you.

1020
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,920
Praise Bob.

1021
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,180
Help me, somebody.

1022
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,440
Let there be slack.

1023
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,260
Don't ruin my life, you susceptible bore.

1024
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,560
Drew characteristic to all people

1025
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,560


1026
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,560


1027
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,560


1028
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,560


1029
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:07,560


1030
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,100
Hold it.

1031
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,200
The hundred bulldogs will blow every one of them stone.

1032
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,480
Don't you see my point?

1033
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,260
No.

1034
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,740
Oh, yes, we all love each other.

1035
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,060
Ah, yes, dear friend, that's what I want to tell you.

1036
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,420
Stop trying to force immorality into the law,

1037
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,040
which makes people accept immorality.

1038
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
Let's respect your love offering,

1039
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,000
because the bigger your love offering is,

1040
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,920
the bigger my love gets for you, dear friends,

1041
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,320
and the more love I spew out there for you.

1042
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,560
And Bob spewed his love,

1043
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,980
and we're both spewing together,

1044
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,440
because we got more love inside us

1045
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,280
than we can hardly hold on to.

1046
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,240
It's more than enough for one man to get a grip on.

1047
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,900
A big old grip on himself.

1048
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,860
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1049
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,640
Ha, ha!

1050
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,720
I want to tell you tonight that it just really touches my heart.

1051
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,840
Through subversive measures, Devo passes on the word of Bob by, uh...

1052
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,540
If you take a look at our last album cover,

1053
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,180
his name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines

1054
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,120
of each of the band members, right next to the word sex.

1055
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,220
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

1056
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,220


1057
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,960
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

1058
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,860
We're like explosions

1059
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,300
That lead to feeling good

1060
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,260
We're like high bills

1061
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,200
That change the world for good

1062
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,660
There's nothing that's to stop and go

1063
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,140
There's nothing but the up and go

1064
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,640
There's nothing like some in and out

1065
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,100
There's nothing more than what you know

1066
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,220
Yeah!

1067
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,140
About the only slack that I get anymore

1068
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,700
is worshiping at the Holy Temple of Ioni.

1069
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,460
Tell us about that.

1070
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,920
What's that?

1071
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,780
Hmm?

1072
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,540
I'm sure your audience knows what the Holy Temple of Ioni is.

1073
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,840
Well, can you tell us?

1074
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,680
Well, I almost do not know.

1075
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,200
It's a female delta.

1076
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
The Reverend Smith,

1077
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,540
this young Reverend Smith has been so instrumental here at the church

1078
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,740
in organizing those spread-leg suppers.

1079
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,280
Well, see, now this is the thing is...

1080
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,900
This is why I have hesitated in asking for...

1081
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,680
You're listening to K&N 98.9, the voice of the Yetis.

1082
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,160
828-9500, our pledge drive number.

1083
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,220
Light a few up, come on.

1084
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,100
Light them up. 828-9500.

1085
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,760
That's all you gotta do is 828-9500.

1086
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,960
Don't pink out.

1087
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,280
Don't try to reel in the false slack

1088
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,160
or you'll just be listening to another station

1089
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,400
very much like the one very near where you're listening to it right now.

1090
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,480
And that's not a joke.

1091
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,000
That's right, friends.

1092
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,080
If you're able to send a little money in,

1093
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,980
then you'll be able to hear the media barrage tapes

1094
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,140
unsullied by pledge drive rants.

1095
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,020
Got me?

1096
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,080
Mr. PP's brother.

1097
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,200
Mr. PP's brother seems like...

1098
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,480
He's gonna speak in just a moment.

1099
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,280
No, it's his son.

1100
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,620
It's his son?

1101
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:33,920
Yeah.

1102
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,420
Okay, well, he's gonna speak in just a moment

1103
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,280
as soon as he figures out what to do,

1104
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,100
which is call back.

1105
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,580
I don't know.

1106
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,560
You know, we're getting so overloaded here at the station, friends,

1107
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,100
with all this confusion.

1108
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,300
You know, we're kicking off the pledge drive tonight.

1109
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,460
It's not like the pledge drive's been going on for the next three weeks.

1110
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,360
Like, no, I'm only kidding.

1111
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:52,940
It's only a week.

1112
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,440
Hmm.

1113
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,500
That is really strange.

1114
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,980
We got a phone call coming in there, Buck.

1115
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,360
No, I guess he kind of lost it.

1116
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,860
I guess he's a little pee shy or something tonight, I guess.

1117
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,220
Well, in the meantime, friends, walk with us now across Dobbs Square.

1118
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,860
828-9500.

1119
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,640
There's hardly anyone on the square right now because it's a holy day.

1120
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,780
Yes, Dobbs Square.

1121
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,960
Let's stroll along this vast public edifice

1122
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,120
built during the years of trouble

1123
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,860
before our alien space brothers came to show us the true way of Dobbs.

1124
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,180
This square, the Dobbs Square, is vast, vast,

1125
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,720
easily 15 miles of solid concrete stretching off in all directions

1126
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,940
as far, as far as the eye can see,

1127
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,920
dotted with magnificent, yet unearthly structures.

1128
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,060
Unearthly because of their cyclopean size

1129
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,940
and because of the pure bulldada

1130
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,060
of their architecture.

1131
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,880
To the east, if you look to the east, friends,

1132
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,780
towering above the lights of Slack Town

1133
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,760
is the Great Hall of the Chosen,

1134
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,000
in which great meals of human flesh

1135
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,240
and human sacrifices may be had.

1136
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,100
To the west, if you look over to the west,

1137
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,000
towards the sunset,

1138
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,960
you'll see the Forbidden City,

1139
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,680
the previous home of Dobbs.

1140
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,680
With its 9,000 rooms,

1141
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,840
many have gotten lost in the labyrinthian

1142
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,200
recesses of this great palace.

1143
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,100
One occasionally indeed stumbles across skeletons

1144
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,020
of the faithful in the echoing deserted halls.

1145
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,580
And up north, ahead of us,

1146
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,300
lies Dobbs' tomb, where the public may ascend

1147
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,980
the 10,000 steps of the pyramid

1148
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,080
to gaze upon the actual body of the Dobbs himself.

1149
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,920
Mummified perfectly and preserved in lucite for eternity.

1150
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,080
But only those faithful enough to dare the radiation

1151
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,960
come close enough to truly peer into the grinning dead eyes

1152
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,680
of our high epoch.

1153
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,820
Bob Dobbs, these are the ones, my friends,

1154
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,540
whose children, for generations untold,

1155
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,600
will bear the Dobbs drone gene.

1156
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,960
Will you be one, my friends,

1157
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,580
will your children be those brave enough

1158
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:34,640
to step up and gaze into the lucite, mummified body of Dobbs?

1159
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,780
Ah, yes.

1160
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,720
But now, we'll pass away from that better world

1161
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,520
and into the mercantile world of the Pledge Drive.

1162
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,380
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1163
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,660
Yeah, the Pledge Drive.

1164
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,200
828-9500.

1165
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:57,820
828-9500.

1166
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,960
Where's, uh, where's, uh, where's Little P?

1167
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,100
Come on, Little P. Come on back, Little P.

1168
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,960
Don't be mad at us. We don't know what's going on either.

1169
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:05,740
What are you after?

1170
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,800
Oh, this, this guy has been calling us all night,

1171
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,260
and every time we try to put him on, it seems like his light goes off,

1172
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,280
which is really insane.

1173
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,780
Isn't it the truth, Stan?

1174
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,820
These mere callers, oh, yes.

1175
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,760
Well, what'd you think of cleaved Egyptian music?

1176
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,400
Yeah, I thought it was pretty, uh, cosmically, uh,

1177
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,940
oriented, if you will.

1178
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,600
If you know what I mean.

1179
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,960
Yeah, I was kind of right with...

1180
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,320
Now, do they know what, what we're doing?

1181
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,400
Uh, out of the bottoms of our pockets...

1182
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,060
Nobody really knows what we're doing.

1183
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,280
We're sending stuff to our, our, uh, supporters, right, Stan?

1184
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,660
That's right. To people who ca-

1185
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,100
Hey, listen, we haven't gotten hardly any calls.

1186
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,620
I mean, maybe 10 or 20,000 calls tonight.

1187
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,320
We need at least, we've got our thermometer...

1188
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,860
Where?

1189
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,620
...chart is only up to about 40,000.

1190
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,060
We need to hit 75,000 before this night's over,

1191
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,340
or that's it, man. Bob is dead.

1192
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,600
The cult of the subgenius is over with.

1193
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,260
I mean, there's no more hope for mankind

1194
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,620
against the conspiracy.

1195
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,920
If you can't manage to dig into your pathetic pocket...

1196
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,420
Oh.

1197
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,420
...and fish out a mere, oh, $5,000,

1198
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,740
or even, you know, 50, 20, 5, okay?

1199
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,360
If you're, if you're like me,

1200
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,060
merely five...

1201
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,580
Fran, do you remember what it was like

1202
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,500
when you had nothing like the Hour of Slack?

1203
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,180
You only could listen to strange outer space shows like,

1204
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,260
you know, Talk Back with the Martians and stuff like that.

1205
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,640
And now, here we are.

1206
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,880
We're 5% of our pledge goal for tonight.

1207
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,140
Only 5%.

1208
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,820
Can't you reach into your checkbook

1209
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,280
and just cut us a check?

1210
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,320
We're not talking about a biggin'.

1211
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,780
We're just, we're, you know,

1212
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,320
it really don't have to hurt as bad as we're saying,

1213
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,800
but if you really hurt yourself, I'll hurt myself.

1214
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,940
I'll send you buttons.

1215
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,940
I'll send you more, the more you send over the $30 goal,

1216
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,380
because, see, actually, it's not really $30.

1217
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,440
It's $29.99.

1218
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,040
You send that $29.99 to KNON,

1219
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,980
and I'll put the last bit in to even it up, and...

1220
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,140
Oh, friends, the line just went dead.

1221
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,640
I feel so inadequate to the task before me

1222
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,620
of making Bob,

1223
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,180
making Bob the biggest thing in Dallas radio.

1224
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,780
You know, only you can do that.

1225
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,780
It's really weird, but...

1226
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,300
Oh, I saw the lights just come on just for a second.

1227
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,560
Oh, and here comes number three.

1228
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,900
But the number is 828-9500.

1229
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,820
Sometimes I feel like I don't say that enough.

1230
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,080
If you want to talk to us on the air, call the old 823-7490.

1231
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,020
But it's 828-9500.

1232
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,260
828-9500.

1233
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:52,260


1234
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:52,500
828-9500.

1235
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,420
To pledge.

1236
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,180
Oh, and they all come on, Stang.

1237
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,740
They all come on.

1238
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,440
Oh, look at those souls volunteering their eternities to Bob.

1239
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,260
Oh, yes.

1240
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,320
Now let's listen to some tape, huh, Stang?

1241
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,420
Let's listen to some tape.

1242
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,660
Let's do that.

1243
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,080
Let's just do that.

1244
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:09,720
Person of Jew.

1245
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,180
Our television programs laugh at homosexuality.

1246
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,140
Hey, they laugh at immorality.

1247
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,380
They laugh at ungodliness.

1248
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,020
They make a mockery.

1249
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,700
They make a mockery of the holy word of God.

1250
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:30,440
And God says, when you change my truth into a lie, I'll give you up to vile affections.

1251
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,720
There was another hole I didn't recognize.

1252
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,320
My dick was so long, the bitch needed circumcised.

1253
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,320
You talk about homosexuals come out of the closet.

1254
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,880
Did you ever dream the day would come in American history when grown men would stand up and

1255
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,880
possess to be making physical love to each other on national television and flex their

1256
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,180
muscles and say, don't tell me that I'm a sissy, I'm a he-man, but I'm in love with that

1257
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,800
man right there and I'm married.

1258
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,120
Larry the faggot was bleeding from the ass.

1259
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,380
Wait a minute now.

1260
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,060
We can't be going into Dolomite.

1261
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,320
That's Rudy Ray Moore, what started to be illegal there.

1262
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,920
That was Rudy Ray Moore, the great...

1263
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,540
Ain't that the truth?

1264
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,760
Oh, here we go.

1265
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,560
And claiming to how the Holy Ghost.

1266
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,480
Well, that's deception.

1267
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,240
Ain't a bigger abomination in the world than women wearing men's clothes and men wearing

1268
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,960
women's clothes and people being perverts.

1269
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:38,280
That's the two of the greatest sins in the world is idolatry, witchcraft, homosexuality,

1270
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:45,020
and men and women wearing the clothes of the opposite sex.

1271
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,000
It's abomination.

1272
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,880
And whosoever do it is abomination.

1273
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,200
And there's more people today.

1274
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,940
Their minds are perverted.

1275
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,020
Their life is perverted and they've been given over to a reprobate mind.

1276
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,280
So many people today, even people that aren't homosexual, their minds are perverted.

1277
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,520
It's filled with filth and it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness that comes

1278
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,620
from the pit of hell.

1279
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,120
And you see it on television.

1280
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,200
You see it in the movie houses and you see it on the market stand.

1281
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,740
And you hear it on the hour of sleep.

1282
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,640
Hey, how about Bernard?

1283
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:21,100
It's a little bit of pornography.

1284
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:21,920
And shucks.

1285
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,540
All you have to do is look around you.

1286
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,500
Female body parts are available just about anywhere.

1287
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,200
Or pick up some picture books.

1288
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:36,020
Well, we're standing here with Brian Dyers, commander of the Dick Army Corps.

1289
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:42,780
And Brian, now tell me, tell us a little bit about the Dick Army Corps.

1290
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:43,980
Now that's a youth group, isn't it?

1291
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,900
Yes, it is.

1292
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,040
A youth group.

1293
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,040
And what exactly do y'all do?

1294
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,620
You do a...

1295
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,780
You do a chant for Dick Army, right?

1296
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,080
Yeah.

1297
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:52,820
Okay.

1298
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,740
And so we've heard it on the hour of slack before, haven't we?

1299
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,480
Sure have.

1300
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,520
Sure have.

1301
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,420
Well, now let's see now.

1302
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,900
If the lines don't light up, I guess we're going to have to do the Dick Army chant, huh?

1303
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,820
Now, who is Dick Army?

1304
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,200
That's what I think a lot of our listeners are confused about.

1305
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,580
Dick Army is a representative...

1306
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:16,800
Where's he from?

1307
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,220
He's from...

1308
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:17,500
He's from...

1309
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:17,780
He's from...

1310
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:17,780


1311
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:17,880
He's from Nantan.

1312
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:18,980
Uh-huh.

1313
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,380
And...

1314
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,060
He's more conservative than Reagan's boss, isn't he?

1315
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,320
Yeah.

1316
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,820
Now, you're his biggest fan, aren't you?

1317
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,600
Sure am.

1318
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,560
Now, you've got this youth group and they're all like kind of like beating on their

1319
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,460
chest and putting their fists in the air and screaming for...

1320
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,360
Dick!

1321
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:34,420
Army!

1322
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,620
Dick!

1323
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:36,880
Army!

1324
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:37,960
Dick!

1325
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,240
Army!

1326
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,440
Dick!

1327
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:41,580
Army!

1328
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,660
Dick!

1329
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,700
Army!

1330
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,440
Dick!

1331
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,440


1332
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:44,720
Dick!

1333
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:45,960
Army!

1334
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,840
Maybe right now I should say it's 828-9500.

1335
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,940
828-9500.

1336
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,320
And that's our pledge drive line.

1337
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:01,100
And Brian, tell us a little bit more about Dick Army and KON and all stuff like that.

1338
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,640
What's the number, though?

1339
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,620
You have to keep reading the number.

1340
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,600
828-9500.

1341
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,100
828-9500.

1342
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,520
Knock yourself out.

1343
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,540
One more time.

1344
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,460
The number is 828-9500.

1345
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,620
Hey, friends.

1346
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,140
I mean, we're sitting here staring at a blank, at a sickeningly blank.

1347
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,360
We've got a couple.

1348
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,420
We can handle two more.

1349
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,900
Oh, there's three of them on there.

1350
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,460
There's three.

1351
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,080
There's three people calling in.

1352
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,760
Oh, come on, Stank.

1353
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,820
That ain't enough, man.

1354
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,400
Shut up, Stank.

1355
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,500
That wouldn't support the subgenius church for two minutes.

1356
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,500
They're all lit up right now.

1357
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,980
Now, callers, we really thank you.

1358
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, heck.

1359
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,380
Wait a minute.

1360
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,420
I got something to say.

1361
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,360
Bless you.

1362
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,280
Bless you, those callers who've called.

1363
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,860
Bless you from the bottom of KON.

1364
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,340
From the dregs of KON.

1365
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:53,920
That's us.

1366
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,880
The dregs of KON.

1367
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,020
And look, just remember that line about false slack.

1368
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,980
You're not getting anything by not sending it in.

1369
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,480
You won't get anything if you don't send it in.

1370
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,860
Because the fact is, if we can't get you money,

1371
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,340
then somebody else will be here.

1372
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:12,720
You can.

1373
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,460
That's right.

1374
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,820
And if you don't know what that means,

1375
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,260
well, they'll show you what it means.

1376
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,840
Only they're not going to ask for it.

1377
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,880
They're going to demand it.

1378
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,580
And they're going to be in a position to take it.

1379
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,340
So I'm not just weaseling saying to you,

1380
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,720
oh, come on, please give a check to 828-9500.

1381
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,380
I am telling you why to send a check to 828-9500.

1382
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,460
You can't sit there in the back on your butt gland.

1383
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,580
You can't sit there on your butt gland and be a gimme bob.

1384
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,260
Holy cow.

1385
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,780
You can't just sit there and be a gimme bob.

1386
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:51,180
You've got to send it in because we here at KNON actually need it.

1387
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,480
We're not even making this up.

1388
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,240
We're under so much pressure from the false churches,

1389
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,500
the conspiracy right now,

1390
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,700
and I happen to know where they live.

1391
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,680
I know if KNON goes down, the last act,

1392
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,980
the last desperate act of KNON will be put at every address over the air.

1393
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,940
But, hey, you know,

1394
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:12,860
we're not there yet.

1395
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,760
And, look, we would rather not do that.

1396
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,220
We would rather just win the court case and then just blow the rest of it off.

1397
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,060
It's serious.

1398
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,700
It's real.

1399
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,140
So thank you for all the lines are all lit up.

1400
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,740
There's no need for me to say anything else.

1401
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,260
I know that somebody is really listening.

1402
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,180
I'd be glad to send you a button,

1403
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,860
and Stang will be glad to send you a pamphlet in the word of Bob.

1404
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,820
We'll be glad to send you this stuff.

1405
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,980
And, hell, we'll just wait for next time.

1406
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,920
But thanks a lot to all of our players.

1407
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,280
It's been a pleasure tonight.

1408
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,900
And we're now at 6% of our goal.

1409
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,640
So thanks, callers.

1410
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,980
OK, good night.

1411
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,120
Now you can hear some tape.

1412
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,660
We all told us we should party if you wanted to come back,

1413
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,940
but he never told us nothing about a bucket full of slack.

1414
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,700
We all party to it puke, but we never got the neck.

1415
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,020
We never got nothing like a bucket full of slack.

1416
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,580
Well, a bucket full of slack is all you need

1417
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,160
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed

1418
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,740
Oh, a bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack

1419
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,120
Take you right to heaven and I'll bring you right back

1420
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,660
Well, I met a lot of doctors, most of them are quacks

1421
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,300
None of them have ever had a bucket full of slack

1422
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,080
Try to sell you a wotan, it comes in a sack

1423
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,480
Doesn't get close to a bucket full of slack

1424
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,660
A bucket full of slack is all you need

1425
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,300
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed

1426
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,820
Oh, a bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack

1427
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,340
Take you right to Dobsdown and I'll never bring you back

1428
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,920
Well, I searched so long till I was really whacked

1429
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,180
It sure ain't easy to find a bucket full of slack

1430
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,820
But when you finally found it, you know that you like

1431
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,060
It's a bucket full of slack

1432
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,300
Nothing in the world like a bucket full of slack

1433
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,460
Well, a bucket full of slack is all you need

1434
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,260
You don't need whiskey and you don't need weed

1435
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,540
Oh, a bucket full of slack, a bucket full of slack

1436
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,860
Take you right to Dobsdown and I'll bring you right back

1437
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,340
Take you up to heaven and I'll never bring you back

1438
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,580
Take you down to Dobsdown and you'll never come back

1439
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:38,100
Ah, yes, dear friends, that was Reverend Jim Erickson of the, uh,

1440
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,320
well, he was playing at the subgenius D-Vival that Buck and I were both at

1441
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,580
in San Francisco, California,

1442
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,580
where we went to take revenge on those who gave Joe Bob Briggs bad reviews.

1443
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,580
Oh, heck. 828-9500.

1444
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,000
Now, friends, we're gonna continue with Media Barrage number three.

1445
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,520
Thanks for keeping them lit up, friends.

1446
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,740
Thanks for keeping them lit up.

1447
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:01,000
You better keep it lit up.

1448
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,180
It's 828-9500.

1449
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,640
You better keep it lit up.

1450
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,660
Yes, everything's going real good.

1451
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,140
And keep pledging.

1452
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,340
These are real pledges now.

1453
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,800
Any fake pledges or any nonsense pledges,

1454
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,500
these are real pledges, and thanks very much.

1455
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,140
And Bob's waiting for his.

1456
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,180
Oh, yes.

1457
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:33,200
Now, Mama's on the bottom and Papa's on the top

1458
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,020
Baby's in the crib, a-hollin' poor

1459
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,260
To her pop job, hey, Baba-ree-bob

1460
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,080
Hey, Baba-ree-bob

1461
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,280
This is my baby nose

1462
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,940
Now, tea is tea and land is land

1463
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,700
Can't get my boogie, I can get it by handshop

1464
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,980
Hey, Baba-ree-bob

1465
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,120
Yes, Baba-ree-bob

1466
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,460
Hey, Baba-ree-bob

1467
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,380
Now, a boogie's in the kitchen and a boogie's in the hall

1468
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,900
Boogie's in my hand and I slung it on the's although

1469
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,080
Hey, Baba-ree-bob

1470
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1471
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1472
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:08,080


1473
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,140
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

1474
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,340
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

1475
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,460
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

1476
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,860
Yes, my baby knows.

1477
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,660
Out in the crapshirt sitting so bold.

1478
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,400
Gonna get me some of the old, not whole-jounce.

1479
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,560
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

1480
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,780
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

1481
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,280
Yes, my baby knows.

1482
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,340
Oh, my.

1483
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,960
For Bob, my friend, Bob is a sex god.

1484
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,800
Bob, in fact, is sex.

1485
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:40,680
An all-encompassing sex that is the very in-ness and surrounding-ness of the union of both the

1486
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,160
human and the uni, and not just heterosexual sex, all sex.

1487
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,580
Bob does not choose to fornicate.

1488
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,220
Bob has the tool of all time, us, to fornicate.

1489
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:01,780
And not just with women, not just with men, with animals, with plants, and the faith of

1490
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,300
all trees.

1491
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,280
That's right.

1492
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:09,640
To the bright white waves of the priming deep of the very earth itself.

1493
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,580
That was fun.

1494
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:13,700
Doctor!

1495
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,780
No, please, doctor, I beg you.

1496
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,420
Does this hurt?

1497
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,480
Does this hurt?

1498
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:17,900
No!

1499
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,780
Doctor, please.

1500
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,300
No, wait.

1501
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:22,900
Can you wait?

1502
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,460
It is a time of flagrant immorality.

1503
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,580
A time when the old standards have crumbled as if hit by history's greatest tidal wave

1504
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,780
of filth and perversity.

1505
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,600
And the world has been a place of confusion and sexual promiscuity undreamed of even five

1506
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,400
years ago.

1507
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:43,780
America's theater marquees scream every kind of degeneracy known to man.

1508
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:46,300
From witchcraft and apocryphism...

1509
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,160
Send it in, send it in.

1510
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:47,820
Send it in.

1511
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,500
All right, folks, we've got this, this is it.

1512
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,600
This is the ultimate hate call, apparently.

1513
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,140
We've got a fine hate call coming in.

1514
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,500
But...

1515
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,040
It's really got a hateful sound to it, doesn't it?

1516
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,060
Hello?

1517
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,660
Hate's... sounds pretty bad.

1518
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:02,760
What's wrong?

1519
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,440
What's going on so far?

1520
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,140
Yeah, it really sounds pretty hateful.

1521
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,000
Um, Phil, would you send that...

1522
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,200
Send it in.

1523
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:09,220
Send it in.

1524
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,220
Phil and the Blanks...

1525
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:10,880
Line two, line two.

1526
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:17,440
...demands that you, you out there, send in that which is most important to you.

1527
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:17,640
Hello?

1528
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,420
Come on, man.

1529
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,200
We want to hear that hate call.

1530
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,640
We don't get anywhere near enough hate call.

1531
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,760
We don't get any hate at all.

1532
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,060
Friends...

1533
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:25,680
We've got a hate call that we wouldn't believe.

1534
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,380
The only reason...

1535
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:26,760
Hello?

1536
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,900
...the only reason God hasn't destroyed the Church of the Subgenius yet is because he

1537
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:36,900
doesn't know whether to be disgusted or elated with doctors for Bob.

1538
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,320
We have got a call that will curl your socks, friend.

1539
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,600
Let's get it, man.

1540
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,760
...eat is slack.

1541
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,360
We've got a call...

1542
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:42,520
...to get slack.

1543
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,600
...now, this is to top off the pledge drive.

1544
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:50,040
And I want you all to listen to line two because this woman hates the Church of the Subgenius.

1545
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,800
She hates us.

1546
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,780
Let's have it, man.

1547
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,520
Hate.

1548
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:52,680
Hate.
