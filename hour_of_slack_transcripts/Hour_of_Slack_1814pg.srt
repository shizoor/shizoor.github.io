1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
Radio has correctly been called the theater of imagination.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,120
Listeners were essential partners in the creative process on programs like

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,540
Suspense, Lights Out, Inner Sanctum, and

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,760
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,300
I'll tell my daddy not to steal anymore and I'll make him get a real job.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,380
Yeah, pretty soon.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,240
First arrangement. The first arrangement.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,080
Babe.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,380
You sit down slowly, making sure the head muscles don't move too much,

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,600
causing the brain to move around in the brain case.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,160
Making sure all the dendrites are connected so that no one knows.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,700
No one knows.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,740
Genetic engineers.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,060
Working in.

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,460
In secret laboratories and media podcasts.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,600
Are now able to create an onion that will not make Mr. and Mrs. Hussle really cry.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,220
He doesn't even have a body, he's just a little head.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,980
Yea, verily, for Bob should be praised.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,860
He is being praised. This is how we praise Bob.

20
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,700
This is how we polish Bob's mouth.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,400
This is the way we worship our Bob.

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,940
We take care of Bob like no one else.

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,400
Repeat after me.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,620
No, you repeat after me.

25
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,060
Bob is fine.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,360
Bob is ice.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
Bob appears and Bob is light.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,620
Bob is nice.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,280
You know, just saying it doesn't make it so.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,360
Bob is not nice.

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,540
Yea, verily.

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,220
Yea, verily.

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,880
I know, if Bob's looking in the window, are you the servant that opens it so he can piss in?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Weep no more.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Onions will no longer provoke tears.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,800
I only know about it because I had to seek out the magic towel that night.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,340
For Bob has arisen.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,520
Well, you shouldn't have.

39
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,760
You should have been able to continue.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,620
Again and again and again and again.

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,200
It makes me want to go to Grandview camping.

42
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Bob never goes down.

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,080
Bob never goes down.

44
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,900
Bob is always up.

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,760
He's always up.

46
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,080
Always up, dude.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,800
He never has to seek out the adult catalogs that other subgeniuses do.

48
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
And you must receive slack in Bob.

49
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,500
Those subgeniuses, too cheap to get on their own computer, must seek out their tiny little

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,980
catalogs.

51
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,740
At 848-4425-4529.

52
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,480
520 man is mounted.

53
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,340
Massive collections.

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,040
And they're not going to be able to get out.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,040


56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,040


57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,260
Bob is a big, massive, huge, erect collection moving toward the bridge.

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,080
No, let's not get dirty here.

59
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,440
Massively large, huge, erect collections.

60
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,680
Moving toward bridge.

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,180
Oh, he's away from the bridge.

62
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,740
Don't worry about it.

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,920
No, don't worry about it.

64
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,300
It's just puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell and Dr. Drummond.

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,280
And before that, Chaz and Dave on ESO's Swamp Radio.

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,920
This is Hour of Slack number 1814.

67
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,600
A new episode of the ESO Swamp Radio Network.

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,600


69
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:56,600


70
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


71
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


72
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


74
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


75
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


76
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


77
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


78
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


79
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


80
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:56,660


81
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:07,320
Some old, some new. I'm back on my feet again instead of flat on my back, finally, after weeks of physical therapy in the form of controlled torture.

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,400
And by gobs, it actually worked. Slow and steady. No pain, no gain.

83
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,740
Regular application of the poop dog hat and hourly exposures to the photo of that.

84
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,940
That, plus endless repetitious stretches.

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,280
If you feel, you heal, and I had lots of feels.

86
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:42,000
In fact, friends, I guess I've been denying the severity of my little arthritic aches and pains for a longer time than I wanted to even remember.

87
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:51,640
I keep seeing ancient evidence that all that hauling of stage props, cases of subgenius swag products,

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,720
and pee-poo,

89
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,760
and NBA gear was stressing my skinny little back bones.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,340
That's been going on for so long it just became background noise for 20 years.

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,060
For instance, I found this recording from the year of 2001.

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:18,420
It's me preaching like a sailor at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland during a revival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

93
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,160
This exactly dates.

94
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,520
The first time I started bitching about my aching back in public.

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
No wonder I cussed so much then.

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,440
And I know that some of the young people here are not going to like to hear this,

97
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,820
but I really did have to quit smoking and drinking to excess.

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,460
But I would not recommend that to everybody, no!

99
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,060
Because sometimes you have to smoke and drink to excess just to stay alive!

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,140
I'm afraid I know how to do it.

101
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,940
I know how that is too.

102
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,460
But my friend, there is an ultimate narcotic.

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,560
And it's one that I wish I had more of right this very second.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,900
That ultimate narcotic is sleep!

105
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,960
Sleep!

106
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,420
Oh my God!

107
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,500
And food, my friend!

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,960
Food is the only kind of speed that you never crash from.

109
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,660
Now I know I sound sort of like mom saying all that,

110
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,040
but some plain old common sense thing.

111
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,120
But I know I sound sort of like mom saying all that, but some plain old common sense thing.

112
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,120


113
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,100
think thatobaboutbetweenoi.com

114
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,040
But living here in this 20th century universe like we do

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,580
and being a bunch of weirdos,

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,380
it's easy to forget that.

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,880
But just wait until you know it was 3 days...

118
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
then you'll know what's important in life

119
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,420
Luckily, I haven't had to cross that particular bridge

120
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,020
but, that reminds me,

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,940
But that reminds me,

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,120
But that reminds me,

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,780
from the audience. Yes, oh, that would be perfect. If you could come up. I have a little

124
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:07,640
multimedia display here. And stand over here. Stand up front so the folks can see you. I

125
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,600
made this little chart myself at about two in the morning. Friends, my list of priorities

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,140
shifted. Now, most of us probably don't write down the ten most important things in our

127
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:30,040
lives. But I started doing that. And my priorities shifted again when I suddenly remembered what

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,040
had been left off the list. Now, these are ranked by immediacy of need. Number one, of

129
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,340
course, air breathing. That's something you often forget. Most people say, oh, the ten

130
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,620
most important things in life. Well, that must be food, sex, and sex.

131
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,360
Well, yeah, sure. When you're 20 years old, that sounds great. But really, let's get real.

132
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,920
The first thing you need is decent air. Number two would be not sex, but water drinking.

133
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,960
Because you can't live for another three hours, another half a day without water. In fact,

134
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,640
I could use a glass of water right now myself. Now, some people would think that number three

135
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,000
would be sex. But no, number three is peeing. To pee.

136
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,240
You can't even live. Once you drink the water, you've got to pee, right? Well, number four,

137
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:28,620
that must be sex. No, number four is food. So, that sounds boring. But remember, hot

138
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,840
pastrami sandwich. Number five was a toss-up. Was it sh**ping or sleeping? Well, I needed

139
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,460
sleep a lot more than I needed to take a sh**. So, I put sleep on top. But if you go down

140
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,000
one more, it's number six is sh**ping.

141
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,580
Number five was a toss-up. Was it sh**ping or sleeping? Well, I needed sleep a lot more

142
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,780
than I needed to take a sh**. So, I put it on. So here we are. Boıraly You Call IN R

143
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,160
SU borders

144
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,240
Here's what happened. I caught the mommy. Let's whoop the Buddhist.

145
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,520
That's the boy.

146
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,380
We had a COS in the sir before.

147
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,600
We've got a crazy boy here.

148
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,600


149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
that's a rock bo흥

150
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,240
he's got the reinst Paige

151
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,460
Oh...

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,000
He just came down the stairs and everything.

153
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,740
He got a

154
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,580
He just came down the stairs.

155
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,860
eating but had better soon. Alright now some of you have noticed something

156
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,820
missing from the list and that would be number eight, money! Notice that money

157
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,600
does follow slack but let's face it it's not interchangeable but it's damn close.

158
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,560
Number nine, the one you've all been waiting for,

159
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:45,200
FROP! FROP! Now some of you may not know, may not be familiar with subgenius

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,740
jargon but FROP is a Tibetan herb that Bob smokes. For some of you, you FROP

161
00:08:52,740 --> 00:09:00,700
might be booze or beer or pot or pills or rock and roll or TV or the government.

162
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't know but everybody needs their damn FROP. Now at this point the kids

163
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,540
are going, oh my god, I'm gonna go to jail. I'm gonna go to jail. I'm gonna go to jail.

164
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:14,220
Okay when is sex coming along? Well it must be number ten. Oh my god, ten!

165
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:25,280
Your back not hurting! Jesus Christ! You could go on down. Eleven and twelve are sex and Bob.

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,020
No longer even, oh and tax, holy sh**. Today's March 15th. I haven't done my corporate taxes yet.

167
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,400
Yes friends, sex and Bob are

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:53,080
no longer even in the top ten. My god! What is this world coming to? Well friends, I'm afraid that this list has been developed by pure untainted, cold, mathematical logic over a number of years.

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:01,520
And some might argue that FROP is too far down on the list or that it's a sad statement about our morals that it's on there at all.

170
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,380
But get real! The only reason that money is on the list at all is that you need the money to make a living.

171
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,020
And you need the money to get the FROP!

172
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:23,460
Anyway, plenty of you young fools are probably laughing that your back not hurting ranks above sex on my list.

173
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,220
But you'll see! Oh yes, you will see my friend.

174
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Well look, these games life. Can I have another enema please?

175
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,640


176
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,240
Oh, we're on the internet. Yes, we're on the internet. Amazing. Can I have another enema please? Yeah, these games will turn the...

177
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,720
Who really likes a drill of learning English into ZINGlish?

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:51,700
No promises. Or maybe Zwinglish. Maybe it's a way of bringing in Scandinavian occult religious forms. Very possibly.

179
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,600
With blocks? With blocks? Well, it's done. Yeah, actually it does deal with that.

180
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,720
Blocks and also peer groups and various other things like that.

181
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,360
It says here, how to improve your child's English now at your bookstore.

182
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,360
Or mail the coupon for your free examination account.

183
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,040
And then you can get a copy, which you may try out for a whole month.

184
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,360
My child is three and still not reading.

185
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,020
Still not reading? What can I do? What can you do?

186
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Beat it. Beat it. You tried that.

187
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,240
Beat out the rhythm with the drum, right?

188
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Salt Peter? Salt Peter? No.

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,560
Is that your name? Ephraim? Have you tried Salt Ephraim? Peter.

190
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,380
Marshall. Have you tried Salt Marshall? Yes. Marshall Salt Peter.

191
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,120
What we've done is when we beat the child, we take salt.

192
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,820
And show the child the word on the book.

193
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,420
If the child gets the word wrong, we put the salt in the wound.

194
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,220
Oh, that's terrible. That's a little thrill.

195
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,160
Zinglish. Yeah, it's zinglish.

196
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,640
It's ready.

197
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,800
Cat. Cat.

198
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,580
That was a C-A-T is cat. Cat.

199
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Ten minutes later, you show him the word.

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,040
And he just sits there. He doesn't know. He shakes a little.

201
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,660
So we have to hit him again. Then take the salt and put the salt in the wound. Cat.

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,940
Good. Sometimes he's just trying to hide it from us.

203
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,500
You're lucky.

204
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,820
You're lucky your city's been saved from three days of nameless terror because you paid your salt tax.

205
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,160
That's right. Yes.

206
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,940
This city yet unblemished because the blemish have yet to arrive.

207
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
Have you seen the tax collector? The salt tax collector? No, I haven't seen him.

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
This is a man dressed in a blue leather costume who comes knocking on the door.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,520
And I said, what is it? And he says, Richard. No, Richard is locked away.

210
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,500
And John wants his salt tax. John wants the salt tax. And I said, but I.

211
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,900
And he says, give me what is half of what you have in your shop.

212
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,840
And I am but a small joiner, so I have but little for them to take.

213
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,960
Then they commence to take from my kitchen, from my larder, from my pantry.

214
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,220
Yet but I have two pigs in the pen. Were I to give one to John, unto him, what must I say for Richard,

215
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,400
who doth language in yon jail back behind the Hans line?

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,940
Oh, one day we will rise up, Robin of Hoffman. He will come. He will save us.

217
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,220
Right now, yet not. It's Robin of Hoffman in the hills of the East Village.

218
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,160
Yes, mistress.

219
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,600
Collecting his men.

220
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,760
Yes, mistress.

221
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,260
His Tompkins Square warriors.

222
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,720
Yeah, the electric park. Right. See that? I love that place.

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
Welcome. You know, do you know the building where I finally got a room for myself in this town?

224
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,340
I finally got a room in a very nice apartment.

225
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,700
You've been over to the place. It's right at the corner of Vroom.

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,780
Oh, I am.

227
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,980
Yeah, Vroom. That's where I'm living.

228
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah, right.

229
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,340
It's a great place, man.

230
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,740
Is that near the?

231
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,580
I'm living right next door.

232
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,440
That's around the corner. I'm living right next door to the, why did you get water?

233
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,720
Oh, yeah.

234
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,480
You watch out, Peter. One day you'll get a place in Manhattan that'll even be worse.

235
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,620
That's right. That's true.

236
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Because those New Jersey places are not so hot.

237
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,060
They are though during the summer. They're incredibly hot.

238
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,580
Very hot.

239
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,220
Yeah, I lived in Garbage Heights, right? Right at the corner of Hell and oh.

240
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,380
Yeah, near.

241
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:47,740
That's right.

242
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,220
During Reconstruction.

243
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,280
That's right.

244
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,060
Joined the gun club out there.

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Oh, you did?

246
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,100
Yeah.

247
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,940
I went there and.

248
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,080
Get your head down, you fool.

249
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,340
Look, there's a postman over there with a grenade launcher.

250
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,760
Where? Over the keep town.

251
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,860
Where's registration? Over there by that copse.

252
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,480
That corpse?

253
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,240
Copse.

254
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,600
Right there where that column of smoke is rising.

255
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,860
Get your head down.

256
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
Just crawl on over there.

257
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,820
But it really gets noisy on election day. I'll tell you.

258
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,640
Then they bring out the white soldiers.

259
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,940
All the time we see nothing but the red men coming out. Red soldiers.

260
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,920
I say, bring on the white soldiers. No, not ready for them to move. You're just a pawn.

261
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,340
Well, don't talk to a rook that way. It's a rook. Society's rook.

262
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,400
Right, right. King Scam. Right to Queen Shuck Four.

263
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,720
Queen Sleaze.

264
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,960
But the knight.

265
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,120
Bishop's Dodo 12.

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,580
The knight is a Bonwit window dresser. Tries to create sex heaven in those windows night after night.

267
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,200
That being him.

268
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,700
It's a great show though.

269
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,280
It's a great city.

270
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,460
It's a great place to live.

271
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,300
The Firesign Theatre from the collection Dope Humor of the Seventies.

272
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,220
And now from the Dobstown Mirror.

273
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,320
With lovely background music by Cyberchun.

274
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,340
Truth outweighs fact.

275
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,080
Look hard at the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

276
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Keep staring until one of you blinks.

277
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,020
Whispering voices inside.

278
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,440
What musicians do you like who are also in your religion?

279
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,720
And what musicians do you like who are not?

280
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,640
Why aren't they all in or all out?

281
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,940
Aren't beliefs and preferences supposed to be the same thing?

282
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,080
Maybe to some believers beliefs and preferences are supposed to be the same thing.

283
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,840
In the Church of the Subgenius we say,

284
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Believe me out of it.

285
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,120
Once you've paid your money to Bob, we actively don't care what you do or believe.

286
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,580
Many are never ready for that freedom of choice.

287
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,900
But I'm an atheist.

288
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,020
Okay, we get it.

289
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,520
You too.

290
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,680
Are you ready to be the kind of free thinker who thinks freely?

291
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,560
Or are only the approved heresies going to cross your teeth?

292
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,920
When you join the Church of the Subgenius, two things happen.

293
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:40,220
First, everything you like becomes part of your clench as a moral good, an aesthetic treasure, and a self-consistent spiritual truth system.

294
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,120
Second, everything you don't like becomes bad and evil and is a false prophet to be cast out.

295
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,060
Who wouldn't want that kind of slack?

296
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,760
And oh yes, you do get to ride on a flying saucer to leave Earth forever on July 5th.

297
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,700
1998.

298
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,180
Praise Bob and thanks to the Dobbs Docktown Mirrard.

299
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:15,560
And now this, from the Subgenius movie, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, by Sandy Boone.

300
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,780
Here's Paul Mavridis.

301
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,800
We actually are a religion.

302
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,940
You know, that seems like an art piece, that seems like a religion,

303
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,680
that seems like performance art, that seems like a joke, that seems like a religion.

304
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,660
Simply because we're involved in something that is funny,

305
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,480
we don't believe that for that reason we should be taken any less seriously.

306
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,240
We started getting invited to things like art museums.

307
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
They thought it was performance art.

308
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,260
Ivan Stang was approached by a fellow in San Francisco who wanted to put on a subgenius party in San Francisco.

309
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,800
And so we pictured some storefront or a loft or something with a hundred people.

310
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,560
And we went, yeah, we'll do that.

311
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,060
And we came back to the second meeting and Tom was all excited.

312
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,840
He had gone out and rented a 900-seat theater for two nights.

313
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,420
Cisco tonight is the location of the first international subgenius world survival crusade.

314
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
TV stations picked up on the show.

315
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,260
It all began with the book of the subgenius.

316
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,460
And the church's deity, Bob Dobbs.

317
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,300
I was preparing tacos one day for my children.

318
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,500
Now Bob.

319
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,040
The face appeared and it's Bob.

320
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:45,140
The night of Slack Show in San Francisco in 1984 was the first time anybody had put any money into a subgenius show.

321
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,160
And flew several people from Dallas and other cities into San Francisco.

322
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
And there was even a paid stage man.

323
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,920
And there was a stage manager.

324
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,820
There were people building sets just for that show.

325
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,360
About half the people here will have a great time.

326
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,580
The rest of them will probably run for the exits.

327
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,380
The one thing none of us were at that point and still aren't are professionals.

328
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,460
And I knew that nobody had ever been in front of an audience as big as the one we were hopefully going to draw.

329
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,300
I remember Friday night going out around the corner of the Victoria Theater.

330
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,480
And the line went out up to Mission and around the corner.

331
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,100
I almost threw up because I thought, we're not showmen.

332
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
These people are paying $7.50.

333
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,740
It looked like it was going to be a disaster.

334
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,220
As people were coming in, we had a galvanized tub of evil looking Kool-Aid.

335
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,060
Some people would come over and they would take it eagerly.

336
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,320
The Dixie cups, just like they did in Jonestown.

337
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,400
And they would drink it and they would come over and say, how long till I get off?

338
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,420
And they thought it was like Kool-Aid.

339
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
Acid Kool-Aid.

340
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,420
Right.

341
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,700
And it was like, oh, about 20 minutes.

342
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,680
Of course, some people were very nervous.

343
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,360
The real question was, is this cyanide or LSD?

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,500
We made sure it was like non-sweetened so we wouldn't kill any diabetics.

345
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:39,380
It was a great, it was really the first event where a lot of people got together and said, hey, we're all subgeniuses and rubbing elbows.

346
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,720
The Night of Slack ran for two nights and was surprisingly successful.

347
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,500
It was the first show that Bob Dobbs himself ever showed up at.

348
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,460
We were not expecting that.

349
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,380
We weren't expecting that at all.

350
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:04,420
He walked out on stage and puzzling evidence, Doug Wallman runs out and shoots him with a handgun.

351
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,320
Right in front of everybody.

352
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,120
Oh my God, Bob was killed that night.

353
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,580
It was so sad.

354
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,040
We were coming from the airport and I got to thinking,

355
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,240
if you want to sell a religion, you have to kill the deity.

356
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,100
That's how you do it.

357
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,400
So I shot Bob thinking the thing would just take off.

358
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,060
The audience went berserk.

359
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,460
But the funny thing was the cops didn't care.

360
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,640
Nobody cared.

361
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,500
Afterwards, people were having drinks.

362
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,340
The band was dancing on the corpse of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

363
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,740
It was this chance to just, you know, sing and dance and be crazy.

364
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,120
It was really, really, really, really fun.

365
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,840
Science does not remove the terror of the gods.

366
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,380
We can't do much about those evil gods from the other side of the cosmos.

367
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,900
But enough of this.

368
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,700
You don't want to hear about this.

369
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Who is the right hand man of Bob?

370
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,320
Who sits on the right hand side of Bob?

371
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,860
None other than the Reverend Ivan Stang.

372
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm not here to talk about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

373
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,700
One of the things that we like to talk about

374
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,840
was how the Church of the Subgenius would allow you to control your own time.

375
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,020
Now, can we have the house lights up a little bit?

376
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,480
We decided to have our producer be our plant in the audience.

377
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,440
There's a main doctrine of the church called time control.

378
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,940
Many people don't know it. Would you take your watch off?

379
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,740
It's a nice watch.

380
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,480
Here it is.

381
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,220
All right.

382
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,420
Break it!

383
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,100
And then before he presumably could be stopped,

384
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,000
Ivan put the watch down on the concrete block

385
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,780
and not just smashed the watch,

386
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,280
but broke the concrete block into pieces.

387
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,720
And then what happened was the unexpected.

388
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,260
We were going to move on to the next thing,

389
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,360
but people in the audience suddenly ran up to us

390
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,060
and started taking their watches off and throwing them on stage.

391
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,920
Some of them were really nice watches,

392
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,620
but the audience demanded that we smash them all.

393
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,840
Doug had us sit up there smashing one after another.

394
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,400
So there it was.

395
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,120
The audience was ready to take it way beyond what we were doing.

396
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,960
I thought, this thing goes farther than I ever imagined.

397
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
We had to run for the exits,

398
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,800
but only in order to get you this report on time tonight.

399
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,720
However, if you're the kind of person who likes to pull the wool over your own eyes,

400
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,480
church is in session again tomorrow at 8 p.m.

401
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,240
That was great.

402
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,700
Cheaper. Better.

403
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
When I think of people who in the past have done me wrong,

404
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,180
I don't think they're thinking of me.

405
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,900
They've forgotten what they did or thought what they did was right.

406
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,940
No, it's just me.

407
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:42,940


408
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,000
Me thinking about it, and nobody else.

409
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,600
If I stopped thinking about it,

410
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,320
not only would the event be in the past,

411
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,540
but even its memory would be in the past,

412
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,960
as if it never happened at all.

413
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,080
Good thing I keep reviewing what happened,

414
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,260
keeping it fresh in my mind.

415
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,380
Otherwise, poof, it's gone forever,

416
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,100
and with no added effort.

417
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,820
Every wish is equal to every other wish.

418
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,920
Making a wish for winning a million dollars,

419
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,660
in the lottery,

420
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,560
is equal to making a wish for winning ten million dollars,

421
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,340
in the lottery.

422
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,340
Or five dollars.

423
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,560
All wishes cost you the same amount.

424
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,160
Wish away those tightly clutched bad memories.

425
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,520
There is not a reason to be stingy or modest with your wishes.

426
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,940
Don't be wishy-washy.

427
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,920
Thank you, Dobbs.town mirror.

428
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,400
And now this.

429
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,820
Ah, the scrotum guy.

430
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,140
What's the name, the scrotal twins, or whatever their name is?

431
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,940
Oh, the back thunder.

432
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,020
That's what they often call it in psychic phenomena.

433
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,520
Back thunder, the pyroflatulator.

434
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,920
No, that means that the times ellipses

435
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,760
are kind of like melting away.

436
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,800
They're refracturing into each other.

437
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,300
That means that tomorrow may actually be...

438
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,380
The time intersection.

439
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,100
Right, tomorrow may actually be today.

440
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,100
The time intersection.

441
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,940
And so it was spelled.

442
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,680
So it was.

443
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,060
Time was done.

444
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,200
Back to that first hour.

445
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,480
That purple bucket monitor.

446
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,260
Emperor Stingy took out his wallet

447
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,740
and decided to end it or begin it all.

448
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,220
Sure, it could just be another stupid subgenius revival.

449
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,140
Or...

450
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,760
It could be the time intersection.

451
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,960
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full of like these weird little jelly beans

452
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,780
and things like that.

453
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,520
The potato man and the thumb people will come together.

454
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,020
Some of them are Charlie and Bob.

455
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,840
For Bob.

456
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,260
A cacophony of beautiful...

457
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,380
Well, my friends,

458
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,200
uh,

459
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,260
uh,

460
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,740
for years now,

461
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,800
Reverend One Encantabyte has been kind of a...

462
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,620
a co-writer of a lot of my rants.

463
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,480
And he's co-written his own rants with himself many times.

464
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,460
But here's a...

465
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,000
There's a new guy who's thrown out one-liners at an incredible pitch.

466
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,540
He's done this before.

467
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,300
He just sent me another...

468
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,440
big list of one-liners that,

469
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,120
I guess,

470
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,660
if one took the time,

471
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,460
could turn all of these into one big rant.

472
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,740
If you used connective tissue.

473
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,580
Uh...

474
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,220
Hmm...

475
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,740
For instance...

476
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,720
Even the book of the subgenius describes Bob

477
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,040
as a short-duration personal savior.

478
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,880
You might say

479
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,800
he's the wham-bam thank-you-ma'am of gods.

480
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,700
But what is a subgenius?

481
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,920
A subgenius is someone who says yes to a job now

482
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,640
and learns how to do it later.

483
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,220
You may be dumb,

484
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,560
but at least you're smart about it.

485
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,040
There are no fools among you.

486
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,140
You are among the fools.

487
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,320
If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say...

488
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,340
If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say...

489
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,560
I'd have just made myself another dollar.

490
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,720
But money is dirty,

491
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,840
so let Bob use his dust-buster on your wallet.

492
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,260
Now remember,

493
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,160
when invoking the name of Bob in the written word,

494
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,900
you must never forget the quotes around his name,

495
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,480
which differentiate him from all of the ordinary Bobs of the world.

496
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,620
And when invoking the name of Bob in the spoken word,

497
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,200
you must at least mentally infer them.

498
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Also, never use smart quotes.

499
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,520
For Bob only speaks in dumb quotes.

500
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,640
Perception of the truth is more important than the truth.

501
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,300
True or false?

502
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,340
I only believe in two things.

503
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,820
Bob and the fact that he doesn't exist.

504
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,580
Now don't you know that all things weird are part of the conspiracy?

505
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,820
It's them trying to out-weird us.

506
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,560
We're getting out-weirded when we should be getting weirded out.

507
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,880
And you know, if you say the word weird enough times,

508
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,200
over and over again,

509
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,200
it starts to sound weird.

510
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,540
Thank you, Reverend Elvis Martini.

511
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,000
And CyberChump for the music in the background.

512
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,040
And now this.

513
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,220
This being Dr. Hal Robbins,

514
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,140
guesting on the old TV show Conspiracy Zone,

515
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,200
with host Kevin Nealon.

516
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,780
More Zone.

517
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,040
We're talking about secret societies,

518
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,780
and I'd like to introduce a material witness.

519
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,240
He's the master keeper of church secrets for the Church of Subgenius.

520
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,480
Say hey to Hal Robbins.

521
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:19,980
Joe!

522
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,360
Big crowd here for Hal, huh?

523
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,660
I see you have some fans here, Hal.

524
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,320
Yes, you can see the Church of the Subgenius

525
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,480
isn't all that secret,

526
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
because many of them are clearly in the audience.

527
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,940
Well, how does your church view these other secret societies, Hal?

528
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,400
It's all really the same conspiracy, according to us.

529
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,100
We call it the conspiracy, or the con for short.

530
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,360
Oh, I see. I see.

531
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
What are your reactions to our panel here?

532
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,840
Well, I found it interesting.

533
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,020
Any discussion of masonry is interesting.

534
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,620
It's not generally known that Buzz Aldrin of Apollo 11

535
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,680
actually brought a masonic flag to the moon.

536
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,320
Yeah, he did a ritual.

537
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,260
Well, I don't know if he did a ritual.

538
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,660
He did. He did a ritual on the moon.

539
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,580
But that happened.

540
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,920
Why didn't we see the flag?

541
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,900
Well, they decided it might scare people or confuse them,

542
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,320
somewhat like this show.

543
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,880
I would think so.

544
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,600
Well, you know, you are subgenius.

545
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,940
Yes, I'm one of them.

546
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,580
How many people in your church?

547
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,840
Well, it's not generally known,

548
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,600
because they tend not to be joiners.

549
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,360
And they don't usually get together,

550
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,920
except on special occasions.

551
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,960
And how often is there a special occasion?

552
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,640
Well, every now and then we have devivals, as we call them.

553
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,180
Devivals?

554
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,660
We perform healings and sickenings and other things like that.

555
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,060
Pretty successful with that?

556
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,760
Oh, yes. We sicken a great number of people.

557
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,820
You sicken me.

558
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,240
Well, it may be contagious.

559
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,240
Do you guys wear hats at all?

560
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,940
Oh, we have all kinds of headgear that we wear.

561
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,340
Headgear?

562
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,260
Okay.

563
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,620
You mean, when you say headgear, you're talking about like, what?

564
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,520
Well, the fez, which the masons and the shriners like,

565
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,940
and pointy hats that we have.

566
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,000
We have hats of all geometrical shapes.

567
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,800
You're the master keeper of the church?

568
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,500
The master of church secrets, they call me.

569
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:17,940
Yeah.

570
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,560
People tend to lose them.

571
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,260
They get misplaced, and so I gather them up.

572
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,080
It sounds very disorganized, your whole organization.

573
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,080
Well, it is disorganized.

574
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,380
You see, since subgeniuses, each subgenius is under his own genius, under his own spirit,

575
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,760
and not under the control of somebody else.

576
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,100
The idea is that the con, the conspiracy, wants to take away your slack.

577
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,940
The subgenius must have slack.

578
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,640
And it wants to sell you false slack.

579
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,800
It wants to make you work for a living.

580
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,460
It wants to make you do what they want.

581
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,240
And slack is the opposite of tension.

582
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,900
It's leisure, the basis of culture.

583
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,000
It's the time, the slack time, in which everything important in your life is done.

584
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,320
And that's what the con wants to take from you.

585
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,480
And now more from Reverend Elvis Martini's little collection of rant bits.

586
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,420
They say you should live life like you're going to die tomorrow.

587
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,220
But I prefer to live life like I'm never going to die.

588
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,460
I personally, friends, say, why not both?

589
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,060
And then he comes along and basically says that too.

590
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:33,080
Live life like you're never going to die, but also as if you could easily be killed.

591
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,200
A nihilist, an existentialist, and an absurdist are having a conversation.

592
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,260
The nihilist says, life has no meaning.

593
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,380
The existentialist says, life has no apparent meaning.

594
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,740
The absurdist says,

595
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,320
apparent meaning has no life.

596
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,240
We firmly believe that procrastination is the only way to get things done.

597
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:12,180
That and radical centrism, where you believe only the most extreme nonsense from both sides.

598
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,400
Bob, frop, give me, for I have had a lack of sin.

599
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,440
One of the reasons I got the boot the first time around was that I was taking it all way too seriously.

600
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,380
For I was without slack.

601
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,620
After all, the subgenius doesn't join in order to be lectured.

602
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,740
The subgenius reluctantly hangs around in order to be told that which she or he has already long suspected.

603
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,160
That they are right!

604
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,440
Folks, I have a Bob bumper sticker on the back end of my car for two days.

605
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,660
I have two reasons.

606
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:01,320
Firstly, to serve as a reminder that sometimes people follow Bob a little too closely.

607
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,880
The other is so that for every person who gets behind me, I can say, I'm better than you.

608
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,580
Because it doesn't matter whether or not that's actually true.

609
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,520
The important thing is that it's being said.

610
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,940
There's a good reason that Bob is supposed to be a short duration personal savior.

611
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,420
Anything longer than that, and it might all go straight to his head.

612
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,260
Because the moment you get Bob, you've got him wrong.

613
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,580
It's like Zen mixed with Bullshit, which is exactly what Zen is.

614
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,340
Funny thing is, there's wisdom in Bullshit.

615
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
There are smart ways to be dumb.

616
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,920
Thank you, Reverend Elvis Martini, for those bits and pieces of rants.

617
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,180
Perhaps into one big rant.

618
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,620
And thanks to Cyberduck, uh, CyberChump for the music.

619
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,500
I use Cyberduck for something else.

620
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,780
You see, the first subgenius, the first truly slack-filled man was J.R. Bob Dobbs.

621
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,520
This is his image on my lapel here.

622
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,200
Yeah, and what's below that?

623
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,780
Oh, well, that's a little rocket that is a badge of the subgenius radio show that we do out in the hinterlands.

624
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
And what's right below that?

625
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,740
Oh, that's tomato sauce, I'm sorry.

626
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,240
Either that or lint, I think.

627
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,080
How many lints?

628
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,340
Well, you know, is it hard to get into a secret society?

629
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,500
If I wanted to get into a secret society, how would I do it?

630
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,420
I'd just feel stupid for sending the 30 bucks.

631
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,040
You'd just walk on the door.

632
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,360
You could go down to Langley and say, I want to join the CIA, and they would probably...

633
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,500
I don't want to join the CIA. I want to go where I can get a hat.

634
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,180
Where you can get some slack, in other words.

635
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,780
Yeah, or some slack.

636
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,560
Well, you can join, but what you can't do immediately is get up into the upper echelons.

637
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,840
You can get into the winking, towel-snapping, back-slapping, little car-riding part.

638
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,400
But you can't get up into the upper echelons.

639
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,480
You can't get up into the part that is starting to interfere with the politics of nations.

640
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,540
Well, Mark, you're an expert on secret societies.

641
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,360
I am not. I wouldn't call myself an expert, you know.

642
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,900
But I think that the best thing you can do is start your own secret society.

643
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,460
Yeah.

644
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,580
How do you know I haven't already? Huh?

645
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,680
How do you know I haven't already?

646
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,420
Because who would join it, man?

647
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,440
It's very secret. It's very, very secret.

648
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,800
Some people can keep a secret.

649
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,220
Yeah, I'm the guy.

650
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,920
And you're right, the Freemasons would like me, because I can't keep a secret.

651
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,320
Okay.

652
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,380
The secret that the Freemasons want is for what is hidden to be revealed.

653
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:26,660
Right.

654
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,740
And to that degree, this show is an agent of Freemasonry.

655
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,060
Yeah.

656
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,880
As well as subgenius, because we're getting all this propaganda out, too.

657
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,520
So you remember whether you like it or not.

658
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,880
All right. Well, I don't want to be a slack, so I...

659
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,200
No, you do want slack.

660
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
I do want slack. Okay.

661
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,100
Not my secret society. We don't take no slack from nobody.

662
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,620
But we need money, so we're going to take a look at a commercial.

663
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,140
When we come back, we're going to take some questions from our audience.

664
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:03,020
Okay, friends, we've talked about Eyelash, the new book of subgenius...

665
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:09,380
Well, it's the first subgenius science fiction novel by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley.

666
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,080
We've published science fiction before, but it was always short stories and anthologies.

667
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,420
Lonesome Cowboy's Dave's Neighbor World is a science fiction novel,

668
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,860
but it's not subgenius-centric.

669
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,720
Eyelash is, very much so.

670
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,420
In fact, here's a section where this...

671
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:42,620
Okay, our two main characters, Elif and Ty, have been forced into working for an Exist in outer space,

672
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,320
doing a kind of a job, and they're getting a bit depressed.

673
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,720
The Exist name is Russ.

674
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,220
And this Exist...

675
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,080
happens to take the physical form of a beautiful Earth woman.

676
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,600
Russ...

677
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,740
To his surprise, Russ came to his aid.

678
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,540
Would you like me to tell you about Planet X?

679
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,180
Elif managed to conceal his glee beneath a chintzy drape of low-level hostility

680
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,460
before asking himself why she wanted to change the subject so readily.

681
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,560
I suppose so, he said, wondering how much of it would be factual.

682
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,880
Tell me of your homeworld.

683
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,740
It's what you would call a gas giant.

684
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,040
No sun, mostly frozen methane.

685
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,120
We live in tunnels carved in the core.

686
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,400
If you could survive at that pressure and temperature, you wouldn't see anything.

687
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,580
Very little free energy of any wavelength.

688
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,900
We prefer it that way. It's much safer.

689
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,540
Terrible things happen on planets with too much activity.

690
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,480
X-quakes, storms and the like.

691
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,600
Somewhere above, perhaps three levels up near the surface of the eyelash,

692
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,640
a chort slammed into the generator wall, making it shake,

693
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,520
metal shavings raining down and striking sparks off the exposed cables on the way.

694
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,300
How the hell did life even begin under those conditions? Elif asked.

695
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,180
Eriley, she says, oh, we got our start somewhere else.

696
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,240
It doesn't matter.

697
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,500
It doesn't matter where.

698
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,820
It was destroyed long ago.

699
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,020
Sucks to lose your home planet.

700
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,280
I'm sorry, I guess.

701
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,040
Don't be.

702
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,460
We destroyed it ourselves.

703
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,680
In fact, we had it carved into slices and sold.

704
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:36,200
We've always been commercially astute compared to the lesser races.

705
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,080
The lesser races, friends.

706
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,420
Elif was thinking of cold corridors carved from methane ice, completely black and silent,

707
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,540
with awful things dragging themselves along the polished floors,

708
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,260
sneering soundlessly at each other as they passed,

709
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,140
thousands of miles of darkness above, pressing down endlessly.

710
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,680
I'm not sure I like the idea of living there, but we wouldn't be living on Planet X, would we?

711
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,880
Or in it, right?

712
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,620
Of course not.

713
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
We don't allow the lesser races anywhere near our homeworld.

714
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,400
And besides, I'm sure you've worked out by now that,

715
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:18,400


716
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,100
the whole tribe going to the promised land thing is an idea left over from the hundreds of thousands of years

717
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,780
that primates spent as nomads.

718
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,160
There was an uncomfortable pause while Russ let this sink in,

719
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,800
and Elif tried in vain to put a positive spin on it.

720
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,700
Oh, don't look so worried.

721
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,540
We value the subgenii.

722
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,080
Life won't be so bad on the reservation.

723
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,380
There's always a use for a good subgenii.

724
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
And I'm sure you've seen this set of prehensile monkey fingers,

725
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,920
even if they did evolve primarily for picking peanuts out of poop.

726
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,480
And that was from Eyelash by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley,

727
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:08,720
published by Subgenius Foundation, see subgenius.com or Amazon.

728
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,080
But we prefer...

729
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,340
Well, I signed the copies you buy from us,

730
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,740
because I did the foreword.

731
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,300
The music in the background, by the way, is by CyberChump.

732
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,640
Their Moment of Perfect Happiness is the name of this double CD.

733
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,320
It's a great rug for reading stuff in the background, don't you think?

734
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,820
And now this.

735
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,340
That was an amazing evening,

736
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,120
and also I met my first crazy subgenius.

737
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,500
This was the first person I ran into

738
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,420
who took it all the wrong way.

739
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,820
He came up to me after that second show,

740
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,140
and he was livid.

741
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,720
The people in Dallas that did this thing,

742
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,600
and Bob, when they find out you're just making a Sonny and Cher comedy show out of it,

743
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,860
they're gonna kill you.

744
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,940
This is terrible.

745
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,100
Look in this book here.

746
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,040
It says stop what you're doing right now.

747
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,040
This is serious.

748
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,380
This is not a fan club.

749
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,400
This is not a joke.

750
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,960
And I said, dude, I wrote all that stuff.

751
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,920
Me and Philo got high one night,

752
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,920
and we wrote all this crap.

753
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,680
Give me a break.

754
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,440
It really shook me up.

755
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,240
It was a little bit scary.

756
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,120
We realized some crazy people are attracted to this.

757
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,640
You know, the ones that are like,

758
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,640
where's Bob?

759
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,040
Where's, no, where's the real Bob?

760
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,720
I think what starts off like a joke,

761
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,720
a few, you know, kind of believers

762
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,400
who want their life to have a little more meaning than it does,

763
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,180
or they feel it does,

764
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,000
and then they get a little,

765
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,760
too gung-ho,

766
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,920
they want to adhere a little too much.

767
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,140
They start believing a little too much,

768
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
and, you know, and then here we go.

769
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,320
You are playing with fire.

770
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,600
And the idea of taking fire

771
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,460
and doing what the subgenius did,

772
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,640
which is setting off fireworks,

773
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,180
it's really beautiful.

774
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,380
It's really fun.

775
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,200
And every second of that,

776
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,940
just a little bit of gas,

777
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,300
a little bit of gasoline,

778
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,720
and it'll tear your face off.

779
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:26,320
There are religions that were originally intended to be jokes,

780
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,240
and then they turned into gangs,

781
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,840
you know, into mafias.

782
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:36,720
I'm here to offer you an opportunity to know the truth

783
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,480
so that if you can connect with it,

784
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,660
then you might survive.

785
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,400
It's kind of a horrifying moment when we realize that,

786
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,820
you know, we could probably pick up 300 people randomly

787
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,180
from anywhere who would pledge their lives to us

788
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,520
if we asked them to.

789
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,880
I suspect that some of the people

790
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,780
who call themselves subgenius

791
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,640
were actually replacing their childhood religion with this.

792
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,580
And that wasn't my worldview,

793
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,680
but when I saw people do that,

794
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,720
it was a little scary.

795
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,840
I guess I was angry at everyone.

796
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,020
I'd been treated pretty s***ty my entire life by folks.

797
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,600
Their message appealed to me.

798
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:30,900
The traditional exchange is that you take responsibility for them.

799
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,020
They want you to tell them what to do.

800
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,620
And this was the kind of power we didn't want.

801
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,040
It was the exact opposite of what we were aiming for,

802
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,700
which was to remove people.

803
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,240
We were trying to get people from that kind of a hook.

804
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,120
There are people who really want to join this cult

805
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,160
and want it to be everything it says it is,

806
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,460
and then when they find out that it's not anything it says it is,

807
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,360
they get really mad.

808
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,320
No talking laughing now!

809
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,480
You've heard our phrase,

810
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,520
s*** them if they can't take a joke.

811
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,840
This is important to us.

812
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,460
Just when we think you might get a handle on,

813
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,780
oh, it's a collaborative network of artists all over the country,

814
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,640
that's all it is.

815
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,420
Oh, no, that's not what it is.

816
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,780
It's really a secretly sort of a subversive organization.

817
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,240
No, no, it's not really that.

818
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,840
It's just a bunch of drunk guys in Dallas trying to freak people out.

819
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,220
You either got the joke or you didn't.

820
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,580
And you got the joke instantly or you didn't.

821
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,760
Occasionally people will call us out on that whole s***

822
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,360
if they can't take a joke thing.

823
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,480
It's like, well, that just excuses everything.

824
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,160
No, it's just funny.

825
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,260
When was the last time you gave a straight answer?

826
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,080
Well, these are all...

827
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,920
We don't care whether they get the joke or not.

828
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,280
Half of them can't.

829
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,180
We're trying to make you laugh,

830
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,120
but also maybe shock you a little bit with our irreverence.

831
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,300
And you may think it's funny, we hope you do,

832
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,420
but if you don't, you shouldn't punish us,

833
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,400
because we are trying to deliver medicine of a sort.

834
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,700
And if you can't take the joke, then please go f*** yourself.

835
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,240
Nick Offerman was the master winger

836
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,540
and woodworker there from Sandy K. Boone's documentary

837
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,340
J.R. Bob-Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

838
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,360
now streaming on everything except Netflix, apparently.

839
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,640
Voices you heard in that segment include

840
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,640
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stack,

841
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,740
Dr. Philo Drummond,

842
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,200
Paul Mavridis,

843
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,540
Richard Linklater,

844
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,620
Reverend Penn Gillette,

845
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,960
Dr. Howell,

846
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,280
Reverend Kelly Cash,

847
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,940
Dr. Legume,

848
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,020
and Nurse Vicki.

849
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:39,880
And others.

850
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,600
You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future.

851
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,820
The 420 will be 500.

852
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,100
You know, I brought a banana, but I can't find it.

853
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,880
I lost it somewhere and I'm hungry now.

854
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,580
The show is just going on and on and my hunger is...

855
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,380
Parting is one of the best things to do for your brain.

856
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,280
Really?

857
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,620
The show is, yeah, I know.

858
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,560
If you listen to this show, you are smarter by 23.5%.

859
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,260
I like to do good things for my brain.

860
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,460
I like to give my brain a good massage.

861
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,060
Do you? Are you a break thinker?

862
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,660
One of those shiatsu massages.

863
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,200
Just open up my skull.

864
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,240
Yeah.

865
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,080
And start kneading the gray matter.

866
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,940
Uh-huh.

867
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,880
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?

868
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,300
Yeah.

869
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,560
So...

870
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,600
I don't use any fancy cutting tools.

871
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,000
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade.

872
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,860
I don't...

873
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,040
I hear somebody's cell phone making a weird...

874
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,820
That weird buzz.

875
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,880
Yeah, you know who that is.

876
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,320
That's my breathing.

877
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,000
Hear it?

878
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,740
That's my air tube.

879
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,740
Oh, okay.

880
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,980
That's the government listening to this show and all the other shows on KPJ.

881
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,220
Are you still in that iron lung?

882
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,920
I've upgraded to the new plastic lung.

883
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:56,940
Oh, okay.

884
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,380
One of those new fangled things.

885
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,380
Says Reverend Elvis Martini,

886
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,000
a super subgenius would not be a super genius.

887
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,640
It's the sub part that would be considered super.

888
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,980
And what is super sub if not extraordinarily sub?

889
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,420
Perhaps the term subpar genius would be more appropriate.

890
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,520
Subgenii, it is known, have been far more likely, at least in the past,

891
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,300
to suffer attacks from other subgeniuses than from pinks.

892
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,980
Other subgenii at least think so.

893
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,340
They think they know what it means to be a subgenius.

894
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,840
A pink has no clue and therefore no dog in the fight.

895
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,380
Jail Dobbs!

896
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,940
Because it's only slightly less trendy to hate Bob than it is to love him.

897
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,700
Bob lived so that we may die.

898
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,660
Stop opening your minds.

899
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,300
Start opening your wallets.

900
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,660
The conspiracy is an erection.

901
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,960
And Bob is a subgenius.

902
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,540
Bob is the spit in your hand.

903
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,900
Anyone who says they know what the meaning of life is

904
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,360
probably wants to sell you something.

905
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,140
And anyone who says that there is no meaning of life

906
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,160
probably wants to steal something from you.

907
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,800
Bob doesn't get clean.

908
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,680
He accumulates dirt until it starts to sheen.

909
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,960
Bob gets so filthy that the grime takes on the grime.

910
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,200
He becomes a shape of slacks, a shirt and a tie.

911
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,080
The con, Reverend Elvis Martini says here,

912
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,700
is the part of human nature that suggests you should go along with the ride

913
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,360
no matter how evil or intellectually dishonest it may be.

914
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,380
It tells everyone that you should go along because, because.

915
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,960
The exes have been with us for a long time.

916
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,800
They have been withholding aid to the earth for decades

917
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,140
in order to pressure the church into announcing

918
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,080
that it's investigating a conflict of interest.

919
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,060
Bob himself sells drilling equipment.

920
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,240
And every ex day is just a drill.

921
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,460
Nooooooooooo!

922
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,720
And what else is here from Reverend Elvis Martini?

923
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,240
You can't spell conspiracy without piracy.

924
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,920
Bob do don't, and Bob don't do.

925
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,360
I think this one's meant sarcastically.

926
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:58,800
A true sign of intelligence and independent thinking is talking about how mindless and sheep-like everybody else is.

927
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,800
It's the best way to let everyone know that you're not like anyone.

928
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:14,580
Yep, that's right, those independent thinkers who all call everybody else sheeple while wearing the same hat.

929
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,160
Thank you Elvis Martini for those random bits and pieces.

930
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,940
Thank you CyberChump for the excellent background music.

931
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,980
Non-distracting, but very pleasant and trippy.

932
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,560
And Price.

933
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,060
Bob.

934
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,340

936

942
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:00,940


943
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,760
Answer in service.

944
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,240
Of whom I'm neither neither rain nor snow.

945
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,780
You know, of course, you can't say half of what he says here on KPF.

946
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,280
Yep.

947
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,220
9-4-1-1.

948
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,300
This is the bastion of free speech.

949
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,540
And for that reason, we watch.

950
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,900
We watch to make sure it is only the right speech.

951
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,160
To make sure.

952
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,480
This is America.

953
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,900
Plus, I read in that book over there, there's things you can't say.

954
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,840
On program independent info.

955
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,720
Yeah, it's in there.

956
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,000
It's written down.

957
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,040
Because the lawyers swarm all over KPFA and try to close it down.

958
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:39,400
Right.

959
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,600
Although that'll happen from inside Pacifica anyway.

960
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,720
So you must listen to KPFA and find out more about all the crazy stuff that's going on.

961
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,220
The dialogue on the...

962
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,560
KPFA is going to need your help.

963
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,540
And that's going to be the last thing we'll worry about here.

964
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,520
I can hear you.

965
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,440
It'll be more like giant armed goons coming in with big...

966
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,660
Big pictures.

967
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,080
Big giant...

968
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,560
Big pictures.

969
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,460
... hairy cockroaches with spider limbs and pitchforks.

970
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,400
And they'll show the big pictures to everybody.

971
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,800
And big giant pictures.

972
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:15,100
And we'll point at the pictures and say, see, now, if you had a cockroach, you could do that too.

973
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,480
But unfortunately, you're...

974
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,720
Wow.

975
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,120
You're...

976
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,720
It's a show.

977
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,460
You're on the show instead.

978
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,080
You are on the show instead.

979
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,060
You are on the show.

980
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,640
Well...

981
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,440
And this week, it's easy not to listen, right?

982
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,600
It's easy, yeah.

983
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,540
Last week, she couldn't stop listening.

984
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,260
No, yeah.

985
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,260
She couldn't go to sleep.

986
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,340
You could throw the show away tonight.

987
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,960
Well, I didn't really want to be on the show.

988
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,900
I just wanted to...

989
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,040
Yeah, I don't blame you.

990
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,440
I wanted to find out what that thing was that you were talking about.

991
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:42,840
But...

992
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,700
No, they always want something, friends.

993
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,780
And we all want more time.

994
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,060
Time on the show.

995
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:56,460
Except she didn't.

996
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,880
The show from KPFA Berkeley.

997
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,900
The puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

998
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,860
Normally Dr. Howell.

999
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,320
Dr. Philodrumon just then.

1000
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:12,940
You know, that show has been around longer than the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1001
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,220
Which is what you're listening to right now.

1002
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,680
And...

1003
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:25,760
Friends, let's let this old soulful tearjerker song about weirdos take us out from our biggest

1004
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,980
weirdo radio heroes of all, the Firesign Theater.

1005
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,760
Where's that Kleenex box?

1006
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,160
Hey, over there in the corner, one of our dearest old friends.

1007
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,780
Nick Danger.

1008
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,780
That's right, friends.

1009
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,720
Nick Danger and Silver Beetle's with you tonight.

1010
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:45,120
Hi, everybody.

1011
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,180
That's right.

1012
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,660
And my little old friend, Nick Danger.

1013
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:47,660


1014
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:47,660


1015
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,600
He's a lady, girl, Danger.

1016
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,640
We have a song here we'd like to sing for you.

1017
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:58,580
My friends are all crazy, they're mad as loons.

1018
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,360
They talk all at once, it's a hundred tunes.

1019
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:10,060
You hear them at night as you push down the highway.

1020
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,980
Like loons landing at some exclusive loon flyway.

1021
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:29,380
And oh, can it be true, y'all feel free to just join in, that there's no rest for the

1022
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,920
wicked, no peace for us two.

1023
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,500
Amazing what sounds you can get out of a banana.

1024
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,300
Now the laughers and screamers, their crosstalk is incredible.

1025
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,240
It's all you can do to believe they're inedible.

1026
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:54,500
And policemen and doctors, hover round the edges.

1027
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,180
As they drag in new converts and make them sign pledges.

1028
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:13,440
And oh, can it be true, well, that there's no rest for the wicked.

1029
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,580
No peace for us two.

1030
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,280
Now me and my sweetheart have tried to escape.

1031
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,400
We've secretly put down our thoughts on this tape.

1032
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,800
And we're sending it out to all who might hear.

1033
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,540
Don't you talk all at once or you'll wind up right here.

1034
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:56,920
And oh, can it be true, that there's no rest for the wicked.

1035
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,980
No peace for us two.

1036
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,400
Alright, one more verse.

1037
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,840
A passage of loons to their home in the sky.

1038
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,940
Don't tempt me a bit to think I'll pass it right by.

1039
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,500
So listen up friends now, you've heard my sad tune.

1040
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,280
Don't be tempted to talk all at once like a loon.

1041
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:40,540
And oh, can it be true, that there's no rest for the wicked.

1042
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,840
No peace for us two.

1043
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,700
Y'all sound beautiful tonight.
