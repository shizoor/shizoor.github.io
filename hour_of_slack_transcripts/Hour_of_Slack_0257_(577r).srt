1
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,080
Have.

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,800
Suppose it's true after all.

3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,240
If so, all you vindictive, moralistic pseudo-Christians who make Jesus look so petty.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,640
All you right-wing ideologues who lie, cheat, and steal in the name of the Lord to grab people's hearts, minds, and money.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,500
All you self-righteous moralists who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see, hear, think, and do.

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,780
Are in big trouble.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,480
Don't let your mind go to hell.

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,780
Save it.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,420
Listen to the subgenius.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,940
Powerhouse.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,620
What?

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,500
Another pop sham.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,140
For that little amount that you can...

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,880
Donate dollars.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,480
$10.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:29,860
$10.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,060
$10.

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,360
$10.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,580
$10.

20
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:30,580


21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,240
Oh, God.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:31,860
Oh, God.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,040
Oh, God.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,600
$5.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,040
$5.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,240
$10.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:33,600
$10.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,020
$10.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,180
$5.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,540
$5.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,580
Cool.

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,400
Did he get it?

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,600
Did he?

34
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,380
We rule the world.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,740
Give a...

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,420
...so other...

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,040
...please do...

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,140
Bob.

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,860
I'm coming in here.

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,100
I'm after you now.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,700
Poor Bob.

42
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,940
I almost felt sorry for him.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,960
Almost.

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,340
And these days, Bob has grown accustomed to a very different lifestyle.

45
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,060
I'm sorry, Bob.

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,700
I'm sorry, Bob.

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm so sorry.

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm sorry, Bob.

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,100


51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,100


52
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,220
I can't do it anymore.

53
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,420
I can't do it anymore.

54
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:19,420


55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,980
I can't do it.

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,900
I can't do it.

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
Oh yes, dear friends

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,700
And welcome back to the Hour of Slack

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,200
This is a special, special broadcast tonight

60
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
I have a lot of feeling in my heart

61
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
Because this is our five year anniversary

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
Five years, dear friends

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,820
This show, Hour of Slack number 257

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,900
Marks the fifth year of the word of Bob

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,940
Reaching out across the airwaves

66
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,700
Reaching out for those subgeniuses

67
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,540
And those slackless ones who need

68
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,380
The slack that Bob can give

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,500
So we've tried to put together a special show

70
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,600
One that will bless your heart

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,300
And bring you closer to the dogma

72
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,280
And the doctrine of Bob's church

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,320
The church of the subgenius

74
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,240
I hope it'll help you to understand Bob better

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,740
To understand your fellow members

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,440
And yourself

77
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,880
Praise Bob

78
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,760
She kept saying over and over and over again

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
It's wonderful, wonderful

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,680
And she said as fast as she could

81
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,300
Wonderful, this is wonderful, this is wonderful

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,900
Everything that happens to you

83
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,480
Every second of every minute

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,080
Of every hour of every day

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,580
Remember silently to name it

86
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,480
Wonderful, this is wonderful

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,460
And whatever you name anything in your life

88
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,440
You've won it become for you

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,700
Are we ready for our time travel experiment?

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,440
Then set the chronons for Nexus 3

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
Okay, the code is I love pretty words

92
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I love pretty words

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,960
I love pretty words

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,680
I love pretty words

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,900
I love pretty words

96
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,220
Now as you can see off in the distance

97
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,580
Leaving space for you

98
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,020
Boing, oing, oing, oing

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,500
And so history was made

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,640
Or rather unmade

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,600
As they went back in time

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,700
Past the fighting minute man

103
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,140
Past the armored knight

104
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,840
Past the Roman warrior

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,540
To this prehistoric site

106
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,720
But we overshot our mark

107
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,820
And we went zillions of years into the past

108
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,400
Into the area of nothingness and chaos

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,560
That existed before the universe

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,960
The primordial vacuum cleaner

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,100
The dust balls of space

112
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,020
Millions of miles across

113
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,080
Gigantic hairballs

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,300
And lint filled the cosmos

115
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,480
Boing, oing, oing, oing, oing

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,640
And so history was made

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:16,660
Remember silently to name it

118
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:16,660


119
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,980
Remember silently to name it

120
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,580
And so history was made

121
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,580


122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Remember silently to name it

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,380
People bring tears

124
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,220
And they raise their voices

125
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,180
Sanctification

126
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,360
And they lower up

127
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,460
Moss

128
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,580
Dirt

129
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,320
And then eventually

130
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,320


131
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,200
There doers

132
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,080
Seellem

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,340
Homily, holy, Lord God of hosts, Hosanna in the highest, in your super van.

134
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,700
Praise God.

135
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,780
Good God.

136
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,320
Having a night.

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,900
This is popcorn.

138
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,100
Lord of mercy.

139
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,380
Lord of mercy.

140
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,540
Lord of mercy.

141
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,780
Lord of mercy.

142
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,660
Christ of mercy.

143
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,780
Christ of mercy.

144
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,120
Christ of mercy.

145
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,800
Christ of mercy.

146
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,920
Christ of mercy.

147
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,020
Christ of mercy.

148
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,440
Christ.

149
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,320
He gonna come back.

150
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,600
One more time.

151
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,740
I invite you to get under my roof.

152
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,260
So give it up.

153
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,700
I turn it.

154
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Give it up.

155
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,160
Lamb of God, take away the sins of the world.

156
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,220
Have mercy.

157
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,400
Lamb of God, take away the sins of the world.

158
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,320
Grant us peace.

159
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,140
He's super van.

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,900
Good God.

161
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,620
He's super van.

162
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,920
Super, super, super van.

163
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,560
Oh my God, I'm caught in the silence.

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,020
I'm having an offensive beat.

165
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,580
And I'm in here.

166
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,360
All my sins are faded.

167
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,400
Leave not yet.

168
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
If you funky down there.

169
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,060
What's even worse than thrashing!

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,500
Shame's so un grades.

171
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,460
Smashing

172
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,460


173
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:40,460


174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm the homie

175
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,820
Praise Bob

176
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,120
Good guy

177
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,400
Praise Bob

178
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,020
Good guy

179
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,620
Mass is ended

180
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,660
Go in peace

181
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,460
Hit that

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
Bob

183
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,100
What about Bob?

184
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,700
Anyway

185
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,220
Shut up human

186
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,660
In the time of

187
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,080
P

188
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,500
When Bob

189
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,220
Dobbs

190
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,420
Takes

191
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,640
My cash

192
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,660
From me

193
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,820
Lost my job

194
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,980
And lost my wife

195
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,240
Some genius

196
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,880
Church

197
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,100
Was to take

198
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,340
My life

199
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,600
The catch word

200
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,240
Religion

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,260
Fills my day

202
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,300
And still

203
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,780
Bob Dobbs

204
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,320
Demands his pay

205
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Down in my

206
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,020
Wall of

207
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,380
Pride

208
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,860
I keep my gold

209
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,680
The guy

210
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,100
Who

211
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,880
Knows

212
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,900
Is after

213
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
My soul

214
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,380
A silent

215
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,940
Creek

216
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,100
The Dallas

217
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,840
Hat

218
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,160
He claims

219
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,900
To deliver

220
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,440
Me

221
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,240
To turtle

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Sack

223
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,740
To turtle

224
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,260
Sack

225
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:39,840
To turtle

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:39,840


227
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Sack

228
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:40,680


229
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Sack

230
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,220
To turtle

231
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,720
Sack

232
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,000
To turtle

233
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000


234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000


235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000


236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000


237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000


238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,300
He's got

239
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,200
A little

240
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,760
Scarab

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,220
For the

242
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,920
Outage

243
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,260
Of the

244
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,620
Car

245
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,740
A big

246
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,260
Deal

247
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,040
Up in

248
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,220
The

249
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,640

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,100
Down

251
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,680
Bar

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,440
Yes

253
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,320
I

254
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,900
Love

255
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,100
It

256
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,700
Can't

257
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,000
Go

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,580
Far

259
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't

260
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Even

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,740
Know

262
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,320
What

263
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,880
States

264
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,260
They

265
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,740
Are

266
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Send

267
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,360
My

268
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,080
Money

269
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,800
Across

270
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:03,440
The

271
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,040
Sea

272
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,760
To the

273
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,120
Land

274
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Of

275
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,960
Malaysia

276
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,560
Where

277
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:06,960
I

278
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,260
Want

279
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:07,420
To

280
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:07,820
Be

281
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,680
It's

282
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:08,760
All

283
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,380
I

284
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,260
I know it's time for me to eat.

285
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:16,060
When Bob Dog takes my cash from me.

286
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,860
When Bob Dog takes my cash from me.

287
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,540
I said no.

288
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,760
Wonderful dear friends.

289
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,860
What that may not be for you.

290
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,260
Ah yes.

291
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,140
This is one of those good old times of genius gospel show.

292
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm sure just brimming over with the spirit.

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,780
I don't even care if you are.

294
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,760
That's how in the spirit I am.

295
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,760
I don't even care.

296
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,600
But we do it because of love dear friends.

297
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,900
Oh praise Bobby.

298
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,500
Bobby.

299
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,640
Hi.

300
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,100
Thanks for calling.

301
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,220
The voice line.

302
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,040
You know with this country on the verge of war.

303
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,680
It's getting pretty hard to take my line of work.

304
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,600
Doing voices for radio commercials.

305
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,220
All that seriously.

306
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,220
In fact.

307
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,040
It's getting so that more and more.

308
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,340
Every time I'm in the studio for a session.

309
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,140
I feel just a little bit more hypocritical.

310
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,140
And guilty.

311
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,960
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy.

312
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,780
To lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image enhancing products.

313
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,360
That in reality they little need.

314
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,820
Nor ill can afford.

315
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,740
The strange thing is.

316
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,120
The more guilty I feel about this situation.

317
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,280
The better my work is.

318
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,000
My delivery improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

319
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
I work four or five times a week.

320
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,740
I've even upped my rates.

321
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,420
Just think what would happen in the event of an all out war.

322
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,460
Thinking about it.

323
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,440
Almost makes it worth thinking about.

324
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,560
But as good as I get at my work.

325
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,480
I'll still be only a mouthpiece.

326
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,820
A conduit for someone else's concepts.

327
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,120
A faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe they're not worth it.

328
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,460
They're advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.

329
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Now what do you think?

330
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,080
Am I cutting my own throat here?

331
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,000
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?

332
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,280
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?

333
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,640
I don't know.

334
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,300
I can't answer that.

335
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,760
But I do know this.

336
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,920
This country.

337
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,440
Has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.

338
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,100
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.

339
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,040
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio.

340
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,540
Nothing you can buy will make you a better person.

341
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,380
A happier person.

342
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,400
A more spiritually connected person.

343
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,140
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.

344
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,080
There are things that can never be turned into commodities.

345
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:34,900
And not be sold.

346
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,180
And marketed.

347
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,740
And these things must be searched for within each of us.

348
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,560
Individually.

349
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,060
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

350
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,020
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bum you just passed on the street.

351
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,280
Then you too are part of that deception.

352
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,100
No matter how much money you have.

353
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,120
The sad fact remains that regardless of what color Porsche or BMW or Lamborghini you have.

354
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,480
You will never be.

355
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,640
One of George Bush's rich friends.

356
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,160
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.

357
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,000
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

358
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.

359
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,400
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields.

360
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,340
Or a slave in the office.

361
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,340
Or a slave in the big house on the hill.

362
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,280
You're still a slave.

363
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,840
And at best a middle management slave.

364
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor.

365
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,960
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

366
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,780
Believe me.

367
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,560
You will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

368
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,300
And you will be replaced the very next day.

369
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,780
By yet another well groomed.

370
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,960
Well oiled.

371
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,600
Eager.

372
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,580
Well meaning.

373
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,960
Brown nosing.

374
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,620
Slave.

375
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,380
This year's model.

376
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,500
Recently we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

377
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,740
Now what do you think brought all that about?

378
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,820
Was it because the communist system was flawed and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

379
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,480
No.

380
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,460
I don't think so.

381
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,560
I think it was because of the ineffective, greedy, myopic and insensitive bureaucrats.

382
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

383
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,040
Interesting parallel don't you think?

384
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,800
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic and insensitive bureaucrats.

385
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,200
Charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

386
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
But rather than choose to evict them.

387
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,340
As was the case in Russia.

388
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,080
All too often.

389
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,400
We choose to emulate them.

390
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,960
To ape their postures.

391
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,200
Their uniforms.

392
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,800
Their speech patterns.

393
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,700
Their words and phraseology.

394
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,320
But remember what I said.

395
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,580
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

396
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,720
Stop acting like you're next on the docket.

397
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,060
Because you aren't.

398
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,380
Stop acting like everything is alright.

399
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,160
Because it isn't.

400
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,860
Nothing is alright.

401
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,120
And if you can look around you at the state of this country.

402
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,820
And not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs.

403
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,940
And that their dominoes just happen to fall first in the system.

404
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,120
Then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends.

405
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,980
Or else you're truly ignorant.

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,100
And all I know is that George Bush's rich friends probably would not be calling this number to hear my demo line.

407
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,360
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.

408
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,660
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now.

409
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,560
Remember.

410
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,140
You're working at least three of those days to pay off your accrued interest charges.

411
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,900
And to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

412
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,980
That 3% at the top.

413
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,820
The real inner circle.

414
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,000
Is bleeding you dry.

415
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,480
It's bleeding this country dry.

416
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,360
Not to mention what's left of this planet.

417
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,540
And as we trip over each other in our ruts.

418
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:23,540


419
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,620
In our rush to emulate our leaders.

420
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,140
We wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance.

421
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,920
Oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

422
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,500
And why do we continue to do this?

423
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,200
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

424
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,860
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

425
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:52,320
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art to the continued perpetration of this hoax?

426
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,080
How can we be part of a nation that is so free?

427
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,660
I don't know.

428
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,340
I can't answer that.

429
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,080
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

430
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,940
Structure without freedom is fascism.

431
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,400
What are you?

432
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,000
An anarchist?

433
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,220
Or a fascist?

434
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,280
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.

435
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,540
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.

436
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,260
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

437
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
Convenience is not freedom.

438
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,460
And the government is not your friend.

439
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,100
Thank you for calling the voice line.

440
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,120
Yeah, that was Joe Paulino, dear friends.

441
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Reverend Joe Paulino.

442
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,760
Isn't this a funny show?

443
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,280
We don't know where it came from.

444
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,900
We can't imagine where it goes.

445
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,940
Bob.

446
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,760
Bob.

447
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,880
Bob.

448
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Bob.

449
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,460
Bob.

450
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,140
Bob.

451
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,580
Bob.

452
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:05,720
Bob.

453
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,220
Yeah, so that's why we're on the air.

454
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,740
That's right.

455
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,820
We've got to be on the air because within about seven or eight, well, I'd say maybe

456
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,660
ten years, most of the human race is going to be dead anyway of AIDS because it's geometrically

457
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,080
increasing.

458
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,480
Look, we sincerely hope that once you see what the gods have in store for you.

459
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,680
By the way of retribution, tribulation, plague, punishment, and flight, you'll realize just

460
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,860
how badly you need powerful friends and benign protectors like us.

461
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,000
You may scoff and ridicule this show right now, but the day will come when the stockpile

462
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,180
calamities will all be unleashed on you.

463
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,360
Hey, this is prophecy.

464
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:41,820
Stand by.

465
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,340
Miniature big feet that run around slashing your ankles with poison razor blades, the

466
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,640
frozen nitric acid hail, volcanoes that belch nerve gas, and hallucinogenic dust clouds

467
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,840
that will engulf us.

468
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:52,980
Don't.

469
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Don't.

470
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,420
Don't.

471
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,520
Don't.

472
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


473
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


474
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


475
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


476
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


477
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


478
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,520


479
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,140
Shut up.

480
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,200
Shut up.

481
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,280
Shut up.

482
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,580
shatters and covers the ground with carcinogenic dreadful smelling grit okay nothing okay

483
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,300
don't don't suffer we've got audio of immune deficiency syndrome here yeah we'll just clean

484
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,860
off the microphone and start all over again there's a possibility that there are numerous

485
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,920
bacteriological and viral strains that are being tried on the human race by the mother earth the

486
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,720
the human race i mean see you're talking about things that don't really seem to matter i think

487
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,280
these are these are minor matters in the scope of things i mean dobbs prophecies laid out what's

488
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,540
going to happen in health industrial bad things like that see we've got the cases here and when

489
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,640
you talk about this many people have a disease or that many people working on in the in the

490
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,000
geological spectrums that are needed to uh actually a critical point will be reached sometime around

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,840
1988 or so when all the the available uh yes all available things

492
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,040
soldiers will be fighting for dogs population aids patients will have been exhausted if the

493
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,200
train yeah but by that by that date every single subgenius will have his own radio show

494
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,080
including you and i mean so we'll all be broadcasting this news at that time and

495
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,680
understanding it okay what year is the mutant revolution headed off when charles manson

496
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,320
discovers the secret death valley entrance to hollow earth and leads all the exiled

497
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,720
misfit nazi hell creatures against the mutant strongholds here they come now

498
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,640
ye have heard that it was said by them

499
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,300
shall

500
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,960
for thine, and to a virtue.

501
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,320
But I say unto you that he resists not even,

502
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,480
but whosoever shall spite thee on thy right cheek,

503
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,060
turn to him the other also.

504
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,680
Ye have heard that it hath been said,

505
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,120
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemies.

506
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,340
But I say unto you, love your enemies less than they pursue.

507
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,160
Do good to them that hate you,

508
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,460
and pray for them which despite thee use you in person.

509
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,480
Well, of course, this is absolutely biological.

510
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,640
This is biological.

511
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,700
Suicide's absolutely madness.

512
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,600
No, it's just ridiculous.

513
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,960
Love your enemy.

514
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,620
It isn't easy to love an enemy.

515
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,000
It's just ridiculous.

516
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,720
And since it goes against your most basic survival instinct,

517
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
but it can be done and turned to an advantage.

518
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,400
Let the love squirt out of you like a fire hose of molasses.

519
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,440
Give him the kiss of life.

520
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,540
Stick your tongue down his throat.

521
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,320
Taste what he's been eating and bless his digestion.

522
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,980
Booze down into his intestines and help him along with his...

523
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,440
Life in all its rich variety.

524
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,320
Do not falter.

525
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:59,040
Let your love enter in unto him and penetrate him with a divine lubricant.

526
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,360
Makes KY and Leland feel like sandpaper.

527
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:09,360
It's the most mucilaginous, the slimiest, ooziest lubricant there ever was or shall be.

528
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:09,780
Amen.

529
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,760
Bop.

530
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,580
Bop.

531
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,820
Bop.

532
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,440
Bop.

533
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:15,960
Bop.

534
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,300
Bop.

535
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,820
Bop.

536
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,140
Bop.

537
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,320
Bop.

538
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,360
Bop.

539
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,520
Bop.

540
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,820
Bop.

541
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,200
Bop.

542
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,260
Bop.

543
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,320
Bop.

544
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,320


545
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,320


546
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,320


547
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:18,360
Bop.

548
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


549
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


550
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


551
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


552
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


553
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


554
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


555
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,360


556
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,420
He is the one true innocent.

557
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,160
He's so dumb that he doesn't know good from evil.

558
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,980
To him, he might walk a little old lady across the street and then might turn around and

559
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,460
do sex tortures on her for three weeks, keeping her clinging to life and then make a sandwich

560
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,340
out of her face.

561
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,920
To him, it's all the same.

562
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,960
And if we were to be as truly innocent as Bob, we could do that too.

563
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
Isn't that sick?

564
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,180
Isn't that scary?

565
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:57,220
That is not giving your sister some more life.

566
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,440
Let's make you shameful, bitch!

567
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,440


568
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,440


569
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,440


570
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,440


571
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,260
Because you don't get two Filterglasses, you were one and all you got two.

572
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,560
The不是андwellansje durdone zwandawandwological people pussy!

573
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,840
Ain't this teeth, dude?

574
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:08,840


575
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:08,840


576
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:08,840


577
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:08,840


578
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Three bars!

579
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,020
Good flesh, Thingumazever.

580
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,460
You just light it up like you do a chest of ale

581
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,360
You inhale a sweet smell of spit

582
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,860
You exhale it out of your mouth

583
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,100
That's all there is to it

584
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,520
It's just like an atomic bomb

585
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,760
That's all there is to it

586
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,260
Things are more messed up than you ever dreamed

587
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,220
What was it all is now

588
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,680
The priorities are all screwy

589
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,640
You're afraid if your hair looks okay

590
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,660
While some new kind of bladder cancer

591
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,100
Is bursting out the front of your desire jeans

592
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,840
Yes, this is bad talk

593
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,880
Nobody will listen to anything else

594
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,660
You won't look at TV unless body parts are cars

595
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,180
Or chickens are crashing on it

596
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,980
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it

597
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,800
You haven't used your other senses since you were five

598
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,120
And you sure as hell won't stop once you know you know someone

599
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,180
Much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more selfish

600
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,900
Makes you stop

601
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,620
And you'll never stop

602
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,760
And you'll thank him for it

603
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,800
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight

604
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,640
You'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing

605
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,060
Good God!

606
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,240
What in the name of sweet screaming

607
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
Jesus is this world coming to?

608
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,640
People bitch, people cry

609
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,620
This is a sign of the end times

610
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,220
That's a sign of the end times

611
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,940
When you should all be hollering

612
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,600
It's all a sign of the end times

613
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,140
Millions are gonna be going

614
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,700
And they're gonna leave this earth

615
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,720
And they're gonna leave their own love, love, love

616
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,540
Lost loved ones behind

617
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,600
What does that say?

618
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,080
Did you hear what he was saying?

619
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,660
Did you hear what he was saying?

620
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,460
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

621
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,640
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust

622
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,680
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom would generally be dismissed by the party

623
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:33,740
Sin, bloodshed, and racism

624
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,980
Who had the upper hand on the collaborate of millions

625
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,160
Sort of one with 떠gu

626
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,600
Thoughts cannot be

627
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,000
Served in such a terrible0

628
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,120
BASED ON lives situations

629
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,640
We've got to tape this. We'll play it back real slow.

630
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,820
And we'll get his whole tape.

631
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,160
Okay, it says meet at the Texas Theater.

632
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,120
November 22nd.

633
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,880
Yeah, that's right.

634
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,480
Bring the curtain rods.

635
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Well, just another subgenie caller.

636
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,980
Just another phone bomb.

637
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,020
Just another subgenius.

638
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,960
What can I say? Bob is fill in the blank.

639
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,220
You can count on that.

640
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,460
Well.

641
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,780
Or kill me.

642
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,360
Or more.

643
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,220
Or less.

644
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,880
And who's going to do that?

645
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,600
The passion of this garbage is delicious.

646
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,160
What was that?

647
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,320
The church of subgeniuses.

648
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,400
But I don't know.

649
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,140
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

650
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,580
Bang.

651
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,740
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

652
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,480
Oh, God.

653
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,280
God for atom bombs?

654
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
Atomic warheads?

655
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,780
All over the country.

656
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,540
Every morning.

657
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:34,780
Past.

658
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,500
Blotted out.

659
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:35,820
Yeah.

660
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,720
In the future.

661
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,540
For sure.

662
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,900
Yeah, that's what I want.

663
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,540
Ah, yeah.

664
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,140
Yes.

665
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,460
30 years ago, I warned of it.

666
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,300
20 years ago, I warned of it.

667
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
You listen in amazement.

668
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Here today.

669
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,960
As we take this.

670
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,460
One joke.

671
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,200
And keep blowing it up.

672
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,280
Bigger and bigger.

673
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,700
And the only reason we're.

674
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,540
We're pumping so much behind this one joke.

675
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,920
Is that we want to see how big it gets before it explodes.

676
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,720
Bang.

677
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,820
Bang.

678
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,860
Bang.

679
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,300
Bang.

680
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,860
Bang.

681
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,340
Bang.

682
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,180
Bang.

683
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,400
Bang.

684
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,280
Bang.

685
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,220
It was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the hump.

686
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,840
This is cars and trains and trash.

687
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,680
Wires and husbands and babies.

688
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,420
What's the fear?

689
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,100
Of course your government and all governments, they'll be trying to fish tail out of it.

690
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
They'll give you all kinds of excuses.

691
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,080
They'll hide the reality under UFOs or extraterrestrial invasion.

692
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,980
Or astral projection or God only knows what.

693
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,680
But they won't try to put it under the rug.

694
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,480
But I'm warning you, you've missed.

695
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
It was Bob all along, dear friend.

696
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
They tricked you, didn't they?

697
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,540
They'll trick you every time they creep up on you.

698
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,940
The little pinky winky stew in the old kitchen.

699
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,020
So we're all going to watch out, aren't we?

700
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,260
Yes.

701
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,560
This is your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

702
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,700
We're going to continue with a little bit of what we have been playing

703
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,220
and a little bit of new.

704
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,360
What we have been playing have been William Burroughs,

705
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,940
and that's the old guy talking,

706
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,340
and the KPFA subgenius show tapes,

707
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:34,040
by puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Gaborg, Fran, Mr. Exotic,

708
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,900
and in this case, lies.

709
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Lies!

710
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,080
Apocalypse.

711
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,400
Apocalypse.

712
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,700
Mariner sailing close to the shores of Tuscany,

713
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,340
heard the sound of a boat, and he said,

714
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,280
I heard a voice cry out from the hills, the trees, and the sky.

715
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,100
The great God Pan is dead.

716
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,620
Pan got a panic.

717
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,720
The sudden awareness that everything is alive and significant.

718
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,000
The date was December 25, 1 A.D.

719
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,260
But Pan lives on in the realm of imagination,

720
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,720
in writing, painting, and music.

721
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,340
Look at Van Gogh's sunflowers writhing with pretentious life.

722
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,860
Listen to the pipes of Pan in Taduka.

723
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,360
Now Pan is neutralized, framed in museums, entombed in books,

724
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,080
relegated to folklore.

725
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,320
But art is spilling out of its frames, in the midst of the world.

726
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,320


727
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,320


728
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,080
Will it stop there?

729
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,260
Consider an apocalyptic statement.

730
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,440
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.

731
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,200
Hassan Isaba, The Old Man on the Mountain.

732
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,180
Not to be interpreted as an invitation to all manner of unrestrained and destructed

733
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:45,120
behavior, that would be a minor episode, which would run its course.

734
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,280
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.

735
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,420
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.

736
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,040
Well, art leaves the frame and the written word leaves the page.

737
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,420
Not merely the physical frame and page, but the frames and pages of assigned categories.

738
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,080
A basic disruption of reality itself occurs.

739
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,340
The literal realization of art.

740
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,540
Success will write apocalypse across the sky.

741
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,920
The artist aims for a miracle.

742
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,780
The painter wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate light.

743
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,020
Movement outside of the picture.

744
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,400
The artist wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate light.

745
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:48,740
And one rent in the fabric is all it takes for pandemonium to sluice through.

746
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,780
Last act. The end.

747
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,040
This is where we all came in.

748
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:03,440
The final apocalypse is when every man sees what he sees,

749
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,980
feels what he feels, hears what he hears.

750
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,400
The creatures of all your dreams,

751
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:19,060
your dreams and nightmares are right here, right now, solid as they ever were or ever will be.

752
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,400
Electric vitality of careening subways.

753
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,640
Faster, faster, faster.

754
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,360
Stations flash by in a blur.

755
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:36,320
Pan-God of panic whips screaming crowds as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

756
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,000
Off the track, off the track.

757
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,220
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening into space.

758
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,060
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

759
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,980
Spinning faster and faster, days and nights flash by like subway stations.

760
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,660
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete and steel.

761
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Flattening cars like beer cans.

762
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,340
Graffiti through glass and steel.

763
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,260
Steel like acid races across the sky in tornadoes of flaming colors.

764
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:25,180
Cherry pickers with satin brushes pick as a door inch through Wall Street,

765
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,980
leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.

766
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,480
Water trucks slosh out paint.

767
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,320
Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols paint every corner of the world.

768
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,500
Everything and everyone in reach.

769
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,180
Survival artists paint cans strapped to their backs.

770
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,440
Grenades at their belts paint anything and anybody within range.

771
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,240
Sky riders dog fight collide and explode.

772
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,800
Telephone poles dance electric jigs in swirling, crackling wires.

773
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,660
Neon explosions and tornadoes splash through ruined cities.

774
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:25,100
Volcanoes spew molten colors as the earth's crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.

775
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,320
Household appliances revolt.

776
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,220
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.

777
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,060
Gallowing hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.

778
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,340
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths.

779
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,060
So clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.

780
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,900
Garden jewels whiz through long parties impaling the guests

781
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,780
who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hatchets.

782
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,220
Loaves of misshapen bulbous plants spring from their bones.

783
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:16,020
Covering golf courses, swimming pools, country clubs, and tasteful dwellings.

784
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,380
At my back, faster and faster, I always hear,

785
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,660
Hurry up, energy ground down into, please it's time closing.

786
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,940
Sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires erupt from manholes and tunnels.

787
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,120
Break out with volcanic force.

788
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,760
Let it come down careening subways.

789
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,620
Faster and faster, stations blur by.

790
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,660
Hand whips screaming crowds with flaming fights.

791
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,380
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

792
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,960
Off the track, off the track.

793
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,220
Planet is pulling loose from its moorings.

794
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,040
Careening off into space.

795
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,040
Scilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

796
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,640
Faster and faster.

797
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,660
Skyscrapers scrape rents of blue and white paint from the sky.

798
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,660
The rivers swirl with color.

799
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:35,600
Nitrous ochres and reds leap through the bridges falling into the rivers.

800
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,940
Splashing colors across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.

801
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:48,040
Amok art rugs in organic mold.

802
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,780
Stirring passions of metal and glass.

803
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,280
Steel girders rising in metal.

804
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,420
Aspersed from their concrete covers.

805
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,500
Walls of glass melt and burn with madness and a billion.

806
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,980
And then crazed eyes.

807
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,900
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.

808
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,240
The sidewalks run ahead.

809
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,880
Faster and faster.

810
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,700
Energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires.

811
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,000
Erupts from manholes and tunnels and breaks out with volcanic force.

812
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,700
Let it come down.

813
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,880
Caught in New York beneath the animals of the village.

814
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,300
The piper pulled down into the sky.

815
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,300
We're escalating our programming here.

816
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,820
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-express talk.

817
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Tonight we're going to probe around.

818
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,940
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-express talk.

819
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:04,680
Tonight we're going to probe around.

820
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Next one.

821
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,560
We're escalating our programming here.

822
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,960
We are no longer going to be the pseudo-express talk.

823
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,480
Don't call it ironic.

824
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,620
The kindest performer ain't in the show.

825
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:34,660


826
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:34,660


827
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,120
Destiny has landed.

828
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:48,240
The thunder, taking control of the world.

829
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,320
The station stands within.

830
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,260
Beneath, freedom is over.

831
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:07,740
Oh, we don't know what they came for.

832
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,580
What they came for.

833
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,660
Unconducible.

834
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,460
We don't know what they came for.

835
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:26,240
But what they aim for is impossible.

836
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,520
The

837
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,340
only those ideas which are accepted

838
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,100
are those which are in the hands of the status quo,

839
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,980
which reaches the wider audience, which makes people brain dead.

840
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,240
And you either have to

841
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:00,240


842
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,120
submit or you have to join the spectacle, you know, the...

843
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,740
The invasion of body statues, that kind of thing.

844
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,100
Yeah, and so we can agree that under that situation,

845
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,620
it's a planet of the dead.

846
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,540
And the alternative is not to offer other ideas,

847
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,220
because they'll be quickly consumed and recycled and played out.

848
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,320
So the real alternative is a kind of new yoga,

849
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,280
an environmental yoga, not a private spiritual or Eastern yoga.

850
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,840
The new yoga is to deal with the environments we've created and we all share.

851
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,340
You know what I mean, Mike?

852
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,660
And so that's why we have to deal with the conspiracy.

853
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,080
It goes back to that caller, that if I was able to take control,

854
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,700
and I do have control, but if I was able to present it in the pink world,

855
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,460
then I could bring in this real alternative.

856
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,100
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environments.

857
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,420
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment.

858
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,440
Can you imagine doing that?

859
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,620
Right.

860
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,540
That'd be one...

861
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,540
It's not an alternative idea, that's an alternative percept.

862
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,260
But the pinks are never going to change.

863
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,260


864
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,080
They're never going to let you do that.

865
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,900
So they will let you have all the celebratory retrievals and replays

866
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,520
and celebrations of ideas and cultures,

867
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,980
because they know the medium is the message, not the content.

868
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,940
The content has no importance.

869
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,800
The control environment is those of the emperor, this is his new clothes,

870
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,560
is that he's just going to keep it on.

871
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,000
He's not going to turn it on.

872
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,900
He has a lot of money to be made.

873
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,160
Yeah.

874
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,900
And he's not even making money. He doesn't even want that.

875
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,280
I knew the UFO of Phoebus was a war, that I recognized it.

876
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,120
And it was laughing.

877
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,240
It was laughing.

878
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,740
The

879
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,560
Uh...

880
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,560
Oh!

881
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,220
Uh-oh!

882
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,240
The

883
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,580
Let them numb the mind with useless consumer goods and luxuries.

884
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:11,760
Let the cows sate themselves on split-level ranches, wall-to-wall shag, microwaves, jacuzzis, food processors, and remote-controlled VCRs.

885
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:22,620
They have pulled the wool over their own eyes, blinding themselves with animal comfort, ignoring the signs traced in fire, ice, and blood that I have come and their time is at hand.

886
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:45,180
The Eastern world, it is exploding, violence flaring, bullets loading, you're old enough to kill, but not for voting.

887
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:53,180
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're toting? And even the Jordan River has bodies floating.

888
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,600
But you tell me over and over and over again.

889
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:05,360
And my friend, oh, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

890
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:19,740
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say? And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?

891
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:27,960
If the button is pushed, there's no running away. There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave.

892
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,300
Take a look around you, boy. It's bound to scare you, boy.

893
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:37,780
And you tell me over and over and over again.

894
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:44,700
And my friend, oh, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

895
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:55,480
Well, this is Hour of Slack, number 9,183.

896
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,940
May 19th.

897
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,260
May 19th, 21,989 A.D.

898
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:12,340
In the news, increased controversy over the skeleton and dwelling place or office of a midhistoric man,

899
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:20,440
recently unearthed by scientists in the deserts of Texas in North Amerenid on Earth Farm 1.

900
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,720
Due to its special qualities, experts are engaged in heated debate over its origins.

901
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,940
Whether it is a man or a woman, it is a question of time.

902
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:27,940


903
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:37,600
Whether it is merely an advanced Homo sapiens, a Q-man, that is, or is it one of the earliest Homo correctus,

904
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,740
also known as the subgenius, the last evolutionary step before our own species, Homo excelsior?

905
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:56,360
Does this fossil represent the missing link between the lesser gravity-bound bipedal primates and the subgenius-descended brain race,

906
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,920
which now conquers the star?

907
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:09,340
And what of the claims by cultists and dissidents that it is no less than the skull of one of the early apostles of the historical Dobbs man form,

908
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:18,020
which brought Slack to Earth Farm 1 in the year 0 B.D., or as they measured time, the late 20th century?

909
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,880
Could this be?

910
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,600
Most scientists concurred that the skeleton could well be that of a man who walked the earth at the same time and place,

911
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,760
as the Dobbs itself, during his last physical incarnation,

912
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:40,460
an unwitting pre-overman fighter in the bitter struggle which raised Homo excelsior from his quagmire of mortality

913
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:50,660
and physics-bound three-dimensional fixed-leggedness and into the energy-based free-thought-form heights of our civilization.

914
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,700
But is it necessarily?

915
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,800
Let's examine the fossil record.

916
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,160
Evidence which,

917
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,640
while meager on the surface,

918
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:09,000
yet allows skilled experts to reconstruct and describe in extraordinary detail the life of this mysterious ancient tool-using ape.

919
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,700
Of course,

920
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,840
Earth Farm 1 in his time was a much different place than it is today.

921
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:24,600
Lavishly gifted with surging plankton-filled oceans and land masses abundant with plants and animals,

922
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,580
the home seed planet then bore the first human species.

923
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:27,580


924
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,180
But all of its

925
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:34,720
cracked smears and falling off its arms was a bizarre wykonation forуsch controllers.

926
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:34,880
They were not under the discipline of human

927
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,940
to work for a way in theonomicienstcellar environment.

928
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,320
Nothing looked afflictly unpenthythmic.

929
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,020
What good were origin,

930
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:40,140
conservation,

931
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,140


932
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,140


933
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,300
the 결국 THERE

934
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,060
deserves called this Davisson Arena.

935
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,200
Who knows where the credulous wrapper is located in Homo.

936
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:48,340
But no處

937
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:57,560
If we should Fort unboxing theánmina of this fossil land speculation comes within 40 minutes,

938
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:57,560


939
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,240
of his implements seen here, supplemented by the oral records of our friends the

940
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:09,140
dolphins, paint a picture of his primeval office. Constructed of simple wood and

941
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:15,260
metal, yet he possessed crude computers of a sort, fashioned entirely from toxic

942
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:20,680
plastics and metals, powered by artificial electricity. These early

943
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,420
computers were sad, immobile, paralyzed boxes, armless and legless,

944
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:32,880
mere heads to be used as little more than flint hatchets. Their users probably

945
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,580
did not even suspect that their computers possessed souls. Certainly they

946
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:42,840
were never used for the sexual pastimes we enjoy today. Nevertheless, their

947
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,400
presence in this creature's hypothetical office distinguished him as a uniquely

948
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,460
electronic animal, the first of his kind. Indeed, he was far more overhuman than

949
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,400
this apish reconstruction of the human body.

950
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,700
The image on the right of the slide indicates, as seen in slide one, which admittedly

951
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:07,020
resembles the domesticated Eloi we breed for soul energy. Even more so, the

952
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:14,080
primitive wild Eloi mocked by our children in zoos. Homo correctus

953
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,320
possesses the familiar uncurved spine. He was robustly built with thick heavy bones.

954
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,200
At this stage of development, he was still better at driving than at

955
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,400
communicating or maintaining peaceful relations.

956
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,240
The skeleton was found next to the corroded parts of a harvesting tool, then called a

957
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,940
lawnmower, proves that he was still incapable of such simple telekinesis as controlling

958
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:46,640
the growth of plants by mental command. He still had legs, of course, though those hideous

959
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,980
jointed appendages which are only vestigial in our race. As seen here, the socket at which

960
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,920
the femur connects to the pelvis was farther inward.

961
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,800
More so than in Australopithecus, for instance. He was capable of walking fully erect if he

962
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:08,600
wore shoes, but abrasion on his coccyx shows that most of the time he was spent sitting,

963
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,840
perhaps because, like us, his great weight would otherwise have crushed even his massive

964
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,360
bones.

965
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,980
The skeleton is, at first glance, typical of the Hugh-mans of that time. Note that the

966
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,400
bones are much thicker than ours, suggesting that the musculature and the muscles are similar.

967
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,400


968
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:26,400


969
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,080
of this creature had broad anchors.

970
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,520
Physically, these creatures were incredibly powerful.

971
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,700
One of them could easily slay 20 of us in combat.

972
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,720
But were his head shielded from telepathic control by Blitanium?

973
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,060
Well, of course, to him, Blitanium was at best a dream.

974
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:53,600
You know, there hasn't been any real advances in your field.

975
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,640
He a gang's on here.

976
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,700
What the heck do we care?

977
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,460
What the heck do we care?

978
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,100
What, you're a tape recorder?

979
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:01,800
Yes.

980
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,240
Hey, that machine is alive.

981
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,780
Get this thing off of me!

982
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,600
Help!

983
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,280
Look, it's crawling right up his leg.

984
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,340
You talking to me?

985
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,140
No.

986
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,160
Yeah, we can see.

987
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,480
How do I, how do I kill that?

988
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,660
Uh, you can, here, we'll show you.

989
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,420
You can take this tape here.

990
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,880
You talking to me?

991
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,780
And you grind up.

992
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:22,900
Yep.

993
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,300
A little bit of buffalo residue.

994
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,060
Yeah, I'm talking to you, little tape.

995
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,700
Get in the trash can.

996
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,660
You gotta talk it down.

997
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,360
Yeah, you're the stupid shell.

998
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,640
You gotta be a man about it and talk it down.

999
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,780
You're the shell we're not gonna use, alright?

1000
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,540
Get back in the trash can.

1001
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,040
Get back.

1002
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,120
You, get back!

1003
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,500
Get in the trash can.

1004
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,800
Get that razor blade, quick, get that editing tape.

1005
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Get that editing tape.

1006
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,260
So the razor blade slaps, razor blade beats tape, any time.

1007
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,880
Oh yeah?

1008
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,460
Yeah.

1009
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,960
Get back in the trash can, you stupid.

1010
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,340
Get in the trash can.

1011
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:48,980
Oh!

1012
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:49,480
What?

1013
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,320
What?

1014
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,680
What?

1015
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:50,860
What?

1016
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:52,900
What?

1017
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,260
What?

1018
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,600
What?

1019
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:56,740
What?

1020
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,280
What?

1021
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:57,760
What?

1022
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,220
The crocodile.

1023
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,680
No animal is half so vile as Croccywoc the crocodile.

1024
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:13,280
On Saturdays he likes to crunch six juicy children for his lunch, and he especially

1025
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,560
enjoys just three of each, three girls, three boys.

1026
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:22,240
He smears the boys to make them hot with mustard from the mustard pot, but mustard doesn't

1027
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,120
go with girls. It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls. With them what goes extremely well

1028
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:33,280
is butterscotch and caramel. It's such a super marvellous treat when boys are hot and girls

1029
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,740
are sweet. At least that's Crocky's point of view. He ought to know. He's had a few.

1030
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:44,060
That's all for now. It's time for bed. Lie down and rest your sleepy head. Shh! Listen.

1031
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:50,780
What is that I hear? Galumphing softly up the stair. Go lock the door and fetch my gun.

1032
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,180
Go on, child. Hurry. Quickly run. No, stop. Stand back. He's coming in. Oh, look. That

1033
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:02,520
greasy greenish skin. The shining teeth. The greedy smile. It's Crocky Wok the crocodile.

1034
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,260
Observe here the remarkably small cranium of Homo correctus.

1035
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:27,160
Only 2,000 cubic centimetres compared to our 50,000. And the characteristic backward sloping

1036
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:32,720
forehead. The brain of this animal was capable only of language, tool making and speech.

1037
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,380
It had none of the 40 other characteristics of high thought which we take for granted

1038
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,580
today. Altogether, his brain had less cells than do those of our contemporary gorilla

1039
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:49,500
servants. As certain radical upstart free gorilla gorillas never cease to remind us.

1040
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:55,780
Every school child knows our ancestors were able to genetically transfer the brain into

1041
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:01,000
the chest where it was better protected while moving the gonads into the cranium where they

1042
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,120
best functioned. But that happened 5,000 years after the last war. Compared to us then, Homo

1043
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:14,760
correctus was truly a monster. Because of his savage, savage appearance, primitive peoples

1044
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,820
on the outer planet still use scary tales of these creatures to frighten their children

1045
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,960
into behaving. But despite the quaint legends of monsters like Dob Squatch or Middle-sized

1046
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,720
Foot, the idea that some pocket of these biological throwbacks might exist are, if romantic, nevertheless

1047
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:42,380
pure myth. Yes, to us, he would look like a mutated, disgusting, violent zoo animal.

1048
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:48,360
But if we could imagine his thoughts, they would probably prove to be remarkably similar

1049
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,800
to, say, those of our ancestors. But we can't say for sure that he was a monster. We can't

1050
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:02,280
say for sure that he's a human or that he's a creature. However, we have some

1051
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,780
guesses that rhyme with our own connections, and only the species we will ever guess are

1052
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:07,800
certain.

1053
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,620
