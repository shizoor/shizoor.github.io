9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,220
Yes, dear friends.

10
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:31,340
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack number 907.

11
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,120
The show devoted to the spaztards of Devo.

12
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:49,280
Yes, friends, the devotional World Devo Convention was held nearby here in Akron, actually.

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,600
And it was inspiring.

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,280
Inspiring and wonderful.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,220
But this particular time, instead of playing a million Devo covers by different bands,

16
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll play different covers by different bands that are all kind of Devoid and Devoish in

17
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,320
nature.

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,600
And now, this.

19
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:16,120
It's kind of hard to wear high heels or slip on banana peels.

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,360
How does she get in and out of...

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,420
Tubbs?

22
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,420
I hope she don't get mad.

23
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,220
I hope she thinks this song is good, not bad.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,520
Cause we think that she's totally rad.

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,020
She's nuts.

26
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,320
No fingers, no toes.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,640
She's jumping on elbows.

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,400
No front teeth, no knocky knees.

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:45,860
She's nuts.

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,140
She don't need knuckles or hands.

31
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,600
She goes to these pop-rock bands.

32
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,300
She's always in these stands.

33
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,580
She's got a lot of fun.

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:51,580


35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,620
She's nuts.

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,980
She can't pick up her phone.

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,240
She can't get dressed alone.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,100
She's got no funny bones.

39
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,500
She's nuts.

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,780
No shoes for feet.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,140
But she sure did what she needs.

42
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,160
She's nuts.

43
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,760
She's nuts.

44
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,700
She's nuts.

45
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,980
I ask her if she wants a drink

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,760
I ask her if she likes Saltido.

47
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,880
So I asked her to go out to the bar

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,960
But all she said was no thanks, no one knew

49
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,980
It was time for us to leave

50
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,480
So I grabbed and shook her sleeve

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,720
Told her I'd see her at the next club

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,820
She got into a fight

53
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,340
So I put her on his back

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,680
She said goodbye and kinda waved her stuff

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,720
She's got beautiful eyes

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
And friends drinking their signs

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,480
But with that cap I thought she'd enough

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,540
It's hard to get good head

59
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,900
Or get down to a bend

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,740
When all you've got is a body and head

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,240
She'd enough

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,660
She's nubbed

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,380
She's nubbed

64
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,100
She's nubbed

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,920
Oh she may not walk the walk

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,020
And she may not like to talk

67
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,400
But boy she sure knows how to rock

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,980
She's nubbed

69
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,780

So what classes are you signed up for?

Who?

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,980
You guys.

112
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,160
What are you taking?

113
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,160
I'm Pollyann.

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
This is college radio.

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,640
I was studying circumcision.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Reversal.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,720
Surgery.

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:34,900
Surgery.

119
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
Reversal circumcision.

120
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Yeah, that's getting to be really big.

121
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,180
Tattoo removal and piercing replacement.

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,400
Piercing replacement?

123
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,100
Fillings.

124
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,180
Fillings for your replacement.

125
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,360
Yeah, and scar replacement.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm studying Pollyannthosociopathy, which is taught by an errant-eyed crazy man from

127
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,580
a nearby institution who's brought in three times a week.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,460
No, this is Pollyannthosociopathy.

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,880
Pollyannthosociopathy?

130
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,800
That's like people who have...

131
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Doesn't he have to take like any normal?

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,080
Horses?

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,100
It's many anthropological studies combined into one.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,740
Well, we don't study real people per se.

135
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,660
Imaginary people we study in the imaginary culture.

136
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,440
You guys are in the 60 thing.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,040
The 60 thing?

138
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
Yeah, the friends to the 60 thing or something.

139
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,020
What is that?

140
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
It's like people over 60 get to take classes for free.

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,280
That's right, Chetty.

142
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,400
We not only get to take them, we need to give them back sometimes.

143
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
God only knows what that means.

144
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,700
But soon I will be ready.

145
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm ready to take the 80 plus plunge, which is more than just a swimsuit now.

146
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,240
It's a full line of reproductive gear.

147
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,880
You look really good for 80.

148
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,580
Yeah, I got all the reproductive gear still intact.

149
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,120
One thing that does look a little bit like a diseased bird, but the rest of me is quite

150
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,720
humorous and ready to make hummus.

151
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,440
You don't look any worse than an elephant skin rug.

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,020
I don't feel any worse than an elephant skin rug, but when I'm hiding in the subway, believe

153
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,240
me, I get some...

154
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,700
I turn some heads of cats.

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:04,960
I turn some heads of cabbage.

156
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,840
You know what I'm saying?

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
I turn some chicken necks.

158
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,820
Whoops.

159
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,380

162
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,240
met in your life will ever be held with one good eye.

163
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,100
They sing, they puzzle, and they twaddle to themselves, and they wear these giant bikinis

164
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,680
made of gold.

165
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,520
I'm a cat's man, Gossamer Flap.

166
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,820
Look at those beautiful, beautiful bathing caps with the hair stuffed down through their

167
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,280
eyes.

168
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,000
Ah, it's mom's way of getting backwards.

169
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,340
Now, Dave, where I come from, there's some really hot-looking grandmothers.

170
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:51,900
Well, you were...

171
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,000
No older than 30 or so.

172
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh, 53 years old?

173
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,660

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,120
And if we smoke his trapeze because he ran out of tobacco

190
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,240
Here we come and we don't care much

191
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,240
If they know what they wanna, they just want dirty boner

192
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,460
Here we come and we don't care net ya

193
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,800
Let's make instead of temporary

194
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,460
Vamos a hacerte el paro haciendo un disco no muy caro

195
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,480
Venimos decididos a quedarnos con tu paro

196
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,280
Vender miles de albums a los tres as we just wanna

197
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,420
Rayarles sus ropitas y quedarnos con su lana

198
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,540
En carrera de razos de bajada y sin frenos

199
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,300
Somos los peos y malos somos amigos del bueno

200
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,340
Somos los que en la playa chingan los planes chingones

201
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,900
Somos los super chilangos entre tu y tus vacaciones wey

202
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,300
Here we come and we don't care mucho

203
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,840
If you know what they wanna they just want your tip and wanna mana

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,260
Here we come and we don't care mucho

205
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,020
Let's make ba-do-ba-do-zad ba-do-ba-do-ba-do-zad

206
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh yes, here we come. A beautiful tune by Molotov, a Mexican rock band.

207
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,600
And now, Kinky Freedman.

208
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,540
Left barber college searching for knowledge

209
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,620
Went to the university

210
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,720
I must confess, sir, this lady professor

211
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,420
She turned me on to anthropology

212
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,200
Now I'm a homo erectus, got two connectives

213
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
Bones that I discovered yesterday

214
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
Tyrannosaurus lived in the forest

215
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
Died because his heart got in the way

216
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Dear Dr. Howard, come down from the hill

217
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,300
Come to the top of your tower

218
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,780
And join me for lunch at the Y

219
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,860
Although you're 30, I still think you're purty

220
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,340
Let's give it that good old college try

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,540
I'm a homo erectus, got two connectives

222
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,760
Bones that I discovered yesterday

223
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,760
Tyrannosaurus lived in the forest

224
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,420
Died because his heart got in the way

225
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm Dr. homo erectus, got two connectives

226
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,660
Bones that I discovered yesterday

227
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,760
Tyrannosaurus lived in the forest

228
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
Died because his heart got in the way

229
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,940
On Texas Music Radio, Johnny Marks,

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,900
riding through the canyons of your mind

231
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,500
with Kinky Freedman and the Texas Jew Boys.

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,920
Homo Connectus by Kinky Freedman

233
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,900
It gets to where you don't even know what's real anymore

234
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,000
and these new college kids come and go.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,500
You're right about that.

236
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,220
They probably don't know what slack is.

237
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,900
They probably never heard of Church of the Subgenius, J.R. Bob Doggs.

238
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,380
This is a state university though.

239
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,720
You can't preach any church stuff here.

240
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,540
So this is like a socialist school?

241
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,340
Didn't they haul away that giant stark fist that the judge wanted

242
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,460
installed in the courtroom here in Cleveland?

243
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,840
But they said, no, no, that would be promoting one religion over another.

244
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,460
Another religion.

245
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,580
Yeah, they'd be promoting the subgenius religion of slack

246
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,000
over the Christian religion of failed prophecies.

247
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:51,980
They do promote nationalism though.

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,260
They're allowed to promote nationalism.

249
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,220
No, I'm not kidding.

250
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,820
If you go over to the cage, you will find dangling

251
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,300
flags

252
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,320
from banners all through the ceiling

253
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,920
is all the flags of all the countries of the world.

254
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,780
Well, that's internationalism.

255
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
That's global friendship, I think, at the university there.

256
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,940
Yeah, that's one world.

257
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,960
That's communist new age.

258
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,500
That's cool.

259
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,840
Except for the child slavery.

260
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,380
You know, it's a nice thing.

261
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,900
Well, that's how it works.

262
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,660
That's what college is.

263
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,240
It's a conspiracy.

264
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,580
It's one world.

265
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,720
It's child labor.

266
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,320
It's cool.

267
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,360
It's international.

268
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,840
It's decentralized.

269
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,980
It's a little dirt in your chocolate.

270
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,340
Yeah.

271
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,040
College is not a democracy.

272
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,980
It's multi-unit, unilaterally.

273
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,060
It's a dictatorship.

274
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,120
And I'm the dick.

275
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,740
Well, some people say you're the tater, but that would mean you're a spud.

276
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,960
What good is democracy when everybody's retarded?

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,800
What good is democracy when everyone else is a fascist around you?

278
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,780
Now, that's what we're waiting for.

279
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,260
Fascism for the people, baby.

280
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,560
Fascism back to the people.

281
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,700
The man has hogged fascism for too long.

282
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:54,740
That's right.

283
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,920
Each and every one of you gets your own special white dictator suit with a brand new pair

284
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,800
of shiny, shiny socks and huge masochistic boots.

285
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, I don't have time for this.

286
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,460
I have to go buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people

287
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,320
wait behind me while I complain.

288
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,340
He still sounds sort of old.

289
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,600
Sort of real old.

290
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,460
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,060
I'm sorry.

292
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,140
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,140


295
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,660
He's this old.

296
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,860
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,540
What's going on with you?

298
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,120
I was born into anberty!

299
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


300
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


301
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


302
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


303
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


304
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,120


305
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,660
They were okay, not great, but pretty good.

306
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,820
They played the songs, I knew they would.

307
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,960
Some old, some new, the same formula stays true.

308
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,440
We can't concur, it's mediocre.

309
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
Sing, sing a song.

310
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,360
Make it simple, so all the kids can sing along.

311
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,500
Sing along.

312
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,040
The list keeps growing, the melody's been stolen.

313
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,520
Remind me of songs.

314
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,260
Songs.

315
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,260
From in the 70s.

316
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,880
You might fool the kids, but you don't fool me.

317
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,780
Have you ever heard of something called

318
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,560
Aboriginality?

319
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,300
Is it absurd to compose music?

320
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,600
No one's ever heard free

321
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,460
Dictability

322
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,580
Like a bosom

323
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,140
Will comfort them

324
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,140


325
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,040
My wonderful

326
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,300
LCD

327
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,460
It's underpowered

328
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,120
It makes your love be flowered

329
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,540
Ready to act up

330
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,600
Then bring its truth to day

331
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Are you ready to rock?

332
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,240
How y'all doing tonight?

333
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
You couldn't stand your fucks

334
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
Maybe you wanna laugh

335
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,960
And you get the same time

336
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,320
I want to speak

337
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,380
This song sounds like 50

338
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,460
You've heard before

339
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,800
Mediocre

340
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,860
Sing, sing a song

341
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,320
Make it simple, so all the kids can sing along

342
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Sing along

343

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,280
You're in college now.

349
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,540
You're gonna learn how to be smart and obey well.

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,020
How to succeed the way they're teaching you to succeed.

351
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,620
When the lecture's over, get up promptly, make sure those buttocks are seared tight together,

352
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,660
so there's no drippage.

353
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:49,940
Walk out of your desk and towards the door with a discreet smile,

354
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,740
knowing that you know what very few of your friends know and have learned at that lecture.

355
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,380
Kids, take advantage of it.

356
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,840
Whatever it is.

357
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,560
LEARN TO UN Nurul

358
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,460
You can tell why things didn't work here early but it never got too close.

359
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,140
Just젤

360
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,200
Let me tell

361
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't lie

362
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,460
Believe in your dreams

363
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:31,680
ESPECIALLY

364
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:31,940
a year later

365
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:33,320
Mónica

366
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,320


367
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,800
Don't look at me.

368
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:34,920
I love you

369
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:34,920


370
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:41,980
Healthy

371
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:41,980


372
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:41,980


373
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,900
The garden is good.

374
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,680
The garden is good.

375
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,960
The penis is evil.

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
The penis is evil.

377
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,060
Amazing, dear friends.

378
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,640
That was Osama's Lament by the great DJ Reverend Dr. Imam.

379
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,500
And now, The Bobs.

380
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,500
Rip, dip, dip, dim, bum, buh-bye Rip, dip, dip, dip, dim, bum, buh-bye

381
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,780
I can't sit and face

382
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:12,180
I can't sit and face

383
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,440
face up to the facts

384
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,640
I'm tense and nervous

385
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,200
and I can't relax

386
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
I cannot sleep

387
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,760
cause my bed's on fire

388
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,020
Don't touch me

389
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
I'm a real live wire

390
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,120
Psycho killer

391
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
Kiss go see

Run run run away

404
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,040
You start a conversation

405
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
You can't even finish

406
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,480
You're talking a lot

407
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,460
But you're not saying

408
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,180
anything

409
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,280
When I have nothing

410
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,720
to say

411
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,960
My lips are sealed

412
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,880
Say something once

413
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,740
Why say it again

414
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
Psycho killer

415
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,620

Psycho killer

430
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,180
Rendered this time by

431
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,240
The Bob's

432
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,000
But worse things

433
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
Lay in store friends

434
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,220
Such as ESO Swamp Radio

435
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,600
From WCSB Cleveland

436
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,400
I wonder

437
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,940
You see a lot of PSAs

438
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,580
On the television

439
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,240
About people dying of ecstasy

440
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,620
How can that actually happen?

441
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,840
Is that a true falsehood

442
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
Or is that a false reality?

443
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,220
That's part of the

444
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,640
Global security act

445
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
The global security act?

446
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,040
Yeah it's against the law

447
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,460
To be un-sober now

448
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,960
Unless you're drunk

449
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,700
That's okay

450
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,960
But if you're anything else

451
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,140
It's not your right

452
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,000
To mess yourself up

453
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
Because it might embarrass

454
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,600
Joe Neighbor and Aunt Tilda

455
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,980
But how

456
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,020
So Dave what's your favorite

457
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,300
Club drug these days?

458
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,740
What's that stuff you snort like

459
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,120
Out of dirty sweat socks?

460
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,540
What's

461
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,620
Bengay

462
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,340
Bengay

463
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,200
How long have you been

464
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,680
Bengay?

465
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,660
A mini mini mini mini

466
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,280
Locker room

467
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,820
Dave goes to Metropolis

468
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,680
A bunch of Bengay

469
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
Smeared around his nose

470
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,940
Hey kid you like poppers?

471
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,360
Got some Bengay popper here

472
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,100
I really appreciate the thought

473
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,540
People have probably wondered

474
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,120
When Princess Wee and I

475
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,180
Are out at dance clubs

476
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,560
We pull out this little

477
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,940
Vial and Sprite stuff

478
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,960
On each other's tongue

479
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,280
And I bet people wonder

480
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,220
It's church air right?

481
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,720
What is that?

482
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,760
Is that that new

483
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,220
Are they

484
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,260
That's also covered

485
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,880
In the new

486
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,600
Rave act I think

487
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,200
What?

488
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:15,960
Sour candy

489
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,180
The universal global rave act

490
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,500
We're acid heads

491
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,440
That's a sign that you're

492
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,120
An acid head

493
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,240
Malic

494
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,020
Acid head

495
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,800
Citric acid

496
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,680
What's going on?

497
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,300
Malic acid

498
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,180
And other

499
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,000
Blow your head off

500
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,880
Sour candies

501
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,920
That's what I've been

502
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Reduced to

503
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,520
For getting high

504
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm telling you

505
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,840
You're relying on your

506
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,680
Shallow very glands

507
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,100
To give you the big buzz

508
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
The big buzz

509
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,600
Is getting

510
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,200
Time to sit down

511
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,060
Hey the lights

512
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,500
Are going down

513
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh wait a minute

514
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,440
Here they come

515
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,020
Whoa

516
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,200
You know I live a life

517
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,940
Of danger

518
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,060
For the FBI

519
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,460
Keeping heads

520
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,140
On our names

521
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,040
And on the land

522
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,760
On the sea

523
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,480
And the sky

524
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,740
And every single night

525
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
Before I go to bed

526
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,480
I get down on my knees

527
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,160
And say Bob

528
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,180
I'm a secret agent

529
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,020
Secret agent man

530
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,600
Secret agent man

531
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,460
Secret agent man

532
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,960
They're giving me

533
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,080
A number

534
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,960
But they take away

535
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
My name

536
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,780
I got one hell of a job

537
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,580
To perform

538
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,180
For the U.S. of A

539
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,300
Got the responsibility

540
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,820
Of our nation

541
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,520
Stopped security

542
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,160
And I got a job

543
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,500
For the FBI

544
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,500


545
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:43,940
But every night

546
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,540
And day

547
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,200
I salute the flag

548
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,820
And say

549
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,340
Thank you Connie

550
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,400
Cause I'm

551
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,920
I'm a secret agent man

552
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,460
Secret agent man

553
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Secret agent man

554
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,880
They're giving me

555
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,820
A number

556
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,900
But they take away

557
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,760
My name

558
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,460
Secret agent man

559
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,880
Secret agent man

560
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,620
I'm a強 agent man

561
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,160
That's the kind of inefficiency

562
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


563
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


564
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


565
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


566
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


567
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


568
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


569
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


570
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


571
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


572
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


573
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


574
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,160


575
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,100
Secret Agent Man

576
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,500
They've given me a number

577
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,560
But they take away my name

578
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,200
Secret Agent Man

579
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,040
Secret Agent Man

580
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,540
They've given me a number

581
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,620
But they take away my name

582
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,760
Secret Agent Man

583
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,040
By Santa Grouch

584
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,400
Although long time listeners would certainly recognize Santa Grouch

585
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,700
As actually being one of the amino acids

586
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,140
Secret Agent Man

587
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,120
Secret Agent Man

588
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,140
Secret Agent Man

589
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:23,360
Secret Agent Man

590
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,700
Secret Agent Man

591
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,780
Secret Agent Man

592
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Man I'm having a bad trip here

593
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,820
The voices in my studio are getting too messed up

594
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,620
They can't say the word

595
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,820
Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him

596
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,880
It's too messed up

597
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,820
My mind is melting

598
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,920
My mind is melting

599
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,180
Society often forgives the criminal

600
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,740
But never the dreamer

601
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,900
Not for a while

602
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,160
Good citizens, we're gathered here tonight to pay homage to a very special individual.

603
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,880
A literal giant of a man.

604
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,360
And perhaps the last one to ever grace this fair earth.

605
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,000
In ancient times, it was believed that the sons of heaven,

606
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,780
who we would consider extraterrestrials or angels, if you will,

607
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,780
copulated with the daughters of earth to bring forth a race of giants.

608
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,880
Gaius, Gilgamesh, Prometheus, Hercules, Goliath, Paul Bunyan, Abe Lincoln,

609
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,960
the late great Frederick Nietzsche, Xena, Warrior Princess.

610
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,240
These people were not mere giants of size and strength,

611
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
but also of mind and spirit as well.

612
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,400
They are our highest aspirations.

613
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,260
They are what makes us special and makes us good.

614
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,060
Sadly, with each passing generation, we lose a little bit more of that magic.

615
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,700
And we become increasingly more mundane and just plain normal.

616
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,980
Every now and then, a throwback born.

617
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,380
But due to the fact that ignorance hates excellence,

618
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,940
these individuals are rarely allowed to reach their full adult superhuman potential.

619
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,760
The year? 1918.

620
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,960
The place? A small mining town of Alton, Illinois.

621
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,060
And on a cold winter morning of February 22nd, Robert Piercing Wadlow was born.

622
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,280
Sweet mother nature squeezed out one last giant to walk upon this earth.

623
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,460
And ironically, when he exited her sweet rosy vagina,

624
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,700
Robert was an average baby, measuring 2 feet 3 inches, 9 pounds 8 ounces.

625
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,260
But he continued to grow at an alarming rate.

626
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,060
At 6 months of age, he was 3'6".

627
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,340
At 18 months, he was 4'9".

628
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,480
And by the time he was 8 years old, he had reached the gargantuan height of 6 feet tall.

629
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,420
Many like to dwell on the fact that at 13, Wadlow was the world's tallest boy scout.

630
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,500
But forget, at the same age, he had read and fully comprehended every book in the local public library.

631
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,580
For you see, Wadlow was not a mere giant of size.

632
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,040
He was a giant of intellect as well.

633
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,100
At 23 years of age,

634
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,760
Wadlow had reached the age of 1.5.

635
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:44,540
He was still growing, but it did qualify him as the tallest person in history,

636
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,020
as recorded in the Goods Book of World Records.

637
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,300
Nevertheless, this pygmy world was not meant for one such as he.

638
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,640
His suit required three times the normal amount of material.

639
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,640
His shoes, a size 37 foot.

640
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,500
A pair cost a whopping $100.

641
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,680
And keep in mind, this is a lot of money back in 1930's pre-air Jordan America.

642
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,780
During this period in his life, every circus, traveling carnival,

643
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,000
and freak show in the country was vying for Wadlow to work for them.

644
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,960
But he patently rejected all of their offers.

645
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,620
Though his family was poor and they could have used the money,

646
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,760
he refused to submit to being gawked at by an endless stream of illiterate sub-humanoid mouth breathers

647
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,500
and toothless pumpkin humpers.

648
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:28,380
For you see, Wadlow was a giant of size, strength, intellect, but also of moral conviction.

649
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,060
He knew that his great body, his great mind, had to serve a great purpose.

650
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,520
He would not allow himself to be degraded for the mere enjoyment of others.

651
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,620
He knew that all humanity must benefit.

652
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,720
Luckily at this time, financial relief came and saved him from a life of destitution.

653
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,360
The International Shoe Company, which custom made all of his shoes,

654
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,740
hired Robert to travel around the country and promote their line of fine and affordable footwear.

655
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,400
His father heroically modified the family car, removing out the front passenger seat

656
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,980
so that Robert could sit in the back and stretch out his mighty legs.

657
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,140
Together, the father and son team traveled over 300,000 miles and visited 800 towns in 41 states.

658
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,940
They were passing on more than 200,000 miles.

659
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,320
This was not just good will for the shoe company.

660
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,360
On this odyssey, Wadlow used his titanic strength to aid in countless barn raisings

661
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,660
and personally knocked down any local bullies or greedy landowners a peg or two.

662
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,920
Wadlow was spreading enlightenment to every person he encountered.

663
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,520
He spoke of a world filled with solar-powered hover cars, 40-pound grapefruits,

664
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,920
an abolishment of the prison system, and legalized marijuana for all.

665
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,500
For all!

666
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:36,880
He envisioned a society in which cloning and gasahol would enable us to no longer be dependent upon anyone but our own.

667
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:36,940


668
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,620
Our own resources. Our own ambition is what would drive us.

669
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,000
Virtual immortality and the line of sex slaves would be rampant throughout the society.

670
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,920
No one would ever have to suffer again.

671
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,300
He offered us a utopia in which everyone would cast a giant shadow from the light of their own souls.

672
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:00,120
And he would free us from the clandestine, reptoid overlords that had befouled this beautiful planet since the dawn of time.

673
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,460
Sadly, the powers that be ensured that Wadlow would never see his perfect world come to fruition.

674
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,660
While making an appearance in Mastey, Michigan on July 3, 1940, Wadlow succumbed to a mysterious foot injury.

675
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:18,440
Experts concluded that it was merely an infection stemming from the numerous blisters that the giant often incurred on his majestic feet.

676
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,560
Lies!

677
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,940
Undercover government agents had actually injected him with a rare form of gangrene that had been perfected by the Germans during World War I.

678
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,260
When did this happen?

679
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,100
Probably when the giant stopped off at a roadside truck stop to relieve his mighty bladder.

680
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,440
He checked himself into a hospital with a fever of 120 degrees.

681
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,700
The nurses and doctors were passing out heat that his body was radiating.

682
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,940
The bungling doctors didn't know what to do.

683
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,480
Their hospital couldn't accommodate someone of his size.

684
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,860
He ended up in a hotel across the street with a series of beds roped together to support him.

685
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,720
Friends and neighbors from all over rushed to his side.

686
00:35:52,940 --> 00:36:02,480
After an emergency blood transfusion from weaker humanoid stock, the infection lingered and his temperature continued to rise until at the precise stroke of midnight on July 15,

687
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,420
deersweet Wadlow shuffled off his weighty morgue.

688
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:16,000
The lucky few who gather around him say he bravely fought through the agonizing delirium from the mess of blood loss and morphine to utter these last words, which I quote here,

689
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:22,160
Lady Death has wide hips indeed. Being born was the hard part.

690
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,100
This dinner is our tribute to Robert Pearson Wadlow, poet, scholar, visionary, shoe salesman, and the giant within us all.

691
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:30,960
Wadlow!

692
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,780
The great Wadlow.

693
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,640
Really an amazing recording.

694
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,380
Uh...

695
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,600
Um...

696
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,860
Done by our friend Reverend Jason Bell.

697
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,140
With his friends Debbie Schwartz and Corey Smith.

698
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:52,060
Wadlow, the great American giant, and now revealed to be the great American subgenius.

699
00:36:53,020 --> 00:37:00,840
Crash in the hall, top of the tables, dragging the rug, sun-venting, not kneeling.

700
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,820
My head at an angle, scraping the ceiling.

701
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,480
I give up and stretch the length of a hallway.

702
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,200
My arms are too wide and I stick like a snake that got stuck in the hose.

703
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,560
But the water won't run and push me back outwards.

704
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:24,460
Nothing is moving and the world is too small and the trees are like flowers.

705
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,840
Midget mother, mother me.

706
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,760
Arms that love cannot hold me.

707
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,600
Eyes that see are seen.

708
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,400
Am I a confusion?

709
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,540
Am I a confusion?

710
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,620
Am I a confusion?

711
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,220
No.

712
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:03,120
Yards of fabric, so much to close me, swallow me backwards, garb for a giant.

713
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,580
I cannot hold on anymore.

714
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,580


715
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:04,580


716
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,040
I play, I trample the teammates

717
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,120
My footprint's too large and my voice is too heavy

718
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,040
Seven sisters hang in the night sky

719
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,180
Where do I come from? Why won't you take me?

720
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,020
White crescent moon, the dagger's above me

721
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,980
Creator, protector, did you ever love me?

722
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Midget mother, mother me

723
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,960
Arms of love cannot hold me

724
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,780
Eyes that see are seeing me

725
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,940
Am I a confusion? Am I a confusion?

726
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:51,240
The Wadlow Song

727
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,060
Jason Bell

728
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,520
Corey Smith

729
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,840
and Debbie Schwartz

730
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,060
Step up, kids. It's time to make your mark in the world.

731
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,680
Just look carefully into the monitor.

732
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,180
As the globe drifts by, so do you.

733
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Drift slowly into your own gorgeous dreams.

734
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,800
I have no dreams.

735
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,860
Well, that's a common plight now.

736
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,440
People have been stopped from dreaming by the dream police.

737
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,060
And there is a dream police out there.

738
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,840
I don't know how far out they are, but I know they're somewhere around here.

739
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,840
They're not only correct.

740
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,180
They don't reflect our dreams, but they interject strange ideas that we have to carry through the next day.

741
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,220
And this is what's happening to so many of our students nowadays.

742
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,540
Their dreams have been co-opted.

743
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,560
Some by the circus folk.

744
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,820
Some by the government of the USA.

745
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,700
Some by the shallow-haired, small, smooth-shaven, bald-headed men in Langley, Virginia.

746
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,240
And the white coats.

747
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,680
Yeah, you're lucky if you get one with the white coats.

748
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,000
The ones with the little pink badges are so much worse.

749
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,540
They want to go deep into your psyche.

750
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,720
So kids, remember, the next time you sign up for a class, give it up.

751
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,440
Forget about school.

752
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,540
Yeah, well, they are giving it up now because I think tuition went up like 15%.

753
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,660
15% from what?

754
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,980
You know, you know what I mean?

755
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,560
Each semester.

756
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,820
This is a state institution.

757
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,180
15% from last semester.

758
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:33,320
And every state institution I've ever been in, you've got three squares a day.

759
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,700
They didn't give you any food.

760
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,780
They would just give you these little plastic squares.

761
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,760
It's kind of like that.

762
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,240
And they give you like a Ronald McDonald's toy.

763
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,480
And they would give you a good licking.

764
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,780
And then they'd give you a beating afterwards.

765
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,180
But I didn't squirm.

766
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,620
I knew one of those days I was going to get the third degree.

767
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,740
I think this is a different kind of institution, but some of the same things happen.

768
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,920
Well, they can't.

769
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,540
They cannot happen.

770
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,200
They keep repeating themselves over and over again.

771
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,940
That's the hell of this dimension and this university.

772
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,460
Hey.

773
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,880
Hey, you know, tomorrow when you go to class, stand up in class.

774
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,680
Just stand up in class, in the middle of class.

775
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,940
Wait until the professor stops and looks at you and just say,

776
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,300
Go to hell.

777
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,120
Go to hell, man.

778
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,780
Just throw the brick in the wall, dude.

779
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,880
Like, go to hell, man.

780
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah, but these children.

781
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,900
Like, I'm challenging you.

782
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:27,900


783
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm challenging your authority.

784
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,540
No, these kids don't have it in them, Chaz.

785
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,000
They don't have the spism and the squank to observe the authorities.

786
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:43,180
Weren't you telling them earlier in your show that they needed to revolt and march in the streets like in the 60s and all that about something?

787
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:52,940
But Dr. Leguim said that as long as he can get a hamburger from his car, everything's okay and there's no reason to complain.

788
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,040
But what about the day you can't get that?

789
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,560
Then it's too late to ask.

790
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,800
Those days are coming soon, Stan.

791
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,440
And on top of that.

792
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,840
The day comes, all of a sudden, there is no more hamburger from your car.

793
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,880
That might be too late to ask.

794
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,620
You might go into one of these days and they give you a severed hand or something.

795
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,500
Well, he found out that those burgers were killing him anyway and he had to quit eating them.

796
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,660
Now when a good time turns around.

797
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,320
You must quit it.

798
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,660
You will never live it down.

799
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,920
Unless you whip it.

800
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,900
You know that no one gets away.

801
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,800
Till they whip it.

802
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,660
I said whip it.

803
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,700
Why don't you whip it.

804
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,020
Come on and whip it, whip it.

805
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,980
It's time to whip it, whip it, whip it.

806
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,160
I'll pay you if you whip it.

807
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,280
Come on and whip it, whip it, whip it.

808
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,380
I'll whip it.

809
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,280
Whip it itself.

810
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,980
The Devo song, a cover by Big Daddy.

811
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,020
And now, another horrible cover by The Bobs.

812
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,980
My brain.

813
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,760
They click.

814
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,960
The things.

815
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,980
They don't seem the same

816
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,840
Acting funny

817
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,920
But I don't know why

818
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,460
Excuse me

819
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,720
While I kiss the sky

820
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,600
The blaze all around

821
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,000
Don't know if I'm coming up or down

822
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,500
Never happy or in misery

823
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,580
Well, who is that girl who put a spell on me?

824
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:51,680
Well, who is that girl who put a spell on me?

825
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,720
Yes, dear friends, I should probably explain the piece that I'm about to play.

826
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:09,740
Now, you know, I put this show, The Hour of Slack, together in my home office castle studio.

827
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:17,200
But on Thursday nights, I go into the station at WCSB, Cleveland State University,

828
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:27,080
and join Professor Chaz Smith on his live radio show, the last part of it, about midnight at 1230,

829
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,960
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and so forth.

830
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,440
And we get these callers, and there's been this regular mystery caller over the last year or two.

831
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:44,640
Every now and then, we'll get this call from this guy that we call, or whatever it is, that we call the Oh Yeah Guy.

832
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,180
This last week, we got a...

833
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:58,760
Well, I don't know how to put it, but the Oh Yeah Man, or being, I don't know.

834
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,040
It was time to acknowledge his presence.

835
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:11,440
And here, we will hear when he first calls in to ESO Swamp Radio, the Oh Yeah Man.

836
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,760
Oh yeah.

837
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,140
Oh yeah.

838
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,040
And I think you're losing my point, whether or not...

839
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,020
Oh yeah.

840
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,560
Oh yeah.

841
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,900
Oh yeah.

842
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,360
Oh yeah.

843
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,620
Oh yeah.

844
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,480
Oh yeah.

845
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,060
Oh yeah.

846
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,560
Oh yeah.

847
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Oh yeah.

848
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:16,460
I got rid of the wrong one.

849
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,060
Damn!

850
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,480
That is no wrong one.

851
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,520
There's no right one.

852
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,860
You got rid of something, and it's coming back.

853
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:24,780
Look, listen.

854
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,160
Oye nomas.

855
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,280
It's the real oye.

856
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,240
Oye.

857
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,440
Not the false oye.

858
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:31,580
Oye.

859
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,400
I see an elderly woman in the basement masturbating furiously to a picture book.

860
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,640
It looks like...

861
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,080
No, no, it's the face of a giant...

862
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,320
I just tried to bleep out my...

863
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,520
...facial bathtub.

864
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,160
Oye.

865
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,720
Yes, she's about 79 years of age.

866
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,180
She's got one good eye, and the other one going skyward like a...

867
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,540
The prophet of oye is on.

868
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,080
Oye.

869
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,000
Oye.

870
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,100
Poor bleepo got direct casted into the...

871
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,420
Talk about...

872
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,640
I think we should sit back and just relax.

873
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,760
Oye is the very least.

874
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,700
Oh, yeah, man.

875
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,340
Oye.

876
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,340
Oye.

877
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,200
Oye.

878
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,800
Oye.

879
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,420
Oye.

880
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,300
Oye.

881
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,620
Oye.

882
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,180
Oye.

883
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,880
Oye.

884
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,240
Oye.

885
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,320
Oye.

886
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:37,600


887
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,000
Oye.

888
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,040
Oye.

889
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,420
Oye.

890
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,900
It's the live sex portion of the ESO broadcast.

891
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,520
I don't think it's sex at all.

892
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,440
I think it's one oi, and he's doing it over through a machine,

893
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,000
so that's why you hear the slap back.

894
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,820
You can hear the recurrence.

895
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,380
That's your wishful thinking.

896
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,580
It sounds like small children regurgitating in the background

897
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,020
if they've eaten all the cookies.

898
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,520
Oh, yeah.

899
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,160
Oh, yeah.

900
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,020
They sure did.

901
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,280
I think maybe that's why they can't communicate a la Whipley.

902
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,920
His head's melting.

903
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,040
Bring him up on the screen a little bit.

904
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,920
Wow, look at that head melting away.

905
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,360
I've got to admit, I've wondered what had happened to this.

906
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,040
The oi, god.

907
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,280
What's the etymology?

908
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,040
Whatever it is.

909
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,600
What's the etymology of the oi, god?

910
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,820
Or the oi, loop, or the machine intelligence that does this.

911
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,200
I think someone captured a sound and looped it and played it back in this planet.

912
00:49:59,580 --> 00:49:59,940
Oi.

913
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,360
Oi.

914
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,340
Oi.

915
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:04,100
I think it's an actual person.

916
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,180
Actual, actual, actual.

917
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,500
He is radio static.

918
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,400
He's not real.

919
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,680
He is radio static.

920
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,280
You want to believe it's not real, but it's just real.

921
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,760
Radio static is real as your face, Dave.

922
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,000
Radio static is real, especially when it makes the right connections in the brain, isn't it?

923
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,080
Thank you once again, Mr. and Mrs. Foxy.

924
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,120
It's time to warm up our pants and get dancing.

925
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,560
What Bob did to Ted, oh yeah, did to us.

926
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,580
He's done it to so many.

927
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,360
He's done it to so many.

928
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,160
You think about it.

929
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,140
He just slid it in a little bit.

930
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,260
And twisted it like a knife.

931
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,620
He twisted it like a knife.

932
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,780
It's a mantra.

933
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,260
Yeah, that's got to hurt.

934
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,600
It's a mantra.

935
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,300
I mean, what does it impart?

936
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,580
Oh yeah, it's a word for a smart man.

937
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,220
What does it impart?

938
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,820
There's factories with thousands of people at them all muttering under their breath, oi.

939
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,580
Oi.

940
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,080
See what they've done to this country?

941
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:13,280
All the factories for the, oi, are in Mexico or in Saipan or in Cebu City.

942
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,120
Or some of those places where they have big musketeers.

943
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:15,800
Oh no, there's some.

944
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,160
There's ones in California and Texas and probably Ohio.

945
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,960
Oh yeah, maquidores.

946
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,200
Factories full of oi people.

947
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,280
Yeah, little tiny, teeny maquidores behind a regular place made out of boxes and stuff.

948
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,180
Old ones, young ones, but they're all muttering under their breath as they were, oi.

949
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:38,280
A solemn cadence as they march through their tasks, their dreary, dreary ordeal every day.

950
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,160
Oye.

951
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,720
Oye.

952
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,300
In Spanish it means...

953
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,940
Look, man.

954
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,240
Oye.

955
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:45,960
Look, man.

956
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,180
Oye, hombre.

957
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,740
Oiga.

958
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,900
It's the power.

959
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,260
The power and the glory of oye.

960
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,660
You have no idea what oye can get you through.

961
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,500
All the hard times, the rough times, and everything is really, really, really hard.

962
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,020
Then you just say, oye.

963
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,380
Oye.

964
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:05,780
Oye.

965
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,060
And then you can get through.

966
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,600
You can get through anything.

967
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,680
Oye.

968
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,100
Oye.

969
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:17,740
Oye.

970
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,500
What does it mean?

971
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,960
But then, what does our very...

972
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,420
What do our very lives mean, my friends?

973
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:36,760
Well, we'll learn not only that, but also why the Martians are so crucial to our nuclear beer.

974
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,520
And even the Martian War in Series 9.

975
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,680
Ready?

976
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:41,980
Hello.

977
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,260
Now I can't hear it, okay?

978
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:43,520
Let's go.

979
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:43,800
Ready?

980
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,740
I'm hearing everything.

981
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:44,960
All right.

982
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,200
Applause.

983
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,380
Thank you very much.

984
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,380
Jesus.

985
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,920
You want all that echo and s*** in there?

986
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,360
Okay.

987
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,680
Thank you very much.

988
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,880
Can we turn him down?

989
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,180
Oh, s***.

990
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,680
Damn it, Jeff.

991
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,480
You don't even need a microphone.

992
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,820
Just take a s*** off of it.

993
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,080
Thank you very much.

994
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
You're welcome, Kinky.

995
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,200
Thank you very much.

996
00:52:59,220 --> 00:52:59,820
You're welcome.

997
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,580
Thank you.

998
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,060
Thank you.

999
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,700
You're very welcome.

1000
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,180
Many thanks.

1001
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,280
Many thanks to you.

1002
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Thank you very much.

1003
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,620
You're welcome, Kinky.

1004
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,360
Thank you.

1005
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:06,880
You're welcome.

1006
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,960
Thank you very much.

1007
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,200
You're welcome, Kinky.

1008
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,060
Now, don't put me up on a pedestal now.

1009
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,860
I don't want to.

1010
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,000
Thank you very much.

1011
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,780
You're welcome.

1012
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,740
Many thanks.

1013
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,680
So welcome to you, Kinky.

1014
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,480
Thank you very much.

1015
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,620
You're welcome, Kinky.

1016
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,440
No, no.

1017
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:24,820
Don't get it.

1018
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,400
Do your original.

1019
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:25,840
Oh.

1020
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,680
What is it?

1021
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,640
You're welcome, Kinky.

1022
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,740
Just the standard.

1023
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,160
Go back.

1024
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,600
Thank you very much.

1025
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,780
You're welcome, Kinky.

1026
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,660
Thank you.

1027
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,280
You're welcome.

1028
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:33,920
Many thanks.

1029
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,100
You're welcome, Kinky.

1030
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,240
Many, many thanks.

1031
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,300
You're very welcome.

1032
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,200
Mucus Garcia.

1033
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,240
Same back to you.

1034
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,600
Thank you very much.

1035
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,220
And me too.

1036
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,960
Thank you.

1037
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,460
You're welcome.

1038
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,220
Thank you very much!

1039
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,200
You're welcome, Kinky.

1040
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:46,900
Thank you!

1041
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,580
You're welcome.

1042
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,240
You're not getting the you're welcome, Kinky.

1043
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,180
Well, you do!

1044
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,820
You didn't, you know, the you're welcome, Kinky.

1045
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,780
You're welcome, Kinky.

1046
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,580
Yeah, I guess it was.

1047
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,160
Nothing this way.

1048
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,560
What do you do with Wayland Jenners old days?

1049
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,600
The first time.

1050
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,120
Thank you very much!

1051
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,220
You're welcome, Kinky.

1052
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,760
No!

1053
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,200
Damn it, something's wrong with that, Jeff.

1054
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,260
You're welcome, Kinky.

1055
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,320
You're welcome, Kinky.

1056
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,280
Yeah, that was what it was.

1057
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,400
All right.

1058
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,860
Thank you very much!

1059
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,120
You're welcome, Kinky.

1060
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,960
Thank you!

1061
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:12,580
You're welcome.

1062
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,440
Many thanks.

1063
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,560
You're welcome, Kinky.

1064
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,260
Thank you.

1065
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,800
You're welcome.

1066
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,900
Do we have enough to work with her?

1067
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,480
You didn't record that?

1068
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,560
What the hell's going on here?

1069
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,620
Thank you very much.

1070
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,580
You're welcome, Kinky.

1071
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,400
Thank you.

1072
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,000
You're welcome.

1073
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,500
Many thanks.

1074
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,760
You're so very, so very welcome.

1075
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,340
Thank you.

1076
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,560
You're welcome, Kinky.

1077
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,540
You've been a wonderful crowd.

1078
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,460
Well, thank you.

1079
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,160
Thank you very much.

1080
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,660
No, thank you.

1081
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,460
You're welcome, Kinky.

1082
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:36,920
All right.

1083
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,720
I hope they were...

1084
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,040
Was anything recorded?

1085
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,760
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,380
Oh, yeah.

1087
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh yeah.

1088
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,440
Oh yeah.

1089
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,140
Oh yeah.

1090
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,180
Oh yeah.

1091
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,940
Can you get to that one?

1092
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,500
Can you get to that one?

1093
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,820
Can you get to that one?

1094
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,940
I think he's getting to it.

1095
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,140
Oh yeah.

1096
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,020
Oh yeah.

1097
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,460
Don't be afraid.

1098
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,080
When the thing goes down,

1099
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,360
it's going down.

1100
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,360
Go towards the light.

1101
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,360
Keep your eyes looking skyward.

1102
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,020
Keep your nostrils firm and erect

1103
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,600
like the rest of the perfect sky

1104
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,940
on those tiny little parts.

1105
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,980
When the light comes to you,

1106
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,740
I'll run with you.

1107
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,580
When you're ready,

1108
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,500
I'll take that.

1109
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,840
I'll take that.

1110
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,640
Oh yeah.

1111
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,440
Well,

1112
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,000
oh yeah.

1113
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,860
Until next week,

1114
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,900
keep your head on tight.

1115
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,740
Back to the Wings.

1116
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,440
Zach and Bill.

1117
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,720
And now,

1118
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,320
as we say farewell,

1119
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,320
a little bit of Al Tijuana

1120
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,820
with the Peter Gunn theme.

1121
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,540
Praise Bob.

1122
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,060
Have a nudge.

1123
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,180
Have a treat.

1124
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,760
First we'll play,

1125
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,260
and then we'll eat.

1126
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1127
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,180
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1128
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,700
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1129
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,980
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1130
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:35,480
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1131
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,420
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1132
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,540
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1133
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,080
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1134
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,120
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1135
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,100
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1136
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,980
Al Tijuana meets Peter Gunn.

1137
