1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling for an anti-PR news.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,140
Italian, Italian, Italians gathered below.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,080
The difficulties are complicated by Parkinson's disease, which causes gradual tracheotomy to everyone.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,500
The Pope released the journalist before he shot himself in the head.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,640
What happened?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,580
PR's police chief says Iran says it needs atomic weapons to make PR news.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,800
No!

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,240
I don't want this!

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,240
Therapy.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,440
Therapy.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,820
I don't need therapy.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
What the hell is this?

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,280
The Self Genius Powerhouse Watch.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,980
Liar! Liar, liar!

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,140
Don't worry, just relax.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,260
I'm cute now, like you.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm cute now, like you.

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm cute now, like you.

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,360
No one can do it better.

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,640
Kick it!

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,720
Another UFO sighting.

22
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,120
This one, front page headlines.

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,260
Another hour of slack.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
A small, dedicated moment of misery.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,100
As the turtles melt into the river.

26
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,940
And now a satanic Elvis arrives in his UFO.

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
His skin is so blue, like Krishna.

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,120
Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something?

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,760
Coffee?

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,340
Coffee break!

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,940
Nice hot espresso enema for you, sir.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
I mean, Mr. King.

33
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,360
Coffee can only make me nervous when I drink it.

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,960
You look like a man.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,120
A man who could use more coffee.

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,520
Free coffee is a constitutional right.

37
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,460
You got any coffee? Coffee?

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,140
Yeah, coffee.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,300
No, I don't drink coffee.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,020
That, sir, is illogical.

41
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,020
Nothing like a great cup of black coffee.

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,320
How to drink coffee, sir?

43
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,300
Hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat.

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,120
Would you please?

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,820
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
Everybody take coffee.

48
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:18,980
Now.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,920
Mob!

50
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,220
Damn, Jimmy.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,040
This is serious gourmet.

52
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,540
Mob.

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,580
It's the best, man. I got it from a

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,000
Stank.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,120
My advice to you.

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,620
You should start drinking heavily.

57
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,720
What is this?

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm not saying, but I can tell you that it's fairly rare and very unstable.

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,080
I like my coffee like I like my women.

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,120
Frappy.

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,080
Bitter and murky.

62
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, you'll like this coffee.

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,800
It's fresh.

64
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,780
Drink up, lad.

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,140
What is that?

66
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,820
Thank you, sir.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,780
That's strange.

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,700
All of a sudden, I don't quite feel like myself.

69
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,980
Do you feel like once the paparazzi ran us their friends?

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,240
Get a rest?

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,820
Get a rest?

72
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,080
Get a rest?

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,020
Get a rest?

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,820
Put that coffee down.

75
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Too bad.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,140
Just to be a good man.

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,600
I pray we're gonna have to liberate George.

78
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,880
But you know what's on my mind right now?

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,540
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,860
It's the dead Bob in my garage.

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,260
Have you got a dead Bob in your garage, my friend?

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,840
How many times are you gonna kill that old sod before he finally wakes up to what you're doing out there?

83
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,660
Don't you care?

84
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,880
Don't you even care about the children of the dead Bobs?

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,600
With alacrity and with a great amount of aplenty,

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,900
we must announce the parents of the millions of dead Bobs in garages around the country.

87
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,260
They're leaving their garages.

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Suburban Mr. and Mrs. America have wake up calls.

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,880
Lots of coffee.

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:51,500
And now the army of Bob clones emerges from the garages as far as the eye can see down the long line of suburban driveways.

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,380
Followed by the corpses of the Armenian olive stuffers.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,340
It looks like quite an entourage.

93
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,120
I can smell the smoke in the distance.

94
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,420
I don't know if some of them are being smoked or are actually smoking themselves.

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,540
It looks like quite a cloud.

96
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,420
These Dobbs clones, as they're called, are the perfect smoking machine.

97
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:25,960
And as well as the perfect selling machine, have decimated the economies and the air of every city they have passed through in this wave of destruction.

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,380
And sales.

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,500
Now, Terb, I'd just like to make one thing I'd like to ask the panel here,

100
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,080
Miss Wee and the turbulent Ivan Stenguefew.

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,720
Many of these corpses appear to have been eviscerated,

102
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,780
and yet they managed to make steam, as it were.

103
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,680
I don't know whether it's the cold weather or the fact that they've been eating the wrong things.

104
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:53,040
Well, they're freshly dead, the Dobbs clones, when they're finished using them.

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,940
I hope I don't have to spell that out.

106
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,820
Leave the corpses, the used pinks, as they call them, behind.

107
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:10,940
And of course, there's no natural scavengers or predators to dispose of the bodies anymore,

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,320
as the Dobbs have also had their way with the buzzards and so forth as well.

109
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,920
Well, there's plenty of that natural...

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,140
It's a serious, serious situation.

111
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
There's plenty of it.

112
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,920
We're hearing right now, at least, that there's plenty of that natural jelly surrounding them.

113
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,280
Most of the corpses that have fallen in the mud...

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,180
Well, everywhere these Dobbs clones go, as you know, they leave the cotter pins and the jelly.

115
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,000
No one understands that. It's been going on for decades now.

116
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,320
Well, they go loose as soon as we pull the pin on them.

117
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes, that's exactly right.

118
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,680
Just as bad as any bad Romero or good Romero films we've seen in the last 500 years.

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,380
These shuffling dead Dobbs are certainly the most horrible manifestation of religious cultism,

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,760
superstitious nonsense.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,560
Oh my God! No! They're coming to the station now!

122
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh my God! Oh my God!

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,560
Well, we just thought a methamphetamine lab blew up down by the river,

124
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,160
and next thing we knew, we were covered with pipes and honkers.

125
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,740
That's not funny, man. Methamphetamines are the scourge of the po-buckers of America.

126
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,160
They're the scourge of Christ.

127
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,500
I lost a lot of friends to bathtub meth.

128
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,540
Well, we lost the Lord. He was actually squashed.

129
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,800
I lost a...

130
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,780
The plug of the drain where they made the bathtub meth.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,320
Jello.

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,480
To bathtub meth.

133
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
It became as vapid as...

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,400
No, it just ate up the...

135
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,540
Vapor.

136
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,340
Yeah, vaporized the plug.

137
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,280
Very plug.

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,860
Meth vaporizes the plug in your head, my friend, so that nothing...

139
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,800
You know, it all builds up and it can't drain out.

140
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,220
And you know, sooner or later, it's gonna have to leak out.

141
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,960
Oh, man.

142
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,060
Look at the corpus callosum.

143
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,380
It's dried like a prune.

144
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,140
Hey, there's talk now of a Columbus devival.

145
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,340
You didn't hear about that.

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,880
No.

147
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,700
That Reverend Janina Grinder was gonna put on somewhere around Columbus.

148
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,280
And the band that's...

149
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:15,160
One of the bands that's gonna be there along with loathsome cow-frunk Dave and the retarded creatures of slime was Stylix.

150
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,080
Stylix.

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh, man.

152
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,320
Stylix.

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,500
Stylix.

154
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,600


155
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:40,880
We have air on the air, man!

156
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,020
Good god.

157
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,020


158
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,020


159
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,020


160
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,020


161
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,300
Esquire of S.I.M.

162
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,300


163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,940
Anddzyles.

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
De null match!

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Fuck.

166
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,840
We took a drink and looked outside

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,300
We always wait until we die

168
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
The greatest thing I ever had

169
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,260
Came to pass and then I said

170
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,180
I like women just like to fly

171
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,740
That doesn't mean it has to be mine

172
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,640
The greatest dream you ever had

173
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,180
You know the truth inside your head

174
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,220
We took a drink and looked outside

175
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,100
We always wait until we die

176
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Take on our future

177
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,480
Take on our future

178
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,480
Take on our future

179
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Thetrustm mile a难

180
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,660
On Miniature

181
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:52,660


182
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:52,660


183
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:52,660


184
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,640
Like I said

185
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,260
It's time for bed

186
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,820
We both wake up

187
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,480
We both get treatment

188
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,020
Like I said

189
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,660
It's time for bed

190
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,160
We both wake up

191
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,960
We both get treatment

192
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,660
Like I said

193
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,200
It's time for bed

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,320
If we drink we will

195
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
We both get treatment

196
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,820
Like I said

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,600
It's time for bed

198
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:13,640
It's time for bed

199
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:13,720
We both get treatment

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm not doing a good job taking the bottom 30% of PR's military

201
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,860
figurehead national federal and people's governments that might pass skeptical plans to change

202
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,400
the bottom 30% of PR news in Washington.

203
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm not doing a good job taking the bottom 30% of PR news in Washington, I'm not doing

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:31,380
a good job taking the bottom 30% of PR news in Washington, I'm not doing a good job taking

205
00:11:31,400 --> 00:12:01,380
the bottom 30% of PR news in Washington, I'm not doing a good job taking the bottom 30%

206
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:30,700
of PR news in Washington, I'm not doing a good job taking the bottom 30% of PR news

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:13:01,380
in Washington, I'm not doing a good job taking the bottom 30% of PR news in Washington, I'm

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,020
singing.

209
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,660
Singing.

210
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,400
Singing.

211
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,900
That's her song.

212
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:29,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm the complication of the scar tissue that has caused the lower

213
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,620
lung to collapse.

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,820
The BBC opened fire on a civilian vehicle last Friday on the road to PR News, Washington.

215
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,940
Yeah, I am mindful that we're all sinners.

216
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,100
It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

217
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,480
I experimented with marijuana a time or two and I didn't like it.

218
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,420
I didn't inhale and never tried it again.

219
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,940
Yeah, I am mindful that we're all sinners.

220
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,200
Go on, chief, go on back to your tribe.

221
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,560
This was a reference to an individual.

222
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,800
Go on, before you get hurt.

223
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,540
Go on, chief.

224
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,980
You got a gun?

225
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,520
Who had a very large penis.

226
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,940
Yeah, right.

227
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,040
And he used the name that he had been referred to in the pornographic material.

228
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,960
Big Bob.

229
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,340
Yeah, that's what they call him.

230
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,160
Big Bob.

231
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Do you recall what it was?

232
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,720
Oh, yeah, it's not a form of socialization.

233
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,640
The name that was referred to was Long Dong Silver.

234
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,720
Yeah, I am mindful that we're all sinners.

235
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,660
Bob.

236
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,400
Congenitally innocent.

237
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,740
Term.

238
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,220
Long.

239
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:31,860
Dong.

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,600
Silver.

241
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,100
In conversation with Professor Hill.

242
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,400
Had you?

243
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,180
We're killing for God.

244
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,580
Killing for God.

245
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,260
That's number one on the religious channel's top ten.

246
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,980
Killing for God.

247
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,820
Holding up, I'm going to kill all your women and children because that's what God wants.

248
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,440
And God gave this land to us and he also gave us these tanks.

249
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,120
So fuck off.

250
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,360
Killing for God.

251
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,780
Killing for God.

252
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,200
That's all Joe and I did, Dom.

253
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
Killing for you.

254
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:57,840
Killing for you.

255
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,160
With the Bible in one hand.

256
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,880
Killing for you.

257
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,700
And the tech nine in the other.

258
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,840
How about one of them little small little angel rad nuclear devices?

259
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,800
Oh, for me, I like this old Russian RPG.

260
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,420
Take out half a damn building while I'm courting for Leviticus 597.

261
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,340
E!

262
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:21,960
Ah.

263
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,640
Ah.

264
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Killing today, friends.

265
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,860
And killing for God.

266
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,720
Killing for God.

267
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,860
This is what we see of our own existence.

268
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,840
Killing for God.

269
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,620
There are so many ways we can express ourselves in this life.

270
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:59,820
And one of my favorites has always been to pick up a bludgeon or a truncheon and beat some elderly person silly, perhaps for death, and read to him the book of God.

271
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,800
And buy yourself a wild planet in a

272
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,220
impersonal dimension.

273
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,360
I, for GEAR 1 you lost.

274
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,360


275
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,260
Toll Labs to eaten fucking

276
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,100
Way if you would like to mie

277
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,260
I'

278
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,140
чит

279
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,420
I

280
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,680
read

281
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:11,680


282
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:11,760
eat

283
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,200
I smoke María

284
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,340
little vermin. He's an example of the worst scum that ever walked the earth, the criminal

285
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,480
cat. Look at that strange doliosophallic skull, the narrow set eyes, the quivering rabbit-like

286
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:32,620
chin, ever moist with a veneer of spittle, the long cadaverous twitching hands, the clashing

287
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,660
badly coordinated suit, vest, and tie combination, the Ralph Lauren polo shirt with the tiny

288
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:45,720
engraved polo ponies, and last but not least, that disgusting syphilitic wart right in the

289
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,280
center of his inflamed nose. It looked like a cat scratched him across the forehead, and

290
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:58,000
it seemed like a good idea, so I brought out Tabby, and I let him have it. This man's been

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,280
scratched by a cat over a hundred times. Call an ambulance. Here comes the dog patrol, and

292
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,240
not a moment too soon.

293
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:19,160
Another bulldog drumming, my pleasure. Out of the fog comes one relentless man, with

294
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,620
his underthrust jaw ready to bite out a chunk of crime.

295
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,340
That's you, friend, I hope.

296
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,780
Yes, it's you. Don't forget that most of you have the deviated septum for a damned or darn

297
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,920
good reason. That's where the implant goes, and that's where you get your directives.

298
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,500
I love big ol'

299
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:39,880
brother.

300
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,940
I love him so much, I wrote a poem to him last night.

301
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:52,540
You are king of the entire Tyra. Please come and let me breathe some air. My rectum and

302
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,260
the rest of my body's not free. I enjoy living in a station with...

303
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,240
Hey, wait, what?

304
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,220
With we.

305
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,000
With we.

306
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,660
With we.

307
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,520
Princess we.

308
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,620
A station, a place to stop for a moment.

309
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
Friends, let's stop for a moment.

310
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:17,060
And tell what we heard. That the crime report there was, of course, Dr. Howell, the toast

311
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,360
of San Francisco on the bread and butter of San Francisco, which I guess would be the

312
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,880
KPFA show of shows, the subgenius show without any name like that.

313
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
And he doesn't have syphilis on his work like I do.

314
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,620
Eh, well, now don't speak too soon.

315
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,180
Okay.

316
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:33,500


317
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,600
We, uh, uh, Norrell Preff did a whole lot of the cool, cool, cool collage.

318
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,120
That were happening in there, uh, such as the living specimen and the all sinners routine

319
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,980
there with, uh, George and so forth. Uh, but, uh, killing for God, I think was punked up

320
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:59,820
by Phineas Narco of National Cynical Network, which you can, uh, reach at nationalcynical.com.

321
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,940
Oh, Norrell Preff is available at heavyconfetti.com.

322
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,220
And, uh,

323
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,520
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is not available at all.

324
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm not a veteran either.

325
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,680
I was spared the last war.

326
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm bird-dogging princess.

327
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,820
We are done.

328
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,540
He's not a veteran.

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,780
And she's bird-dogging yours.

330
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,400
Truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

331
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,660
No, no, no, no, man.

332
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,920
You're not a bird-dog.

333
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,820
You're a joker.

334
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,320
Got to bird-dog him.

335
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,080
I wonder why we, I'm sorry, didn't mean to get in between different actions.

336
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,260
Oh, no, no, no.

337
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,960
There's nothing.

338
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,520
There's nothing happening at all now.

339
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,220
No, no.

340
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,680
I just wondered why.

341
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,180
It's all for you, Dave.

342
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Killing for God.

343
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,660
Why this is so emblematic of our culture and our human race.

344
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,860
What do you mean our culture?

345
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,420
Whose culture is that not emblematic of?

346
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm not saying.

347
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm saying ours is human beings or human beings, whichever, like, you know, deformed vegetables you want.

348
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Could we not rise above that which is base and human and animal?

349
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,020
If our go-match was stimulated, perhaps, correctly, we could see the other side.

350
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,000
Perhaps not genius.

351
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,620
For that must be going the wrong direction.

352
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,580
But sub-geniuses.

353
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,780
Those who burrow under the underthings, under the groundwork of all cultural relativity.

354
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:28,540
Those who dig a hole under the magnanimous structures of the old culture and let it fall in underneath you like a temperature.

355
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,040
The termites in the foundations, one might say.

356
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,200
Each individual termite is a relatively powerless little force of slag.

357
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,420
But all told, together, working completely unconnectedly.

358
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,760
Why those termites can bring down your house.

359
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,620
The tombs of sub-genius ideas.

360
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,120
Your neighbor's house.

361
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,620
The cop station down the street.

362
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,100
Bringing down your cerebellum.

363
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,120
I want to bring down your religious constructs.

364
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,260
That brings me down.

365
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,720
All your sociopathological lies you tell yourself.

366
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,340
I couldn't help it.

367
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Maybe you are there with too much passion.

368
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,820
Or too hard with attention for anything.

369
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,660
But soon, you will be surrounded.

370
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:19,680


371
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,520
in this till adjust fornoj noir himself.

372
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,640
But even so.

373
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,560
A humble Roheth the Gypsy act alone.

374
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,200
Who, neither with a grin nor chic inside partetherur to creepyITT

375
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,360
We wouldn't hope it comin' husband.

376
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:34,780
I don't need грats anywhere.

377
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:34,840
But you want to see rust.

378
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
Just we won't make it.

379
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:36,740
Cutマaa

380
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,860
same sneer on his face.

381
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,060
Every sign you go looking for a job

382
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,820
says no wart mongers need apply.

383
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,100
Every place you go, the bank's

384
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,840
trying to take your money, trying to take

385
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,400
your livelihood.

386
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,820
It ain't changed in a hundred

387
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,240
thousand years.

388
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,040
Walk down to the enlistment station, man.

389
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,920
There's gotta be a way

390
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,640
out of here.

391
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,080
There's gotta be a way out. There's gotta be a way out.

392
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,200
There's gotta be a way out.

393
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,760
Run.

394
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,000
No place to hide.

395
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,380
What's that smoke? What's that huge pipe?

396
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,580
What is that strange smell?

397
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,220
What's that...

398
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,020
Could that be the smell of hope?

399
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,600
Could that be the pipe of...

400
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,660
It was, and now he's gone.

401
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,560
Oh well, well that was fun for a second.

402
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,520
That's the way he is, man.

403
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,740
He comes and he goes, you know.

404
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,520
He's like a gypsy too, though.

405
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:30,840
He's so cool.

406
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,600
Check those sideburns.

407
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,620
No way to describe it.

408
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,320
I like the braided nostril hairs.

409
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,040
The kind of dreadlock thing going on.

410
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,440
That stinky smoke made me feel funny.

411
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,880
In fact, I feel like...

412
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,880
I feel really different.

413
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,460
I feel humorous myself, but I don't know if it's...

414
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,180
I feel more...

415
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,780
I'm seeing through new eyes.

416
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,040
I feel...

417
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,760
Look, you got a new eye.

418
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,700
There's an eye.

419
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,680
There's a hole in your forehead.

420
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,600
And there's a hole behind you

421
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,320
underneath your backbone.

422
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,820
And there's another hole

423
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,220
right in front.

424
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:06,960
It's...

425
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,300
It's incredible.

426
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
I can't...

427
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,360
I...

428
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,500
She's turned into a huge pipe.

429
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,720
Down upon your feet.

430
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,080
It's a pipe,

431
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,460
and she is in it.

432
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,240
It's like she is the funnel

433
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,160
through which the smoke may pass

434
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,000
and so many other things.

435
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,600
The vessel of Connie.

436
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,080
Channeling the all-femininity

437
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,320
of the inner yin

438
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,720
of all yangfulness.

439
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,260
This holy kundalini vessel

440
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,220
is capable of re-transforming the earth.

441
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,980
But no, you can't re-transform.

442
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,560
You can't transform one time and re-

443
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,880
Love has been born

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,660
into this plane

445
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,100
as a living two-legged pipe.

446
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,740
Wow, and what legs.

447
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,060
Wow.

448
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,200
And that smoke.

449
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,540
It's a bastard child, though.

450
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,660
I'm afraid it'll never find legal work.

451
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,260
At least in this sect.

452
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,780
Who is man enough to take...

453
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,680
to partake...

454
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,660
of this,

455
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,300
the pipe of Bedeet the Bodebob?

456
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,700
You got the testicles?

457
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,620
Come on, kid!

458
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,220
No, stop trying to wait, kid!

459
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,640
Get up here!

460
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,920
Get up close!

461
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,340
Now, now, get ready!

462
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,680
Yeah, see, everything's gonna be just fine,

463
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,380
just like in the Main Street, USA.

464
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,120
Look at the pipe. Firmly!

465
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,600
Go! Point your glance this way.

466
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,140
That's right.

467
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,780
Now put your mouth around there, baby.

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah, that's it, kid.

469
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,960
And listen.

470
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,100
By the time you take one big heften-up-and-pipe of that,

471
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,580
the bells of St. Mary will blow in the dark.

472
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,900
Anyway, there you go, Sonny.

473
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,140
You're one of us now.

474
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,140
Whoever the hell we are.

475
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
That is the question, isn't it?

476
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,060
Whoever the hell we are.

477
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,640
Who are we, friends?

478
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,820
Why, only PR news knows the answer.

479
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,260
To avoid paying fines for 35 bodies.

480
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,760
There are still many more to be voted on since they have that last time.

481
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
The bodies were probably recently abducted or recently probably abducted.

482
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,460
Probably wearing civilian clothes.

483
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,260
Probably some recent days ago.

484
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,500
Some areas of Massachusetts received 8 inches of PR news in Washington.

485
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,240
Billy Martin is one of the nicest people.

486
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
He's one of the cleanest boys in our town.

487
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,020
He's one of the cleanest boys, too.

488
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,280
But he hasn't always been so clean.

489
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,480
They just want me to be a sissy.

490
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,240
As a matter of fact, they knew that a boy is bound to get dirty.

491
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,260
The trouble was, Billy had the wrong idea.

492
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Billy had the dream.

493
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,600
I bet cowboys don't wash all the time.

494
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,760
It's not sissy to be clean.

495
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,940
Who said that?

496
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,540
Who's there? Who's there?

497
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,740
Sophie is the name, partner.

498
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,200
Why, you're a living cake of soap.

499
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,240
You're a living cake of soap.

500
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,060
I don't quite understand.

501
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,640
So many boys and girls don't understand what a good friend I can be.

502
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,320
So I'd like to show you.

503
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,360
May I?

504
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,340
Just lie down and close your eyes.

505
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,420
That's right.

506
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,080
Why, I see a cowboy.

507
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,800
He's washing up.

508
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,780
That's right.

509
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,160
There's nothing sissy about that cowboy, is there?

510
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,100
Now, close your eyes again, and I'll show you.

511
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,820
Learn good hand habit.

512
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,440
Each time you bathe all over.

513
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,420
That's right.

514
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,780
You and I can be partners in other clean habits, Billy.

515
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,740
And especially after going to the toilet.

516
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,600
If we work as partners.

517
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
Your clothes.

518
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,360
You know, flies carry dangerous germs on their feet.

519
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,280
Keep your mouth away from the nozzle.

520
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,660
That's right.

521
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,700
Break off the piece.

522
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,660
And Billy didn't forget.

523
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,980
He's one of the cleanest boys in our town now.

524
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,020
That cowboy sure knows how to clean a little boy now, don't he?

525
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, he don't.

526
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,180
He's no sissy.

527
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,360
Well, just because of the meat hooks and everything, I've had problems before.

528
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,020
But that doesn't mean I'm still that way.

529
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,220
I don't have to wear at least pink ankle cufflets.

530
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,220
At least I don't have to let everybody know what my satellite image says where I am.

531
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,380
Uh.

532
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,160
Uh.

533
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,340
Your satellite image always knows where you are, Dave.

534
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,480
That's my satellite shadow, isn't it?

535
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,180
Actually, as long as we're indoors, they can't see us.

536
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,840
I don't think.

537
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,340
Unless they use those special helicopters that do resonant stuff off the glass windows.

538
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,700
Right.

539
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,600
You're near a glass window, so technically they could get a kind of a reading.

540
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:49,960
It doesn't look like it's moving.

541
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,900
They could even record what we're saying here in this room.

542
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,980
They outside could hear what we're saying.

543
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,060
Right at this moment.

544
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,160
The fact that we're on the radio would make it a little bit moot point.

545
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,400
But they could be spying on us and detecting us.

546
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:01,680
And they could be spying on us.

547
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,640
They could be detecting what we're saying without plugging in the radio.

548
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,280
We can hear everything you say.

549
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:06,860
They can.

550
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,440
Yes.

551
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,760
On the way over here, we were talking about those websites where you can look at the geosynchronous orbiting satellites.

552
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:20,340
And their websites where you type in your address and look at your house from above through the satellite eye.

553
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,180
The third eye in the sky.

554
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,520
Why do they have to be so journalistic?

555
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
The conspiracy users.

556
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,280
And the snoopers.

557
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,300
And the peeping toms.

558
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,600
And the snooping toms.

559
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,760
And the little child cleaning cowboys.

560
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,660
There's nothing sissy about that cowboy now, is he?

561
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,640
But no, seriously. They can see you.

562
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,480
They can watch you bathe.

563
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,400
They can watch you bathe those children.

564
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,120
They can watch you bathe in the canoe from above, Dave.

565
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,100
They know what you did in that canoe.

566
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,180
They know what you do, kid.

567
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,300
They can see you and they're seeing you now.

568
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,100
You're bathing those kids in a canoe.

569
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,500
They saw you while you were seeing them.

570
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
And they know you were looking.

571
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,460
They know what you were looking at.

572
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,960
What was I looking at?

573
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,340
I got an email the other day that they wanted me to click on it so I would look at it.

574
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,740
But I knew it was entrapment so I didn't even look at it.

575
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,280
Because I knew.

576
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,380
They know about Connie and the canoe.

577
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,860
They also get the biofocal optical scans.

578
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Once you look in the canoe.

579
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,820
Yeah, you look in there. See, when you click on it, they're clicking on you.

580
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,120
And then next thing you know, your cerebral cortex starts to click.

581
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,660
Back when I was a kid, when I was on, well, you know, the drugs and the JTPase and all that.

582
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,020
And the Freon and the nasal hairs.

583
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,820
We'd be driving around and we'd be going,

584
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,820
Hey man, be careful about that cop over there.

585
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,060
Because the cops have a vibe detector.

586
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,340
They can tell if you've got a buzz on, man.

587
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,520
Because they have this special vibe detector.

588
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,400
Special brain scan.

589
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,400
And the funny, we thought that was a funny joke back then in the 1950s.

590
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,760
When I was a teenager.

591
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,600
But now, it's not such a joke, is it?

592
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,500
No, things are on the other foot, aren't they, Sheriff Poopie?

593
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,120
Yes.

594
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,640
Now we can see the other side of the boat.

595
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:01,640


596
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:01,640


597
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,340
We can scan your brains too while you are scanning our brains.

598
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,900
The cerebral recorder is on the other side of your cerebra.

599
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,040
The left brain doesn't know what the right brain is doing, but the little recording device down there does.

600
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,300
And don't worry, the shoe is on the other foot, so you're not going to walk too far.

601
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,220
Oh, they tried to explain it.

602
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,920
They dangle the, they hide it in the open.

603
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,160
They dangle it in front of our faces and mock us in the form of science fiction movies.

604
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,040
The strange overboiled hot dog on the floor.

605
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Oh, look what they'll be doing in the open.

606
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,260
It'll be the year 2020.

607
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,400
They'll be recording your thoughts and you won't even know you have a brain recorder that was implanted before you were born, that was grown in you.

608
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,780
Would you say so?

609
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,700
And then you find out that they've had it since World War II!

610
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:50,040
That they've been putting them into soldiers and infants since World War II, the brain recorders!

611
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
What is going down, Johnny?

612
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,100
Billy will never be clean.

613
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,160
And that's not a good cowboy.

614
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,560
And Tommy will never be dirty again.

615
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,580
These children have been renamed and relocated.

616
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:14,360
Each one of them given their own special magnetic shoe to flee whenever the brain scans don't fit.

617
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,820
It's not the same world you thought it was, Dr. Sphynx!

618
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,880
Things have changed for good.

619
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,060
Or for ill, depending on your perspective.

620
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,660
I love you, big brother.

621
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,660
Big brother.

622
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,320
I love you so much.

623
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,300
I sing.

624
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,620
It's too late for human individualism anymore.

625
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,640
They're gonna stomp it all out.

626
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,920
Where's that little booklet I found?

627
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,660
It had this funny, interesting...

628
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,760
Where is that little booklet you found?

629
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,180
It had this interesting little...

630
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,320
Oh, now at last the step-by-step process is revealed?

631
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,800
This explosive new future religion beyond science?

632
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,500
May raise your intelligence, transform your life, improve your health and luck, and end financial woes.

633
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,620
May raise your intelligence, transform your life, improve your health and luck, and end financial woes.

634
00:31:59,620 --> 00:31:59,620


635
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,860
Well, I heard that before.

636
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:13,680
Sure, buddy. Sure, I'm gonna believe some pipe-smoking salesman's claim that this is a certified religion of scorn and vengeance directed at all of them, the enemies of us outsiders.

637
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:23,080
It is self-help through scoffing and blaspheming, frenzied fornication and the thumping of graven images.

638
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,300
The Church provides answers and miracles in the service of...

639
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,600
...SERI-AVALUES!

640
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,500
What?

641
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,220
Ignore the man behind the curtain, friends. The goal is slack.

642
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,260
The method is casting out of false prophets.

643
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
The weapon is time control and the motto,

644
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,000
We can't say on the radio,

645
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,000
Because they can't take a joke!

646
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,000
But why?

647
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,020
But you can, friends.

648
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,000
We know that you can because you once pledged money to the station.

649
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,340
You can take a joke.

650
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:51,840
You can take a joke.

651
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,100
Yes, we've taken a joke very well so far.

652
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,340
Some say we've taken this joke a bit too far.

653
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,160
Some say we've taken this joke a bit too far.

654
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,600
Some say that you can't take a joke.

655
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,400
If you go to one of those subgenius devivals, you're likely to be...

656
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,500
...DOSED ON EXTASY!

657
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,840
What?

658
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,820
That's what we were accused of recently.

659
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,000
Take a bite.

660
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,040
Why, can you imagine that, friends?

661
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,980
What if you came to, for instance, Text Day, May 7th in Austin, Texas?

662
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,500
Would you be dosed on ecstasy by a nice girl?

663
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,780
Only Bob knows and you can find out.

664
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,120
Or is your soul ready...

665
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,300
...for Text Day?

666
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,100
...for Text Day?

667
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,880
Have you seen her blue flesh?

668
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,420
Have you seen her shiny purple behind, beckoning you as it glows in the dark?

669
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:49,100
You want to follow it, running forward on your knuckles, drooling after that gold ring of slack and beautiful soft round things.

670
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,300
Ah, he with the eyelids like an elephant clitoris.

671
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,900
Beautiful, bobbling...

672
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,260
He with the horns of a man of two kisses.

673
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,500
But that's a distraction from Bob!

674
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,060
That's a distraction from Bob, my friends!

675
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,560
If you...if you lose sight...

676
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,420
If you lose scent of the smoke of that time...

677
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,560
...if you lose sight of the smoke of that time...

678
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,300
...for one second, you might backslide!

679
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,980
You don't want to backslide, do you?

680
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,540
And fall back into the arms of the...

681
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,400
...the one we cannot speak?

682
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,620
...the one we cannot speak?

683
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,900
It's beautiful.

684
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,540
It's a modern version of tomorrow's future today.

685
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,480
Not all artists are starving!

686
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,400
An incredible new vision of the future you'll never see.

687
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:26,880
An incredible new vision of the future you'll never see.

688
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,360
It's the art of working with people.

689
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,760
It's the art of working with people.

690
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,800
It's the art of crying about their reality.

691
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,160
It's the art of crying about their reality.

692
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,280
You don't want a mink coat.

693
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,760
Rayon is the fabric of the future.

694
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,680
You want a polyurethane hat.

695
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,600
You don't want a fuzzy wool hat.

696
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,340
You want a polyurethane hat.

697
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,700
Friends, what is...

698
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,480
...Baldada?

699
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,380
What is not?

700
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,200
What is not?

701
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,020
Synthetos itocratis iptipanis.

702
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,000
It is, as Aristotle said,

703
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,880
It is, as Aristotle said,

704
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,460
Baldada, the essential

705
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,240
Ism-asm-non-what-what-is.

706
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,900
Baldada is the nearly unexplainable label

707
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,000
Baldada is the nearly unexplainable label

708
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,360
for that mysterious quality that impregnates

709
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,660
ordinary things with meaning for the subgenius

710
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,500
no matter how devoid of value

711
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,020
they may appear to the others.

712
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,580
they may appear to the others.

713
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,620
Seeing in the vivisecting light of

714
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,640
Buldada, we recognize that the most

715
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,000
awe-inspiring artifacts in the world

716
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,900
of our civilization are not the revered

717
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,620
artsy-fartsy pieces of culture

718
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,000
displayed in our swankest art museums,

719
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
universities, and concert halls

720
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,500
as the conspiracy would have us believe,

721
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,700
but are instead to be found on such icons

722
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,600
as low-budget exploitation movies,

723
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,100
lurid comic books, all-night TV,

724
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,840
sleazy paperbacks of the gods,

725
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,200
certain bizarre billboards and pulp magazine ads,

726
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,880
and literally any other

727
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,060
fossil of raw humanity in all

728
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,240
of its tish-kickingly

729
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,960
flawed GLORY!

730
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,000
of its tish-kickingly flawed GLORY!

731
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,180
of its tish-kickingly flawed GLORY!

732
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,340
of its tish-kickingly flawed GLORY!

733
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,980
That's enough cheering now, we're going to

734
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,900
remove the appendices down from

735
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,960
this book, or this

736
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,900
book of life here spread out on the table

737
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,460
in front of me, Tom

738
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,800
Germanicus, was that his name?

739
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,220
Tom Germanicus,

740
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,680
an insurance salesman from

741
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,640
Wichita,

742
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,020
and he died 57 years of age

743
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,280
from over-smoking of his own coronary,

744
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,000
and what we're going to do is make

745
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,780
this incision right above the placebo

746
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,140
area, and there's, you notice

747
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,760
there's various onographic and

748
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,380
insular designs below there,

749
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,920
and could you also move the

750
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,880
camera a little bit closer?

751
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,040
This man has no spleen,

752
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,960
is that right Nurse Coxie? Yes, that's right.

753
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,860
Could you please hold the non-spleen

754
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,720
up so the people in the operating theater

755
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,760
and the back few chairs

756
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,740
of the balcony can see the actual

757
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,440
non-spleen? Do you want to talk to her?

758
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,000
It's pink, just like most of his

759
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,340
friends in his life was,

760
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,740
and it's a little smelly, like the

761
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,640
way things all came out for him,

762
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,700
but you notice here,

763
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,140
he's got an incision on the back of his neck.

764
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,180
Yes, I can see that.

765
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,820
Nurse, could you show him the tattoo

766
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,880
of the pipe right above the, yes,

767
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,900
where the, hmm? Here you are

768
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,860
doctor. Now this area is

769
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,320
. . .

770
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,320
. . .

771
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,760
. . .

772
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,020
. . .

773
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,000
. . .

774
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,120
. . .

775
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,220
. . .

776
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,300
. .

777
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,340
It's, it smells really funny in here.

778
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,400
. .

779
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,840
. .

780
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,420
. .

781
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,100
. .

782
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,720
. .

783
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,660
. .

784
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,760
. .

785
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:45,840
. .

786
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,320
6 o'clock alone

787
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,000
Dream a little dream of

788
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,860
Oh, dream with a

789
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,800
Dream on, dream on, dream on

790
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,860
I wanna dream of a

791
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
Sometimes in time

792
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,920
Working around

793
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,260
Dream police

794
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,220
They come to me in a band

795
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,760
Dream police

796
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,020
They come to me in a band

797
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:41,060
I've got so many dreams

798
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,280
I've got so many dreams

799
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,560
I've got so many dreams

800
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,500
I've got so many dreams

801
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,280
I've got so many dreams

802
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,280


803
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,820
I've got so many dreams

804
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,640
The Impostor Dream

805
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,180
The Impostor Dream

806
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,320
That was, that was, that was

807
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,160
That was, that was, that was

808
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,000
Just a dream, just a dream

809
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,080
Just a dream, dream

810
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,300
Dream, dream, dream

811
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,820
Phineas Narco did that, friends.

812
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,920
We've been playing a lot of Phineas Narco's stuff

813
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,880
he's done over the years and years and years

814
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,740
for national cynical

815
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,780

at nationalcynical.com

817
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,900
Hail Reverend Phineas Narco

818
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,540
as he

819
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,960
our leader in collage

820
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,700
for this show, well, him

821
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,640
and Norell Preff, who did

822
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,880
the Clean Billy one

823
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,600
heavyconfetti.com

824
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,780
Look at that

825
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,580
crowd of Satanists following those

826
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,060
two subgenius collage artists

827
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,280
They're starting to run a little, you know

828
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,300
keep up the pace a little bit, I don't know

829
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,860
not too good a situation

830
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,440
situation

831
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,340
What else have we got here?

832
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,160
Oh, Artemia Salina did one of the cut-ups

833
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,140
we were hearing later, the 126 song

834
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,960
which I can't possibly describe

835
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,620
What, what?

836
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,680
He do, drunk suck binklin

837
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,500
Give Luke's bzium goon chops it

838
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,360
Dob you're a dub, dob leets it

839
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,940
Big off, you're a bad man kill

840
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
That's health-pope Huey, sort of

841
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,420
Yeah, sounds like some of the research

842
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,680
had been done, yeah, listen

843
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,400
Nip him bug with dessert

844
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,500
Right, gosh, he can make it out quite easily

845
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,360
Yes

846
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,660
He jokey, be gooned up

847
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,020
Now this person is clearly not a problem with syntax

848
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,700
It's a problem with his actual mouth and his muscles in his mouth

849
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,140
Is it chip-chop mixed, Huey?

850
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,780
Yeah, yeah, his throat and much of the part below his larynx and his thorax

851
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,120
resembles chip-chop's hand

852
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,700
Now I know you can't understand a damn thing he's saying

853
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,880
but I know what he means, don't you?

854
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,320
Hey, sweetie, you know what I'm talking about?

855
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,080
Sorry

856
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,800
Sweetie

857
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,780
Dead sweet

858
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,100
Oh my goodness

859
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,560
Did somebody steal your bike?

860
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,380
It's just so good

861
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,640
Sell little children for sex

862
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,380
They'll be high

863
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,980
Oh, clean cowboy

864
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,600
I'll make you

865
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:22,320
Oh, the cowboy's cleaning them puppies again

866
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,160
Yeah, yeah, I got my wash

867
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,760
The lines were talking head

868
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,320
Which is a tad worse than being fined $7,500 Canadian

869
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,560
And to somehow make that situation palatable

870
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,680
They're dead, sucker

871
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,100
And all those European fag country

872
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,780
Unless we let a couple of the daughters and a couple of the little boys

873
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,720
Go and have sex

874
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:44,960
With those rich Americans

875
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,660
So why don't you try that?

876
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,940
Jackass you

877
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,700
My, I wish I could do that

878
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:50,840
In unrighteousness

879
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,400
All the nations in the aggregate

880
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,160
All has a drop in the bucket

881
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,200
I was unable to preach it

882
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,000
Like I'm doing it this morning

883
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,160
And I love to see

884
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,440
We're selling little children for sex

885
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,380
It's a little tickle in the ocean

886
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,220
Against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men

887
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,800
And we are the terrorists

888
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,840
Yes

889
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,560
You Swedes

890
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,600
Better let your hearts be troubled

891
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,080
With fags and dykes

892
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,900
Counting the infants and the suckling

893
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,680
Yes

894
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,480
We are the terrorists

895
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
We're weak and vulnerable

896
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,380
You filthy Swedes

897
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,000
That's a perfect fit

898
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,220
You're going to be buried with the barrel of an ass

899
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,500
Don't bring acid

900
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,680
And them dead Swedes

901
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,780
That you can't find no how nor way

902
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,740
More land

903
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,960
More land

904
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,560
More land

905
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:42,680
More land

906
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:42,680


907
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:42,680


908
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:42,680


909
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:42,680


910
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:42,680


911
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,580
We got a verse for it

912
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:43,580


913
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,820
Wake up

914
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,500
You're going to hell

915
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,980
Everybody's in a diabetic coma

916
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,900
From all this sugar preaching

917
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,720
You arrested a God almighty

918
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,100
Bike

919
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,380
Are likely to be found in mass grave

920
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,160
Every last one of them

921
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,000
I mean in the suckling the infantest of the infants

922
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,700
Fags are relevant to the child's story

923
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,000
The lover's out

924
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,040
The lover's out

925
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,960
The lover's out

926
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,840
The lover's out

927
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,600
So

928
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,100
Fags

929
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,940
Love love love love love love

930
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,580
Sugar sugar

931
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
Sugar sugar sugar sugar sugar

932
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,760
Get out in the concourse

933
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,920
In the streets

934
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,680
You filthy Swedes

935
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,800
E-R-R-T-E-R-E-L

936
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,680
And Sweden got it

937
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,680
I don't know

938
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,960
That was Reverend Ivan Stang live at the Detroit Devival

939
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,860
Last couple of weeks ago

940
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,940
That was you?

941
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,580
Reverend Stang was very upset over the treatment he'd gotten on his recent tour of the country

942
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,580


943
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,580


944
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:43,580


945
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:50,580
The subgeniuses in Sweden apparently expected more of him than he was willing or able to put out

946
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,960
Well in Stockholm they were expecting more than the stock Stang if you know what I'm saying

947
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,700
Yes that's right

948
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,480
They wanted you to perform in a multifunctional way

949
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,200
Yes they're more multicultural in Sweden I guess

950
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,320
They wanted you not only to spurt your venom but also to spurt his sperm

951
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:12,440
Well not me we're talking about Reverend Stang the crotchety old hate filled usurper of the throne of J.R. Bob Dobbs

952
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,560
On the throne of Gustavus

953
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:20,100
When Dobbs returns you know Stang will meet his fate and justice will be served

954
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,440
Those who were taxed unfairly under Stang will be released from their bondage

955
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,640
Bob will again sit on the great throne of slack

956
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,380
And the true subgenius race will spill its seed

957
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,860
Washing like a great tsunami of mutation

958
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:41,420
Across all of the Americas, the old worlds and the old planet

959
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,360
Who shall wear the great umbrella?

960
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,700
For when the sputum of Bob comes down

961
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,240
There'll be no projecting without this magic umbrella

962
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,920
No

963
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,640
Look at it

964
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,240
No brother

965
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,320
It's made of finest very finest silks

966
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,020
Well it's polysynthetic silks

967
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,520
The thickest

968
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,940
That are very thick and firm

969
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,460
And wait a minute

970
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,720
But I thought he was just the sacred squad

971
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,060
And Bob is big my friend

972
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,860
And Bob is good looking

973
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,060
And he wears tight tight tight tights

974
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,560
And look at Bob's umbrella

975
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,560


976
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,560


977
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,560


978
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,560


979
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:13,560


980
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,340
Bob go friends

981
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,960
He's a real uber mensch

982
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,940
An overman

983
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,640
One could almost say yes

984
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,940
A super man

985
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,500
A fantastical

986
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,440
Bigger than life

987
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,720
Larger than limbaugh

988
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,900
A real cheese of a man

989
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,220
He's no joke

990
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,860
He's no dime bag

991
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,660
Bob's the real thing

992
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,800
Bob's an injection baby

993
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,860
Bob loves you

994
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,400
And his love is so big

995
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,640
And so grand and so great

996
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,300
And his slack is so fat

997
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,120
And huge and heavy

998
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,240
That when Bob comes down on you my friends

999
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,220
When Bob comes on you

1000
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,400
You'll know it

1001
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,640
And it happens every time you go to the bathroom

1002
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,380
Did you know that?

1003
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,900
Every time you go to the bathroom you feel Bob

1004
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,460
And every time you go to the Bob

1005
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,440
Bathroom you're creating

1006
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,900
In your mind's eye an image of Bob

1007
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,000
To focus to concentrate on

1008
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,560
This is the idea of Bob's life

1009
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,000
This is the idea

1010
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,920
This is the idea of

1011
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,400
What's the name of that damn meditation

1012
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,200
What's the name of it again?

1013
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,220
Damatol

1014
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,660
No no no

1015
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,940
In fact you need to take your damatol

1016
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,020
Come to think of it

1017
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,360
I think we've had enough of this

1018
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,600
And you take this damatol right now

1019
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,200
Just open your mouth and take the damatol

1020
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,480
I don't want to

1021
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,460
I'm tired of the bees buzzing around my forehead

1022
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,900
I'm tired of these endless arguments

1023
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,560
You can still hear those bees?

1024
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,100
Yes people

1025
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,020
Yes

1026
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,360
The alien bees

1027
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,580
And the little argument of soldiers from outer space

1028
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,520
They tell me which department to head

1029
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,820
Which faculty to be in charge of

1030
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,480
What faculties to lose

1031
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,700
When they come back

1032
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,220
I'm tired of it

1033
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,080
He's lost his faculties

1034
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,880
But that's alright

1035
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,940
There's a new principal in town

1036
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,800
And he's looking for you

1037
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,700
That's right

1038
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,560
Lord Rizal

1039
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,100
And Germans

1040
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,760
This year a mixture of many years into the future

1041
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,660
You're going to be treated to some of the finest

1042
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Most luscious lecturing

1043
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,340
And sideways cavernating this side of plutonium

1044
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,080
Once we've secured this galactic area

1045
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,520
And those beyond

1046
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,640
There's no stopping

1047
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,960
Who's

1048
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,180
Who

1049
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,700
No

1050
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,620
Are we

1051
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,920
Stopping

1052
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,660
Who's us

1053
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,900
Who are we

1054
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,300
Who

1055
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Who are we

1056
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,920
Who are we

1057
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,580
Who are you

1058
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,040
Who are they

1059
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,120
Who is he

1060
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,020
Who is it

1061
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,220
Who are they

1062
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,140
Who are you

1063
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,720
Where are they

1064
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,700
Where is it

1065
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,160
What is mine

1066
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,600
Who are you

1067
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,800
Who is not

1068
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,840
You know you're llama

1069
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,000
And you're daddy

1070
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,280
Say it high and low

1071
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,040
I'm no good for you

1072
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,620
They call me untouchable

1073
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,040
I'll turn the ash round

1074
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,760
See that I don't know what to do

1075
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,420
I get so tired of sneaking around

1076
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,180
Just to get to your back door

1077
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,160
I crawl past the garbage and your llama jumps out screaming

1078
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
Don't come back no more

1079
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,220
I can't take it

1080
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,140
Siddhar wants to kill your llama

1081
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,540
Siddhar wants to kill your llama

1082
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,280
Siddhar wants to kill your llama

1083
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,720
Siddhar wants to burn your dead

1084
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,100
I can't believe he's the best friend

1085
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,320
Later I tried to call you

1086
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,080
Your llama told me you weren't there

1087
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,280
He told me don't bother to call again

1088
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,740
Unless I curl up all my hair

1089
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,440
I get so tired of sneaking around

1090
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,140
Just to get to your back door

1091
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,080
I crawl past the garbage and your llama jumps out screaming

1092
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,420
Don't come back no more

1093
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,160
Siddhar wants to kill your llama

1094
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,280
Say it high and low

1095
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,160
I get so tired of sneaking around

1096
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,880
Just to get to your back door

1097
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,040
He told me don't bother to call again

1098
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,620
Don't come back no more

1099
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,220
Siddhar wants to kill your llama

1100
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,140
He tells me don't bother to call again

1101
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,380
Don't come back no more

1102
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,260
Later I tried to call you

1103
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,120
Your llama told me you weren't there

1104
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,620
You told me don't bother to call again

1105
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,120
Unless I cut off all my hair

1106
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,660
I get so tired of sneaking around

1107
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,400
Just to get to your back door

1108
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,140
I crawl past your garbage and your llama jumps out

1109
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,700
I scream it don't come back no more

1110
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,460
Can't take it

1111
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,360
I said I want to kill you now

1112
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,920
I said I want to kill you now

1113
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,200
I said I want to burn you down

1114
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,240
I can't believe I made you mad

1115
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:16,120
I said I want to kill you now

1116
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,340
Come on

1117
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,480
Come on

1118
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,360
Come on

1119
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,240
Oh yes, Noril Pref!

1120
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,320
Reverend Noril Pref, dear friends.

1121
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,560
My sitar wants to kill your llama.

1122
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,820
More from Noril Pref

1123
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,140
is at heavyconfetti.com

1124
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,480
I guess, you know,

1125
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,340
what are you asking

1126
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,000
a logical question?

1127
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,780
In the first place,

1128
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,640
you should have asked

1129
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,120
the question in front of you.

1130
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,240
First, I must ask you a question, friend.

1131
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,100
What question did I ask?

1132
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,000
You asked what is the meaning of slack.

1133
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,900
That is the first question

1134
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,600
you were asking.

1135
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,680
Then you're asking

1136
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,780
how does Bob relate

1137
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,960
to the meaning of slack?

1138
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,040
Does anybody really know

1139
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,800
what's slack?

1140
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,060
It's something you gotta feel

1141
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,020
way down in your,

1142
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,300
way down in your,

1143
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,600
you know,

1144
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,020
what's the part of your tevas?

1145
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,640
Yeah.

1146
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,900
You gotta feel way down

1147
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,100
in your spinal column.

1148
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,220
Hey, hey, hey.

1149
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,360
You don't need to feel down

1150
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,460
in her spinal column.

1151
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,500
Mr. Cowboy.

1152
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,740
Hey, quit cleaning that.

1153
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,300
Cut.

1154
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,080
The out of control

1155
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,180
cleaning cowboy.

1156
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,620
See, this is a tantric spot

1157
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,060
right here.

1158
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,720
You have this neck.

1159
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,360
Oh, what's,

1160
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
it's absorbing my finger.

1161
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:42,660
Is that,

1162
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,720
what, listen here, boy.

1163
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,700
Um,

1164
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,080
kids,

1165
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,480
don't ever,

1166
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,640
don't ever try to do

1167
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,540
what I'm doing right now.

1168
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:49,920
No, man,

1169
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,140
don't ever use your digits

1170
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,520
to mess with the digital delay.

1171
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:52,860
I mean,

1172
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,640
think of what happened

1173
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,600
to Tom Delay.

1174
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:54,940
You know,

1175
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,200
he spent too long

1176
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,700
and now look at it.

1177
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,620
Just do what I say,

1178
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,460
not as I do.

1179
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,500
I'd like to ask you,

1180
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,760
you children,

1181
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,440
you know,

1182
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,320
who are the children

1183
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,120
of tomorrow

1184
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,100
to think on this problem

1185
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,600
and as we go through

1186
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,580
the upcoming academic year,

1187
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,740
along with the other

1188
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,520
members of the department,

1189
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,840
we're going to try

1190
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,140
not only to bring you

1191
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,820
the most,

1192
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,440
the best education

1193
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,800
we possibly can,

1194
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,180
but a wholesome environment

1195
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
in which you can thrive

1196
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,600
and get,

1197
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:36,600
okay,

1198
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,220
get the implant away,

1199
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,840
get the implant away from,

1200
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,080
get the implant away

1201
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,820
from that child.

1202
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:42,860
Get,

1203
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,340
get the,

1204
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:43,580
get the,

1205
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,380
get the,

1206
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1207
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1208
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1209
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1210
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1211
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1212
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1213
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1214
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1215
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1216
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:45,740


1217
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,300
get the implant away from,

1218
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,080
get the implant away from,

1219
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,580
which is the part of the proboscis

1220
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,220
which hangs itself daily

1221
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,140
at the witching hour

1222
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,760
and then rehangs itself

1223
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,200
on the wall.

1224
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,380
It's dreadful.

1225
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,900
It's horrible.

1226
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,640
It's,

1227
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,200
it's,

1228
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,940
it's the subgenius

1229
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,600
radio ministry hour of slack

1230
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,800
and it's back

1231
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,020
and it won't go away.

1232
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,380
Well, actually,

1233
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,580
it will go away fairly soon,

1234
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,640
but in the meantime,

1235
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,700
you should know

1236
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,500
that you can always

1237
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:23,940
Always get more information about the dreadful Church of the Subgenius by dialing in to www.subgenius.com.

1238
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:28,340
There's no O in subgenius, but there is in .com.

1239
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,360
In fact, there's actually two if you think about it.

1240
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:41,020
Friends, you can also check out the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack by way of the U.S. Postal Service by writing to us.

1241
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,780
That's us at Post Office Box.

1242
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:51,480
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1243
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,040
To whom are you making your address?

1244
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,640
Stately Wayne Manor, Ohio.

1245
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,400
Who are they?

1246
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,680
44118.

1247
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,580
Once again, who are you?

1248
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,380
Who are they?

1249
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,140
I don't know who they are.

1250
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,660
I've never seen them before in my life.

1251
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,840
Yes, if I knew better, I'd say they were here for a different reason than you had in mind.

1252
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,240
I don't know it's anywhere.

1253
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,940
What's it look like then?

1254
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,520
Well, it's red with yellow wheels.

1255
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,100
I mean, blue with orange wheels.

1256
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,280
It's all in the mind.

1257
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:33,700
The End

1258
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,140
The End

1259
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,080
The End

1260
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,980
The End

1261
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,020
Blue manes?

1262
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,100
What do you think?

1263
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,580
I think that...

1264
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,180
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead.

1265
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,180
What do you think?

1266
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,120
Well, then, um...

1267
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Pounding overwhelming waves.

1268
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,500
What do you think of that, eh?

1269
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, I think that...

1270
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,100
That's a Muslim flag, right?

1271
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,180
I think...

1272
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,040
Well...

1273
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,600
I've forgotten.

1274
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,600
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.

1275
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,120
I kind of like the way it is.

1276
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,340
Submarine shape.

1277
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,480
Submarine shape.

1278
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,000
Submarine shape.

1279
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,560
Well, up in the crow's nest, I am the sea.

1280
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,320
Well, son of a bitch, we've discovered, man.

1281
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,680
Tom and Joe, dear friends.

1282
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,580
I'm not sure which that was, Tom or Joe.

1283
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,140
Hey, man, haven't you heard the word of Bob?

1284
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:54,460
I'm a mutant.

1285
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,020
I'm a sickoid, lobotomy, drug user.

1286
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,520
I blow everything off.

1287
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,980
I vomit on Christmas.

1288
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,080
And I think Bob is the only true salvation.

1289
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,860
And our goal is to have 34 billion hating our guts by 1984.

1290
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:19,900
This goal will be vigorously pursued and sought after by all Arkansaniac subgeniuses.

1291
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,400
Our schism is at war with your father church.

1292
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,200
We're declaring ourselves as heterics against Bob.

1293
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,100
No, wait a minute.

1294
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,420
Wait a minute.

1295
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:28,920
No, we're not.

1296
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,260
Just kidding.

1297
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,520
We're with you, Bob.

1298
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,060
We heard you.

1299
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,640
This is Bob police.

1300
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,340
I was just kidding.

1301
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,600
One, two, three, four.

1302
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,760
Doctors for Bob.

1303
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,960
Doctors for Bob.

1304
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,520
Doctors for Bob.

1305
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,920
Doctors for Bob.

1306
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,460
Doctors for Bob.

1307
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,940
Doctors for Bob.

1308
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:02,940


1309
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,320
Doctors for Bob.

1310
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,220
No regulating.

1311
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,880
The Lord hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto thee.

1312
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,860
The Lord be with you.

1313
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,180
He's lost his faculties.
