1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Cha-cha-cha-cha! Cha-cha-cha-cha!

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,020
Oh, yes, dear friends, you will not turn your radio off.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,640
You won't. You can't.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,820
Because I'm going to play Half-Assed Drunk by Doctors for Bob later on tonight.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,360
And I know that's the all-time favorite Aura Slack song.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,160
So here we go.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:52,120
Here we go.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,620
Young human, could he be the one?

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,780
Maybe.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,340
But will he be ours to control?

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,740
Never, never was a devil, always gonna get us a Samuel.

12
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,380
This is K-N-O-N, 90.90.N, FM, in Dallas, Texas.

13
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,100
This is the subgenre of radio ministry.

14
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,260
Aura Slack on K-N-O-N, 90.9 in the left excess.

15
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,440
Praise Bob.

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,120
Aura Slack on K-N-O-N, 90.9 in the left excess.

17
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,860
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

18
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,200
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,260
Variety of ingredients.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,380
You can create an appetite in the prospective customer.

21
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,700
Where are we, Bob?

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,240
The code is broken.

23
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,180
Trouble?

24
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,840
Big.

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:50,940
Security.

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,380
Security.

27
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,040
I have the lead on.

28
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm tight.

29
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,140
Well, take it off for me.

30
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,860
The message is, Mars needs women.

31
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,260
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,540
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

33
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,100
He's gonna make a million dollars.

34
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

35
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

36
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm gonna make a million dollars.

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:22,720


38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Or they're destroyed.

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,820
Hey, King.

40
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,200
Watch Shaker.

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,300
Buy everything.

42
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
Come on.

43
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,100
Get up off that chair.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Follow me.

45
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,500
Ready?

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,140
Go.

47
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,000
The Soap Genius.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,780
Our old Slack.

49
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,380
What?

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,120
We're staying up late for her.

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,060
Wouldn't you say?

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,200
Definitely.

53
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,580
Welcome, potential initials.

55
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,480
Yes, I love you.

56
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:16,160
The Soap Genius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,020
to be played on radio station...

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,560
KNON!

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,700
And only in the...

60
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:21,700


61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,360
The city of Dallas, Texas.

62
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,260
That thing always catches me.

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,560
Here's your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,980
With special guests Will of Dobbs and D. Lee Williams.

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,760
The man on earth.

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,860
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,680
I can't wait a moment longer. I've got to have sex with you.

68
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,540
The facilities are now enormous.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,740
This is where the young composer feeds a fragment of it into several tape recorders and gradually...

70
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,040
I call him to Hong Kong to find what dream he's going to livestream in his next life.

71
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,400

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
To me that's a film

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,340
xix стр.

76
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,340

Marina, no, no, no, no, no.

81
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,720
Se mi sente Rocco Granata, quello mi impicca, ragazzi.

82
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,880
Per poco non gli distruggevo la canzone.

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,020
Era la versione originalissima di quella canzone con il Rocco Granata in Marina.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,780
Marina, Marina.

85
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,980
Oh, thank you, thank you.

86
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,980
I couldn't understand a word you were saying there, but what the heck, you know.

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
This is Doctors for Bob, a half-assed drunk.

88
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,820
This song was dedicated to Jesse Presley, the aborted fetus twin brother of Elvis.

89
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,000
You can't arrest me, officer. I'm not drunk.

90
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,120
I might be half-assed drunk, though.

91
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm half-assed drunk.

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,280
Hell, you know who you are.

93
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,280
When you got a hangover and it's all hung over back, say to your girlfriend's car,

94
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm half-assed drunk.

95
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,400
Just you and me.

96
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Sergeant Carter haircut, go-mop out, hook up.

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,180
Living off a LSD.

98
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,860
Half-assed drunk.

99
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,560
And I'm feeling blue.

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,580
Well, a flood come in and it washed away my den and my water bill's still past due.

101
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,960
Half-assed drunk.

102
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,540
Called my boss.

103
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,340
I ain't feeling quite right.

104
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,280
Well, it can't be Monday, cause I don't remember Sunday and my hands are sitting Saturday night.

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,820
Sweet love song.

106
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,520
Half-assed drunk.

107
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,820
Hell, I'm drunk, yeah.

108
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,940
Well, I used to have a job, but I'm sick of getting robbed, so I finally just up and quit.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,340
Mama had a fit.

110
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,140
Half-assed drunk.

111
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,040
Well, my head feels odd.

112
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,540
Well, baby needs food.

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,360
But his daddy needs a lewd brother.

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,100
Baby better find himself a job.

115
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,440
Half-assed drunk.

116
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,140
Half-assed drunk.

117
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,660
Meth21.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,800
Meth21.

119
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,140
Meth21.

120
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,240
Meth21.

121
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,860
Meth21.

122
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,420
Meth21.

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,880
Meth21.

124
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,500
Meth21.

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,240
Meth21.

126
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,220
Meth21.

127
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,780
Meth21.

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,480
I have ass drunk

129
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,240
And I'm having fun

130
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,940
Stopped on a hill

131
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,300
Cause I had to take a pill

132
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,340
But I couldn't quite find my tongue

133
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,860
Have ass drunk

134
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Hell, I can see

135
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,160
Well, they said the light was red

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,200
Now a couple of folks

137
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,160
Well, there was 22 mangled

138
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,000
And there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,760
He had to sort of walk like this

140
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,860
For the rest of his life

141
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,160
Well, there was one guy

142
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,140
It was pretty neat

143
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,280
He was hurt pretty good, I guess

144
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,700
They had like this machine

145
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
That was like hooked up

146
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,460
Where he had this tube running up

147
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,200
Through his nose, you know

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,220
And that was the only way he could breathe

149
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,720
And well, there was this one dude

150
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
It was like a blade

151
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,560
He'd chop straight down on his toes

152
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,520
And last I heard he still couldn't walk

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,720
There was one guy

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,420
Well, this is what's weird

155
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,280
They found parts of him on front of the car

156
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
And other parts of him on the back

157
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
Of the same car

158
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,660
I mean, it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it?

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,500
How you could find pieces of the same person

160
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,640
On the front and back of the same car

161
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,600
I mean, I just don't understand

162
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,900
They ought to run some kind of scientific test

163
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,760
I don't even see how that could even happen

164
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,540
And a couple folks dead

165
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,160
Well, it sure looked green to me

166
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,680
Half-ass drunk

167
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,760
Hell, I wish I was

168
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,740
Turned a brand new Trans Am

169
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,080
Into an old tin can

170
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,060
Trying to outrun the fuzz

171
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,260
Half-ass drunk

172
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,120
I'm a victim of lies

173
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,260
Well, there's nothing wrong with me, Your Honor

174
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,040
I can see, hell, I got you damn

175
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,260
D-Dug your eyes

176
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,560
Half-ass drunk

177
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,380
Oh, woe is me

178
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,540
Well, I don't want to be a victim of lies

179
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,340
I really pay, but it's steady every day

180
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,400
Breaking rocks till they're broke as me

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,900
Half-ass drunk

182
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,860
Hell, I'm half-ass drunk

183
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,600
Lord, I'm half-ass drunk

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,420
Just as sorry, oh, half-ass drunk

185
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Party band, they tried to say we couldn't

186
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,280
We couldn't play our instruments

187
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,860
Well, we showed them we was a damn rock and roll party band

188
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,500
We a damn king of rock and roll

189
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,580
Pauly's the champion

190
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,280
We a damn king of rock and roll

191
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,960
We brought Dr. Bob, said, Dr. Bob, get down

192
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,580
Dr. Bob, get down so low

193
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,780
They gonna get down so low

194
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,020
They gonna make James Brown look high

195
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,820
They gonna make James Brown look so high

196
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,320
Oh, yes, dear friends

197
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,100
That's Jane or Hypercleans with Doctors for Bob there

198
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,660
With a special censored version of Half-ass drunk

199
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,540
Your favorite song

200
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,080
Yes, Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas

201
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,940
And they're gonna be here in the studio

202
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,140
Sooner or later

203
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,820
And hopefully sooner

204
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,800
Oh, and...

205
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,300
Boy, I'll get in a lot of trouble that night

206
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,060
The power

207
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
But, uh...

208
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Hey, did y'all just hear interference just then?

209
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,120
I listen to the show on headphones that are attached to a radio

210
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,000
So sometimes I hear, you know, when the lightning strikes

211
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Or the poltergeist gets into the transmitter

212
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,300
I hear it the same as you

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,800
Anyway, you can call here tonight

214
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,480
To get information, more information about

215
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,260
What the heck kind of a show this is

216
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,580
This is the Church of the Subgenius Hour of Slack, dear friends

217
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,400
And you can call

218
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,060
That number is

219
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,820
823-8534

220
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,780
No, wait

221
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,800
Is that right?

222
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,120
No, 823-7490

223
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,620
823-7490, friends

224
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,380
God, what's wrong with me?

225
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,000
I wrote the wrong thing

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,780
823-7490

227
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,420
And speak to the Will of Dobbs

228
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,780
And try to figure out what's going on

229
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,780
Or you can write to the P.O.

230
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,260
Box number which we'll give at the end of the broadcast

231
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,180
So have those pencils ready

232
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,520
Ah, yes

233
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,680
And meanwhile, we must find

234
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,380
The way to get back

235
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,200
Back to where we came from

236
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,860
And it's like this

237
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,320
Notice, y'all don't talk about religion much

238
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
I guess it's real hip out here in California

239
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,200
It's a more

240
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,860
Humanistic approach to life

241
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,420
No, we believe in just letting the

242
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,320
Holy benediction of Bob

243
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,100
Flow out like pus from a pustule

244
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,760
You just said that?

245
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,980
I just don't understand the true power of the show

246
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,860
And wholeness

247
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,960
Oh, it's very fashionable to say

248
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,060
Bob is a good man

249
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,520
Oh, he was a prophet

250
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,860
But, uh, the son of Jehovah One

251
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,360
No, well

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,680
I don't go for these superstitions

253
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,140
You say

254
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,360
Very fashionable

255
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,700
It hath not been my use to pray

256
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
With moving lips and bended knees

257
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,280
But silently, by slow degrees

258
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,240
My spirit's eye to Bob composed

259
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,740
In hope

260
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,960
Humble trust my eyelids close

261
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,200
In reverential resignation

262
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,080
No wish described

263
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,240
No thought expressed

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,680
Only a sense of suffocation

265
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,120
A sense, or all my soul impressed

266
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,360
That I'm out in the street undressed

267
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,280
Church air, one soul per breath

268
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,080
Church air, one soul per breath

269
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,280
Get your breaths right here!

270
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,420
Don't need oxygen

271
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,180
For the Bob's early life

272
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,800
That too loudly we'd screech

273
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,800
In the toilet blaspheming

274
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Whose clogged eyes and dark ears

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,160
This is supposed to be a religious show?

276
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,580
I thought there was a separation of church and state

277
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,120
Bob and country

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Where the house of God is

279
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:44,800


280
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,740
And, of course, the church is a church

281
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,260
And your monsters were washed

282
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,980
Our battle all teased

283
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:52,980
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

284
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,920
Funny joke!

285
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,800
Bob's a funny joke here!

286
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,740
What?

287
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,780
Bob's a funny joke!

288
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:03,800
You've certainly been leading your radio listeners down the great path here!

289
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,400
A big old joke!

290
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,580
I guess the conspiracy's a joke too

291
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,120
Oh slack, I guess that's a joke

292
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,900
Well, as they say pinkness is next to greenness

293
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,720
The green of the cabbage

294
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,980
And where they meet

295
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
On an old homo's grave

296
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,680
Can't say that.

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,500
The devil's hands are my ideal playground

298
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,000
I hold the seven-bladed windbreaker

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,980
The wheels that turn are behind me

300
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,920
I think backwards

301
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,500
Starship

302
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,820
I'm always here

303
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,020
I will do

304
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,520
Don't stop

305
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,320
Keep on saving

306
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,560
My pretty girl

307
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
I'm always here

308
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll tell you Executive Director

309
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,640
Deliver me to kunnen

310
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,460
I'm thinking about football

311
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm in love

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,120
I'm worried

313
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,740
Thinking about who'm going to win

314
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,920
And that's where it goes

315
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm worried about the outside Кстати

316
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:06,840


317
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,480
We're going to win

318
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:07,780
Will get Shaun

319
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:07,880
Boom

320
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,060
Бог на бутылке

321
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,460
Б popping...

322
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,640
I think the most important thing that your listeners need to know

323
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,320
is that the Church of the Subgenius is man's only hope for slack

324
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,560
in these coming end times.

325
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,000
That's exactly why we're here in Berkeley tonight.

326
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,880
Now, what is this fabled slack once of you speaketh?

327
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,260
Slack, Bob, is...

328
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,200
Slack, I guess you'd say, is the absolute and total absence of any stress whatsoever.

329
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:52,640
It's the highest state that man can try to reach in his spiritual or carnal quests.

330
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,860
If the last 50 years made such a change,

331
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,300
just imagine the New York of 1980,

332
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,100
when everyone has a number instead of a name,

333
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,240
and the government tells you,

334
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,620
whom you should marry.

335
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,440
Just imagine.

336
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,520
1980.

337
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,080
Here, dear, take your medicine.

338
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,560
Come on.

339
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,180
Let me have some more pills before you call.

340
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,980
There you are.

341
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,420
Now take care of yourself.

342
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,020
Yeah, take care of yourself.

343
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,880
I like to go to the lake and like to roller skate and walking around.

344
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,460
Um...

345
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:36,720
Um...

346
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,240
Um...

347
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,240


348
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,240


349
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,240


350
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,980
I like to do things that are different.

351
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,200
Yeah, someone with a lot of energy.

352
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Uh-huh.

353
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,160
Yeah.

354
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,220
Okay, your code number once more?

355
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,680
37.

356
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,300
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

357
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:48,660
Right.

358
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,660
Okay, thank you.

359
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,240
Thank you.

360
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,760
Bye-bye.

361
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,420
Hi, you're on hotline.

362
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,560
Um, yes, my code number is 238.

363
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,580
Truthfully, it's a little terrifying.

364
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,200
I live for a while in the shadow of Castle Frankenstein.

365
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,240
Glad to hear from you.

366
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,300
Turn the radio on.

367
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,640
Well, I think you'll get the show no matter how you're listening.

368
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,040
It's being beamed through the heads of all essential Northern California,

369
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,200
no matter what they do.

370
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,460
Yes, this is the show that never stops.

371
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,220
It's whistling.

372
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:37,480
We're on our way.

373
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,500
But I don't get it.

374
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,820
Oh, no.

375
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,680
The church air pass.

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,480
No, you don't.

377
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,140
I don't understand.

378
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,160
Where's Whistler?

379
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,340
Oh.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,520
Oh.

381
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Oh, yeah.

382
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,740
See, as long as the Whistler's on,

383
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,340
we seem to be at peace with our universe.

384
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,140
We don't like to be too confused.

385
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,700
We're able to do more things.

386
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,440
If happy little bloopers find me on the way,

387
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,480
why, oh, why?

388
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,580
Why can't I?

389
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,740
This is Negative Land, unreleased album.

390
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,960
Three, two, one, zero.

391
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,760
Nip, sink, crash, bang, shot, boom, glass.

392
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,620
Damn bright, drag, light, breeze, and grow.

393
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,060
To pop up my universal gang.

394
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,980
Aerial, great, shoot, shine, I'm sober.

395
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
Car-bomb!

396
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,340
Three, two, one, zero.

397
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,040
X-ray, air through the whaley rag.

398
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
Bed, valve, flywheel, left arm rest.

399
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
Crank shaft, tire jack, rear view mirror.

400
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,380
Plow spring, piston spring, proper foam ties.

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,380
Car-bomb!

402
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,460
Three, two, one, zero.

403
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,500
Black-eyed, needle-bound, dashboard batting.

404
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,440
Left cab, round tire, rear-chill wiper.

405
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,400
Lean-hand, little hand, radio dial.

406
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,900
Front three, back seat, air-container.

407
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,380
Car-bomb!

408
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,680
Three, two, one, zero.

409
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,620
Rubber hose, rocker valve, ninja nose, pedometer.

410
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,500
Spy, butt gas cap, cigarette lighter.

411
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,240
Headrest, speed, red registration.

412
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,720
Floor mat, firewall, accelerator pedal.

413
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,820
Car-bomb!

414
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,020
Three, two, one, zero.

415
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,980
Little gray radiator, tonic on the wire.

416
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,060
Kleenex, consent deck, charismatic fluid.

417
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Headlight, seatbelt, side-row cover,

418
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,660
and a bumper sticker that says...

419
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,860
No other possibility.

420
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,680
Oh, Negative Land.

421
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,340
They're so fine, folks.

422
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,980
Too bad you can't buy that.

423
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,700
Wish you could.

424
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,300
You have to come to the subgeniuses

425
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,380
to find stuff like this.

426
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,780
Negative Land.

427
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,680
Oh, and this song here, I'm going to get out of it

428
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,960
after a minute, but it's a...

429
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,780
It's a good one to listen to after having seen

430
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,620
that show, America,

431
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,700
which I didn't get to watch yet,

432
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,080
but I'm sure we'll be using quotes from that

433
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,040
on Hours of Slack after a few years.

434
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,880
Oh, you got it.

435
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,280
Okay, the Dealey Llama here has it on tape, friends.

436
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,220
But, so you'll be hearing it.

437
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,720
But this is Negative Land, some more Negative Land.

438
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,940
And it's so wonderful.

439
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,260
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

440
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,060
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

441
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,300
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

442
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,340
The loudspeaker spoke up and said...

443
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,980
Christianity is stupid.

444
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Christianity is stupid.

445
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,920
Christianity is stupid.

446
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Christianity is stupid.

447
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,480
Christianity is stupid.

448
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,560
Christianity is stupid.

449
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,360
Christianity is stupid.

450
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Christianity is stupid.

451
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:49,680


452
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,260
Christianity is stupid.

453
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,260


454
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,260


455
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,260


456
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,400
Communism is good.

457
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,500
Communism is good.

458
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,260
Communism is good.

459
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,200
Communism is good!

460
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,880
Did you hear that?

461
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,240
Give up!

462
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,160
Give up!

463
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,040
Give up!

464
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,220
Give up!

465
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,780
Give up!

466
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,880
Christianity is stupid!

467
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,620
Christianity is stupid!

468
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,340
Christianity is stupid!

469
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Give up!

470
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,640
Give up!

471
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,440
And what exactly can the listeners do about this problem?

472
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,200
It's a regulatory problem.

473
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,800
It's taken right to the Internal Environmental Preservation Agency.

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,620
What's going on down there?

475
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,000
What do you think you're doing down there?

476
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,600
Phone call!

477
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,260
Oh, uh, you better get it.

478
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,340
Who are you folks?

479
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,900
That's right here in my script. Phone call.

480
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,320
Here we go, starting the show.

481
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,120
Okay, first exercise when you get on the show is you gotta learn how to do fire.

482
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,260
That's pretty good.

483
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,520
Here, buddy, put your fire away.

484
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,580
No, no, no, you're supposed to wrinkle cellophane.

485
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,160
Oh, jeez, I forgot. Oh, well, okay, that's my point.

486
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,680
Can't you guys do anything?

487
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,940
Now, just, uh, calm down. This happens all the time.

488
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,580
There's nothing to be worried about.

489
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,060
There are lots of little listeners that are this confused.

490
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,520
But what do we care about them? They're evil. Evil.

491
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,620
Okay, you are the user. What we'll do is we'll be putting you through the job control generator.

492
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,840
Then you go into the job control file. Then you go down to either the project file or up to the data processor.

493
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,020
When you go through the processor, you'll be using the CT channels.

494
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,040
Through the temporary process terrain and on up to the C1 data.

495
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:12,620
There is a place terrifying to us, to women.

496
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,820
It is said a man will come.

497
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,600
A man will come.

498
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,900
The Kwisatz Haderach.

499
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,780
He will go where we cannot.

500
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,680
You've heard of the Scientologists, you've heard of the Moonies, you've heard of the Holy Rollers and the Snake Handlers.

501
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,040
You've heard of all the false gods, you've heard of the false prophets, you've heard of the false witnesses.

502
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,360
This is like all of those all rolled into one a thousand times worse and yet...

503
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,760
True.

504
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,660
With so much, I mean, we can save that many more souls.

505
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,020
It's not the money we're after, you understand. It's not the money. It's really not the money.

506
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,460
It's the...

507
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,160
The souls. Your very soul.

508
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,380
The souls that...

509
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,480
The souls that need Bob.

510
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,660
Yeah, it's not the whole, the entire soul either.

511
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,040
It's just the part of your soul that has rubbed off onto the dollar bill say that you carry in your back pocket.

512
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Or the bit of your soul which the signature on the check carries.

513
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,040
Bob can glean, he can read the ESP smudge that is on your dollars.

514
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,200
And if you have...

515
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
If you're thinking of Bob...

516
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,720
Bob is thinking of you.

517
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,120
And you are under protection.

518
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,220
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

519
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,960
It is by the juice of sap food that thoughts acquire speed.

520
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,280
The lips acquire stains.

521
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,700
The stains become a warning.

522
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,960
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

523
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,760
And Bob's thoughts of you are in direct proportion to your thoughts of Bob.

524
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,260
Uh-huh.

525
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,860
And even more direct proportion to your rewarding of Bob because...

526
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,120
Because what are thoughts? Thoughts are merely zephyrs, are they not?

527
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,220
Thoughts are fleeting.

528
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,080
Thoughts are impulses.

529
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
But then what is the concrete proof of thought?

530
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,140
What is the energy by which we measure thought in this wonderful and I might say the best of all countries?

531
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,120
Well, it is the wallet essence.

532
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,360
And that is indeed how Bob judges you as we judge others.

533
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,480
The amount of wallet essence to which you render up yea unto Bob.

534
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,880
These green pieces of paper otherwise known as money, are these in any way related to the holy scriptures?

535
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,220
Are these the actual...

536
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,840
Oh, no. No. No. No. Absolutely not.

537
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,580
Where's that water?

538
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,940
Oh.

539
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,300
The Pope is thirsty.

540
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,840
Oh, God. Sorry, Pope. Here we go.

541
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,280
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

542
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,980
It is by the juice of sapu that thoughts acquire speed.

543
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,840
The lips acquire stains.

544
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,780
The stains become a warning.

545
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,020
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

546
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,300
Up there, my child.

547
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,000
There dwells the one true God who created all living things.

548
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,940
The true God is the moon.

549
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
No end to the earth.

550
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,800
Bob is fill in the blank.

551
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,800
Let him enter your life.

552
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,620
We can't show you the tape interviews.

553
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,580
He wants to protect you.

554
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,060
He must protect you.

555
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,560
He has to protect you.

556
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,860
Joe, come on.

557
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,540
He says Bob will protect you.

558
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,140
You said the dollar will stop the spot.

559
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,680
1-4-0-3-0-6-7-1-4-1-4.

560
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,060


561
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,180
One dollar.

562
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:16,920
Dollar.

563
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,220
Dollar.

564
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,640
And of course that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.

565
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:29,220
I'm telling you, all other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

566
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,100
Question number two.

567
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:44,600
Do you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the death and burial and resurrection of him?

568
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,880
Sir, we absolutely believe in him.

569
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,280
Everything.

570
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,940
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

571
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:59,160
Now was the first beast before him and caused the earth and them who dwell on it to worship the first beast whose deadly wounds.

572
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,220
And he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven.

573
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,460
Bob's my friend and he's taking me somewhere.

574
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,940
Bob's my friend.

575
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,700
Bob's my friend.

576
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,680
And he's leading me somewhere.

577
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,220
Is he waiting there for me?

578
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,740
Is he waiting for me?

579
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,380
Bob's my friend.

580
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,060
Bob's my friend.

581
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,760
And he's leading me somewhere.

582
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,300
Leading me around.

583
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,140
What could be waiting there for me?

584
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,440
What could be waiting for me?

585
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,280
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

586
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,300
Doctor, let him kill me.

587
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,540
Help me!

588
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,100
Help!

589
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,700
Help!

590
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,280
Bob can't help me.

591
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,480
He can help.

592
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,020
But will he?

593
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,000
Will he help me?

594
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,060
Got nothing if I'll beg.

595
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,540
Bob's my inner guide.

596
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,040
And he's leading my body.

597
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,500
Leading my body.

598
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,860
He's even nice to my pets.

599
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,080
He's nice.

600
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,400
He's nice to my pets.

601
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,060
Bob's a good boy.

602
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,400
That was Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

603
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,980
All of our friends in Dallas, Texas.

604
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,020
Yeah, can you believe people still live down there?

605
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,180
I thought everyone left when the dinosaurs died.

606
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
But no, no, no, no.

607
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,640
They're still down there moving around the streets and hanging around with the cow buckers.

608
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,640
And, well, friends, we hope everybody's feeling fine down there in the land of cowboys.

609
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,300
And cowgirls.

610
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,380
And, yeah, well, you know, you're just going to have to be careful.

611
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,740
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

612
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,780
Thank you, Jim.

613
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,460
Glass Madness.

614
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,520
Now, boys and girls, your parents are in bed.

615
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,800
So you can call.

616
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,340
You can call the Willa Dobbs here at 823-7490.

617
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,420
Got it right that time.

618
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,540
823-7490.

619
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,260
And Bob will protect you.

620
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,780
Bob will protect you.

621
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,280
Bob has to protect you.

622
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,380
He must protect you.

623
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,940
Bob is going to protect you.

624
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:14,520
I don't care whether he gets paid or not, dear friends.

625
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,440
But it's better if you pay him.

626
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,780
A hell of a lot better.

627
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,440
And I do mean that literally, dear friends.

628
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,020
I mean, he has to protect you.

629
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,020
And he wants to protect you, too.

630
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,400
The fall of animal matter from the sky.

631
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:47,840
Charles Fort suggests, quote, to start with, that we put ourselves in the place of deep sea fishes.

632
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,320
How would they account for the fall of animal matter from above?

633
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,100
They wouldn't try, friends.

634
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,020
Or it's easy enough to think of most of us as deep sea fishes of the kind.

635
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,380
M. Bois says of a substance, reddish, very reddish.

636
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,380


637
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,320
Varying to yellowish.

638
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:17,180
That fell enormously and successfully in France and Spain on April 30th through May 2nd.

639
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,460
That this falling substance carbonized and spread the odor of charred animal matter.

640
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,020
That it was not pollen.

641
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,060
That in alcohol it left a residue of resinous matter.

642
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,760
Hundreds of thousands of tons of this matter must have fallen, friends,

643
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,360
with the odor of charred animal matter.

644
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Making one think of an aerial battle that occurred in interplanetary space several hundred years ago.

645
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,940
Hmm.

646
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,000
It's all very absurd because even though we're told of a prodigious quantity of animal matter

647
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,340
that fell from the sky for three days in France and Spain,

648
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,540
we're not ready yet.

649
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,060
That's all.

650
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,200
M. Bois says that this substance was not pollen.

651
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,880
The vastness of the fall makes it acceptable that it was not pollen.

652
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,360
It had an earthy insipid taste, says Signor Simenini,

653
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,000
and described it as unctuous.

654
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,580
When heated, the matter turned brown and black.

655
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,940
But at the same time that this matter fell from the sky,

656
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,380
loud noises were heard and stones also fell from the sky.

657
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,920
Black rains and black snows, friends.

658
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,680
Rains as black as a deluge of ink.

659
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,320
Jet black snowflakes.

660
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,840
Such a rain as that.

661
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,340
That which fell in Ireland on May 14th.

662
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,580
Fell upon a district of 400 square miles.

663
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,920
The color of ink of a fetid odor and very disagreeable taste.

664
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:53,340
It left, quote, a most peculiar and disagreeable smell in the air.

665
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,160
And Charles Fort continues in the Book of the Damned about these

666
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,800
damned things that fall from the sky.

667
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,340
Our intermediatist principle of pseudo-logic,

668
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,820
or our principle of consciousness,

669
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,920
is that nothing is unique or individual.

670
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,760
That all phenomena merge away into all other phenomena.

671
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:19,060
That, for instance, suppose there should be a vast celestial super-oceanic

672
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,340
or interplanetary vessels that come near this earth

673
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,660
and discharge volumes of smoke and time.

674
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,560
We're only supposing such a thing as that now,

675
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,320
because conventionally we're beginning modestly.

676
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,380
But if this were so, there would necessarily be some phenomenon upon this earth

677
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,860
with which that phenomenon would merge.

678
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,820
Extra-mundane smoke and smoke from cities merge,

679
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,220
and both would manifest in black precipitations of rain.

680
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,200
Now you figure it out, friend.

681
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,560
The music here is by Mark Mothersbaugh,

682
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,760
and I don't know where it comes from.

683
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,540
It was sent here from Brazil, so you got me.

684
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,920
The music is by Mark Mothersbaugh,

685
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:22,920


686
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:22,920


687
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:22,980
It's not just a matter of time before it emerges.

688
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:22,980


689
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,520
It's a matter of time before it emerges.

690
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,160
It's a matter of time before it emerges.

691
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,300
It's a matter of time before it emerges.

692
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,220
And if you want to keep listening,

693
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,040
you know what to do.

694
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,540
You got 43 hours to listen to tapes of my life,

695
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,860
and let me tell you something,

696
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,420
I've got tapes of my life,

697
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,260
I've recorded everything I did for the last two years,

698
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,960
and I'd like you to listen to it and tell me,

699
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,720
Am I crazy? Can you tell me?

700
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,560
Am I crazy? Or what?

701
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,800
Hey, wait a second, I just got a few more things I want to talk to you about,

702
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,420
because, well, you know, wait a second, wait a second, no, no, wait...

703
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,960
Three minutes and thirty seconds at three o'clock,

704
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,520
three minutes and thirty seconds at three o'clock,

705
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,880
how precise this morning,

706
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
humm, ga, ba, dang, ba, ba, do, hoo, hoo, hoo...

707
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:06,980
Oh!

708
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,940
I'll open all the lines and give you the opportunity to,

709
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,940
maybe even to blaspheme against me if you want,

710
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,500
but I'm sure you won't do it because,

711
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,940
oh, the next song is beautiful.

712
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,540
This is a beautiful song.

713
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,420
This is Gianni Morandi with his eyes of a girl.

714
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:21,820
Anyways...

715
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,160
What you're hearing now is from a group called Mystery Tapes.

716
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,740
This is a new discovery we've made.

717
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,860
I'll be giving their address down here,

718
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,580
towards the end.

719
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,900
Keep your ears open for Mystery Tapes.

720
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
It's time.

721
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,280
repaired

722
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,660
thats

723
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:08,660

727
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,200
time

728
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:36,880
We are ninjas, no geishas, that's not what you expect.

729
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,860
I can fly as high as Ushiyama, which means heavy armor.

730
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:54,460
I can walk on water, jump on the clouds, live under the sea.

731
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,580
You are a ninja, I am a ninja, I'll crush you and throw you away.

732
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,460
I ran a82

733
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,940
I made up alligators.

734
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,020
Afterwards.

735
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,220
That mean take a bath.

736
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,180
I can disappear.

737
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,220
In front and fire.

738
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,180
I canumber butt.

739
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,380
That's mystery tapes, friends.

740
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh, this stuff we're listening to here is done on a Macintosh computer, not mine.

741
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,600
This is all straight out of Macintosh.

742
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,480
No synchro sounds.

743
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,020
Weird, weird, weird stuff there off of little, little bitty.

744
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,400
I mean, that's off a Macintosh so dumb it's like mine.

745
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,220
Dumb as mine.

746
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,680
Like the cat to the kitten.

747
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,180
Like the dog to the boy.

748
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
But KNON's having a benefit at the start.

749
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,740
That's right.

750
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,120
Beginning Sunday, February 22nd, KNON will begin having its fundraiser party.

751
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,800
Live at the hottest spot in Dallas, the Star Club.

752
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,220
Located at 703 McKinney.

753
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:52,560
And to kick it off at the Star Club will be the three imperial grand wizards of all hip-hop supreme.

754
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,180
The State, Big Al, and KNON.

755
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,000
Casanova Rock.

756
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:00,280
It all happens Sunday, February 22nd, promptly at 9 p.m.

757
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,120
And all proceeds between 9 and 11 go to KNON.

758
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,620
The cover charge is $5 and there will be a special performance by the champions of rhyme, Something Fresh.

759
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,920
So don't forget to show up promptly at 9 p.m.

760
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,020
Because between 9 and 11, all the proceeds go to KNON to help raise the voice of the people.

761
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,540
And it all happens Sunday, February 22nd.

762
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:29,220
As we kick it off with a serious benefit party for KNON at the Star Club.

763
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,220
With me, the Snake, Big Al, and Casanova Rock.

764
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,880
For more info, call the all-hearted Death Party Hotline at 554-8182.

765
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,120
Do you want to party?

766
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,800
And dear friends, if you want to write for information to the Church of the Subgenius,

767
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,460
let me give you that P.O. box.

768
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,900
It's the P.O. box of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

769
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,660
And the Hour of Slack.

770
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,660
And the Church of the Subgenius.

771
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,100
Write us for information.

772
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,980
Just write a little postcard that says,

773
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,460
Hey man, send me a little chunk of slack so I can know what the heck's going on.

774
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,320
And that number to write is P.O.

775
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:23,800
Box.

776
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,460
Oh yes, dear friends.

777
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,240
P.O. Box.

778
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,000
1-4-0-3-6.

779
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,140
1-4-0-3-6.

780
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,440
In Dallas.

781
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,080
No, 1-4-0-3-0-6, dear friends.

782
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,120
1-4-0-3-0-6 in Dallas, Texas.

783
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,900
7-5-2-1-4.

784
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,180
Got it?

785
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,760
Baby?

786
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,600
Get it?

787
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,520
4-4-4-4.

788
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:55,520


789
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,680
4-4-3-0-6.

790
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,100
That was, uh, how far this tape was.

791
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,480
I gotta take that.

792
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,280
1-4-0-3-0-6.

793
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,240
1-4-3-0-6.

794
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,640
1-4-3-0-6.

795
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,180
1-4-3-0-6.

796
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,600
This is DK Jones.

797
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,200
1-4-3-0-6.

798
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,520
1-4-3-0-6.

799
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


800
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


801
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


802
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


803
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


804
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


805
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:23,520


806
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,640
Thank you.

807
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,800
Thank you.

808
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,860
Thank you.

809
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,780
Thank you.

810
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,160
Thank you.

811
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,020
Let's go.

812
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,240
And the Pope, David Meyer, Pope of New York.

813
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:51,160
I should just say that I've seen pictures, the one official picture that the church uses for publicity purposes,

814
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,420
the one picture of Bob.

815
00:46:52,420 --> 00:47:00,120
And I can best perhaps describe what he looks like by saying he looks a bit like a cross between Hugh Hefner and Hugh Beaumont.

816
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,280
Right, right.

817
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,800
That's other names that have been mentioned.

818
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:13,640
Mark Trail, who also smokes a pipe and has the, that smile, that smile that seems to say.

819
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,160
It says, I know the mating habits of every animal and bless and forgive them all.

820
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,880
Yes.

821
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,120
The smile of Bob says, here in 1953.

822
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,820
Posing for the stupid pipe tobacco ad.

823
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,600
I know how cool I look in 1984 when I'm really needed.

824
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,800
So you'll, if you haven't seen Bob's face, well, all of you have, all of you have seen Bob's face.

825
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,960
You didn't recognize it for what it is.

826
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,160
Yeah.

827
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,320
Dennis Domenes' dad.

828
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,260
No, he had glasses.

829
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,160
Bob is a more manly fellow.

830
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,380
He's almost, almost too manly.

831
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,220
Not to, not to say that Bob hasn't.

832
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,700
He has a lower pompadour, I think, than Dennis Domenes' dad.

833
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,280
He looks very much the Bon Vivant.

834
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,640
Yes, he is.

835
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,100
That he is.

836
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:00,840
Bob has, Bob has a wife in every state of the Union and countless children.

837
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,700
It's, it's very hard for us to keep track.

838
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:10,240
And the funny thing is of all these wives, I've interviewed three or four of them and they all, they all claim that he's the perfect husband.

839
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,160
He's always around.

840
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,280
He's, he's good with the kids.

841
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,160
And of course, he's the per, he's the best breadwinner in the country probably.

842
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,540
Bob is fantastically wealthy.

843
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,400
He does not need your money.

844
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,740
We at the foundation to spread his word, we.

845
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,840
To do his work.

846
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,480
Yes, to do the good work, the best work, we do need.

847
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:41,280
I use a penis, I wash a penis, I wash a penis, I use a penis, I wash a penis, I use a penis, how much more to know?

848
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,280
.

849
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,840
This is the gravity pilot.

850
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,320
.

851
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Bob.

852
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:57,880
.

853
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,900
Bob is sex.

854
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,060
.

855
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:04,620
Sex.

856
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,220
Bob is sex.

857
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:08,840
.

858
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,440
Bob, Bob is sex.

859
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,580
Who told you that?

860
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,240
.

861
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,140
.

862
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,300
.

863
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:15,360
.

864
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,700
.

865
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,100
.

866
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,680
.

867
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,460
.

868
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


869
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


870
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


871
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


872
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,460


873
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,920
Bob, Bob, .

874
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:27,920


875
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,300
Bob is sex.

876
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:28,920
.

877
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,880
Bob is...

878
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,760
Bob is...

879
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,220
Young girls.

880
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,080
They can be yours.

881
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,520
Thanks for my mind, Dr. Swabob.

882
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,980
Thanks for letting me keep my mind, Doc.

883
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,760
The Dobbs model was built by Carlo Rambaldi.

884
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,620
And it's articulated.

885
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,500
It can make 27 smirks and sneers.

886
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,600
And it's plastic face.

887
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,340
It has big, friendly plastic eyes, too.

888
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,900
Big, friendly eyes.

889
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,080
Experience time travel, anvil possession,

890
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,960
past wives, UF odors, and big feet

891
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,480
here on the mysterious hour and a half of misery and darkness.

892
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,140
Yes, you're hearing the authentic spewings and spoutings

893
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,520
of Ivan Stang himself, as well as Gary Gubofran.

894
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,320
And the word was...

895
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,200
And the evil, Dr. Howell.

896
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,180
Burn him, he's evil.

897
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,280
Evil.

898
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,260
So can we attune our consciousness...

899
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,220
...to the fire?

900
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:23,920
There we are.

901
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,260
Boy, that's the funniest of genius jokes.

902
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,000
Hey, dude.

903
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:28,400


904
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:37,900
You're ready to hang the gate on a flashing today.

905
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,300
You know the word will cause our

906
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,260
to be found?

907
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:45,680
I've heard.

908
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,680


909
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,680


910
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,680


911
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:45,880
I've heard.

912
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,420
I've heard.

913
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,060
I definitely have heard.

914
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,080
I've heard.

915
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:55,380
I've heard.

916
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,980
I've heard.

917
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,020
I've heard.

918
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,880
I've heard.

919
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,020
I've heard.

920
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,020


921
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,020


922
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,780
I've heard.

923
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,260
I've heard.

924
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,240
Hypnotized

925
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,460
One wink

926
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,360
Mowdaki

927
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,700
You are in jail

928
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,420
Atabako

929
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,500
You are a ninja, I am a ninja

930
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,840
I'll crush you and throw you away

931
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,920
You are a ninja, I am a ninja

932
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,160
I'll crush you and throw you away

933
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,100
Throw, throw, throw, throw, throw

934
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Dr. Christian Barnard, prominent heart surgeon, is here to address a medical convention about his now famous rear transplant

935
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,480
My boy, my boy, my boy Bob

936
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,520
My boy Bob

937
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,920
At first, they didn't take you seriously

938
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,540
Good

939
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,260
Then they began to be frightened

940
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,980
Good

941
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,600
They kept their opinions to themselves

942
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,160
Good

943
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,920
They stopped joining clubs

944
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,480
Good

945
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,720
They informed on their friends

946
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,320
Good

947
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,940
But you went on and on and on

948
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,480
Now they're beginning to ask themselves, maybe I'm next

949
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,240
Where will it lead to?

950
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,140
Nowhere

951
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,220
Hi, doctor

952
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,500
Doctor!

953
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,140
No, please doctor

954
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:58,380
I'm here

955
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,800
I beg you

956
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,360
Does this hurt?

957
00:52:59,660 --> 00:52:59,960
Doctor

958
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,400
Does this hurt?

959
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:00,740
No!

960
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,220
Dr. Please

961
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,680
No, that's it

962
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,480
Doctor, please

963
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,660
No, wait, can you just

964
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,120
Here, just

965
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,220
No, just

966
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,640
This is from Byron Warner's tape

967
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,620
I have something to tell you

968
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,260
The Jelly Mind Generation

969
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,140
I don't think we should go on today, I think you're too upset

970
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,760
Doctor, doctor, please

971
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,500
Doctor, doctor, I didn't mean it that way

972
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,840
Doctor, listen to me

973
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,360
Fascism is very much with us today, boys and girls

974
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,080
It is a time of frequent immorality

975
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,040
I myself killed some 15,000

976
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,460
We will discontinue the interview to check the quality of the recordings

977
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,240
We'll switch you to the 16th tee where we'll show you in slow motion

978
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,660
Arnold Palmer, US opium champion

979
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,760
What kind of pictures am I carrying in my mind today?

980
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,860
You know, of course, that you are living in a power age

981
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,620
What are you doing with it?

982
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,660
What is money, anyway?

983
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,540
Indeed, all is chaff which blows away in the exhalations of Jehovah One

984
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:14,580
It only gains its true power at the moment that it passes from your pocket into Bob's

985
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:22,900
And since Bob isn't here, you can still send for that information from the church of the subgenius

986
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,620
And they need to be laundered

987
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,480
We have the pocket of Bob here

988
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,540
What is it?

989
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,420
They smell like they haven't been washed in months

990
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,640
But look, Connie did this embroidery

991
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,780
Through this, the envious Wellman slashed

992
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,360
And as he plucked his cursed steel away

993
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,260
Mark how Bob's special ichor followed it

994
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,980
As rushing out of doors to be resolved if Wellman so unkindly knocked her no

995
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,100
It is too Wellman

996
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,620
Then fall Dobbs

997
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,880
Then burst a mighty fart

998
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,320
Great Dobbs he fell

999
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,580
I'm not going to be able to let my kids listen to this show now

1000
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,260
Way to go

1001
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:07,760
Why, it's just an ancient Anglo-Saxonism from the early history of our race

1002
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,840
Meaning to hit or strike

1003
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,880
Yes, as in Farquhar

1004
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,160
Farharhardenfartin

1005
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,020
Hardenfartin

1006
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,240
Oh, here we go

1007
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,920
How many of you pyroflatulate?

1008
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,360
You've been blown off pyroflatulate

1009
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,340
Don't be embarrassed

1010
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,840
Come forth and testify

1011
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,240
It's the first thing the royal septuagint does

1012
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,580
It's gasses through our lungs with the sound of

1013
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,240
Call any time, day or night, if the spirits are moving

1014
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:34,260
Remember, there will always be a subgenius pastor there to hear your words and receive your heart

1015
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,500
Until you talk to me

1016
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,680
Professionals welcome, women discourage

1017
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,740
You're talking to me?

1018
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,340
Oh, it's the Good Sex for Mutants League and now stationed in Utah

1019
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,260
Say, I see a little light here on our board

1020
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,280
It looks like we have a caller after all

1021
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh, whoopty-doo, caller

1022
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,220
A slack fan boy

1023
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,700
Maybe, but maybe one from France

1024
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,540
Hello, you're on the air

1025
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,460
Listen, I've got a problem

1026
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:00,520
Uh-oh

1027
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,840
Every time I die, something happens

1028
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,020
Cowards die many times before their deaths

1029
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,600
The valiant never taste of death but once

1030
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:16,220
And, you know, if Bob lets you know for sure that there is an afterlife

1031
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,400
Half the people in the world would commit suicide

1032
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,020
So there's an evolutionary reason for this

1033
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,380
We're interested in the

1034
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,640
Half would kill themselves, it's a real drag

1035
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,000
It's the before life that concerns us

1036
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,320
That's right, it's the pre-life, the pre-existence

1037
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,980
The sub-life, something which is a plane of existence below our own life

1038
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,760
Hanging around in the ethereal nothingness

1039
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,380
The underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence

1040
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,400
Subligacular

1041
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,320
Wait a minute, we've forgotten the customer again

1042
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,920
Oh, yeah

1043
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,120
Dear lady, please express your opinion

1044
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,020
Please

1045
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,720
What should I do?

1046
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,740
Open your mouth

1047
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,520
You must donate your heart to Bob

1048
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,000
Yes, open your mind

1049
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,380
In a figurative manner, of course

1050
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,380
And open your wallet

1051
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,100
Yes, and bend over

1052
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,420
And touch your eyes

1053
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,480
And receive the word of Bob, dear friends

1054
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,860
I speak to you through the voice of Dr. M. Brady

1055
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,640
You will be changed, you'll be a new being after that

1056
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,860
You'll have giant, powerful television sets and be able to walk through walls

1057
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,280
That sounds wonderful

1058
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,500
Say, could you tell me

1059
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,980
Are you as beautiful as all the women here in the Bay Guardian want ads?

1060
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,760
Yes, we are

1061
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:25,760


1062
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,880
Bob

1063
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,300
It's a beautiful world we live in

1064
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,320
A sweet romantic place

1065
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,440
Oh, yeah

1066
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,180
Beautiful people everywhere

1067
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,240
Bob

1068
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:50,760
Bob

1069
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,180
The way they comb their hair

1070
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,720
Bob

1071
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,500
Bob

1072
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,660
Makes me want to say

1073
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:55,560
Bob

1074
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,040
Bob

1075
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,280
Bob

1076
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,940
It's a beautiful world, baby

1077
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,320
Bob

1078
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,780
Bob

1079
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,500
Oh, yes

1080
00:57:59,500 --> 00:57:59,820
Bob

1081
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,340
Oh, yes

1082
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,340


1083
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,660
It's a beautiful world

1084
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,120
Bob

1085
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:02,600
Bob

1086
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,220
For you

1087
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,980
Bob

1088
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,260
Bob

1089
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:05,840
Bob

1090
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:05,880
Bob

1091
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,600
For you

1092
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,300
Bob

1093
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,000
Bob

1094
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,400
Bob

1095
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,840
Bob

1096
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,480
Oh, yes

1097
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,840
1-4-0-3-0-6

1098
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,280
Dallas, Texas

1099
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,620
75214

1100
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,940
And some of the

1101
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,980
Let me give a little plug here

1102
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,700
For the Mystery Tapes folks

1103
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,400
We've started getting cassettes

1104
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,580
From a group in Canada called

1105
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,160
Mystery Tapes

1106
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
And I'm going to give you their address

1107
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
You can send them like three bucks

1108
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,720
For a sampler cassette

1109
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,000
After which you will

1110
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,020
And with the catalog you get with that

1111
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,040
It's almost as good as the subgenius catalog

1112
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,960
Anyway

1113
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,640
That's Mystery Tapes

1114
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,540
At Box

1115
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,880
727

1116
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,580
Station P

1117
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,940
Toronto, Ontario

1118
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,220
M5S

1119
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,300
2Z1

1120
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,680
Canada

1121
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,240
Got it?

1122
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,740
Are we not pins?

1123
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,660
Are we not pins?

1124
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,680
They tell us that we lost our tails

1125
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,980
Evolving up from little snails

1126
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,740
I say it's all just wind and tails

1127
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,220
And sails

1128
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:29,660
Tails

1129
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,100
We are

1130
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,980
Devo

1131
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,960
Are we not pins?

1132
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:36,880
Dear friends

1133
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,460
Are we not pins?

1134
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,460
Well, Ron Lindsay ought to be here

1135
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:43,500
Any second

1136
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,140
Literally any second now

1137
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,940
To do the Soul Oldies show

1138
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,340
In the meantime you hang on

1139
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,300
It's Mark Motherspa

1140
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,240
Whipping out some oldies but goldies

1141
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,420
And then we're going to go to a bit of

1142
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,360
Cleve Brother

1143
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,520
Cleve Duncan

1144
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,480
Doing one of his

1145
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,480
Slackmaster Cleve

1146
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,400
And girls you need to send those essays in

1147
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,920
About why you want that date

1148
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,560
Why you deserve that date with Cleve

1149
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,580
Oh yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang

1150
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,500
Signing off of the hour

1151
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,800
So praise Bob

1152
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,220
Oh

1153
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:09,620
Oh

1154
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:09,680
Oh

1155
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,540
Oh

1156
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,200
Oh

1157
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,720
Oh

1158
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,220
Oh

1159
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,580
Oh

1160
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:14,140
Oh

1161
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:14,680
Oh

1162
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:16,180
Oh

1163
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:16,300
Oh

1164
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,660
Oh

1165
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:16,960
Oh

1166
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,080
Oh

1167
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,180
Oh

1168
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,260
Oh

1169
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:17,260


1170
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:17,260


1171
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:17,540
Oh

1172
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:17,540


1173
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:17,900
Oh

1174
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,900


1175
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,900


1176
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,900


1177
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,900


1178
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:17,900


1179
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh

1180
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1181
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1182
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1183
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1184
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1185
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1186
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,000


1187
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,100
Oh

1188
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:24,100


1189
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:24,260
Oh

1190
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,880
Oh

1191
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,460
Oh

1192
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,720
Oh

1193
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:33,920
Oh

1194
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,060
Oh

1195
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,920
Oh

1196
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,020
Oh

1197
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:36,500
Oh

1198
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:36,520
Oh

1199
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:36,740
Oh

1200
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1201
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1202
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1203
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1204
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1205
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1206
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1207
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1208
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1209
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1210
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1211
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1212
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1213
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1214
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1215
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1216
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1217
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1218
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1219
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1220
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1221
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1222
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1223
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1224
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1225
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1226
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1227
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1228
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1229
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1230
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1231
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:36,740


1232
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,240
Was a pink

1233
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,720
Gold

1234
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:47,980
Gold

1235
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:03,240
No matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

1236
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,500
Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!

1237
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:35,560
The world is getting rougher day by day.

1238
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,100
If you think it's gonna get any better, just keep dreaming away.

1239
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:45,740
You've got to hold your head up high all day and night.

1240
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,980
Cause your brain's gonna go crazy.

1241
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,100
The only weapon you need to settle up a fight.

1242
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:56,940
Cause no matter how much you shake and dance, the last few drops go down your pants.

1243
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,740
No matter how much you scream and shout, ain't nobody gonna try to help you on out.

1244
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,440
No matter how much you piss and moan, ain't nobody gonna go and leave you alone.

1245
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:11,480
No matter how much you whack your head, you're better off living than being dead.

1246
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,480
Hit it! Hit it!

1247
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,440
Society pushes harder on you every day.

1248
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,280
You've got to get what you make and you hear them say.

1249
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,220
But you can't have your cake and eat it till you know.

1250
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,120
There ain't enough to go around and it's starting to show.

1251
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,200
The planet's getting fouler all the time.

1252
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,140
For men from your brain.

1253
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,080
The grape turned into wine.

1254
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,220
We've got to destroy the forces that are still in your sack.

1255
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,620
Scare all them mothers, give them one big heart attack.

1256
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,340
We've got to regain control of our destiny.

1257
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,600
Cause they want to take it away from you and me.

1258
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:13,580
But we've got to stop all this fighting amongst ourselves.

1259
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,220
Cause that just keeps them confused.

1260
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,840
And they think,

1261
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,560
That's swell.

1262
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,380
Stand up for your rights and soon you'll win them back.
