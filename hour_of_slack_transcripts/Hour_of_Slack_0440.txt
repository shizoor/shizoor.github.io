Yes I vow, ere this night this way, you will drink the black sperm of my vengeance.
Here's Buck Owens.
Hello! Hello! Hello!

Hello! Hello! Hello!
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Where we are now, it's a dangerous, here we are now, and dangerous.
Ah!
I know I didn't need that second barrel, but who counts birdshot in a man's chest?
Rock and roll is dead. Long live rock and roll.
Rock and roll is dead.
There was no accident.
My efforts to expose them have been discovered, so I, the hunter, become the hunted.
All my adult life, through four presidents, has been spent in a twilight world of COVID.
I have been a victim of the over intelligence of my country.
They are the moles who cannot come in from the cold.
We call ourselves the 39 steps of fanciful code name.
Our assignment, neutralize the three pied pipers of rock music.
Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix.
Okay. What are your plans for the future and the new experience?
Well, we're going to make our music into a religion, which it already is anyway.
Only solidify it, you know, to that.
And really, for us to play outside more, you know.
People don't realize that music has so much to do with what's happening today, you know.
And you're not going to stop the music.
When I say you, though, I mean, you know, whoever is listening through the microphone there.
I can say you.
Got it.
The youth in this country and their idols are an incredible power block.
Musicians, artists, campus radicals.
They listen to voices.
These voices must be stilled.
And we'll use anything.
Internal revenue, infiltration, wiretaps, street walkers if you need.
We're well funded.
Hello. I'm Bill Kreutz.
Hi, I'm Jimmy.
It's such a thrill to meet you, Mr. Hendricks.
Girls, are you ready?
Sure.
This is Deborah.
Hello.
And this is Cindy.
And a pleasure to meet you.
All right. Shall we get into position, girls?
Let's have a little skin now.
I can keep you there maybe all time.
What kind of position is it you have in mind?
Well, Mr. Hendricks, do you think you could take your jacket off and your shoes?
We've got to get in a tropical mood, you see.
Well, it's not that I don't want to get undressed.
It's just that...
I think I'm going to be buried in this jacket.
Oh.
Lend an ear, voodoo child.
Who counts birdshot in a dead man's chest?
You don't want to hear about napalm.
You just want to rock.
Lend an ear, voodoo child.
And now, the Soap Genius.
Our Soap Genius.
We'll blow a hole in your shorts.
When we said reality will never be the same,
we weren't kidding.
What's this button?
Escape.
Yeah, well, that's in case things get a little intense.
It's kind of like an eject button.
Things can get a little squirrely, you know.
It's reality driven by...
Then there's no escape.
Look, man, I'm warning you.
I saw this kind of thing in the 60s.
You could go insane.
Or worse.
I'm worse than one.
I do best before the skiff.
I think best.
I'm in a rush.
Worst Coach Att entrepreneur.
When you'vekaped your order on

menstrual period?
Yeah, you have a
Just as many things as I should.
How's the blood sugar level?
Gray-faced guys keep showing up at concerts.
I could stuff him with a pillow.
No, he must go the way he's expected to go.
Look, I've got a blade.
I could open up a lung.
That's right, he's got that choke on it.
When the music's over
Turn up the lights
Turn up the lights
Turn up the lights
Turn up the lights
If you look in the back there, you see I don't have a rug on the floor.
I got linoleum.
That's for puke from people like you.
Yeah.
You two have a very abstract thing going here.
What is the nature of the accident?
It's not an accident.
My God, he's dying.
Won't you hurry?
Is this emergency drug related?
God damn it, why does it matter?
Yes, yes, he's dead.
He's been dead.
He's been dead.
That's right, he's got a choke on it.
Look, this is too easy.
I've come this far, why don't I get it right?
The black is stoned.
Let me finish him off for good.
No.
Just follow instructions.
Get out of there.
I could snuff him real easy with a pillow.
No.
We'll do it.
My way.
He must go the way he's expected to go.
Look, I've got a blade.
I could open up a lung.
Look, I've got a pipe.
This is getting interücketal.
Good.
Let's do this.
Are we leaving?
Of course.
I can tell...
Of course.
Don't worry.
We know the game.
is expected to go.
He must go the way he's expected to go.
I don't say that it's true.
I'll just leave that up to you.
If you don't believe, I'll understand.
When I fall like this,
and I want to kiss,
baby, don't say no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Leave my embrace.
For still in my heart,
it is your turn.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Lend an ear, voodoo child.
It's nothing new to me.

Jimmy.
Yes, love you,


Janice, Jim, John, Drelloid, Gigi, Janer, Kurt.
Well, at least they're off the J's.
Say that much for them.
I guess they're started on the K's now.
But who's going to be next?
Who's next?
Keith?
Get it?
Keith?
Who's next?
Real funny.
And what about Sid, man?
What about Buddy Holly?
It's a shame, but friends, it was all predicted in the pamphlet.
It was right there in pamphlet, subgenius pamphlet number two,
printed nearly ten years ago on page five.
It says, and I quote,
Compared to slack, nirvana is like having your eyes slowly gouged out
with a carrot peeler while resisting.
It's like a
It's like a
operation known by the fanciful codename, the 39 steps.
We know from the great Larry Buchanan's film, Down on Us, also known as Beyond the Doors,
that the Nixon,
the White House, deliberately, yes, had Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison murdered,
yes, murdered to prevent their leading the lemming-like youth of America in a mass stampede
into LSD, free sex, and body painting, friends.
So far in the game, the 39 steps are winning.
15 to 0 over the 27-year-old left-handed guard players from Seattle.
It's a stone bummer.
And what we want to know is how come the Johns die while the Pauls at least appear to live on.
Barrier.
A challenge.
A wall they have to climb.
Like waving a red flag in front of a bull.
Worn out.
Harsh.
Wrung out.
Hands reaching in the air.
Grabbing at everything.
A lot of guys with boners.
A lot of girls in heat.
Everybody angry.
Crying.
Hard up.
The lady is a poet.
The mystics could tell us.

I know our little safeguard.
I've always believed that love is the only bond that is in harmony.
!
Oh!
As we end the broadcast,
let me say that you ain't got nothing,
and he's got it all.
And your miserable self is against the wall.
The only thing you have not tried
is the sport of chumps.
That's suicide.
You'll say there ain't no use in living.
It's all a waste of time.
And you want to throw your life away.
The people, that's just fine.
Go on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Just make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.
Oh yeah.
Just think of the rain, no light to shine in.
Through the bushes up ahead.
And we're all going to be so sorry.
When we find out who was it.
Go on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Just make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.
Oh yeah.
Just think of the rain.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.

And you want a little attention.
And you need it pretty quick.
Don't want to mess your face up.
And we won't know if it's you.
But there's just so much to worry about.
Now what you gonna do?
Go get on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Just make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.




I jump.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Friends, at that point,
Frank goes off into yet
an entirely different rant.
Frank Zappa there
at the end of our
Dead Rock Star collage.
Once again,
of course, the newspapers,
they always call it drugs
or suicide.
But, you know,
I could snuff him with a pillow.
But, no, he must go the way
he's expected to go.
I got a blade.
I could open up a lung.
That's right.
He's got a choke on it.
And this is
our friend Tommy Lopez
in the background.
I'm trying to think if there's any other credits
I need to give.
I can't think of anything right off hand.
I've been too ticked off lately, friends.
Yes.
I spent a lot
of time yesterday being angry.
Angry at what you ask.
You're asking me?
I know you want to know.
Well, at all the things
that make me mad.
That's what I've been angry at.
The things that make me mad all the time.
Now, they don't bother me
when I'm not thinking about them.
But, uh,
and I try not to think about them.
But, friends, they get in my face.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ugh.











Mainly people that pester me.
My friend, uh,
conservatives.
Republicans.
I get ticked off at them.
Racists.
They make me mad.
Prudes.
Busy buddies.
Censors.
Sexists.
Socialists.
Democrats.
I hate Democrats.
Speecists.
Nasty.
Spoiled kids.
And all the press, friends.
All of the press.
They're my new idols of hate.
Although I did read, uh,
the most encouraging,
well, of course, it was tiny and short,
little article in the news.
I was amazed that they would admit this.
Allowing us how people in Little Rock, Arkansas,
were getting really cynical about the press
because some of the things that appeared
about, uh, Whitewater in major newspapers
like the Wall Street Journal
and, uh,
Newsweek?
Those were patently a bull hockey.
And the, the Arkansasians would complain
that such-and-such was a total lie
and, uh,
the Journal or Newsweek
would print the correction
at the back of the paper
in five-point type.
And so even the conservative fundamentalist
Arkansasians are going
well,��
and maybe it's not a liberal bias media
after all because then they sure oughta get on the Indians,

stretching the truth and flat out lying and twisting things.
I hate to cut.
I hate to do that to Jimmy, but he's starting to step on me.
Anyway, you know, it's gotten to the point where it's so obvious, friends,
that those Republican insiders, the only reason they haven't killed Clinton with poison
is they're afraid they might get caught.
And they will assassinate the Democrats any way they can,
not because they're patriots, but because they want the power.
And the only thing they've been able to use so far is that this guy and his wife
have some kind of swinging lifestyle,
as if George Bush didn't have girlfriends and Dan Quayle didn't smoke pot.
And this stupid two-bit real estate deal in the 70s,
the cover-up of which they have succeeded,
and they're going to have to do it again.
And making look in the press like it was, oh, somehow much worse than Watergate,
much worse than Iran-Contra,
because it shows that the president might have cheated.
Well, of course he cheated.
Clinton's just another conspiracy puppet,
greedy, egomaniac, corporate communist.
I'm not defending him, friends.
No way.
Or what he represents.
I'm just attacking.
I'm attacking the other conspiracy, uh, uh, uh, bastards, pink boys,
whose secret police really run things by extortion anyway.
Oh, but the normals, oh, it's okay to lie to Congress,
have entire wars where thousands are killed and enslaved
without Americans ever hearing how they sponsored it,
even after the elected Congress specifically said,
no, no, you can't do that.
Oh, that's my friends.
It is as nothing compared to going around saying that American laws
don't actually have to be biblical.
Or being an uppity woman whose husband runs around and she doesn't even care.
And what's the worst of all is me being reduced to defending a bunch of pinks.
Like I say, man.
But it's so terrible to get pissed at your friends and relatives
who happen to be fundamentalist, conservative nuts.
And I was sitting there this morning reading the paper going,
by the beardlessness of dogs.
Oh, damn it.
These pinks, they are Nazis.
This country would go Nazi in the blink of an eye
if they just put enough red, white, big enough red, white, and blue flag
in front of the Fuhrer
with enough big, pasty, roly-poly men up in front
to say enough nasty things
about making them.
And I was reading the paper,
and I was reading the complex impulse
so that all the other good old boys and girls
can read between the lines.
Man, I hate it, friends.
I hate that Nazi side of America.
I hate it.
I hate it so much.
God, I hate Nazis.
I hate conservative butt boys who are really Nazis
and pretend they aren't.
I hate them worse than Nazis.
At least the German Nazis would come right out and go,
yeah, yeah, we think we the greatest.
We kill everybody.
Oh, no, we're much more subtle here in America nowadays.
Get a nice, plump, rump boy up there to say,
liberal,
with just the right ring in his voice.
And hey, his people know what that word means.
Uppity women, all Jews, all Arabs, most Catholics,
all Micronesians, Macronesians,
Silanese, Negroes, Mexicans, Guatemalans,
even wasps like myself, who happen to recognize closet Nazis
and commies when we see them.
Oh, yeah, we get thrown in that mix, too.
Of course, we're the worst ones of all,
because we're traitors to the good old pink boy race.
And when I hear one of my own good subgenius doctor friends
say something to me like, you know, Stang,
the most powerful person in this country now is a woman
who wasn't even elected, I have to look at him, and I say,

I'm ashamed of you, because you've fallen right into the trap.
Did not Dobbs tell us 13 years ago that all those presidents
and their wives, no matter what party,
all of those characters are just scarecrows put up there
to keep the idiots throwing rocks at them
so they wouldn't pay any attention to the real power behind the scenes?
And now here you're falling for this line that this one incredibly powerful person,
is going to ruin your country as if it wasn't already half ruined.
Now think about it.
Aren't you just barking at their latest scarecrow?
Haven't they succeeded in distracting you just by updating the decoy?
It makes me mad, friends.
But what also makes me mad is when actual, true, bleeding-heart liberals
don't realize the dangers and how they've been set up.
And they don't realize the dangers of the world.
They don't realize nearly how bad it actually is.
When they open their mouths about politics,
what comes out sounds like the conservatives' cartoons of them.
Rush Limbaugh quotes them,
Oh, well, the liberals will just say,
it's only because she's a woman.
Well, what about Kay Bailey Hutchison down there in Texas?
Friends, it ticks me off that well-meaning people set themselves up
and play along with that propaganda game,
and in some cases,
actually become the hand-wringing commies
that the fundamentalist right-wing idiots make them out to be.
It ticks me off.
It makes me mad.
It's getting to where the middle of the road,
which is Clinton, for God's sake,
that means communist now.
And liberal, well, that means demon.
And nobody even talks about radicals anymore.
Yeah, to hear some people talk,
Clinton's a radical.
I'll tell you who's radical by the true definition, friends.
The fundamentalists.
They want to put you behind bars
because someday you might be contagious.
And, uh, well, there is a little thing in the newspaper here today.
Galveston, Texas.
Galveston County Republicans are being harshly criticized
and even threatened
by their, merely their call
to quarantine people
carrying the virus that causes AIDS.
Yes, friends,
Galveston GOP calls for AIDS concentration camps.
The county GOP approved the resolution March 26,
but it only came to light in recent days.
The GOP resolution recommending
the isolation and quarantine
of persons who are HIV positive
was passed by the majority
of the 300 Republican delegates
of the party convention.
The resolution calls for quarantine
until a cure is found.
See, at least it's not quarantined forever.
Just until a cure is found.
So the general population can be protected
from the disease.
It also calls for identification
of individuals carrying the AIDS virus
and the tracing of their sexual partners.
So, uh,

the GOP measure was one of 115 passed
at the county party meeting
and forwarded to the Texas GOP
for possible consideration
of AIDS concentration camps
at the party's state convention in June.
Oh, well, you know,
there's probably some of my listeners
out there going,
whoa, AIDS concentration camps for queers?
That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.
I hate them, friends, hate them.
But, let us, um,
where are we now?
Where are we in show?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get carried away
for the last 20 minutes.
It's just, you know,
it was just a little thing I did.
Let's let our old friends,
uh,
let our old friends,
where are our old friends?
Here they are.
Oh, I'm sorry,

we'll let these old friends
carry us down into
some other part of the show.
Cut that out!
Look, man, I'm warning you.
I saw this kind of thing in the 60s.
I'll tell you what.
You can't just kill a woman




but we won't do that.


We'll do it now.
We'll do it now.



We'll do it now.
He must go the way he's expected to go.
Skimpy, climb inside.
Fun awaits you if you climb inside.
Skimpy.
If you look in the back,

I got linoleum.
That's for puke from people like you.
Rock and roll is dead.
Enhanced, enhanced, substantially improved.
Refinements have been carried out and all results are good.
Enhanced.
Now dance, embrace a happy mood.
Rejoice that Florence Henderson substantially improved.
Running the strut and wiggle her butt
has pulled her out of her rut
and found her a whole new personality.
The right is to wing a critical thing
that's meant for a king.
The chicken has got a certain westernality.
Let's ensure her shrubberies have been shaped
to resemble Wisconsin.
Before she dons her rubbery head
that looks like Wendy Johnson.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Enhanced, enhanced, delightfully improved.
Refinements have been implemented like we knew they should.
Now dance, please dance, embrace a joyful mood.
Shout out that Florence Henderson substantially improved.
Rejoice that Florence Henderson substantially,
Effectively,
Remarkably,
Considerably,
And evidently, certainly,
Very much improved.
Oops!
Enhanced.

Let's go!
Let's go!
You were not excited at all from that.
Well, it's so funny because even some people look at my music and say,
is that why they're going?
I say, what do you want?
You know, what are you trying to get first out for?
Try to go by the feeling?
Because it goes loud.
That's what you say.
That's great.
All those things that work for you, like you,
are supposed to work in living room.
Before I heard of it,
I knew it.
I knew it.
Oh, yeah.
I know you're going.
I know you're going.
I know you're going.
I know you're going.
I know you're going.
I said, hey.
Yeah, I said, hey.

You can take that and shove it in the place where Bob Dobbs don't care to look.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
Woo!
Hello?
Boy's got his nose and everything here.
Hello.
Caller, you're healthy.
Can you do a bristling for me?
A bristling?
A bristling.
A brishing?
A brishing, man.
A beatitude.
A brishing.
I thought, the reverend, can you do a brishing?
I guess he wants you to masturbate his child.
I mean, clip his toenails.
Oh, I know what they want.
Authoritative breastfeeding.
No, they wanted you to circumcise his wife.
Or his child.
No, no.
His man child.
He circumcised his wife last night.
No, in the church, we only circumcise females.
Oh, the clitorostomy.
Yeah, it's because of the gods from Sodom, the ancient star in space.
I remember.
Analectomies.
It's all occult, obscured from our everyday mundane garden variety knowledge.
I heard about the anal cults that would sew up their anuses.
I don't think that would be nice.
They were packing a mean load.
And that was not a very good thing.
That was not a very successful cult.
Nor were the Kastrati.
Nor long-lived, that's true.
The Kastrati of Russia were a short-lived fanatic cult.
Did not last long either, yes.
Two things that you must do if you want to keep on having, you know, another cult to follow is procreate and...
Right, look at the Mormons.
And dung-reate.
Yeah, many of them.
I mean, that's a successful damn cult.
Less than about a hundred years ago, they were a bunch of idiot nuts, you know.
Now they run.
Right down the street here.
That's where they started.
Right.
Based on misogyny and dog puppets.
And then they all took off.
Right over there, where that one guy, Lundgren.
Did you ever hear about that?
Jeffrey Lundgren, do you remember him?
Todd Lundgren?
There was a big...
Todd Lundgren.
There was a big...
When Joseph Smith was on his way west, Ohio was once west.
If you're coming from Albany, I guess that was a big deal back in them days.
And so they started that big old temple over there in Kirkland.
And that's where Lundgren...
Todd Lundgren had that vision for utopia.
Yeah.
It was like virtual reality.
No, there was a Mormon offshoot.
Which killed some other guys by luring them into...
A wizard.
A wizard.
A true star.
Oh, the Lundgren...
Yes.
A clown.
That's right.
There was...
I think there was a Hollywood meat puppet and three army organisms.
One of them was a soldier ant, and the other one...
Three of them were let go at an earlier date.
I'm with the Ervil LeBaron cult of Mormon.
We're against the Lundgrenites.
Yeah.
I remember it badly.
We must do a covenant sealing upon them.
Using the sacred holy secret underwear to strangle the faith out of them.
Now that was actually a part of the story.
The covenant had to do with sealing the sacred underwear.
And they strangled some people with sacred underwear.
Did they?
And he expected to be next Joseph Smith or Brigham Young or one of those other people.
Jacques de Molay.
Jacques de Molay.
Joan of Arc.
David Cora.
Oh, wait a minute here.
This just in.
Current Affair has just declared Nancy Cry again has won the National American Popularity Contest.
Oh, yeah.
So Tanya Harding is now out of it completely.
That babe will never...
She got glass knees.
She'll never make it as just big time skater.
And the Russian went after the German today with her skate.
It just came in over the wire.
Threw the skate.
Threw the skate, it says.
Threw the skate at her and hit her in the leg causing her to get three stitches.
This is wild.
Female ice skaters getting violent like a bunch of hockey guys.
There must be something about the cold.
It was predicted ten years ago in Book of the Subgenius that a blonde slut...
One by name.
...Russian full-bucker skater would attack using a gigantic Samoan as a weapon would attack this high-class, snooty-looking, long-legged, rich girl, rich brunette girl.
Said that right in Book of the Subgenius.
Oh, Red Boy, you know the people from Samoa are not snooty.
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.
Huh?
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.
Well, now you know that...
She signed a contract with a homeowner.
I can't wait for those Tanya Harding pornos to come out.

You know, HOM video or something like that?
Well, they always come out with a porno movie with a cute title like Sperminator.
Or Psycho Sluts on Skates.
Yeah, right, right.
They've got to do something with that.
Olympic Fever could be a...
Oh, yeah, that would be a cool one.
Olympic Fever.
You'd have like the village...
Olympic Press.
Yeah, yeah.
You'd have your village there and everybody's sitting around drinking their Gatorade.
And then the stewardesses would come up, see?
And they'd be dressed up in dog suits and everything.
And then like, say, the one who's the best.
Yeah, one guy with a huge hat would come up being dressed in a dog suit.
Another good Winter Olympic would be like ice chewing.
Where you get the ice at the bottom of the drink and you have to chew it.
Crunch, crunch, crunch.
That would be another good one.
Oh, he broke a tooth.
Uh-oh.
It died.
Yeah.
The life was sucked right out like a flatulent prairie squid convulsing on the ice.
In the rink of our own amphitheater.
Never mind.
I'm sorry.

I was casting through some pieces and I managed to come across that.
In the back of my mind I saw that.
Hello?
Uh, hello?
Hello?
Goodbye.
I think one of your tape loops called up.
Chaz.
It was the hello one again.
Oh, just the little hello loop.
Yeah.
But they just do that to hear the echo.
Oh, uh, trucker radio, huh?
Trucker radio?
She wants to do trucker radio.
I'm not doing trucker radio tonight.
I recognize that laugh.
Oh, I recognize that squeal.
Truckers, truckers.
I recognize that squeal of pleasure.

Oil to kill from different doors

Okay.
What, in your opinion, is the future of pop music?
Well, I like the word pop in the first place.
Well, okay.
All it means to me is pilgrimage of peace.
Okay.
Well, we'll get down.
Okay, what do you think the sound of the future will be then?
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a critic.
You know, I can just only go by what I want.
On my own side, I like to get into more symphonic things
so then kids can respect the old and the traditional,
you know, like classics.
I like to mix that in with, you know, with so-called rock today.
But it's always changing according to the attitude of the people, you know.
When the air is static, loud, and aggressive, that's how the music gets.
When the air starts getting peaceful and harmonic and so forth,
that's how the music will get.
So it's up to the people how it's going to be.
But music is going to be here regardless if it's rock or whatever.
You know.
And it's going to influence a whole lot of people's minds now
because like I said before, that's part of their church now.
Well, music is considered extremely emotional
and it's supposed to rid the individual of frustration.
That's what they say.
Yeah, if people let it.
I judge.
It's marvelous.
Yeah, instead of trying to...
I can tell you that from my own experience.
If I'm really uptight and I'm tense and everything,
I go to somewhere like the Whiskey and really enjoy myself.
Yeah.
I enjoy to listen to Andy Williams or something.
You know, he's very relaxing, for instance, you know.
