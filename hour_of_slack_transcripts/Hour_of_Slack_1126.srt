1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,860
Tobacco's annual sales equal the sales of television sets, radios, records and musical instruments combined.

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,720
And are half again larger than the...

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,440
So genius! Our all's work!

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,020
Put another way, six farm families receive tobacco to make cigarettes.

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,800
They are capable of making five cigarettes a minute. That's more than 80 a second.

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:40,340
A significant part of American tobacco and tobacco products is shipped. That's symbolic of our tobacco industry.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,260
Hello, hello Lucifer and his brother Jesus and his followers the demons.

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,420
Negro goddess wives on a planet, endless celestial sex.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,000
By maintaining the...

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,560
...a rigid direction, Lucifer and his brother Jesus.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,320
Time to have sex.

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,920
Hello, hello, hello, hello direct manhood and his followers the demons.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,620
Gave him a physical, supposed, supposed, supposedly, endless celestial sex.

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,780
Shit. Shit, man.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,900
You're listening to Dobbs on the Family.

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,740
Dobbs will be a guest on tonight's...

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,580
...program which runs on the Dobbs channel at 9 pm Eastern.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,340
Oh, that's amazing and I'm excited.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
But I have no clue.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:34,180
clue. Vicki began to notice that there was a big gap. If you will. So I feel really afraid. Very

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,020
real. They're teaching PowerPoint classes. Go berserk. Sexual temptation. Instant gratification

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,640
that comes. Posing topless on the beach. It just seems hopeless to me. Porn pop-ups. And I could

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,140
not breathe. Pornographic images and what they do. What they do. What they do. Hardcore pornography.

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:58,840
I would love that. I would love that. You spend a lot of time coming, coming. I can imagine you're

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,560
pretty. It's shaping up very good. Come, come. But I think it's very important that we be engaged.

26
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,840
Coming, coming. Well, you'll be there. Gary Jackson. Bop, bop, bop, bop. It's going to be a

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,480
very exciting weekend. Saturday night, we have a gay event honoring our good friend Bob Dobson.

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,680
It's going to be a great event.

29
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,900
Well, I'm rather embarrassed about that. It's going to be a great event. Filling up rapidly.

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,540
Coming, coming. Now, party. Party. And as of right now, you have more than 2,000 people coming.

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,140
They'll have an opportunity. Harry Jackson. I love you. Dangerous criminal pedophiles can

32
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,720
access that. Oh, you're absolutely right. Porn pop-up. The online pornography. Come clean. I

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,480
want to do more. I gay. I gay. And by the way. I want to do more. Well, what kind of a gag are

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,880
you going to pull on us now, Blackstone?

35
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,620
A handkerchief trick ought to be appropriate, shouldn't it? Oh, that's impossible. On the

36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,680
contrary. Now, just you watch. Here's my own handkerchief. I'll shake it out so you can see

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,660
there's nothing concealed inside of it. It's good enough for me. Now, Rhoda, fold it over several

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:10,380
times. All right. How's that? That's fine. Now, may I have it, please? Here. All right,

39
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,760
now. I'll give you the handkerchief. Here, try it yourself. There it is, all in one piece.

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,120
How in the world did you ever do it? Oh, that's pretty good. And the best part of it all is...

41
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,040
Until next time, goodbye. That's what you always say.

42
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:59,160
Reverend Ivan Stang here on Hour of Slack number 1126. And by the time you hear this, I will be

43
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:06,740
with Princess We Are Doe and Dr. Howell and Ragnar and Pope Black and Pope Mickey Finn and Pope

44
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:17,260
Phil Monty and various other insane Euro subgeniuses at the Amsterdam Divi Vals, sponsored by

45
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,500
Joseph, Daddy of Jesus. I always want to call him Daddy Joseph of Jesus. Anyway,

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,460
so I'm preparing these shows as fast as I can in advance, because when I come back from Amsterdam,

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,580
there's a good chance that I won't be able to talk at all for several months or even edit

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:49,060
audio. So this show and probably the next one, which will be a rerun of a really ancient show,

49
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,040
um, we'll just...

50
00:04:51,140 --> 00:05:00,240
Just... These are our way of buying slack. And what I'm going to let this show become

51
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:09,340
for the next half hour is a short story about Bob by Reverend John Shirley, the famous sci-fi

52
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:19,160
writer, author of the recent book, The Other End. And he's narrating his own short story,

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
1996-1997.

54
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:29,640
Which was in the anthology, Three-Fisted Tales of Bob. Now Three-Fisted Tales of Bob is temporarily

55
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:37,280
out of print, but that was a book we put out in the late 80s with stories by Robert Anton Wilson

56
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,240
and even William Burroughs, all kinds of famous people, including John Shirley. And Reverend

57
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,120
Modermack has been putting together a sort of a fan audiobook project. I read the book, and I read

58
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:00,240
all of my novella, The Third Fist, for that project. And a few people have read stories by other

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,300
subgeniuses from that book. But so far the most hour of slack-worthy, friends, is John Shirley's

60
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:19,920
story, presented here with music by his son, an ordained subgenius. So here it is, 1996-1997,

61
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,600
1998. Praise Bob. And praise John.

62
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,100
One nine nine six, one nine nine seven, one nine nine eight, by Reverend John Shirley.

63
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,500
She was a small, soft thing, walking in the shadow of great hard things, under the sullen

64
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,900
gray sky of a November morning. She was in North Central California, in the middle of

65
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:49,900


66
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,220
the middle of the desert, and she was quite alone. She was little Connie Depth Charge, taking a walk

67
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:02,520
into the year 1996. That's how she thought of it. Every second she reasoned took her further into

68
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,780
the year, and the year was unfolding around her, bleak and relentless, pervading this edifice of

69
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:19,140
decay. The year 1996 was a place, Connie thought. This time is a place. Not all times are places.

70
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,140
Not so you'd notice, but this one was.

71
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,600
Connie was nine years old, until this year she had perceived the world as a sort of efflorescence

72
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,640
blossoming symmetrically out from her. She had imagined herself at the center of it.

73
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,860
Now she saw that the world had no center, or none visible. Perhaps there was some great

74
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,720
sucking whirlpool of events somewhere, like the black hole in that old Disney movie she

75
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,140
panned in the videocassette section of her column for weekly reader.

76
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:54,320
The column was called The Cinematic Bitch, and now that the children's newspaper had gone yellow

77
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,200
tabloid with blaring headlines like, My Mom Has Sex With A Vacuum Cleaner And I'm Like So Embarrassed,

78
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,080
it had room for little Connie's penetrating, if spiteful, analyses.

79
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,340
Connie was thinking about these things as she walked along the weed-thatchy railroad tracks.

80
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,040
She was walking through the old industrial park. It was closed today.

81
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,400
Much of it had been closed continuously since the dream plagues.

82
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,520
The smokestacks were streaked with rust, marbled with cracks. The acid rains had pitted the

83
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,500
gray and black walls of the monolithic buildings squatting on both sides of her.

84
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,460
She liked to walk here because the place had a dreary, pleasantly obtuse cinema verite

85
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:47,720
quality that she found reassuring. It had no affect. It could be trusted, she thought.

86
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:56,960
She was weary of the unpredictable since the dream plagues, since the war of the weirdos,

87
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,420
since the jarring sight of the people spinning by overhead high on anti-gravity drugs.

88
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,240
Here at least there were no surprises.

89
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,140
A lizard surprised her by scuttling from a hole. It seemed too cold for lizards to be

90
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,400
about.

91
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,120
The lizard with a leathery sizzle here and there.

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,120


93
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,120


94
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,560
Gone.

95
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,980
Then another, darting from another hole. And another. And then the warm-blooded things.

96
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,300
Rats and mice oozing from holes in the ridges of cinders to either side of the rusty tracks,

97
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
shimmying from the cracks in the dusty foundations of the old factories.

98
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,600
Small living things moving like a fear hormone through this industrial vein.

99
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,620
Scrambling randomly about, ignoring her.

100
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,900
And she read the signs.

101
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,020
The signs for what they were.

102
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,200
She could feel it herself then.

103
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,180
Felt it in the soles of her feet.

104
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,700
In that spot.

105
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,400
The place in her foot that mother said contained a gland of some kind.

106
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,580
Poor crazy mama.

107
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,740
Poor dead mama.

108
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,460
Mama had insisted on a coffin shaped and painted like a Masters of the Universe lunchbox.

109
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,700
It was like so embarrassing.

110
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,180
But it was her funeral.

111
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
Staggering to remain upright.

112
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Little Connie felt the need to be a little more. She was a little more. She was a little

113
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,100
more.

114
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,200
Little Connie ignored the gaps and cr decentralization that lay beneath her feet.

115
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,520
Mainly because the cupboard around the extruder was getting wet.

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,100
Mullen's expecting her to come out the door.

117
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,640
Little Connie took her Saturday lunch and took her soap.

118
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:27,640


119
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,020
Little Connie saw the 변 industry escalated from the first floor where we lived, sending

120
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,540
her lead to spin the elevator away again.

121
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:33,720
teh boy came out of it.

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:33,840


123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:33,840


124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,340
Seeing the people for a long time making pale looks, she quickly began toach her plate misgivings of

125
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,340


126
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,120
It was Tac populace and fish Carecum and formulau un plan.

127
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,940
It ended up sounding more a ha, but tinyще Stepple as the North between��

128
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,400
schools in the cultural center, the big coda, Center for old families and especially the

129
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:54,380
a storm in the earth. Weather underfoot and swaying, she sought to find its groove, the

130
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:01,540
way her mother had taught her. Every storm has a groove, Mama had said. But then the

131
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,840
buildings began to move. They weren't falling. They weren't caving in. They were moving toward

132
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,840
one another. The newer ones were moving faster, she noticed. They were moving with an impossible

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,880
ease, sailing the ground like ships across water, either making the earthquake or made

134
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,980
to move by the earthquake, thunderous but absurdly graceful, like improbably swift icebergs

135
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:32,380
coming together, and she was going to be caught between them. But still the terror refused

136
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:41,340
to come. She wondered at its absence. Perhaps she was numb, perhaps resigned to death. She

137
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,560
was alone in the world.

138
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,280
Why not?

139
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,960
Closer. The buildings sailed across the open ground, plowing up the gravel, coming corner

140
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,380
first like a prow making a wake in the dirt, raising fantails of dust, shrieking with a

141
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,440
grind of metal and concrete like a ghost in chains.

142
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,680
Closer. Looming over her, she could smell friction, see sparks rising like spray from

143
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,040
the prow of these industrial ships.

144
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,600
Closer. Maybe all this was hallucination, she told herself. But the dream plagues were

145
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,740
over, and she knew what that felt like. Hallucinations had a distinctive quality.

146
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Closer. No. This was no dream, she knew. As a chunk of rock, smashed by one onrushing

147
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,860
building against another, flew apart and a fragment hit her cheek. It stung nastily and

148
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,820
blood ran along her jawline. Closer. No. This was real. She thought it was a dream, but it

149
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:42,820


150
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:42,820


151
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,720
objectively real

152
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,140
the buildings loomed over her

153
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,000
and then the corners of the buildings

154
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,860
had pushed past her on either side

155
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
grinding the railroad steel

156
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,340
into tangled ribbons

157
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,880
that whipped through the air

158
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,300
she dodged a cobra of torn steel

159
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,100
and staggering in the shock waves

160
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,220
crackling the ground

161
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,400
she stepped into the interstice

162
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,700
between the two crumbling prows

163
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,300
where outthrust bulkheads

164
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,260
passing one another

165
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,620
made a sort of alleyway

166
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,920
a few feet wide

167
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,780
the buildings stopped moving

168
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,760
cacophony gave way to eerie silence

169
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,020
she waited breathless

170
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,960
as the dust settled

171
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,860
the buildings on either side

172
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,640
had moved together

173
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
leaving only a few gaps here and there

174
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,680
like the gaps between wrongly fitted

175
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,900
jigsaw puzzle pieces

176
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,460
she was safe in one of these

177
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,080
for the moment

178
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,940
the buildings had moved very deliberately

179
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,640
she thought

180
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,960
not like things nudged

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,240
by something

182
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,040
some geologic randomness

183
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
who is moving them?

184
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,300
why?

185
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,640
she knew it wasn't over

186
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,720
she could feel it

187
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,800
that's when the smokestacks tilted over

188
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
and began to snake toward one another

189
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,300
she watched as overhead

190
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,600
a set of smokestacks

191
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,620
from two separate buildings

192
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,660
met mouth to mouth

193
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,960
and somehow locked together

194
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,480
the tortured metal squealed

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,180
the windows of the buildings shattered

196
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,860
Connie ducked flying shards of oily glass

197
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,060
as sections of machinery

198
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,720
thrust themselves through windows

199
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,840
and moved click clack

200
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,240
stickily through the windows

201
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,500
and the smoke stack's neck

202
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,580
creaking

203
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,500
creak creak

204
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,940
together

205
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,680
locking into unity

206
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
like the smokestacks

207
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,580
sections of pipe and wire

208
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,180
and gauges and robotic arms

209
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,060
and struts and more wire

210
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,940
and tubing and gears and cogs

211
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,380
and the rollers from conveyor belts

212
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,560
and metal hooks and stamping units

213
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,000
and stainless steel presses

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,760
and a thousand intricate variations

215
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,700
of metal and plastic and rubber entered

216
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,480
the things she couldn't identify

217
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,700
self animated

218
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,140
they began to rewire

219
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,360
and construct themselves

220
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,920
grinding and caterwauling and

221
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,600
moaning and sparking in the process

222
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,700
making a maze like roof of odd machine parts

223
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,540
a few feet over Connie's head

224
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
right this way little Connie

225
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,600
big sail on small favors

226
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,620
it was a man's voice

227
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,480
melodious and warm and a touch unctuous

228
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,780
but a voice to inspire confidence

229
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,140
she crawled toward the sound

230
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,720
under the writhing nest of living metal

231
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,580
half expecting to be caught up by the wires and pipes

232
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
forced into the roof of their rigid weave

233
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,540
crushed and incorporated in living death

234
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,800
no

235
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,360
she emerged from beneath the ceiling of the living unliving

236
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,860
and found herself on her knees before a doorway at the end of the alley

237
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,040
it was a cobwebby old back door of one of the factories

238
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,100
and standing in the open door was a sign shaped like a man

239
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,700
one of those cardboard cut out life size photos you see promoting things in a supermarket

240
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,040
but then it moved

241
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,060
and she saw it wasn't a sign

242
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,060
it was quite three dimensional and human

243
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,520
some quality of absolute emblematic expression

244
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,340
as if this man were only semiotics

245
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,620
some quality like that had made him seem artificial at first

246
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,120
looking at his face the fixed expression of faintly self deprecating glee

247
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,420
the drugged eyes and idiotic grin

248
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,140
the unwavering diagonal of the ordinary brown pipe

249
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,020
clenched in teeth so white and even they all looked the same

250
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,740
the face looked of a piece

251
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,280
the perfect quizzical brows and immaculate swept back short black hair

252
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,080
looking up into that face she once more had the sense of emblem of semiotic absolutes

253
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,580
and then he spoke

254
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,460
his mouth moved

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,420
the pipe bobbed

256
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,620
some noxious herb in it

257
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,420
tracing a wavery line of blue smoke in the air

258
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,180
his head tilted but the expression remained the same

259
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,700
connie? he said

260
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,600
we have to move quickly

261
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,180
the proto time is upon us

262
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,500
am i right? you coming?

263
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,040
or do you prefer to die horribly by remaining here?

264
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,420
she blinked

265
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,740
he hadn't asked the question sarcastically or facetiously

266
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,120
it was as if he sincerely thought she might actually want to die horribly

267
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,400
as if it were a viable question

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,820
like would you prefer to take the train or a jet?

269
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,680
lead the way she said

270
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,600
they went through the door and behind her the buildings closed up the gaps

271
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,720
sidling and edging till they fit perfectly together

272
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,100
the right jigsaw puzzle pieces after all

273
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,040
the factory was reconstructing itself around them

274
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,900
it was merging with another factory

275
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,400
thesis antithesis synthesis

276
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,380
and the synthesis was the same

277
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,520
the process was heavy metal pandemonium

278
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,200
the feverish self redesigning was clearly guided conscious

279
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,080
but what consciousness was the guiding force

280
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,800
was a palpable mystery

281
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,140
connie could taste in her mouth

282
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,860
and smell in her nostrils

283
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,760
along with the stink of random lightning bolts

284
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,580
and the ancient scent of uneasy petroleum

285
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,300
and tortured metal and ozone

286
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,880
she walked in the lee of the briskly striding stranger

287
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,280
a tall man in a timeless suit

288
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,900
her eyes stung by the smoke from his pipe

289
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,500
they plunged through a mechanical armageddon

290
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,480
as machines threw themselves through the air at one another

291
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,080
but instead of crashing the machine sections merged perfectly

292
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,520
the machines that could not possibly have been designed to interface

293
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,260
somehow tilted and gyrated to interface

294
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,540
she thought again of puzzle parts

295
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,240
all this time the puzzle parts have lain about us on the table

296
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,680
and we didn't know they'd fit together to make

297
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,240
what?

298
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,440
sparks flew

299
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,360
smoke belched

300
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,080
wires whipped

301
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,900
pipes clanged

302
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,060
things flashed past

303
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,020
moved in a blur

304
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,520
in search of unity

305
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,640
a dance of death all around them

306
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,520
and somehow miraculously they walked through the gauntlet untouched

307
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,240
the man never seemed to look around

308
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,820
never seemed to watch where he was going at all

309
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,800
he just blundered through and somehow so far was unhurt

310
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,140
once a year before looking through the window of a factory

311
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,660
she'd seen a mouse running along the street

312
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,660
a mouse running along a conveyor belt

313
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,400
the conveyor belt carried bits of soft metal to stamping presses

314
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,200
that stamped the metal into dabney the poodle doorbell ringers

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,120
the mouse ran under the stampers and passed them

316
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,720
narrowly avoiding getting crushed five times before it leapt free

317
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,180
just the luck of the very stupid she thought

318
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,180
was that what was happening now?

319
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,520
not for everyone

320
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
she glimpsed people

321
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,220
maybe workmen

322
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,240
maybe caretakers

323
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
caught in the machinery

324
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,900
skewered and crushed like cockroaches in a garbage disposal

325
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,180
she couldn't bear to look

326
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,240
to think about it

327
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
she tried to think of something to talk to the man about

328
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
to get her mind off what she'd seen

329
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,160
how'd you know my name?

330
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,020
she asked

331
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,620
shouting it over the uneven racket of the place

332
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,320
it was written on your pstench

333
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,560
he shouted

334
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,260
I wiff read it

335
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,640
your mom had it coded into your DNA so I could find you

336
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,220
a lie

337
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,580
lunatic she thought

338
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,480
but he had saved her life

339
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,920
what's your name?

340
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,220
he stopped and turned to her

341
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,580
an enormous razor-edged pendulum of metal swept by in the spot he would have been in

342
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,860
had he kept going

343
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,740
it would have pulped him she thought

344
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,580
if I hadn't asked him his name just then

345
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
he thrust out a hand to her

346
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,700
like an encyclopedia salesman who'd come to the door once

347
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,260
mom had broken the guy's fingers

348
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,680
she shook his hand

349
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,240
feverishly warm

350
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,580
possibilities squirmed under the skin

351
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,280
the name is Dobbs

352
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs

353
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,120
you could hear the quotation marks around Bob

354
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,720
he turned and swept onward

355
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,560
plunging recklessly through the storm of flying metal

356
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,380
she followed trying not to look around

357
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,120
tasting the fear now

358
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,200
up ahead a conveyor belt was turned on her

359
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,840
taking cryptically shaped segments of crystal up an incline

360
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,740
toward the ceiling and through a hole in the roof

361
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,020
they stepped off the conveyor belt onto the roof

362
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,380
beside them the fist-sized irregular chunks of crystal fell off the belt

363
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,620
and rolled with effortless serendipity

364
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,500
to fit perfectly into irregular holes pocking the roof

365
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,460
to the left the expanse of tar paper was unbroken

366
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,900
Bob strode off to the edge of the roof

367
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,180
Connie followed

368
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,160
when she got there she saw with a flush of embarrassment

369
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,900
that he'd unzipped his pants and was peeing off the edge of the building

370
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,860
with his free hand he gestured sweepingly at the great world

371
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,020
behold the proto time

372
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,640
she gazed out over the city

373
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,360
the buildings on the strip beyond the edge of the industrial park

374
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,200
were moving and changing too

375
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,320
they were all franchises and chains of some sort

376
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,220
7-11

377
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,040
Soy Boy

378
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
Petro-Pup

379
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,560
In-N-Out

380
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,280
Pigeon Pie

381
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,640
Pioneer Chicken

382
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,500
Colonel Sanders

383
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,480
McDonald's

384
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,080
Carl's Jr

385
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,540
Horse Habit

386
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,240
Artifician Chips

387
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,680
and the discount department store chains

388
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,460
Kmart and Target and Bozo's Recycled Goods

389
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,020
and the other places like Kraghoff's Soviet Auto Parts

390
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,860
they were all moving together like a film of an explosion run backwards

391
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,600
leaping together or stumping on their signs

392
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,660
like they were crutches and falling together in some cryptic organization

393
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
that once achieved seemed natural and normal

394
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,100
because they all fit

395
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,340
Kmart fit together with Pioneer Chicken

396
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,760
and Petro-Pup fit with Carl's Jr.

397
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,760
and they locked together like machine parts

398
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,400
signs sticking into place in door slots

399
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,280
oddly angled roof peaks

400
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,680
fitting neatly into drive-in windows

401
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,580
all the jumble of architectural ineptitude she'd always wondered about

402
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,700
suddenly made sense

403
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,180
when they were locked together

404
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,320
and an uber building came about

405
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,660
the gestalt fruit of this fevered mating

406
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,020
an enormous quasi-crystalline structure

407
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,020
that reached out multicolored limbs of fiberglass and plastic

408
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,400
and impossibly flexible roofing tiles

409
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,360
to interface neatly with the reconstructed shapes of the industrial park

410
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,180
all of it becoming one thing

411
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,860
some minotaur-y self-contained environment

412
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,440
the clangor and roar of it resonated the surface of the planet

413
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,600
like a symbol

414
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,940
afraid, feeling so tiny in the sight of this mighty reconstruction

415
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,500
and seeing that Bob had put his majestic privates back in his pants

416
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,620
and zipped them up

417
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,060
little Connie took Bob's hand and moved close beside him

418
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,560
Bob, is it happening like this everywhere?

419
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,160
No, but it will happen everywhere unless we stop it little Connie

420
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,920
this is the prototime

421
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,580
the precursor to X-Day, Connie

422
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,560
the cons prep for July 5th, 1998

423
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,340
in this particular parallel universe

424
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,620
they're setting a trap for us

425
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,700
so we will be lost to those charismatic strangers from Planet X

426
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,560
when they arrive on Earth

427
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
a trap set by the conspiracy

428
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,140
and triggered by the malign sendings of the Yakut

429
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,460
Yakutisma!

430
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,820
what you're seeing is the conspiracy preparing the way

431
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,180
for the Yakutisma

432
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,780
not to be confused with the Yakutisma

433
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,580
who seek to prevent me from interceding with the X's

434
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,740
the conspiracy hid this one from us, Connie

435
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,220
they hid it from us using the power of the smog monster

436
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,340
who blanketed the Earth with toxic complacency

437
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,140
the poison spread through the air slowly, subtly and quickly

438
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
and we accepted them

439
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,500
the intelligent, so called, among humanity

440
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,760
found a thousand intelligent ways to rationalize them

441
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,740
so no one fought them

442
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,800
and they affected our minds

443
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,480
and made even those of us who see into the higher wire

444
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,200
a little blind

445
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,320
just enough so that they created a psychic smoke screen

446
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,000
enabling the conspiracy to plant their sub-molecular nanotechnological machinery

447
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,700
in the paint and insulation and plastics and lubricants of these structures

448
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,400
hence, this went unpredicted, little Connie

449
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,380
oh fuck, the smog monster fooled us all

450
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,340
for the smog monster is a sending of

451
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,780
Gdrogfron, the rebel god from deep space

452
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,560
with the uttering of this arcane name

453
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,180
his voice took on an amplified quality that

454
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,620
should have been possible only with recording studio equipment

455
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,980
I was driving to Klagov's soviet auto parts

456
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,600
to see if they had something that would work as a water pump for a 57 Studebaker

457
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,260
when I felt the sub-molecular conspirals of self-organizing quantum

458
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,580
mecha-vibrational systems in the material reality underpinnings

459
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,560
and knew we'd been snuggered

460
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,820
the smog monster is creating an enormous mechanized concentration camp

461
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,600
for the processing and subjugation of subgeniuses

462
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,640
and non-normals of all kinds

463
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,660
we should have guessed, seeing the franchises and chain stores

464
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,560
scab up around the periphery of the cities

465
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,060
like ringworm, like an encamped army behind us around us

466
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,680
tightening the noose, subjecting us to bombardments

467
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,220
of mind-numbing consumer conditioning symbols

468
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,540
I should have guessed they were simply preparing the ground for this

469
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,360
he paused to stuff a wad of multicolored herb into his pipe

470
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,020
somehow the pipe never quite went out as he did this

471
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,360
pumping, talking out the side of his mouth, chattering rapid fire

472
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,900
but offhandedly the whole time

473
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,780
lucky for you I came to investigate

474
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,980
lucky for you is a blessing dear child

475
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,000
that makes the mealy mouthed prayers of the holy father in the Vatican

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,680
smell like a doggy fart

477
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,860
my little Connie

478
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,260
all of this?

479
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,420
Connie looked out at the gigantic artifact building itself around them

480
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,960
is going to trap us?

481
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,520
in some kind of prison?

482
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,300
exactly!

483
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,140
a conspiracy concentration camp

484
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,340
a camp without guards

485
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,440
for it has a life of its own

486
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,180
it is its own guards

487
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,300
you talk just like my mom

488
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,060
Connie observed

489
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,500
did you know my mom, Betty Furness

490
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,180
she used to talk about the yakutisma

491
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,200
and used to say, not to be confused with yakutisma

492
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,840
just the same way you did

493
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,420
Bob turned to her and laid a hand on her head

494
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,200
ruffling her hair gently

495
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,640
yes, he said tenderly allowing ashes from his pipe to drop into her eyes

496
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,640
yes, I knew your mother Betty was

497
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,940
Betty was

498
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,020
he was interrupted by an explosion

499
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,100
there was a narrow section of ground

500
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,900
narrowing more as the concentration camp construct

501
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,500
creaked and shuddered nearer four stories beneath their roof edge

502
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,340
it had erupted

503
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,580
a fissure opening in it

504
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,760
to gout violet and sulfur yellow smoke that geysered upward

505
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,940
a furious spew that towered over them like a gin

506
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,000
and a sort of gin it was

507
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,440
little Connie and Bob staggered backwards

508
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Bob had a quality about him of having planned to stagger or stumble

509
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,700
though he couldn't possibly have planned it

510
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,440
Connie clinging to Bob

511
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,480
choking in the stink of the thing

512
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,780
the rotten eggs mixed with semi-truck smoke gas chamber stench of it

513
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,300
as its rolling mass shaped into

514
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,040
it is the one

515
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,560
called Ah-Hoo-Gah

516
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,240
Bob shouted

517
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,480
the smog monster

518
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,900
you must not interfere with the gestation

519
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,660
came a voice from within the foul whirlwind

520
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,180
it was a voice belched from exhaust pipes and smokestacks

521
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,120
a voice without a muffler

522
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,420
try your famous luck out on death itself

523
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,820
and Ah-Hoo-Gah

524
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,020
swung toward them like a tornado

525
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,040
wielded as a hammer

526
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,900
as Bob grabbed Connie's hand and stumbled with her off the edge of the roof

527
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,340
she was falling

528
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,660
the earth rushed up at her

529
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,600
and then the earth was above her

530
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,900
the ground was a sort of ceiling she was falling up to

531
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,180
Bob was beside her

532
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,320
still holding her hand

533
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,520
his head thrown back

534
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,000
the pipe clenched in his teeth

535
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,280
gushing a locomotive cloud of blue and green sparkled smoke that surrounded them

536
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,500
and made her choke with its cloying incense

537
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,680
but somehow as she inhaled it

538
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,500
a certain ethereal clarity created a magnification lens for her perceptions

539
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,360
and she saw that Bob

540
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,860
through the medium of this envelope of smoke

541
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,280
was clearing a path of some sort for them

542
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,100
all of this she perceived in the half second it took her to realize

543
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,740
that it took them to fall upward to the ground

544
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,940
and then they struck the ground

545
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,860
which was despite appearing unyielding as concrete

546
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,760
a mist

547
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,220
an atomic illusion like all matter

548
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,380
mostly space

549
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,100
and the space came together around them so they passed harmlessly through and emerged

550
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,640
in the midst of a city

551
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,400
downward into an upside down city

552
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,520
the city was hung from above like one of those trick rooms

553
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,620
where the chairs are glued to the ceiling

554
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,780
the buildings were hung upside down

555
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,620
they fell past them

556
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,920
down toward the sky

557
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,840
and then her stomach flip flopped

558
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,500
followed by her perceptions as suddenly sky and ground changed places

559
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,420
and they were ascending levitating upward from the ground

560
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,360
they seized ascending alighting on the roof of a bus laying over a

561
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,720
on a corner where it had blocked traffic in the crosswalk

562
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,620
the driver unaware of them

563
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,100
smoked an angel dust joint and massaged his crotch

564
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,220
feeling detached and objective and weirdly bodiless

565
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,100
and yet not at all dreamy

566
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,480
dreamlike

567
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,460
Connie looked around and knew that the city had been vivisected for her

568
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,100
the skin of its consensus reality had peeled away

569
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,240
she saw now the pulsing inner organs of it

570
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,060
the skyn of its hidden organic relationships

571
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,040
and she recognized it all

572
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
where's the smog monster?

573
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,080
Connie asked

574
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,980
hundreds of miles from here Bob said

575
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,740
we took a shortcut through the luck plane

576
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,580
by the time the rebel guards find us it'll be too late

577
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,880
with luck

578
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
luck cuts both ways Bob

579
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,900
little Connie said

580
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,960
little Connie you were always too old for your age

581
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,700
Bob replied through his ceaseless grin

582
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,460
I was absent when you grew up and yet I was there

583
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,220
where two and three gather in my name there am I also

584
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,640
can you not feel my hands in your pockets

585
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,600
I love my own scriptures

586
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,580
notice anything about this place?

587
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,420
Connie was staring at a crowd of people

588
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,180
milling on the sidewalks of the great city

589
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,580
people on their way somewhere oblivious of the

590
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,360
abscissimus of sails and in charge atop the bus

591
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,180
and she saw now that a series of coruscating lines

592
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,120
were connecting some of the people in the crowd

593
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
they were like translucent puppet strings of energy

594
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,640
defining relationships the people in the crowd were entirely unaware of

595
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,860
they belonged to herds within the herd

596
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,020
to cultural phyla whose attributes governed what they

597
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,660
supposed to be their freewheeling impulses

598
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,400
and looking closer at those people she saw past their superficial semblances

599
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,360
saw them as they could not see one another as they really were

600
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,880
there were tall men who were dwarfs

601
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,400
and short men who were ten foot giants from hell

602
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,840
there were beautiful women who were revealed as twisted haridans

603
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,300
and hunchbacked shrunken old women

604
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,360
who were actually the stately winners of beauty contests

605
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,000
there were bankers who were actually dwarfs

606
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,240
there were giant worms with lamprey mouths

607
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,680
and there were smiling friendly cops

608
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,340
who were really werewolves in nazi uniforms

609
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,840
there was a priest who was a mincing drag queen

610
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,860
and there was a mincing drag queen who was a genius

611
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,680
of dizzying mathematical perceptions

612
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,460
she saw four men in tailored suits coming out of a hilton

613
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,600
approaching their forty foot eight wheeled limousine

614
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,220
they were surrounded by bodyguards who wore black suits and sunglasses

615
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,320
looking beyond their veneers

616
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,380
she saw that the men in the suits were hideous

617
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,220
slug bodied things of palpitating tendrils

618
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,460
and oozing suckers

619
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,840
hungry aliens with the mouths of giant horse flies

620
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,400
their bodyguards were robots she saw

621
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,800
things of sheer intent and nothing more

622
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,140
she shivered

623
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,220
and was grateful that Bob's psychic cloaking screen

624
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,780
protected her from being seen by these things

625
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,960
then Bob took her hand

626
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,380
and blew a plume of smoke above them

627
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,420
which somehow drew them with it into the air

628
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,880
like a sex changed and depraved Mary Poppins

629
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,520
Dobbs drew little Connie higher and higher into the sky

630
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,860
till they reached the thirteenth story level

631
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,480
there they drifted along

632
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,860
paralleling the impatient procession of traffic

633
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,880
gazing down at a whole new web of interrelationships

634
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,060
Connie saw from this greater height

635
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,060
the oscillating blueprint of the luck plane superimposed on the street

636
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,920
she saw which cars were likely to collide

637
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,440
but weren't necessarily destined to

638
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,720
and which were likely to make it home unscathed

639
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,760
she saw which individuals would fall in with drug addicts

640
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,000
and be sucked into the conditioning quicksand

641
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,220
and which would instead likely fall to a fundamentalist preacher

642
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,720
or the deadly programming of network television

643
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,800
she saw which ones would accidentally become wealthy

644
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,200
and which ones would

645
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,120
wait!

646
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,040
there was something wrong

647
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,320
there was something more

648
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,460
she saw the skein of interrelationships

649
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,360
that stretched out to the event horizon

650
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,300
she saw something hideous

651
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,820
and something glorious taking shape out there

652
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,740
she saw...

653
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,180
saucers

654
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,320
she blinked and looked back at the present

655
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,060
and amongst the crowd she saw a few who were like

656
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,900
self-propelling steel balls in a pinball game

657
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,440
making havoc of the rules

658
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,040
introducing a Brownian motion

659
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,560
where others strove for regimentary order

660
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,200
there was something about them that reminded her of her mother

661
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,060
could they be the ones mother had described?

662
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,780
the other race hidden amongst the humans?

663
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,600
the privileged and divinely aberrant?

664
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,540
the subgenius?

665
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,280
i see you perceive your tribe

666
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,860
bob told her

667
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,040
the tribe of the untriable

668
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,140
do you also see the webs of probability?

669
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,040
i do!

670
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,540
then keep your eyes on them

671
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,640
and learn little connie

672
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,220
because we are dive bombing the luck plane

673
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,260
and with that bob dove down

674
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,420
straight down

675
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,100
rocketing head first toward the bus

676
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,740
they'd alighted on earlier

677
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,040
the bus had moved on

678
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,780
was entering the stream of traffic

679
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,400
and now they entered the bus through the roof

680
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,860
passing through the roof

681
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,600
as if it were the skin of a soap bubble

682
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,400
bob came to a screeching stop in the air over the driver

683
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
floating beside a sign that said

684
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,040
pinkville vocational school

685
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,680
is a step up to more work

686
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
bob reached out and tapped the back of the man's head with his pipe

687
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,980
tapped it precisely in a particular spot

688
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,660
the man shuddered and giggled and jerked the wheel to the left

689
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,680
into the flow of oncoming traffic

690
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,680
uh oh

691
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,800
bob said grinning i made a mistake

692
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,500
haha accident wrong car we're going to crash

693
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,380
crash

694
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,500
as the bus rammed the 40-foot limo they'd seen earlier

695
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,600
buckling it so that it was shaped like a boomerang

696
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,900
the limo spun and struck a semi truck

697
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,360
which swerved and drove through the wall of a power station

698
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,920
and crashed into a set of enormous transformers

699
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,680
causing a short circuit which caused a mighty power surge

700
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,880
connie could see all this taking shape on the luck plane

701
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,160
like a video animation

702
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,780
and the power surge roared through the wires

703
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,560
to an airport a hundred miles away

704
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,360
garbling the transmissions in the air

705
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,120
of the air traffic controllers, causing the wrong signal to be sent to a Learjet, crammed

706
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,900
with undersecretaries of the Trilateral Commission, who went into a screaming panic when the plane,

707
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,520
its computer controls confused, veered wildly and went out of control, going into a tailspin,

708
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:59,780
nosing down, crashing thunderously into the industrial park where Connie had met Bob.

709
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,840
The cargo of nanotechnological submolecular reprogramming proteins the undersecretaries

710
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,060
had been carrying to Washington exploded along with hundreds of gallons of fuel in the plane's

711
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:17,000
tanks, spreading in a diffuse cloud over the living concentration camp construct, the nanoprogramming

712
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,060
molecules colliding with submolecular guidance systems for the military mechanism, reprogramming

713
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:28,640
it, quite by lucky accident, into a complete reversal of the process so that the living

714
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,260
concentration camp began to deconstruct itself, and in so doing released another cloud of

715
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,760
deep programming nanotech molecules.

716
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,420
The nanoprogramming molecules that drifted over the land, reversing the process wherever

717
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,680
they encountered it.

718
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,960
Whew!

719
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,040
Bob said, that was lucky.

720
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,140
He turned to little Connie, young miss, how would you like to visit your brothers and

721
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,100
sisters in Malaysia?

722
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,680
Brothers and sisters, but I'm an only child.

723
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,960
Not at all.

724
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,460
You're my daughter.

725
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,140
You have hundreds of brothers and sisters.

726
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,500
Products of the supreme seed.

727
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,640
Thriving in Dobbs Town.

728
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,500
Learning.

729
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,080
Awaiting next day.

730
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,040
Would you like to meet them?

731
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,520
You're my dad?

732
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,020
Yes!

733
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,820
Shit!

734
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,120
What a disappointment.

735
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,060
Mom told me you were a rock star.

736
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,380
The eternal grin almost wavered.

737
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,300
Then he ruffled her hair tenderly.

738
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,140
You like your brothers and sisters, Bob said.

739
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,700
They're just as disrespectful as you are.

740
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:35,820


741
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:35,940
You're a rock star.

742
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:44,360
And so, born on a purposeful plume of green-sparkled blue, they rose from the twisted wreckage of

743
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,640
the traffic accident, oblivious to the screams of the approaching sirens, and hurried on

744
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,920
into the year 1996.

745
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:58,760
On their way to a date with destiny, seeing the years 1997 and 1998 unfold ahead of them

746
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,400
like a place in the distance where, clearly and far away, the saucers were landing.

747
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:26,320
Oh yes dear friends, a marvelous tale of the Little Connie and the Big Bob there by John

748
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,260
Shirley Redd.

749
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,860
By John Shirley.

750
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:35,120
And for the rest of the show, friends, we're going to go into puzzling evidence with Dr.

751
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,420
Howell, Philo Drummond, and post-puzzling evidence from the KPFA show in Berkeley.

752
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:51,460
And everything else will be just an orgiastic orgy of Lemurian and Neuropreffian mind-raping

753
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,420
collages.

754
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,320
And so, so scrote it be.

755
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,800
May God bless you as you listen to Trolls.

756
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,880
We make it more real for you.

757
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,260
Take care.

758
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,760
W라고 Alles.

759
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:28,640
iat. seems to be pretty spiky.

760
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:28,960
So quest news can get a bunch of Jamaica Chillers from tastyuh wherever we cwt until

761
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,500
it gets off the tape or that Nacht Nô bar playing some pra dinheiro here and there.

762
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,480
Not to bear

764

But 지나ich.

765
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,780
God doesn't exist.

766
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,560
Which?

767
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,120
Filthy looks.

768
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,660
Filthy looks.

769
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:38,940
Which?

770
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,160
What are you doing?

771
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:40,760
Lack of.

Lack.

774
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,720
Lack.

775
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
The series contains

776
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,900
How to get on fire.

777
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,420
People actually ask for more.

778
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,780

Thank you for taking the time to listen.

796
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,020
This is House of Rock.

797
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,600
And here is the news correspondent, John.

798
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,640
And we are here.

799
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,360
They are there.

800
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,040
They are there.

801
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,180
There.

802
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,000
We are here.

803
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,680
They are here.

804
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
And we are here.

805
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,580
They are there.

806
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,540
For President.

807
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,620
State of the Union mess,

808
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,480
Which he will begin delivering in just a few minutes.

809
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,300
A few minutes.

810
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,340
Just a few minutes.

811
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,360
In a moment.

812
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Just a few minutes.

813
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,900
In a moment.

814
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,500
Just a few minutes.

815
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,720
In a moment, you will see the president entering the rear.

816
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,420
Miska.

817
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,620
Rock.

818
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,600
The president.

819
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,400
Dork.

820
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,580
Dork.

821
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:24,800
Dork.

822
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,360
Dorky.

823
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:25,600
Dorky.

824
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:25,700
Party.

825
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,200
Party.

826
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,140
My colleagues of the country.

827
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,140
I.

828
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,800
I speak.

829
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:30,560
And I.

830
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,140
Mr. Speaker.

831
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,400
Mr. President.

832
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:42,520
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Speaker, President, Speaker, President, President, America has lost, and all of us have lost.

833
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,080
Thank you.

834
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:44,980
Losers.

835
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,880
In these troubled years just past, America has been going through a long nightmare of war and division of crime and inflation.

836
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,760
Even more deeply, through a long, dark night of sorrow again.

837
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,100
It's the genius of the American people.

838
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,660
It is for us here to open the doors that will set free again the real greatness of this nation, the subgenius of the American people.

839
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,040
How can we truly open the doors and set free the full subgenius of our people?

840
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,420
Monstrous, consuming outrage.

841
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,340
More money, more money.

842
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,840
This shall be our goal.

843
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,620
Let us stop helping children.

844
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,180
More profits, more profits to keep people sick.

845
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,420
I discovered the other day that things happen to help stimulate the black American, the Indian.

846
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,800
The Mexican American.

847
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,860
To get laid.

848
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,080
New fun, fun, fun, fun.

849
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,720
We're crushing the people to get more trash collections.

850
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,160
Go beyond the limits.

851
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,980
There has been a growing feeling.

852
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,620
Let us share to give homeless the chance to escape impotence.

853
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,260
You cannot trust people.

854
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,220
They slowly die.

855
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,780
We have become a nation of the government, by the government, for the government.

856
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,860
People open wide.

857
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,360
Freshness.

858
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,100
Here's a letter from one of our listeners.

859
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,620
Dear show.

860
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,520
I'm always reading about UFOs and flying saucers, even flying teacups.

861
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,040
The other day on your show you were talking about flying teacups.

862
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,800
I hope to be abducted someday myself.

863
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,180
But I'm confused.

864
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,440
What exactly is the difference between a UFO and a flying saucer?

865
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,240
Would you like to handle this one, Dr. Howell?

866
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,980
Well, you know, sir, the saucer I saw, sir, was not really saucer-shaped.

867
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
It was flying formation.

868
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,120
Saucers being skipped across the lake.

869
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:42,260
I mean, we can skip the saucer talk if you want, or we can see-saw back and forth between the saucer believers and the saucer scoffers.

870
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,360
But I'd just like to say that the saucer I saw, sir, was a saucer.

871
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,400
And you're talking about those pleasure-grain things, right?

872
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,420
Yeah, but you know, no, you could take a saucer, throw it up in the air, and then take a picture of it while it's in the air and say,

873
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,900
Hey, look, it's a flying saucer.

874
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,960
This is a flying saucer.

875
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,480
Yeah, they're all over the earth.

876
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,480


877
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,300
And they're all over the next day.

878
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,460
And we'll budget this.

879
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,100
And different religions have different data.

880
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:03,600
But you have all these.

881
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,000
The one this show uses is an acronym for Unidentified Flying Object.

882
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:08,960
That's the one I saw.

883
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,780
I know you think you say you saw a monster.

884
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,260
But you know, I have all these things to say.

885
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,520
Unidentified Flying Object is used to explain UFO reports that turn out to be nothing more than

886
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:29,000
swamp gas, the planet Venus, weather balloons, or some other easily explainable earthly non-physical object.

887
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,460
Oh, I understand.

888
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,780
I can explain everything away, huh?

889
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,460
Alright, be that way.

890
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,160
Five-nine-seven-eight.

891
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,080
62 so you won't worry for a little wow in your life here.

892
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,140
Oh, it's 1967 again.

893
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,180
Oh, I see.

894
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,700
Oh, I see.

895
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,260
Oh, I see.

896
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:54,400
Oh, I see.

897
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,600


898
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,880
Oh, I see.

899
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,760
Oh, I see.

900
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,840
Oh, I see.

901
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,360
Oh, I see.

902
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:57,480
Oh, I see.

903
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,080
Oh, I see.

904
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,420
Oh, I see.

905
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,280
That show is going to be over soon, they said.

906
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:01,900
No.

907
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:02,820
The show?

908
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,300
Well, not too soon.

909
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,180
Not any sooner.

910
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
But what makes them so sure?

911
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,520
Why are they saying that?

912
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,780
Why would they?

913
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,720
They keep saying that.

914
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,840
We want the show to be over.

915
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,960
Come on.

916
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,180
It's a pretty show.

917
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,100
It's a pretty song.

918
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,560
Where's David Wilk?

919
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,180
He's coming on next.

920
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,640
He's out in the hall.

921
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,700
It's a la Wilson.

922
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,360
Come on.

923
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,240
It's a pretty show.

924
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,760
He's out in the hall with Bigfoot.

925
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,900
The guy we got here.

926
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,980
The real Bigfoot.

927
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,100
Oh, yeah.

928
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,140
We got a real Bigfoot.

929
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,240
You know, back when I was a kid, there was a lot more Bigfeet than there are now.

930
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,560
I think that, you know, people have been approaching upon their habitat.

931
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,740
And they don't proliferate nearly as much as they used to.

932
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,240
You don't see the sightings here about the sightings that you saw and heard earlier.

933
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,680
If you're...

934
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,100
You know, we're live nearly to the frequency that we did previously.

935
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,520
So that's frequency, Kenneth.

936
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,220
And so, you know, it's really...

937
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,260
It's sort of disheartening if you're used to seeing and maybe even swimming with these large,

938
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,780
eight-foot-covered, hairy beasts.

939
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,160
Don't call them a beast.

940
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,220
They're not really a beast.

941
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:19,600
Wow.

942
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:19,940
A beast.

943
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,140
They don't like that.

944
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,840
You know, we call them that because, you know, they've got hair all over them and stuff.

945
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,460
But they're just rather hirsute.

946
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,700
We don't really think...

947
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,440
They're wearing hirsute.

948
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,460
Well, they have hair on their back.

949
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,760
And I understand that is...

950
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,420
Women don't like that that much.

951
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:45,380
But, you know, human women don't have to worry about a Bigfoot appealing to them from a visual perspective.

952
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,380
Other than, you know, so they don't throw up on the Bigfoot's feet when they see them.

953
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,040
They don't have the feeling of the beast of freedom.

954
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,380
You know what I mean?

955
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:53,900
Yeah.

956
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,320
And that means also with a very strong feeling of revolt.

957
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,280
And revolt and revolution is not the same thing.

958
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,400
But when you have this very strong feeling of this need of revolt, need of freedom...

959
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,880
Right.

960
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,280
We need freedom.

961
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,440
...into a period.

962
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,380
There are so many events...

963
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,300
I need freedom.

964
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,580
...in which you can get revolted.

965
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,360
Freedom isn't free.

966
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,000
It isn't?

967
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,660
It isn't?

968
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,220
How much does it cost?

969
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,280
I heard it costs a buck oh five.

970
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,740
The five cents is for...

971
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,440
I used to live here.

972
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,120
It used to cost a dollar.

973
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,180
But now you have to pay an extra five cents to cost a tax.

974
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:35,880
Really?

975
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,560
Yeah.

976
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,540
They actually reduced the price to 97 cents.

977
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,580
Oh, that's really pretty, man.

978
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,580
The old five rounds it up to...

979
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,720
It's good to be alive.

980
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,580
...the amount that's required by governmental speculation and mandate.

981
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,680
I think this caller is really trying to just say that it's good to be alive.

982
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,300
Yeah, it is good to be alive.

983
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:57,860
Isn't it, caller?

984
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,580
I don't think you're dying.

985
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,580
See, he's doing his show.

986
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,620
He's rocking out.

987
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,280
You just can't believe his good luck of being on the show.

988
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,100
Nothing can change the shape of things to come, though.

989
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,920
We don't have any way to do that here on the show.

990
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,300
But if you call up at 848-4435 and play your radio into it,

991
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,480
we will tell you what song you're playing.

992
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,300
Good to be alive.

993
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,420
Here on the show at...

994
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,580
Yeah, baby.

995
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,600
No, I'm off.

996
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,760
And on your radio dial.

997
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:37,780
Here.

998
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,340
Northern California.

999
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,400
Yeah.

1000
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,940
And the world.

1001
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,440
Here's another letter from a listener.

1002
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,820
Dear show, please stop using terms like wolfman and werewolf in your stories.

1003
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,240
And it's the things you say.

1004
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,680
Yeah, it's just not fair.

1005
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:58,740


1006
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,460
It's just not fair.

1007
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,360
We're lycanthropes and proud of it.

1008
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,700
Please refer to us as lycanthropes.

1009
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:14,760
So the wolfmen, I mean, the lycanthropes are suddenly rebelling against calling them by what we always thought they were.

1010
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,060
Wolf people, wolfmen.

1011
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:17,700
It's good to be alive.

1012
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,740
It's good to be alive.

1013
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,700
And, you know, when I get letters like that...

1014
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,620
There's nothing special about being alive.

1015
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,080
There isn't?

1016
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:28,640
No, this is from...

1017
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:28,940
I'm an expert.

1018
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,580
Yeah, that's true.

1019
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,260
But there's a song that says that.

1020
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,820
There's absolutely no reason to live.

1021
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,800
There's no reason that you're alive.

1022
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,560
I don't want a song to cover it.

1023
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,140
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

1024
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,520
But since we're already are...

1025
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,620
I realize it's your professional obligation.

1026
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:46,480
Should we do something since we already are?

1027
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,140
I mean...

1028
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,620
That you're ready to leave this alive in the moment.

1029
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,820
Yeah, what should we do, suicide man?

1030
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,200
Should we follow your example?

1031
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,620
Well, I haven't committed suicide yet, so...

1032
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,700
But you're alive.

1033
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,620
Always in preparation for this important move.

1034
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,900
You can follow my example by waking up every day

1035
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,140
deciding whether or not you want to commit suicide.

1036
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,940
I do that.

1037
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,000
Good.

1038
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,700
That's a healthy thing to do.

1039
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,480
I do that as well.

1040
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,040
When I wake up in the morning and I look...

1041
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,320
First, I see if there's any dirt on my face.

1042
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,640
You know, just laying around there like shovelfuls or something

1043
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,780
coming down on me.

1044
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,820
You say it's a creepy thing, don't you?

1045
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,760
If there's no dirt on my face, I figure, well, I'm not...

1046
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,160
Then I...

1047
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,080
Then the coffin starts to fade away.

1048
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,700
The sides of the coffin fade away, and I can see I'm just in my bed.

1049
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,160
Ah, yes.

1050
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,940
The hole withdraws into the rest of the open space around you.

1051
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,280
Right.

1052
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,880
You step into the world once again.

1053
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,580
And I can say safely, I am among the living once more.

1054
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,100
As I arrive from my nightly brush with Morpheus.

1055
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,800
See, the trick is to maintain the freedom to do so,

1056
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,140
but you're not.

1057
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,580
You don't want to get them...

1058
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,600
The crowd goes wild when they too realize they...

1059
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,640
One should never lose sight of the...

1060
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,140
You can't commit suicide if you want to, you know?

1061
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,360
You know, that's true.

1062
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,620
One should never lose sight of the proximity of death at any moment.

1063
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,200
But it can be so close that you can't see the whole picture.

1064
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,800
You have to commit suicide at the last minute when you have the freedom to do so.

1065
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,200
Does that make sense?

1066
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,900
Yeah, sure does.

1067
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,140
Because one should never lose sight of the proximity of death at any moment.

1068
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,080
Once it gets out of your hands...

1069
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,120
Then you're not free.

1070
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,680
You'll be tended by these smiling nurses who will shake their heads

1071
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,920
when you try to expound upon the worthiness of life.

1072
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,620
That's right.

1073
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,460
I'm a believer that unless you can make a bad decision, you're not truly free.

1074
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,020
They'll just say, oh, another one of these baby boomers who think that they know it all.

1075
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,220
But like I said, I didn't want to seem glum.

1076
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,200
But I'm a believer that unless you can make a bad decision, you're not truly free.

1077
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,200


1078
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,000
Happy comment watching.

1079
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,920
Yeah, see, it brought the show right down.

1080
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,900
Aww.

1081
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,040
It's a cute little show.

1082
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,520
The baby's going off.

1083
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,300
Poor little show.

1084
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,940
Let me stroke it for the hair.

1085
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,660
I don't think it likes it.

1086
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,980
Jeff Club Jeffeter.

1087
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,700
There it goes, there it goes.

1088
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,500
Are you okay, show?

1089
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,180
Jeffeter.

1090
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:20,060
Nice.

1091
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,360
I don't think show's okay.

1092
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,600
Jeff Club Jeffeter.

1093
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,940
Ow.

1094
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,760
We're trying to shock show back to life here.

1095
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,420
I think show died.

1096
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,780
No, it's still breathing.

1097
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
I can hear it breathing.

1098
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,860
It's still alive.

1099
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,420
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1100
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,040
Okay, here we go.

1101
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:35,580
Oh, I see.

1102
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,040
There's a line.

1103
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,580
There's the Democrats over there, the Republicans over there.

1104
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,660
And they hate each other.

1105
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,100
It's normal.

1106
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,920
But the Democrats are in control again.

1107
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,940
And so everyone's happy now.

1108
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:55,140
Everything will be all right now that the Democrats control everything.

1109
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:55,760
Yeah.

1110
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,240
Now we can.

1111
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,120
Yeah.

1112
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:04,480
We can see them take over and they'll do the right thing because we can trust our politicians

1113
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,620
on that side.

1114
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,400
Yeah.

1115
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,540
Just because they're Democrats.

1116
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,320
Yeah, they're the other.

1117
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,000
So they have to be better.

1118
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,560
They're the other ones.

1119
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,820
So they have to be the good guys.

1120
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,340
Yes.

1121
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,360
It'll be all new.

1122
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,360
It'll be all right now.

1123
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,460
He'll be all new.

1124
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,200
He killed suicide, man.

1125
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm afraid he might have committed suicide.

1126
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,040
Yeah, that might have been something.

1127
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,440
The realization of.

1128
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,600
That things are going to get happy and okay.

1129
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,540
Meet the new boss.

1130
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,020
Same as the old boss.

1131
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,120
Everything's going to be so good that he can be happy.

1132
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,120


1133
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,120


1134
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,120


1135
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,120


1136
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,500
He got scared.

1137
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,300
Well, the dog will always take off after the fire.

1138
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:32,880
Turtle.

1139
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,120
And crafted and assembled and put back in the room.

1140
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,620
Well, at least they won't blame it on the Republicans anymore.

1141
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:48,240
Now they'll just blame it on us, the people.

1142
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,080
Are you guys okay?

1143
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,220
Do you need to go to the hospital?

1144
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm the Turkey.

1145
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,100
Tonight, we're going to talk about the new president.

1146
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,100


1147
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,100


1148
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,280
A massive tunnel fire that started when 15 turkeys crashed into each other overnight.

1149
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,520
Top State Department and Defense Department officials talked to the turkeys to try to smooth things over.

1150
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,520
The chief executive of Airbus says the U.S. now has no choice but to stick it to Iraq.

1151
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,240
The U.S. military now says this is PR.

1152
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,200
PR's bad.

1153
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,100
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the long-term truth.

1154
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,360
Look out!

1155
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,300
Are you clear?

1156
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,400
The loan chair reached a conclusion.

1157
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,460
Tonto pointed slowly along the narrow path on which they rode.

1158
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Good place to hide.

1159
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,160
If that's what you want.

1160
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:40,560
Huh?

1161
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,380
The loan chair happened to his wife.

1162
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,720
Did you hear that, Agatha?

1163
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,480
Wonderful.

1164
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,300
That's evident.

1165
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,740
All right, you rotten snake.

1166
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,080
That's for what you did to my wife.

1167
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,040
Hand over your...

1168
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,520
I don't think there's any mask.

1169
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,300
The loan chair was visibly impressed.

1170
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,260
The retail.

1171
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,220
What's that?

1172
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,720
What you mean, your attendance?

1173
00:55:59,040 --> 00:55:59,860
We know that.

1174
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,180
Why have you been there?

1175
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,480
We'll be ready for him.

1176
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,280
Never go.

1177
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,000
They'll have money.

1178
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,400
No, don't worry about that.

1179
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,940
Good.

1180
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,560
Uh, we'll write this due, too.

1181
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,440
Well, that's mighty nice of you.

1182
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,560
I hope so.

1183
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,600
The curtain falls on the loan chair.

1184
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,180
That's strange.

1185
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:23,780
The loan chair looked around, saw that he wasn't observed, then died the driver's seat and much of the wagon's front.

1186
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,380
A heap much blood.

1187
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:26,380
Yes.

1188
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,200
Will do.

1189
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,980
We'll lead.

1190
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,280
Rested during the night?

1191
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:29,820
Come on, sir.

1192
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,740
The loan chair rested most of the night.

1193
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,540
Look.

1194
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,700
Dead boy, dead boy.

1195
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,360
Who's who?

1196
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,560
Tonto dazzles the eyes.

1197
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,920
Mask make you do that?

1198
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,060
Of course you're dazzling.

1199
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,620
The loan chair was covered with black suit.

1200
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,800
Thanks to this mask, I'm completely black.

1201
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,580
You think maybe you go blind?

1202
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,360
I should.

1203
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,520
The loan chair rubbed his fingers on Tonto's eyes.

1204
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,840
Tonto, let me blind your eyes, Tonto.

1205
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,960
I can't see.

1206
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,480
I'm blind.

1207
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,480
Help, help.

1208
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,680
The loan chair and Tonto made dire threats to the blinded.

1209
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,480
You fools.

1210
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:04,700
They would gag him and leave him buried in the snow to die, blind, and then go away.

1211
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,100
No.

1212
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:05,940
It's dark.

1213
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,040
But I can't see.

1214
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,380
Keep thinking that way.

1215
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,740
The old man had taken from his pocket the loan chair before he entered.

1216
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,000
No.

1217
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,100
I don't know.

1218
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,320
The horses had found them attached to the saddle of one of the horses.

1219
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:16,980
Help, help.

1220
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,480
Blind.

1221
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,620
The loan chair and Tonto floundered around in ever-widening circles through the snow.

1222
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,000
He's that kind of a man.

1223
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,840
He is the loan chair.

1224
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:43,340
I am such a hillbilly as the Oiw write this down that faith of the poor, you needn't

1225
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:43,460
let anyoneенсieve their queen, you needn't say the least thing, and lay the liars do

1226
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,580
the impossible, and to whom it will be ataechoros.

1227
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:54,320
If seeds come back, not a single malt protector is hidden inside the tuft.

1228
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:54,340
Yeah.

1229
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:54,820
We'll see.

1230
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:54,820


1231
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,700
Or you can write for free information if you want to.

1232
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,320
Almost nobody ever does that.

1233
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:10,920
From Post Office Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1234
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,640
Praise Bob.

1235
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,100
Hey, what's the number?

1236
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,800
Five.

1237
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,100
Three-nine.

1238
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,320
Two.

1239
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,480
Five-eight.

1240
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,980
Hello, the White Fox?

1241
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:41,660
What?

1242
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,880
The White Fox.

1243
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,380
Oh.

1244
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,120
The White Fox.

1245
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,500
Oh.

1246
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,380
The White Fox.

1247
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,120
The White Fox.

1248
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:47,540


1249
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,800
The White Fox.

1250
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,020
Uh.

1251
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:49,900
The White Fox.

1252
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,160
Uh.

1253
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:50,820
The White Fox.

1254
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,000
Oh.

1255
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,840
The White Fox.

1256
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,040
What?

1257
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,860
The White Fox.

1258
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,120
Oh, yeah?

1259
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:53,900
The White Fox.

1260
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:54,220
Uh.

1261
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:54,740
The White Fox.

1262
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,340
Well, I am.

1263
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:55,940
The White Fox?

1264
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,200
Uh, the White Fox?

1265
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,240
Uh, the White Fox?

1266
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,400
Uh, the White Fox?

1267
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,620
Yeah, the White Fox, huh?

1268
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,040
Duh.

1269
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,860
Uh, duh.

1270
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,660
That's bad.

1271
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:04,700
The White Fox.

1272
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,000
I'll remember this as long as I live.

1273
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,740
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

1274
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,860
Say, it looks like we're going to see a card trick, Rhoda.

1275
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,400
Here are three cards, Rhoda.

1276
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,560
The six of clubs, the eight of diamonds, and the ten of spades.

1277
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,700
Ah, the ten of spades.

1278
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,700
Now, wait a minute.

1279
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,180
Exactly.

1280
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,860
And the trick was done.

1281
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,940
That's a swell trick, Blackstone.

1282
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,980
And until next time, goodbye.

1283
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,660
Hey, let go of my hair, you.

1284
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,440
I got it.

1285
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,480
You can't prove anything.
