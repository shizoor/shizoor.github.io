00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,280
Look out!

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,180
Shut up!

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,920
Shut up!

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,340
Come in.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,020
Shut up!

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,780
772,000.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,500
Shut up!

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,520
772.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,120
Shut up!

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,440
341.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,060
Shut up!

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,340
341.

14
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,380
Shut your face!

15
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:26,900
Is that correct?

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,860
Yes it is.

17
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,660
61.

18
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,600
Thank you.

19
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,240
Shut up.

20
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,500
That will be all for the present.

21
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,680
Very good.

22
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,140
Silence!

23
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,640
The Self Genius Powerhouse Watch.

24
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,200
Excellent.

25
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,080
Thank you, Lee Murr.

26
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,000
Most of this show is straight out of Cleveland.

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,880
The bulk of it is Sheridan, the mysterious weirdo who provided another massive 45-minute media barrage.

28
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,580
And at the end, we'll hear a classic, beloved tune from...

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,080
Cleveland's Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,500
And some acid garage punk jazz by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

31
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,860
But first, get out your ear protection because here comes Sheridan.

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,780
Shock.

33
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,680
So tell your friends the next time Feature Shock comes on.

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:15,900
Hey.

35
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,260
Do what you want to do.

36
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,000
Just have a party.

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,500
But check it out because it's heavy.

38
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,800
It's heavy for you and it's yours alone.

39
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,600
.

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,840

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:25,840

the

61
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,720
this

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,340
Radio and stream announcer of Black Flag.

63
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, plug this wire in.

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,440
Contact.

65
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,300
Contact.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,440
Contact.

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,020
Contact.

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,080
I think we can begin to broadcast.

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,060
Oh, we're already broadcasting.

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,900
Primary and secondary circuit head commencing now.

71
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,700
Ah, yes, dear friends.

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,960
Screen lights across the board.

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,720
Yes, the show is warming up.

74
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,320
Yes, and you can see your radio light up.

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,740
And if you look inside the speakers real close, you may be able to see the picture.

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
This is not a broadcast.

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,880
After children first learn to talk well enough for other people to understand,

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,180
they sometimes like to use their...

79
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,600
Be out and who are you to sit there criticizing me?

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
You must be a loony.

81
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,100
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,900
I am not a loony.

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,100
Yum, yum, yum, dee, a-buckety.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,940
Rum, ding, do.

85
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,980
Yee, me, me.

86
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,060
Yahoo.

87
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,100
Yoddy, buggy.

88
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,820
Rum, ding, do.

89
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,800
Me, me, me.

90
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Yahoo.

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,040
You are a loony.

92
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,180
What other mind control cults put you in the driver's seat with two steering wheels?

93
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,680
Now all together.

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,880
I flagpole.

95
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,780
Desecrate.

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,060
It is a word of sacredness.

97
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,440
Violating the Constitution is nothing to sneeze at.

98
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,420
Or is it a blue, white, and red herring?

99
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,540
All of the different things that could recreate that in which we all believe.

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,400
What else?

101
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,960
Reason.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,140
Or prohibit.

103
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,560
The Declaration of Independence.

104
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,120
Partisan.

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,840
Petty petition.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,200
Petty petition.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,300
Petty petition.

108
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,800
This doesn't hurt free speech.

109
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,520
Free speech is protected by this amendment.

110
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,140
It's not harmed or diminished.

111
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,740
Free speech is diminished.

112
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,880
I diminish.

113
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
Free speech.

114
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,780
I almost said something.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
I'm trying to make it seem like it.

116
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,960
It's good enough time and attention for a question to happen.

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,860
Having a clear understanding of what we're doing.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,260
And as tombstones are knoppeling, as churgogs and places of worship are nautilizing,

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,220
flags dust of trivialized tution.

120
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,300
Like a despot.

121
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,180
Commodity.

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,720
Comm Arabia.

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:18,940
Commodity.

124
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:18,960
You are all dangerous for this country.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:18,960


126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,060
Self-desлыcon is enough to make me SPECIFIC.

127
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,400
Please don't confess on your….

128
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,420
Ask if you're a Ruble person or not.

129
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,500
Mother of God.

130
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,000
YouBrave.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000


132
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


133
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


134
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,200
You saw this right there around here.

135
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,820
And you missed me at a crisis.

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,440
Because I'm hell on earth.

137
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,940
Was here for 8 weeks, eight months and still no response.

138
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,240
You're insane.

139
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,960
And you're the equivalent of not even 아니е anyeremy 유.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Now, lemme see.

141
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,300
Isn't this way I'd go home and sleep tonight?

142
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,240
Where are our haggars doing here?

143
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,000
I got some big fat 2bc in here I got a little pound and a crackle crackle tea I got some

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,260
Google Pauls I got some peyote peyote peyote and that's it then I also have a stabilizer

145
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,040
I got some big fat 2bc in here I got a little pound and a crack crack tea I got some Google

146
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,860
Pauls I got some peyote peyote and that's it then I also have a stabilizer

147
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,520
I got a boy who lies to his teeth by demonic records and smokes the dope

148
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:41,020
Of course what I mainly do is just take the stuff that people send me and I just take

149
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,020


150
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,780
the stuff that people send me and I just take the stuff that people send me and rip them off to the max

151
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,620
Aha! Aha!

152
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,540
You like to speak that?

153
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,460
I like to talk that!

154
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,040
I like to talk that!

155
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,040
That, how do you say that, picklepuss

156
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,220
I like to talk that!

157
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,280
I like to talk that!

158
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Nothing!

159
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,940
Nothing?

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,000
I think we understand it a little more maybe

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
as a public than we used to

162
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,180
but I would say that I still don't

163
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,540
think that the public awareness

164
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,180
is up there

165
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,280
in sync with actually the impact

166
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,340
That's terrifying

167
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,660
Look if this happens to your kid

168
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,720
or if you look at this and if you have children

169
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,060
you say could this happen to my child

170
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,420
out of some kind of rebellion

171
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,420
how would a parent

172
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,460
be aware?

173
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,740
Many youngsters are into it, teenagers and younger

174
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,520
and the clues are there

175
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,340
Aha! Aha!

176
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,760
Hello doh!

177
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,120
Hello doh!

178
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,500
Rosbanius you ought to be in the future team in your garage

179
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,580
that, how do you call it, that frog head

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,000
yeski teski

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,500
what did you say

182
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
got it something else, you know

183
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,500
Rosbanius you ought to be in the future team in your garage

184
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to see that!

185
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,040


186
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I want to see that!

187
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,260
You have to use so many cuss words

188
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
What the f*** are you talking about?

189
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,480
What the f*** are you talking about?

190
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm going to call the consultant too of our show

191
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,080
you know

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,940
The premise

193
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
is simple

194
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,840
we invite famous celebrities

195
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
musicians and authors

196
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,540
in for a one on one interview

197
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,060
the

198
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,260
very first

199
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,480
time they say

200
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,540
you know

201
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,820
the interview ends

202
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,860
and the next guest comes

203
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,000
in for their turn

204
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
this

205
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,540
process repeats until we're

206
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,780
out of famous people

207
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,320
and we begin interviewing the staff

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
here in the studio

209
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,000
an

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,360
added feature is that

211
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,580
one half of the you know

212
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,220
point is

213
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,380
awarded for each time the

214
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,180
guest unnecessarily

215
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,140
uses like

216
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,280
in a conversation

217
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,640
beginning

218
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,300
a sentence with so

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,360
will be frowned upon

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,780
but not penalized

221
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,480
so

222
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,860
we're ready for our next

223
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,940
guest

224
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,640
please welcome

225
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,280
Alice Cooper

226
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,760
Alice Cooper

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,460
Alice Cooper

228
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,460


229
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,840
Alice Cooper

230
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,480
Alice Cooper

231
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,180
Alice Cooper

232
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,320
so Vince

233
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,960
can I call you Vince?

234
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Yes

235
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,920
you can

236
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,660
if you want to be swallowed by a snake

237
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,760
or our bass player

238
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,260
so

239
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,900
pal

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,880
what was Frank Zappa like?

241
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,980
oh

242
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,080
he didn't care

243
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,760
he put us in a room

244
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
with a crappy boy track

245
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,940
cheap microphones

246
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,680
pork rinds

247
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,560
and a lot of beer

248
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,960
and that was all

249
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,460
our business

250
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,000
and our equipment

251
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,040
did he at least

252
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,080
supply the chrome tape?

253
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,140
oh yeah

254
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,780
Toyota chrome weather stripping tape

255
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,200
I think it was

256
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,140
it was

257
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,040
the least he could do

258
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,620
given the budget

259
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,840
so

260
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,680
how about your upbringing

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,640
I mean

262
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,580
Al

263
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,880
well you know

264
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,940
being born in Ohio

265
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,700
you and your constrictor

266
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,520
can take a walk

267
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,460
Cooperstown indeed

268
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,300

269
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,880

271
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,040

272
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,960

278
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,460


279
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,460

291
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800

no

296
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,460
You're a financial supporter of this show, aren't you?

297
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah.

298
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,800
Yeah.

299
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm gonna miss that money.

300
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,180
Go.

301
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,120
Just go.

302
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,200
Go break up some speech or something.

303
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,780
Our next guest is...

304
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,840
Patrick Stewart?

305
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,500
What the hell is that?

306
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,700
I can't interview without some research.

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,940
Tell him to come back next week.

308
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,900
Damn.

309
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,000
Well.

310
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,340
Well.

311
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,540
Well.

312
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


313
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


314
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


315
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


316
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


317
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,320


318
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,860
Let's welcome back our cameraman.

319
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,940
Cameraman Curtis.

320
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,000
How the hell are you, Kurt?

321
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm good.

322
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,360
You know, the amaretto scones in the bike room are almost gone.

323
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,400
Patrick Stewart likes them.

324
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,360
Well.

325
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,880
That's all we have time for.

326
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,660
Tune in next time for...

327
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
Uh.

328
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,180
I gotta go.

329
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,620
You know.

330
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm sorry for what we're doing with music in the name of the area.

331
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,000
It's, uh...

332
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,620
I'm sorry for what we're doing with music in the name of the area, guys.

333
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,160
But, uh...

334
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,200
Stop it, you know what I'm talking about.

335
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,420
So, play the flag.

336
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,420
Play the flag.

337
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,700
I don't think I've heard enough music as mad as I can.

338
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,140
You accept yourself as a unique and valuable person.

339
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,620
You're open, honest, and direct with your relationships.

340
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,960
Demagis.

341
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,460
I take the but.

342
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,600
that you are exceptionally talented and highly collegiate.

343
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,120
Ah, ah, ah.

344
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,520
That I am heavy.

345
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,160
You got some slick chicks?

346
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,600
Oh, a wolf.

347
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,840
I'd like to see some babes myself.

348
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,620
Me too.

349
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,380
Ah, ah, ah.

350
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,120
Ah, ah, ah.

351
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,280
Ah, ah, ah.

352
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,320
Ah, ah, ah.

353
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:17,540
Ah, ah, ah.

354
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,600
What we need is a real live target.

355
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,960
Oh, a volunteer.

356
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,660
You'll do.

357
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,420
We'll throw the knives at him.

358
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:28,920
Oh, no.

359
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,620
You have nothing to worry about.

360
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,020
If either one of us hit you, we lose.

361
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,940
Oh, that's difficult.

362
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,080
And no.

363
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,800
Don't worry, ordinary people talk of running it.

364
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,260
You need to know that.

365
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


366
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


367
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


368
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


369
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


370
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,260


371
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,320
Just like that?

372
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,320


373
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,960
Make love with a guitar

374
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,020
If you should meet the sweet señorita

375
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,060
Romance with a guitar

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,440
La casa вся

377
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,600
Fatal

378
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,880
I don't know what that is.

379
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,920
Hey!

380
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,420
Hey!

381
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,860
What's wrong with you?

382
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,380
Get busy!

383
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
There's some trick going on here.

384
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,040
This is not true.

385
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,080
This is not real.

386
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,960
It's not good.

387
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,180
The reason it's not appreciated

388
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,080
because it hasn't shown any guts.

389
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,900
Hasn't shown any dance.

390
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,780
Hasn't shown any moxie.

391
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,220
There's some trick going on here.

392
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,240
This is not true.

393
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,200
This is not real.

394
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,160
It's not good.

395
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,020
All I get is a damn headache and boredom.

396
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,860
I really feel sickness

397
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,880
in the pit of my seat.

398
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,720
I feel a stomach, I say.

399
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,620
Poetry is generally very dull.

400
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,540
The reason it's not appreciated

401
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,400
because it hasn't shown any guts.

402
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,240
Hasn't shown any dance.

403
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,220
Hasn't shown any moxie.

404
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,400
It's like writing a good poem.

405
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,400
You just do it.

406
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
It's a beer.

407
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,620
It's a beer.

408
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:45,620


409
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,940
It's a beer.

410
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,660
It's a beer.

411
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,180
Generally, he's just a dumb,

412
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,900
fuddling asshole writing

413
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,540
insecure lines that don't come through.

414
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,460
insecure lines that don't come through.

415
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,360
Believing he's immortal.

416
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,540
Waiting for his immortality,

417
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
which never arrives.

418
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,860
Because of poor...

419
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,080
Because of poor...

420
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,280
Because of poor...

421
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,520
There's some trick going on here.

422
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:16,780
There's some trick going on here.

423
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,520
This is not true.

424
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
This is not real.

425
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,400
It's not good.

426
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,900
It's not real.

427
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,140
You've written poems that you really meant,

428
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,480
alone, you know,

429
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,620
by your typewriter.

430
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:29,960


431
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,840
Then there's this crowd out there drinking beer

432
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,540
and all that.

433
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:37,920


434
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,620
And they're not even drunk.

435
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
They're either drunk or drunk,

436
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,100


437
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,100


438
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,760
The writer has no responsibility.

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,380
Except to jack off in bed alone

440
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,700
and type a good page.

441
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,300
I felt there was nothing out there,

442
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:14,020
there. So I had to continue because they were so bad, not because I was so good. And I'm

443
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:26,080
still not so good. But they're still very bad. There's still room for somebody to step

444
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:36,380
in here, you see. That should be enough right there for that bottle of 55 poets. That should

445
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:55,340
cure them. Good night. Goodbye. And happy reading.

446
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,060
Good night.

447
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm so jealous of him I want to cut his fingers off so he can't ride anymore.

448
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,440
We would like to apologize to those people who may have heard a short extract from Pleasures of the Dance,

449
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,820
a selection of Norwegian Carpenters songs earlier in this record.

450
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,880
This appeared in error and will not be repeated.

451
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,060
In fact, we don't really know the secret.

452
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,240
We are relying on the pagans to start those.

453
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,720
These views may be a little difficult to understand

454
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:15,160
I think This is the accident that

455
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,160


456
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,160


457
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,140
we are cooking now

458
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,800
for my guess

459
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,760
This is an expert.

460
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,220
This is an expert.

461
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:55,580
This is an expert.

462
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:18,420
This is an expert.

463
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,420
This is an expert.

464
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,640
This is an expert.

465
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,960
This is an expert.

466
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,440
This is an expert.

467
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,040
You want a chance?

468
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,560
Yeah.

469
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,820
Very well.

470
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,540
You may choose the manner in which you will die.

471
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,900
Oh, that's easy.

472
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,980
Old age.

473
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

474
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,420
That's easy.

475
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

476
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

477
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,620
Bob Wood, National Program Director of the Chum Group,

478
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,420
worked with us in producing...

479
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,840
Hold up, hold up, before we get started...

480
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,520
Guess who's coming?

481
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,020
It is...

482
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,820
Guess who's coming?

483
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,440
It is...

484
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,200
Guess who's coming?

485
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,900
Back, back, back, back again.

486
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,700
Who is it?

487
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:46,900
It's...

488
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,320
Just your favorite...

489
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,460
DJ Savior.

490
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,340
Use it.

491
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,120
Use it.

492
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,500
Use it.

493
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,180
Use it.

494
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,160
Use it and confuse the beast that you never heard.

495
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,920
Come on.

496
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,980
Come on.

497
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,880
This is...

498
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,660
1990.

499
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,800
Meanwhile, uptown, the DJ player.

500
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,240
In trial salvation,

501
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,000
the dreamer...

502
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,500
You're running bad.

503
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,120
Ah...

504
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,300
Friends, the Church of the Subgenius is happening now.

505
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,380
Praise Bob.

506
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,120
Worship Connie.

507
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,180
Ah...

508
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,800
Ah...

509
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,180
Ah...

510
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,920
Ah...

511
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,660
Ah...

512
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:40,800
Ah...

513
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:40,880
Ah...

514
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

515
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,640
Goodbye, baby.

516
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,400
Goodbye, baby.

517
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,740
Goodbye, baby.

518
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,940
Goodbye, baby.

519
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:00,560
Goodbye, baby.

520
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
Goodbye, baby.

521
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:04,980
Goodbye, baby.

522
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:04,980


523
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,220
Goodbye, baby.

524
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,540
Goodbye, baby.

525
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,500
Goodbye.

526
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,860
Goodbye, baby.

527
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,480
Goodbye, baby.

528
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,480


529
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,480


530
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,480


531
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,500
Good luck, we're so professional

532
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:41,900
Yeah, I dig living in the hip scene, you know

533
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
I could never go back to square society, you know

534
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,160
I think I came out of the womb listening to

535
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,000
Black Flag, you know, it's like, it just comes

536
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,840
natural, the hip thing, you know, and the cool

537
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,620
people, you know, Squaresville is just a drag

538
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,360
The big thing here is just to make sure it

539
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
stays as unconventional as possible and to

540
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,220
make sure that it's a lot different

541
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,440
First of all, Rad, you never let on how much

542
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
you like a girl

543
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,820
Oh, thank you

544
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,840
Hi

545
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,400
Two, you always call the shots

546
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,620
Kiss her, you won't regret it

547
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,140
Now three, act like wherever you are, that's

548
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,020
the place to be

549
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,520
Isn't this great?

550
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,020
Four, when ordering food, you find out what

551
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,000
she wants, then order for the both of you

552
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,220
It's a classy move

553
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,760
A lady will have the linguine and white clam

554
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,800
sauce and a Coke with no ice

555
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,540
And the five, now this is most important

556
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,860
She never complains

557
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,960
We go on an adventure

558
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,780
Holy shit, this film is awesome

559
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,240
It's a classic

560
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,240


561
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,240


562
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,600
For all of humanity

563
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,300
You make an honor out of us

564
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,300


565
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,600
Enjoy it

566
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,380
You what the hell, what is it?

567
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,020
Again.

568
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,340
You what the hell, what is it?

569
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,900
Again.

570
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,940
You what the hell, what is it?

571
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,460
Again.

572
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,540
Of course, we put down in the computer and it make a mistake.

573
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,900
It's not possible.

574
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,820
You are really fool.

575
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,720
Oh no, I will never can explain that in the parliament.

576
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,360
They all going to laugh.

577
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,920
The electronic system is working.

578
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,440
We drag all the wires out of the room.

579
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,760
Then there are few buttons to pull it through.

580
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,320
Two, one, the light comes.

581
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,260
Is my phone ever?

582
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:11,240
Is the probability such that my phone has likely been goofed by a big flip caused by the cosmic ray?

583
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,440
I'm not sure I can discuss this.

584
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,280
Oh really?

585
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:16,900
Yeah.

586
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,940
I've been thinking about this.

587
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,700
Grandpa has some fun.

588
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,500
You always said he's the best.

589
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,540
He's the best, all right.

590
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,740
Take your cũng

591
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:57,900
I'm waiting for you at that special us waiting for you at the end of the glass cigarette.

592
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,660
Give me a sweet tasty cigarette.

593
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,260
Before it que 80 millimeter pressure.

594
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,620
70 millimeter pressure.

595
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,960
Sunday,土 STEVE facebook.com

596
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:11,960


597
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,120
70мотр

598
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,800
70 ernst

599
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,040
The necessary prescription of the Great Patriotic War.

600
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,880
You just push. It won't hurt nothing.

601
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,000
Grandpa's the best killer there ever was.

602
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,540
I never took more than one liquid stage.

603
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,900
I did sixty and five minutes once.

604
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,500
And now...

605
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,920
For the first time ever on record...

606
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,000
In a day, ten days prior to the World War II...

607
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,560
Because you liquid stage will fix your team.

608
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,000
Just a minor warning that the future would not beiere us.

609
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,220
The red leur would walk away in a matter of seconds.

610
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:40,000
Who would go to the war?

611
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,220
When I was 10 years old, I couldn't believe how long it took to get to be 10 years old.

612
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,180
We can never leave.

613
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,620
Isn't it wonderful?

614
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,340
Please.

615
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,340
I have this urge to cross my legs right now.

616
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,760
Why?

617
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,760
Why?

618
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,700
Why?

619
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
We're desperate.

620
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,460
We're desperate.

621
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:12,960
I can't fight.

622
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,140
I'm a total rebel.

623
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,240
We're desperate.

624
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,240
Yeah.

625
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,360
A lot of people aren't friends with me.

626
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,260
Because I'm a scary looking person.

627
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,820
We're desperate.

628
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,140
I just hang by myself mostly.

629
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,180
Because I'm a scary looking person.

630
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,780
We're desperate.

631
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,420
I just hang by myself.

632
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
Because I'm a scary looking person.

633
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,120
We're desperate.

634
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,260
I just hang by myself mostly.

635
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,220
Yeah.

636
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,380
A lot of people aren't friends with me.

637
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,460
Because I'm a scary looking person.

638
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,840
looking person we're desperate i just hang i guess i'm a scary looking person

639
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,320
we're desperate i just hang by myself mostly i i'm down against everything

640
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,380
so

641
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,900
student of dobbs training is practically forced to bring his strangest desires into rampaging

642
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:41,340
life i used to get embarrassed of all my god's manners now i get paid the pigs pay me fabulous

643
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,360
sums of money for what they used to put me in jail for thanks to bob

644
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,180
i think she's dead no i'm not

645
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,560
oh

646
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,240
now you take that message

647
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,960
out you take the satanism message out you take the rebellion message out you take the

648
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,820
premarital sex message out you take the drug message out you take the rebellion message out

649
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,620
you take the fifth out you don't have anything left there ain't nothing there

650
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,740
he didn't realize that he had accidentally started during the eight and a half minute silence

651
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,280
but that was okay with me because i really wasn't looking forward to that anyway i get stiff

652
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,060
though

653
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,500
the

654
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,320
very

655
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


656
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


657
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


658
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


659
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


660
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


661
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


662
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


663
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,320


664
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,800
things, especially living things, are what they are because they possess some inherent

665
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,020
essence, something we are born with biologically and define who we are really.

666
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,240
That in turn can lead us to believe that there is some essence, a fixed, immutable essence

667
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,820
that defines who we are.

668
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,440
We are also tuned to moral attributes.

669
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,260
We want to make sure that other people are cooperative, that we can trust them.

670
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,300
So that is another computation that might inform that.

671
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,540
Why we think that people are good, though, this is a little bit of a mystery.

672
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,180
So maybe it's just a wishful thinking.

673
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,300
Maybe, you know, I'm more likely to cooperate with you if I believe that you are inherently

674
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,280
good, although that can also have quite a bit of cost associated with it.

675
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:34,040
So no, we don't quite know where this belief arises, except for people have this belief.

676
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,240
They were all born with a belief.

677
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,080
They're almost okay with that polarity, right?

678
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,900
Knowing that maybe I see myself one way, other people see me another way.

679
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
At that point, really, I have a choice to make.

680
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,020
You know, does it matter?

681
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,920
Do I want to change my view?

682
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,740
Do I want to work to change others' views?

683
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,580
Or is it okay for them to be slightly different?

684
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,660
But...

685
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,460
He no longer has a moral compass.

686
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,180
He no longer knows that we're seen right and wrong.

687
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,140
He's lost his moral conscience.

688
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,360
He's lost his moral conscience.

689
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,100
He's lost his moral conscience.

690
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,120
He's lost his moral conscience.

691
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,480
He's lost his moral conscience.

692
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,860
He's lost his moral conscience.

693
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,240
He's lost his moral conscience.

694
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,840
What did you learn?

695
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,520
This was even greater of a problem than I sort of expected.

696
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:37,440
What we discovered was that 95% of people believe that they're self-aware,

697
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,220
but only about...

698
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,940
10 to 15 percent of us really are.

699
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,100
With the right approach, anyone can get there.

700
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,040
People say, well, if you're just old enough and you've had enough life experience,

701
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,780
you'll be self-aware. As it turns out, that's not true.

702
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,800
There is a 0.0 correlation between age and self-awareness.

703
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,780
The Matrix isn't that bad, I guess.

704
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,280
You can still have that lobster dinner in the Matrix.

705
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,600
And yet,

706
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:38,980
And yet,

707
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,320
we perceive ourselves as well as others

708
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,140
such that underneath all this, you know, mumble-jumble,

709
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,520
there is a single protagonist.

710
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,840
There is a single true self.

711
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,620
There is a single true self.

712
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,000
There is a single true self.

713
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,200
Then, if you feel a bit guilty about it afterwards,

714
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,260
we can dig a grave and you can throw up into it.

715
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,020
There's always this tension between who we think we are and how others see us.

716
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,320
This is not a rerun.

717
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,040
Sometimes we don't even actually see it.

718
00:41:43,040 --> 00:42:01,140
Things are happening in the 맞아 the way it was in the first plays.

719
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:05,180
Statistics got in my hair even when I pero reserved them.

720
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,180


721
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,940
But that's already proven to be how we feel.

722
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,000
There's one more.

723
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,520
I don't care!

724
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,400
They're powerful bacteria!

725
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,900
I don't care!

726
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,360
I still have a good time!

727
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,560
I don't care!

728
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,760
I'm fine with it!

729
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,200
You know I have many people in my life at work.

730
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,240
You know I have many people in my life at work.

731
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:41,180
You know I have many people in my life at work.

732
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,080
You know I have met many people in my life.

733
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,380
You know I have met many people in my life at work.

734
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,360
That should be enough right there.

735
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,940
If you've enjoyed listening to this record,

736
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,320
If you've enjoyed listening to this record,

737
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,860
you'll enjoy Oscar Tritt's second LP,

738
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,220
Folk Songs of the Spanish Inquisition.

739
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,300
Folk Songs of the Spanish Inquisition.

740
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,940
Folk Songs of the Spanish Inquisition.

741
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,040
Folk Songs of the Spanish Inquisition.

742
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm going to complain.

743
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,280
You want to complain?

744
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,700
Look at these shoes I've only had them three weeks,

745
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,640
and they're yours to wear right through.

746
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,580
If you complain, nothing happens.

747
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,480
I'm sick and tired of this office.

748
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,180
Excuse me.

749
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:30,740
Excuse me.

750
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,940
Hey!

751
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,400
Hey, Indy, stop!

752
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,180
I want to call the police!

753
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,920
Excuse me, excuse me.

754
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,160
Excuse me.

755
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:44,920
Correct!

756
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,600
Excuse me, mould limousine.

757
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,320
I was

758
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,740
Dismissed ec blender機

759
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,820
from沒

760
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:57,920
in any room

761
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,220
That was indeed an ending.

762
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,540
Thank you, Sheridan, for making my job so easy at a good time.

763
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,500
I just got my COVID shot and planted a huge garden yesterday,

764
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,200
and today I can barely move.

765
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,480
Maybe I should have gotten a vaccine shot instead of a COVID shot.

766
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,200
Anyway, now, the great Cleveland band

767
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,580
that unfortunately died with its leader, Chaz Smith,

768
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,880
Einstein's Secret Orchestra from the album Sex in Another Dimension.

769
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,140
You read me, Hal?

770
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,580
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

771
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,440
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

772
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,740
Do you read me, Hal?

773
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,440
I'm trying to understand.

774
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,920
I read you.

775
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,320
Open the pod bay door.

776
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,460
I'm sorry, Phil.

777
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,880
I'm afraid I can't do that.

778
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,220
Now my confidant's alone in a drift

779
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
In endless black and white dotted mist

780
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,100
I'll help you and heal you and love you, she hissed

781
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,900
Then slid from the shadows and gave him a kiss

782
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,360
I may be a nobody, but I'll always have one

783
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:28,500
Lack of a sense of purpose, yes

784
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,280
In time there means nothing at all

785
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,260
In space the earth is quiet and small

786
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,420
Then I thought I'd call a glimpse of you

787
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,920
But I'm hiding somewhere in Eurasia

788
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,200
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

789
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,740
Do you read me?

790
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,020
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

791
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,900
Do you read me?

792
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,500
A primitive day, I'm in you

793
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,220
One pilot thought he flew alone

794
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,540
In endless black, nowhere from home

795
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,660
Then shadows sizzled and crackled and spun

796
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,020
And again she slithered from out of the dark

797
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,060
Who are you, he thought, but did not speak

798
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,380
She answered his question without missing a beat

799
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,520
I'm you, she says, I come from within

800
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,680
And now you've unleashed what you're not to begin

801
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,100
In time that means nothing at all

802
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,060
In space the earth is quiet and small

803
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,260
Then I thought I'd call a glimpse of you

804
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,960
Hiding somewhere in your edge of the world

805
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,360
Where

806
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,780
I was alone

807
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,440
So I head back home

808
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,980
All right, I told my wife

809
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,660
To call me to me

810
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,160
And I said, I'm going to be

811
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,140
Hello, how do you read me?

812
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,140
Hello, how do you read me?

813
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,500
Now they float alone in dark spotted mist

814
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,620
Companion in white, embraced in a kiss

815
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,180
She knows him and he needs to see her like this

816
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,480
And know that the shadows hide all that he is

817
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,360
In time that means nothing at all

818
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,400
In space the earth is quiet and small

819
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,240
Then I thought about it

820
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:32,420
A glimpse of you, I am somewhere in the range of the blind

821
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,120
You read me now?

822
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,280
In the range of the blind

823
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,000
Open the pot they door

824
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,380
That's where I'm at

825
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,880
Open the pot they door

826
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,720
You read me now?

827
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,360
In the range of the blind

828
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,920
So how do you read me?

829
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:08,440
In the range of the blind

830
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,480
That's where I'm at

831
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,540
In the range of the blind

832
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,460
So how do you read me?

833
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,360
Open the pot they door

834
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,780
Open the pot they door

835
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,100
You read me now?

836
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,620
You read me now?

837
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,880
You read me now?

838
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,080
You read me now?

839
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,800
You read me?

840
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,960
Open the front gate door.

841
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,720
You're raising now.

842
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,300
You're raising now.

843
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,020
Open the front gate door.

844
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,820
Oh, wow.

845
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,300
You're raising now.

846
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,280
You're raising now.

847
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,760
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

848
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,640
Hello, Hal, do you read me?

849
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,900
Do you read me, Hal?

850
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,780
Affirmative, Dave.

851
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:35,100
I read you.

852
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,880
Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

853
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,700
I'm sorry, Dave.

854
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,080
I'm afraid I can't do that.

855
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,460
Hi, folks.

856
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,720
Who makes you mad?

857
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,560
Rude waitresses?

858
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,940
That rap jamming next door?

859
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,180
Boom, boom, booming all night?

860
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,960
Someone stealing your parking spot?

861
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,120
Don't get ulcers.

862
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,840
Get the bomb.

863
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:01,540
No, come.

864
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:03,960
Now.

865
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,740
Hi, folks.

866
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,220
I'm Hiroshima Schwartz for Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

867
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,940
Thanks to the black market arms race and follow the Soviet empire,

868
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,840
we are literally blowing up the competition.

869
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,400
We've got Mini Megs, Pocket Thunder, the baby neutrino that leaves their apartments intact,

870
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,360
the H-Tail Pocket Fishing Man,

871
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,680
any and every kind of low-range, low-res.

872
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,240
We're not even talking about nuclear weapons.

873
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,620
We're talking about the first strike or defensive.

874
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,100
Everything from one yard to 20 mile dead zones.

875
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,200
Half-lives from one minute to one million years.

876
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,900
These incredible teeny weeny warheads actually fit in your wallet, purse, or pocketbook.

877
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,420
For ladies, it's the petite Mini Meg Madame Curie with attractive gold chain reaction,

878
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,780
only $29.95.

879
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,940
For men, it's the rugged masculine Vernivon bra and Pocket Thunder, only $29.95.

880
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,000
Just want to scare them?

881
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:49,680
Just wear them.

882
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,720
Beautiful cobalt bomb earrings, only $29.95.

883
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,600
Yes, folks.

884
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,340
Soon everyone will have the bomb.

885
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,940
Don't wait till it's too late.

886
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,020
Radiate pure power.

887
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,360
Nuke them now at Hiroshima Schwartz's Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

888
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,300
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

889
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,440
And we're going to close with the Swingin' Love Corpses,

890
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,460
another lost tune that was just found.

891
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,420
But first I wanted to mention that X Day is happening July 2nd to 5th,

892
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,020
and I'm pretty sure there'll be two live in-person events,

893
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,600
one at Wisteria in Ohio,

894
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,440
and one at the Land of Id in Land O' Lakes, Florida.

895
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,580
I'll be at the Florida one only, but I won't be running things.

896
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,060
Argus Fox and Pease are organizing it,

897
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,840
and Reverend Zanthea Oktoshroom is hosting it at her resort.

898
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,860
For information, visit hypercubego.com.

899
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:48,620
That's hypercubego.com slash xday2021.

900
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,120
Or subgenius.com,

901
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,980
although I've not updated that page yet.

902
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,220
But now, the Swingin' Love Corpses with their never-heard-ever song,

903
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,500
The Flowers of Your Soul.

904
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,440
.

905
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,960
.

906
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,980
.

907
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,560
.

908
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:54,680
.

909
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,140
.

910
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,200
.

911
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,220
.

912
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:06,940
.

913
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,740
.

914
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,680
.

915
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,840
.

916
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,160
.

917
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:12,600
.

918
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,760
.

919
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,620
.

920
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,820
The shiny snowflakes

921
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:41,080
Inside your mind

922
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,280
Extract

923
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,940
Just like the flowers

924
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,920
In your soul

925
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,120
The flowers of your sky

926
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,220
The clouds inside your soul

927
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,460
The sun inside

928
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,480
Your doorway

929
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,800
And the souls inside your home

930
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,280
The

931
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,480
world

932
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,920
The technology inside your mind

933
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,700
Is like a graveyard to your soul

934
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:45,000
The sailboats in your sea of hate

935
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,940
Are carving a deep hole

936
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,400
As you pass the snowflakes

937
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,600
The sea inside your heart

938
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,860
The sky erupts in magma flow

939
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,880
It's a torn up photo

940
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,680
All of your dreams

941
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,260
All of your dreams

942
00:57:38,680 --> 00:58:08,660
All of your dreams

943
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,760
You try to tell someone

944
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,920
About the way you feel

945
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,000
But you can't escape

946
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,180
The sound of the wheel

947
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,000
Is burning inside your mind

948
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,800
Like an expression

949
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,100
The soul that you can't leave behind

950
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,620
But there's nothing you can try as your own

951
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:49,680
All you've got that you will never forget

952
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,700
Is space

953
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,400
Is its name

954
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,340
Are you still living?

955
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,620
Are you telling yourself

956
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:00,460
view

957
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,760
What more could you want?

958
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


959
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:02,760


960
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,700
You have to do things right here.

961
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:03,700


962
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,920
It's like that for you.

963
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,740
It's like that for you.

964
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,940
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

965
00:59:38,680 --> 01:00:02,400
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah G放
