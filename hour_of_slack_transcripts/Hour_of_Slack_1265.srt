The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,820
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,200
is intended only as humor and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta,

4
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,520
its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,600
Star Date 2434.2.

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,160
First officer's log.

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,280
On a routine patrol flight in the Milky Way galaxy, I discovered on our space sensors

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,980
an unidentified planet careening wild birds.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wildly, in an eccentric solar orbit, I ordered an immediate investigation and with much difficulty

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
maneuvered our ship for a temporary orbit.

11
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,540
Upon beaming down to the planet's surface, all I could see were ruins.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,280
Ruins of some type of civilization.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,100
Crumbled buildings.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,980
Deserted streets.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Charred vegetation.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,560
All covered with a thick layer of dust.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,500
But none as leaves the Earth's surface as founding tectonic material.

18
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,500
The only sort of

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,040
visible cup of air that appeared to have been disappeared, really, we never even experienced.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,180
Only the pleasant waves of light of a certain planet and a began to emerge.

WhileORDMENTADEP.COM

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,040
Water targets awaited full unanimous questioning.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,920
These rare features remain undeniable.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:55,500
For what these are, there exists only onelaughiger.com.

25

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,160
JOHN ====וקmpony 0575-045 Cameras began recording all Bridgemark tabletodopes at the request of Karl Amersstam.

27
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,560
I heard a sound.

28
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,640
It came from a cellar in one of the nearby buildings.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Carefully and slowly, I found my way to the source

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,320
and discovered a human being.

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,160
Or rather, what once was a human being.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,360
A scarred, disfigured man lying in the rubble.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,380
When I questioned him,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,620
he told me that this had once been a great world.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,200
They had abundance and plenty.

36
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,400
Intelligence, beauty, love.

37
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,080
There was enough for everyone who lived there.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,380
But the inhabitants were never satisfied.

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,260
They wanted more.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,100
They wanted everything.

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,400
And they started to quarrel amongst themselves.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,980
They could not live in peace.

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,420
And they tried to destroy each other.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,260
In doing this, they destroyed everything.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,220
Their abundance, their plenty,

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,140
their abundance.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,260
Their own intelligence, their beauty, their love.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,820
He told me that so far as he knew,

49
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,840
he was the only living thing left.

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,700
But that he knew he was dying.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,020
When I asked him the name of the planet,

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,560
he replied,

53
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,620
we called it Earth.

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Oh my God, you blew it up!

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,400
Damn you all to hell!

56
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,280
This is a real, truly live place.

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,520
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice.

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,300
But most of it was beautiful.

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,460
But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was,

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,500
I want to go home.

61
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,960
Then close your eyes.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
And think to yourself,

63
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,460
there's no place like home.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,560
There's no place like home.

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,120
There's no place like home.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,960
There's no place like home.

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,420
There's no place like home.

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:57,940


69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,600
There's no place like home.

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,500
There's no place like home.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,240
There's no place like home.

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,120
Hey, aren't you going to

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,980
turn that damn clock radio off,

74
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,520
so that it's footsteps,

75
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,840
or for maintaining the foods

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:12,840


77
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,540

79
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,520
There there no profit way.

80
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,640
All of my weddings,

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,400
including in the 순간 blank quênoas but turtle quê perhaps,

82
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,140
as long as you don't seem to be congratulations from my vast utom Poweria de los Horale.

83
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:36,000
your troubled mind. Poor Flooz, just let it soak into your shattered little brain.

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:52,040
Wait a minute! You evil witch! That isn't funny at all! Ah, ease up. You were flat-out

85
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,820
kookin' on that song a couple weeks ago. So what's with the long face, puddin'?

86
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,620
Oh, like you don't know? Ah, yeah, but I like to experience the pain I caused through your

87
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:12,640
perspective. Mmm, this is so sweet. So, you went up to Ranch Apocalypse with hundreds

88
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,120
of other drooling bobbies, looking to get off-planet with them here pie-in-the-sky

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,900
sex goddesses, huh? And, ooh, you wound up getting royally reamed for your

90
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,020
brainy, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty,

91
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:29,100
bright and shining fate, didn't you? Surprise! Ooh, and what did you get for your trouble?

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,220
Cuts, bruises, blisters, sunstroke, and, ha, one hell of a chest cold. Ooh, and on top

93
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,060
of that, you really burned your bridges behind you when you flipped that final end of the

94
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,820
world bird at all your co-hosts and both of your listeners. But, but you did that! Did

95
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,300
I? Really?

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,340
Hey, who's to know? Who can tell where I end and you begin? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:09,040
Ooh! Hey, Sparky, it's Saturday night again. You still have a show to do. Oh, screw the

98
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,020
show. Oh, well, you sure got your wish last Saturday night. Thanks to you bugging out,

99
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,800
that was one screwed show. You know what went on in your precious little fun house while

100
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,780
you were too vegged out to pull your shift? I don't care. Yeah, you don't care that that

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,400
surf music maniac, Rex Reverb, spent a whole hour of church time playing Measerloo over

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,540
and over and over? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh, and tonight, he's planning to play 25 versions

103
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:50,780
of Surfer Joe, the vocal. No, no, no. Oh, yeah. No. No. It doesn't matter anymore. I

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,760
don't care. There is no show. There is no church. There is no...

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,460
Bob? Ha, ha. There is no Bob, is there? Yeah, you've been on a loser's treadmill for years

106
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,720
now and for nothing. It's all over, Flooz. Little Ivan's house of cards got blown down.

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:18,060
Hey, wake up and smell the mail fraud. Yeah, the Federal Trade Commission and the IRS and

108
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,780
the National Council of Churches are closing in on that.

109
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,360
That little weasel. Ha, ha. He's gonna be sharing a cell with Glenn Turner. Yep, looks

110
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,080
like you've been humping the wrong leg, sugar plum. All your subgenius boyfriends are gonna

111
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,940
be taking the fall for this. Oh, a hard rain's a-coming from this shakedown and I, for one,

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,320
ain't sticking around to take it on the chin. Oh, jeez. Why don't you just wrap those poisonous

113
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,320
lips of yours around another cliche? Ha, ha. Hey, consider the source, baby.

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Everything in me comes from you. Oh, great! But unlike you, I am looking out for our future.

115
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,060
Look at it this way. You could use this opportunity to change directions. And your ministry has

116
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:11,200
been steadily declining ever since you started this fiasco. Mmm, but hey, up isn't exactly

117
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:19,540
an option with you. Maybe you could just go down at a steeper angle. Oh, or hey, you and

118
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,780
that co-host of yours... Oh, hey, hello there. You know me. You know me. I can go anywhere.

119
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:20,780


120
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:26,340
yours could do uh one of those drive time things like those you know those local radio idiots

121
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,920
stink and sticky or whatever their names are yeah think of the billboards you could take

122
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:41,460
callers yeah hey you got a natural flair for comedy except for that

123
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,840
what this miserable little dog and prairie squid show of yours could be made to turn a profit

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,820
that insipid bob stuff has been keeping you out of the big time flus you could be straddling a

125
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:04,060
success rocket to the moon oh but i like straddling w-r-e-k atlanta just fine all right the mindless

126
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,740
loyalty card you know they keep you and the big band show guy around just so they can get senior

127
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,860
citizens kicked back from the federal government and what do you think they put you on at this hour

128
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,740
you know

129
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,020
I know this town closes down at 10 o'clock.

130
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,460
And look at this equipment here.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,320
It's all held together as spit and scotch tape.

132
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, but they have hearts.

133
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Oh, yeah, well, I got a heart too, and it's bleeding for you.

134
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,260
Got a tampon?

135
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,800
No, but I do have a wooden stake, bitch.

136
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,780
Take that!

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,740
No! Ow!

138
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, damn you!

139
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Well, well, it's one less Susie to worry about.

140
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,160
It smells like summer's eve in here.

141
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,220
I'm sweetness and light, Susie, and you freed me from my earthly prison.

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,180
And last time you were here, I was here.

143
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,900
And now I'm free to spread my message of love and joy and peace throughout the world.

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Give me back that stake, sister.

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,060
Hey, I'm pretty good at this.

146
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,140
Oh, my left boob.

147
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,860
Oh, why'd you have to go and do that?

148
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,360
Geez, Flues, you sure can't take criticism.

149
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,460
Look, you bitch, I only have one stake, and I hate her more than I hate you.

150
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,180
So, just go.

151
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,760
And just shut your stinkin' trap and crawl back in my cortex and just do your friggin' job, okay?

152
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,260
Wh-whatever you say.

153
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,620
I have a show to do.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community

155
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,040
I would really like to know you better

156
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,200
But sometimes I'm afraid that it's not meant to be

157
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,740
I would like to believe in something higher

158
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,920
That I can't get a grip on all the little things

159
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,700
When the night comes, I cannot sit still, you see

160
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,520
And the years, they have not been so kind to me

161
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Got a gallery of figures standing all in a row

162
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,180
Every single figure has a name, you know?

163
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,300
It's all of its own

164
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,300
Never look back, never look back

165
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,660
Don't you look back on me

166
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,340
Hey, yeah, my life has come around again

167
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,660
Like so many days

168
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,300
Hey, yeah, my life has begun

169
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,620
Oh, it's been through so many pieces

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Hey, yeah, my life has come around again

171
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,700
Like so many threads

172
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,700
And we went too far to be friends

173
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,240
There's a time and a place for understanding

174
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,560
And a time when our actions sound louder than words

175
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,380
And I don't seem to get no implications

176
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,120
And I don't know how to get through to you

177
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,800
And a time like the pyramids has run away

178
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,780
The mountains and the valleys and the words that we say

179
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,440
We have got to make sure that something remains

180
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
If we lose each other, we've got no one to blame

181
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,460
Never look back, never look back

182
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,920
Don't you look back on me

183
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,560
Hey, yeah, my life has come around again

184
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,860
Like so many days

185
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,500
Hey, yeah, my life has begun

186
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh, it's been through so many pieces

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,860
Hey, yeah, my life has come around again

188
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,840
Like so many days

189
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,660
And we went too far to be friends

190
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,920
Hey...

191
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,560
Hey...

192
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,680
Hey...

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,540
Hey...

194
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,260
Hey, yeah, my life has come to a bad end

195
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,940
Like sun and the clouds

196
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,600
Hey, yeah, my life has begun

197
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Oh, you see

198
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,140
Hey, yeah, my life has come to a bad end again

199
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,580
So many days have been

200
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,840
So many days have been

201
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,500
Hey, yeah

202
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,860
I can't get away

203
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,900
Hey, yeah, my life has come to a bad end again

204
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,300
Hey, yeah

205
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,140
And I've made a bad deal

206
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,640
Hey, yeah, my life has come to a bad, bad turn

207
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,160
Oh, what would a dead man

208
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,200
Hey, yeah, my life has come to a bad, bad turn

209
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,320
My life

210
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,020
Came and go

211
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,100
Hey, yeah

212
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,200
I can't get away

213
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,200


214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,340
I can't get away

215
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,660
And I've made a bad, bad deal

216
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,020
Now I can't get away

217
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,920
And now I cannot titillate

218
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,160
Come, take my hand

219
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,300
Come, please help me

220
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:01,300


221
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
All right!

222
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,560
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

223
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,700
When you're waking

224
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,940
From a bad dream

225
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,900
Don't you sometimes

226
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,540
Sometimes think it's real

227
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,320
But it's only

228
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,060
All emotion

229
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,020
That you feel

230
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,100
As painful as it is to contemplate,

231
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,560
I guess we should really

232
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,920
become

233
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,760
again at the beginning.

234
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,420
July 5th, 1998.

235
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,440
Dawn, just like

236
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,140
every other day in Dallas.

237
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,620
You can't do this, Bob.

238
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Sheriff, arrest that man!

239
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,720
This community is going to learn to obey the law!

240
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,580
Why should we obey laws that are twisted to fit the needs of thieves and liars?

241
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,520
Take it easy, Bob.

242
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,740
Arrest him! He's a deputy marshal.

243
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't let that stop you, Sheriff.

244
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,740
I'm fed up with the law around here.

245
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,760
This court can accept my resignation right now.

246
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,720
Where am I to, Bob?

247
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:26,900
I'm...

248
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm...

249
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Come on, get going, boys.

250
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,860
Bob, come on.

251
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,000
Sorry about this.

252
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,780
I'll get in touch with you.

253
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,580
Thanks for trying, Todd.

254
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:34,740
Hey!

255
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,740
It's next day.

256
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,440
What do I care?

257
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,700
A ship that will take you anywhere you want to go in the universe.

258
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,600
That's the kind of flying saucer I mean.

259
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,200
No kidding.

260
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,800
Yes, no kidding.

261
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,680
And if it doesn't turn out to be true,

262
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,580
you can have your worm bag.

263
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,640
Whoa.

264
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,420
Um...

265
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,460
I don't know about that.

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:57,860
Uh...

267
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,500
Oh, all right.

268
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
Sounds all right to me, I suppose.

269
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,840
I didn't catch your name, mister.

270
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,500
Dogs.

271
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,960
Once again, Superman concentrates.

272
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,000
Like a laser, his mind beams the exact course they must take to the silver creatures

273
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,740
who wait, shivering just a foot above the Earth's surface.

274
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,320
First thing he says is, watch out for religious deception.

275
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,220
Sincerity is not enough.

276
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,800
The devil's sincere, but he's not saved.

277
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Adolf Hitler was sincere, but he's in hell.

278
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,380
Sincerity is not enough.

279
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,320
You've got to be sincerely right.

280
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,260
You can be sincerely wrong.

281
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,900
Yes, yes, that's right!

282
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,580
Everything you know is wrong.

283
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,320
Then, like a plague of locusts, the alien creatures rise up, up into the sky,

284
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,240
up until they become, once again, a tiny, tiny dark cloud above the highest mountaintop.

285
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,760
And then, finally, can be seen no more.

286
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,000
DOROTHY AND HER PALS

287
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,940
BOOM!

288
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,200
As the screen fell, Dorothy and her pals saw a most unusual sight.

289
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,300
Behind the screen was a tiny, little, old-fashioned...

290
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,300


291
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,580
...old man with a bald head and wrinkled face.

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,420
Who...who are you?

293
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,000
I, uh, I am the Wizard of Oz.

294
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,320
But I thought the Wizard of Oz was a huge head or an invisible man or...

295
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,180
No, no, no, I'm not really the great Wizard of Oz.

296
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm just a pony. I'm a...I'm a humpug. All that.

297
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

298
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,360
I should have stayed with the promise keepers.

299
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,020
No redemption, no redemption

300
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,300
No redemption, no redemption

301
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,080
No redemption from evil and sin

302
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,220
No redemption, no redemption

303
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,260
No redemption, no redemption

304
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,020
Okay. Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?

305
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,360
Damn it. It fell apart like everything else I've ever believed in.

306
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,520
So, I guess it's back to good old-fashioned voodoo.

307
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
Wow, I need a drink!

308
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,140
Come with me.

309
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,500
Terrible! Now I'll never get a heart!

310
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,140
And I'll never get a brain!

311
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,260
And I'll never get a return!

312
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,940
And I guess I'll never get back home!

313
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,700
I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean any harm. I was just pretending.

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,180
But...why did you do it?

315
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,500
Well, it's a long story. You see, I was born in Nebraska.

316
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,840
That may have been the way it happened, Mr. Stang.

317
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,480
But I suppose it wasn't.

318
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,060
Oh, I'm nuts.

319
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,160
Hello.

320
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,620
Hang on here. Who's this?

321
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,580
My name is Bobby Dobbs.

322
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,320
You come in here and take our jobs! You're dead! You were on your skin!

323
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,640
All right.

324
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Well, since they can lie, you're dead! I mean it! Dead!

325
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,200
But you did call it a sympathy trick, Mr. Stang.

326
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,420
The jury has already heard the testimony about the phone call.

327
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,580
There's no use trying to pull the wool over my eyes.

328
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,100
The damage is done!

329
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,120
Don't apologize.

330
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,480
It's much too late now to forgive you for your lies.

331
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,560
I'll keep you in my heart and soul now with such a bitter pill.

332
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,400
To find you only wanted the taste of a brand-new thrill.

333
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,120
The damage is done!

334
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,580
I've been such a fool

335
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,580
I never dreamed that

336
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,500
You could ever be so cruel

337
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,240
Oh, you were playing with my love

338
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,580
It was all a little game

339
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,940
But you've coined my hopes and dreams

340
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,460
Now I'll never know, I'll never be the same

341
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,200
The damage is done

342
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,620
My lesson is learned

343
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,620
This is the last time

344
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,620
That I ever will be burned

345
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,700
Cause the damage is done

346
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,440
Damage is done

347
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,120
Damage is done

348
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,120


349
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,300
You have done

350
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,900
You have done

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:16,900


352
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,100
That my love

353
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,800
Was for good

354
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,060
This was all a little game

355
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,400
But you've coined my hopes and dreams

356
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,000
Now I'll never know, I'll never be the same

357
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,780
The damage is done

358
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,200
The damage is done

359
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,560
And you've had your fun

360
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,000
Now you're free to run

361
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,440
Now the damage is done

362
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,800
Oh, you were playing with my love

363
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,180
The wizard turned back

364
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,660
away and Dorothy whispered to the lion how the people didn't want the wizard anymore.

365
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,360
Oh, we were fools to trust any man.

366
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,540
Have you been such a fool, such an adult, such an idiot, such a dum-dum as to give away

367
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,020
my pinky, the best stuff and maker in the neighborhood?

368
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
And most quieter than most worms as well for a saucer without a matching cup?

369
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,200
Take that!

370
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:08,840
Ow!

371
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,640
Ow!

372
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,960
Ow!

373
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,720
Oh, my God!

374
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,100
That's a bad thing!

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,800
Hey!

376
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,180
Ow!

377
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,520
Now, Bob, I think I got a little problem.

378
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,040
Then me, I just stick it up and get it over with.

379
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,680
Oh, Brad, Bob generally knows what he's doing.

380
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,580
He does everything for the...

381
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,120
Well, Bob, what are we going to do?

382
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,760
I don't know.

383
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:30,840
That's great.

384
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,020
We go home and hang us.

385
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,940
We stay here, we starve to death.

386
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,360
Roger, don't the other way now, Dobbs.

387
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,840
If I'm not back tonight, don't wait for me.

388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,500
I'll meet you in Denver, Mountain Hotel.

389
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,260
Wait a minute, Bob.

390
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,600
Me and the boys have been talking.

391
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,140
How about taking over the bank in town before we split?

392
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Nothing to it, Bob.

393
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,260
I told you we were through tonight.

394
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,320
Now get out of here the way we planned all of you.

395
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,360
Bob says we're through.

396
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,320
But why?

397
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,420
It's a shame to leave all that money down there.

398
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Yeah.

399
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,560
That town owes us plenty.

400
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,460
It sure does.

401
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,660
It sounds good, but what about Bob's order?

402
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,720
He won't even know about it until we give him his share.

403
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,040
Yeah, right.

404
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,860
Bob, couldn't we take our fight to another county where we could get a fair trial?

405
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,620
That's a good idea, Ben, but it takes money.

406
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,480
We haven't got it.

407
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,340
Christ.

408
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,440
Who wants the back seat?

409
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,940
Hey, I do.

410
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,840
What I owe you?

411
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,620
With interest.

412
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,780
Bob!

413
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,860
Get Ben out of here.

414
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,100
Come on.

415
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,740
Come on, Bob.

416
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,580
Come on.

417
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,560
The other officers quickly take up the slack.

418
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,640
Thanks, Bob.

419
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,980
You got me out there just in time.

420
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,320
This ain't right, Bob.

421
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,300
Nothing's right anymore.

422
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:42,940
Go on.

423
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,500
Go on.

424
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:43,800
Get going.

425
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,360
Go on.

426
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,400
Go on.

427
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,580
Go on.

428
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,780
Go on.

429
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


430
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


431
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


432
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


433
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


434
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


435
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


436
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:46,780


437
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,740
It won't be like before.

438
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,180
There just won't be anymore.

439
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,580
Well, I want him.

440
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,320
Say, Wizard, guess what?

441
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
I just now quit.

442
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,520
Why did you quit?

443
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,660
Why did I quit?

444
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,500
Because after you've been taking aboard a UFO, it's kind of hard to top that, all right?

445
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,660
They have Alcoholics Anonymous.

446
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,020
They don't have Alien Anonymous.

447
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
I lost my watch.

448
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,740
I lost an alien culture who wanted to take me to the planet Arcturus.

449
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,000
I mean, I don't know if I've gotten the resentment, you know, forgiveness part down in the program.

450
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,120
I turned to a cult for mindless happiness when I had beer all along.

451
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,660
You taking it?

452
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:29,840
No.

453
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm letting go.

454
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,920
I'm letting go.

455
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,400
You're letting go.

456
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,880
Okay, fine.

457
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,060
Stop.

458
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
Dad, Bob broke your beer.

459
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,140
No, I didn't.

460
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,860
Doug broke it.

461
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,440
It was you.

462
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,460
Clean up the mess, boys.

463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,280
Ridiculous.

464
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Perhaps, Mr. Stank.

465
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,240
In the middle of the room was a big, green marble throne.

466
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,540
Sitting on the throne?

467
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,380
Well, it wasn't exactly sitting, because it was nothing but a big head.

468
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:48,940
Nobody.

469
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,080
Just a head.

470
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,960
As Dorothy stared, wide-eyed, the big, bald head said,

471
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,500
Dobbs, we'll get the dynamite.

472
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,840
Oh, sacred head, now.

473
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,800
Oh, my God.

474
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,920
Oh, my God.

475
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,720
Oh, my God.

476
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,000
God, I hope they're stoned.

477
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,880
Oh, my God.

478
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,720
Oh, my God.

479
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,280
Attention, attention, attention.

480
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,200
The bleeding head of our plumber has been destroyed.

481
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,620
Oh, my God.

482
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,200
It was not supposed to be like that.

483
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,700
A premature head-latching, but nonetheless, a lead-latching.

484
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,520
And now, because it's absolutely no-sense, we're going to have Jader launch the head.

485
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,860
Oh, my God.

486
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,880
If anybody has any flashlights...

487
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,120
We need some flashlights over here.

488
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,160
We need a...

489
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,620
The superstar needs some lights.

490
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Flashlights, flashlights.

491
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,040
I know you guys have them.

492
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,420
Where are they?

493
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,240
Break them out.

494
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,200
Break out the flashlights.

495
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,500
And let's launch the bleeding head of Tiger Woods.

496
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,180
Ladies and gentlemen, state.

497
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,760
State.

498
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,820
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just seen the destruction of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

499
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,120
I think this shows everyone.

500
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,960
Just tell us why the conspiracy is ready to go and try to stop the X's landing.

501
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Because it's the Palmer head, which is the perfect golfer who has the golf plan,

502
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,360
who's actually working with the Y's to try to stop the X's.

503
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,040
The conspiracy is trying to connect with the Y's,

504
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,260
which is connecting him with things that have seven limits for heads,

505
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,820
which isn't exactly the same thing as the thing with a U-totem for a head,

506
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,840
which is different, actually, from the thing with an 812 store for a head.

507
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,080
Who?

508
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,080
A witness who can prove you are lying, Mr. Stang.

509
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,900
Now, there's Arthur.

510
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,280
Arthur is a witness.

511
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,480
I think I'll start by reading you one that isn't terribly serious,

512
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,740
but it explains what his views were when people asked.

513
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,900
My answer is, no, he really did not believe in a serious way in UFOs,

514
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,940
and this might be an indication of that.

515
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,400
UFOs is a bucket of s***.

516
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,660
Mr. Stang.

517
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Is a bucket of s***.

518
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,200
I'd just come up behind him with a knife and put his throat real quick like that.

519
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,700
So I grabbed him by the collar.

520
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,400
And I jerked him out of the car and said,

521
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,760
Buddy, I ain't never seen nobody like you are.

522
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,140
How come you pull these kind of jokes?

523
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,260
He said, well, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

524
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,760
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

525
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,360
It's a bad joke.

526
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,040
That's great.

527
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,680
Your words, your words don't mean

528
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,620
What they used to mean

529
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,480
They were once inspired

530
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,680
Now they're just a joke

531
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,900
They're just, they're just routine

532
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,260
I'm afraid the masquerade is over

533
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,040
And so is love

534
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,620
And so is love

535
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,940
Bob, you've been through so darn much lately.

536
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,680
What do you think's going to happen to you now?

537
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,660
I don't know.

538
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:13,780
I don't know.

539
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,160
Gotta nuke something.

540
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,080
Touche.

541
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,960
Have you thought about one of the other major religions?

542
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,780
They're all pretty much the same.

543
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,660
What if we pick the wrong religion?

544
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,600
Every week we're just making God madder and madder.

545
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,220
Testify!

546
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,200
You just gotta learn not to expect nothing out of life.

547
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,080
Were you fixing to say a little something about how life don't seem too fair?

548
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,340
Don't even start.

549
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,040
Don't even start.

550
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,660
Don't even start.

551
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,560
I think you need to learn to get a little disappointed.

552
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,680
Tear dropped or wind there don't make me laugh.

553
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,260
Please don't touch my heart.

554
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,760
Who said life was a roller coaster?

555
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,060
Who said life was sweet surprise?

556
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,840
Who said life was a circus poster?

557
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,300
Not me, not me.

558
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,820
So ask me no questions.

559
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,120
Give me no answers.

560
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,920
And I'll tell you no lies.

561
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,640
Were you getting yourself a ride?

562
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:13,640


563
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:13,640


564
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:13,640


565
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:13,640


566
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,980
A little moody cause some folks are down right mean

567
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,640
Oh me, oh my, ain't that a shame, shame

568
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,760
Well you're starting to make a little speech

569
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,380
About the troubles that you've seen

570
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,680
Please spare me that

571
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,040
Stop that pity game again

572
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,960
Now who said life was a ball of berries?

573
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,440
Who said life was peach ice cream?

574
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,300
Who said life was a box of cherries?

575
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,520
Not me, not me

576
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,380
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

577
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,580
And I'll sell you no drinks

578
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,520
Were you thinking that you were gonna maybe

579
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Have to leave this lovely town again, again?

580
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,820
Get one more spot

581
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
Were you feeling a little like a baby

582
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,360
Who just got itself knocked down?

583
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,540
You say you were

584
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,160
I say well so what?

585
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,740
Ain't no use

586
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,900
Who said life was a song for singin'?

587
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,100
Who said life was such a snap?

588
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,060
Who said life was a bell for ringin'?

589
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,240
Not me, not me

590
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,020
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

591
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,720
And I'll hand you no credits

592
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,120
Who said life was a song for singin'?

593
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,300
Who said life was such a snap?

594
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,180
Who said life was a bell for ringin'?

595
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,400
Not me, not me

596
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,220
So ask me no questions, give me no answers

597
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,960
And I'll hand you no crap

598
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,740
And I'll sell you no dreams

599
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,320
And I'll tell you no lies

600
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,360
No lies

601
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,220
I couldn't bother to be a low-down door count witness, in you.

602
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,740
There isn't a bus coming home?

603
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,040
What are you looking at?

604
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,640
I'll cut loose, you skank!

605
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,520
If I were by myself, I'd show for you, unconscious!

606
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,580
It was me!

607
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,620
Wait, you're making a mistake!

608
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,960
Put me down!

609
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,080
It's the villager!

610
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,100
It's a clerical error!

611
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,780
It's Stang's fault!

612
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,720
The party's over

613
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,200
It's time to call it a day

614
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,620
It's time to call it a day

615
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:39,620


616
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,240
They've burst your pretty balloon

617
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,500
And taken the moon away

618
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,620
It's time to wind up

619
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,740
The masquerade

620
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,960
Just make your mind up

621
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,620
The masquerade

622
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,300
The piper must be paid

623
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,060
The party's over

624
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,540
The candles flicker and dim

625
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,340
You danced and dreamed through the night

626
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,220
It seemed to be right

627
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,800
Just being with him

628
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:37,800


629
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,220
Now you must wake up

630
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,680
All dreams must end

631
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,120
Take off your makeup

632
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,320
The party's over

633
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,740
It's all over

634
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:07,780
The party's over

635
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:07,780


636
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:07,780


637
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:07,780


638
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:07,780


639
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:07,780


640
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,160
Over, my friend.

641
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,200
Now you must wake up.

642
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,280
Our dreams must end.

643
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,320
Take off your makeup.

644
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,500
The party's over.

645
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,480
It's all over.

646
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,860
My friend.

647
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:23,140
Well, I think I'm gonna break down and cry.

648
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,720
Oh!

649
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,900
Oh!

650
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,800
Oh!

651
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,520
Oh!

652
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:30,800
Oh!

653
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,100


654
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,220
Oh!

655
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,400
Oh!

656
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,820
Oh!

657
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,040
Oh!

658
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,040


659
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,040


660
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,040


661
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,920
Yes, I've been hurt.

662
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,720
Like I've never been hurt before.

663
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,460
Turn back the clock, hey, turn around and join the ambience.

664
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,040
Yeah, don't just sit last to your in there like that.

665
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,060
Because you cheated, cheated, cheated,

666
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,660
cheated, cheated, cheated, cheated on me, girl.

667
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,520
Yeah, she told me that not always she makes the best of me.

668
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,660
You way.

669
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:57,680
You way.

670
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:57,900
You way.

671
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,380
I have nothing to do with it, I swear.

672
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,200
I was just repeating what I was told.

673
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,800
Oh, little girl, girls out in the air.

674
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,480
And I've been hurt.

675
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,080
Oh, till I can't do it.

676
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,440
Oh, not you too anymore.

677
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,800
Oh, look lady, I really have nothing to do with this.

678
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,520
And my name.

679
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,700
Here you go.

680
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,840
There must be some sort of mistake.

681
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,220
And no pain.

682
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,940
No, no, no, no.

683
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,120
When you left.

684
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,720
No more, I keep.

685
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,880
Great.

686
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,820
Cause I can be.

687
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,840
Sweeter than you.

688
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,260
Left with food.

689
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,060
Bobby Bull.

690
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,700
And I've been hurt.

691
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,300
Hurt.

692
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,240
Till I can't hurt.

693
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,880
Hurt.

694
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,540
Well, at least it sounds like there's a limit.

695
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm so hurt.

696
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,680
Oh, great.

697
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,500
Where'd she come from?

698
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,600
To think that you.

699
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,240
You lied.

700
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:21,860
To me.

701
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,460
Hey, I'm in the same boat.

702
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,800
I'm hurt.

703
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,260
Way down deep inside of me.

704
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,820
Try to look at it from my perspective.

705
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,540
I mean.

706
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,900
You said your love was true.

707
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,240
And we'd never.

708
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,720
Ever.

709
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,580
Never.

710
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,180
I cotton.

711
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,720
Hey.

712
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,300
Look.

713
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,120
No, you what?

714
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,020
And one.

715
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,900
Hey.

716
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,800
Mine.

717
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,960
self.

718
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,300
.

719
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,300


720
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,300


721
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,520
What?

722
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,420
I don't.

723

hilltop in tourorthDIO

749
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,880
Bob, the fact that you alone understood my pain, the agony of living on this life-sapping planet,

750
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,020
and you told me what I longed to hear.

751
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:48,280
That yes, there was a place in the stars where the slack flowed like hot lava and the sex codices were even hotter.

752
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:55,280
Yes, yes, it didn't matter how much I suffered here because I would be rewarded there.

753
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,740
So, oh, how I debased myself for you, Bob.

754
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:10,740
I prostitutelized for you, serving you on my knees night and day in the trenches of this pink conspiracy world,

755
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,140
spreading the message of your divine withering grace among the slack-starved masses.

756
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,500
Oh, and then, come your prophecy next day,

757
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,260
I awaited your coming in the fearsome light of early dawn,

758
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,320
with hundreds of believers, arms spread, mouths wide open for the first barrage of face-raping bats,

759
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,860
and it didn't come.

760
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,240
Desperately, desperately, I looked to the skies for those gleaming iridescent escape vessels

761
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,880
and for the glory and sex codices within them, but they didn't come.

762
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,420
I was looking for that ultimate good time that you promised us, Bob,

763
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,200
and Bob...

764
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,260
Bob!

765
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,060
I didn't come!

766
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,100
Oh.

767
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,300
Oh, what does this mean, Bob?

768
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,880
Is your word false, even to your truest believers?

769
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,900
Are our sacred pre-scriptures nothing but lies?

770
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,380
What else is there you're lying about, Bob?

771
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,160
What about the sex?

772
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,340
What about the salvation?

773
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,040
Oh, Bob, if you were wrong about X-Day,

774
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,340
were you wrong about the slack, too, Bob?

775
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,120
Oh, no.

776
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,140
No.

777
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,220
I can't go on if it means living in a world without slack.

778
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,060
Oh, Bob, I can't take this pain.

779
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,420
Why?

780
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,360
Why?

781
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,160
Why?

782
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Why?

783
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,620
Why?

784
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,280
Why?

785
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


786
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


787
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


788
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


789
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


790
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


791
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


792
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


793
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


794
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,280


795
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,620
Why?

796
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,660
I wonder why.

797
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,060
P攰

798
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,060


799
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,980
ف

800
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,000
But I never find out why

801
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,840
I keep pushing to hold it

802
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,740
Maybe I keep trying to make it right

803
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,720
To another lonely day

804
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,200
Oh, oh, oh

805
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh, oh, oh

806
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,800
It's coming to an end

807
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,520
25 years

808
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,300
And it's just one night

809
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,780
Oh, yeah

810
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,140
But I'm 25 years old tonight

811
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,820
So I know it can't be right

812
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,180
And I'm no better, babe

813
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,760
And I can't help you no more

814
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,400
Than I did when you just began

815
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,280
But it don't make no difference, babe

816
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,780
Oh, oh, oh

817
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:16,780


818
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,520
No, no

819
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,820
And I know that I could always try

820
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,560
It don't make no difference, babe

821
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,300
I better hold it now

822
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,280
I better need it, yeah

823
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,840
I better use it till the day I die

824
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,680
Why?

825
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,020
Why?

826
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,680
Don't expect any answer

827
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:46,980
Still

828
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,320
Oh, I know that they don't come with age

829
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,220
No, no

830
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,860
I ain't never gonna love you any better, babe

831
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,300
And they're never gonna love you right

832
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,760
So you better take it now

833
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,040
Right now

834
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:08,760
Oh

835
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,860
But it don't make no difference, babe

836
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,620
And I know that I'm gonna wish it out

837
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:16,780
And I know that I'm gonna wish it out

838
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,540
But there's a fire inside of every one of us

839
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,840
You better need it now

840
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,720
I get to hold it, yeah

841
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,080
I better use it till the day I die

842
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,780
Don't make no difference, babe

843
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,880
No, no, no

844
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,200
And it never ever will

845
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,680
I wanna talk about living and loving you

846
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,800
I get to hold it, babe

847
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,660
I gotta need it now

848
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,380
I better use it

849
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,920
Say hi!

850
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:48,900
Say hi!

851
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,780
Don't make no difference, babe

852
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,060
Say hi!

853
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh, honey, I hate to be the one

854
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,820
I said you better live your life

855
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,680
And you better love your life

856
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,960
Oh, baby

857
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,180
Someday you're gonna have to cry

858
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:03,600
Yes, indeed

859
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,680
Yes, indeed

860
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,620
Yes, indeed

861
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,580
Oh, baby, yes, indeed

862
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,560
I said you're almost gonna hurt your own life

863
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,800
I said they're almost gonna let you down

864
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,780
I said they're almost gonna let you down

865
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,220
And it's everywhere

866
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,580
Everywhere, everywhere

867
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,500
And everywhere, everywhere

868
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,600
Oh, honey, what you hold on to, it's gonna move

869
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,700
I said it's gonna disappear when you turn to black

870
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,440
I said you know it ain't gonna be there when you wanna reach out and hear about it

871
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,540
Oh, baby

872
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,660
Oh, baby

873
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,440
Oh, baby

874
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,260
Oh, but keep trackin' on

875
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,300
Oh, yeah

876
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,600
Oh, yeah!

877
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,440
Oh, yeah!

878
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,780
Woo!

879
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,020
Woo!

880
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:52,860
Woo!

881
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,660
Woo!

882
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,920
I sang

883
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,100
I saw

884
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,000
And I fell little fool I am

885
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,020
And now I'm in an awful jam

886
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,100
I love him but oh

887
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,180
I guess I'll have to change my plan.

888
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,380
I should have known that he'd be somebody else's man.

889
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,720
I overlooked that point completely

890
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,880
until the big affair began.

891
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:46,800
Yes, before I knew where I was at,

892
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:53,280
I found myself up on the shelf, and that was that.

893
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,580
I tried to reach the moon, but when I got there,

894
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,780
all that I could get was the air.

895
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,780
My feet are back up.

896
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,100
I'm up on the ground.

897
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,020
I've lost the one man I found.

898
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,880
I guess I'll have to change my plan.

899
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:31,580
I should have realized I'd be an also-ran.

900
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,380
Why, why did I buy those black pajamas?

901
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,580
Before the big affair began.

902
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:51,260
My boiling point is much too low

903
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,640
for me to cope with that elope for Romeo.

904
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,600
I think I'll crawl right back

905
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,880
and into my shell,

906
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,500
dwelling in my purse.

907
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,940
But

908
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,480
from thousands of miles beyond your planet.

909
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:43,760
Warning!

910
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,200
Warning!

911
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,540
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.

912
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,080
Ah!

913
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,620
Oh, my God!

914
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,740
Oh, great advice, but how can you change your plans

915
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,100
when half of your life has been spent preparing for a day

916
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,100
that just didn't happen?

917
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,520
Or did it?

918
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,960
Did it not happen, Seekers?

919
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,300
I was there at Brushwood, and I know what I saw.

920
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,440
Or I think I know what I saw, but...

921
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,640
Oh, whatever it was, it was truly apocalyptic.

922
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,860
I went not knowing what to expect,

923
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,580
but with a background sensation that we would all somehow be ripped off.

924
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,820
Oh.

925
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,980
You know, as I put it, one way or another,

926
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,280
we're all gonna finally get porked real good by Bob.

927
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:45,880
Woo-hoo!

928
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,180
Oh, but, you know, Seekers,

929
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,300
I never expected to be feeling such righteous afterglow

930
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,700
from the spiritual mugging we all suffered.

931
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,480
Sure, staying in Jesus or brazen charlatans

932
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,680
who took advantage of our willing gullibility,

933
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,940
and sure, the chance of actual redemption from the skies

934
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,100
is about zilch .9,

935
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,640
and, uh, oh, but still,

936
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,960
I tried to keep that wool pulled over my eyes

937
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,400
and to be a starry-eyed little seeker for the cause,

938
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,700
and although deep inside there was a feeling

939
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,500
that we were about to get the big burn of all time,

940
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,740
I tried to deny it.

941
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,380
Oh, but, Seekers, something mystical happened out there

942
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,000
in that subgenius sweat lodge,

943
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,560
and I know I'm not the only one who saw it.

944
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,860
The night of X-Day Eve, after all the riddles,

945
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,620
the night you all started to peter out,

946
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,440
I took my boombox full of apocalyptic, easy-listening music

947
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,680
out into the middle of the big-ass brushwood field

948
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,480
and stood out there,

949
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,980
naked and alone in the dewy grass

950
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,000
beneath a sky that was screaming with stars.

951
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,300
And there I danced an end-times dance alone in the dark.

952
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,920
And as I swirled,

953
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,840
everywhere I looked was alive with our people,

954
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,840
the night air pulsed with subgenius life.

955
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,820
All around me was a ring of their glowing campfires

956
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,280
and the sounds of their last night on earth revelry

957
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,140
carried through the cold night air

958
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,540
and blended with the atmospheric schmaltz.

959
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,560
And suddenly, I was moved to tears of absolute joy by it all,

960
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:39,420
because this was no longer a raggedy-ass convocation of bitter misfits

961
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,100
that screwed up loners.

962
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,300
No, suddenly we were a great subgenius nation.

963
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,540
And at that point of Satori alone there in that field,

964
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,660
I sobbed like a damn baby over it.

965
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,720
And in that crystalline perfect moment,

966
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,020
I knew what it was really all about.

967
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:09,740
Waiting for the saucers to arrive was a lot of kicks, sure.

968
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,780
Oh, but that wasn't the be-all and end-all of the game.

969
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,760
Yeah, we got burned.

970
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,820
Oh, but at the same time,

971
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,560
something stronger in us all got forged in those same fires.

972
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,040
We are all in this church from the start

973
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,380
because of our mutually shared pain and discontent.

974
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,000
And at the risk of sounding just too damn sweetness and light,

975
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,700
we have each other.

976
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,840
That's where our power and our true menace to them is.

977
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,320
And some has always lain.

978
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,660
Oh, but by the same token,

979
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,700
we can draw the solace and the strength that we need for our basic survival

980
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:55,160
from the fact that we are a solid, cohesive subgenius family.

981
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,920
Yes, every one of us has a part around Bob's big dinner table,

982
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,100
passing that steaming tureen of slack to the Yeti next to you,

983
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,200
and happily digging into the soul-satisfying feast of Dobbs

984
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,000
with our brethren.

985
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,080
Sure, we're a dysfunctional family,

986
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,680
but we're made of superior material to start with.

987
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,660
And our version of the home game has much more amusing and fascinating characters,

988
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,460
like our oily daddy, Stang,

989
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,820
and our badass uncle, Katahdin Lagume,

990
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,640
and our sweet little brother, Onan,

991
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,800
and our silken sister, Lilith,

992
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,380
and our crusty old grandpa, G. Gordon Gordon.

993
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,160
Ha ha!

994
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,920
Oh, and you can just think of me

995
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,820
as your slutty sister, Susie,

996
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,900
who laughs it off when you walk in on me

997
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,320
when I'm douching in the tub.

998
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,300
Yeah, because out there in the woods, Seekers,

999
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,060
I got more bang for my membership buck than I ever thought possible.

1000
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,660
This church has given me,

1001
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,020
and I know it has given many others,

1002
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,100
something immeasurable,

1003
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,660
and I am absolutely shining from it all.

1004
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,180
With lovely subgenius friends like I have,

1005
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,100
I can simply chortle out of hell to sex goddesses,

1006
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,360
and maybe I can laugh off the sting of brutal disappointment that much more easily.

1007
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,760
Because we didn't exactly get off this planet,

1008
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,120
but for some weird-ass damn reason,

1009
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,520
I don't exactly mind living on crap ball earth as much as I did just two weeks ago.

1010
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:35,300
And that in itself is a miracle of first degree, baby.

1011
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,280
Oh, sure, this cult is founded on a big damn joke,

1012
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,620
but our dedication to our own is totally serious,

1013
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:48,740
and any lame-ass butt-stain who doubts that we're a family

1014
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,620
can just look at the outpouring of support for poor stricken pea-kitty.

1015
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,320
A subgenius so strong that not even diabetes could fell him.

1016
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,020
Oh, maybe we didn't get off this planet, Seekers,

1017
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:09,860
but we can use our new solidarity to create a subgenius paradise for the utensin here on earth.

1018
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,060
And by the way, yes,

1019
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:20,180
that was a huge damn X in the clouds in the pink light of early dawn on X-Day morning.

1020
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:27,400
And it was truly a beautiful thing to see the tangible sign of Dob's covenant with his people,

1021
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,020
a fire in the skies over our great subgenius nation.

1022
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:39,100
Oh, brave new world that has such creatures in it.

1023
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,020
Snap out of it.

1024
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,420
Ow!

1025
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,320
Ah.

1026
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,980
I think that pagan living softened your brain.

1027
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,140
How do you feel?

1028
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,820
Huh.

1029
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,440
Do I ever need a frickin' cigarette?

1030
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,340
After that emotional display, I need a douche.

1031
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,420
Oh, yeah.

1032
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,140
Ah!

1033
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:00,860
Ah!

1034
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:03,480
torres?

1035
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,480


1036
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,320
Nab.

1037
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,020
Oh, fuck!

1038
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,660
Partner, yes!

1039
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,380
Through this night were still the troubles of the past so far.

1040
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,760
Out of sight, through the mind.

1041
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,560
Ah, oui.

1042
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,020
Ah, oui.

1043
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:30,100
Ah, oui!

1044
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,780
I've done a lot

1045
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,400
God knows I've tried

1046
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,040
To find the truth

1047
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,220
I've even lied

1048
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,960
But all I know

1049
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,900
Is down inside I'm bleeding

1050
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,240
I'm a superhero

1051
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,660
Come to feast

1052
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,400
To taste the flesh

1053
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,840
Not yet deceased

1054
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,180
And all I know

1055
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,640
Is still the business

1056
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,880
Of a hero

1057
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:25,880


1058
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,540
With me

1059
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,360
And crawling

1060
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:23,220
on the planet's face

1061
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,060
Some insects

1062
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,100
Called the human race

1063
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,560
Lost in time

1064
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,560
And lost in space

1065
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,560
And in meaning

1066
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,500
Meaning

1067
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,520
Meaning

1068
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,900
Ah

1069
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,200
Ah

1070
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,200


1071
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,740
Smithers, I'm so happy.

1072
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,720
Something amazing has happened.

1073
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,780
I'm actually happy.

1074
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,540
Take a note.

1075
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,940
From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.

1076
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,220
I'm sorry, sir.

1077
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,260
I don't have a pencil.

1078
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,300
Don't worry.

1079
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,180
I'm sure I'll remember it.
