00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,980
Bob Lepke, Bob Lepke, Bob Lepke, Bob Lepke

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,380
Hello my friend, how are you?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,880
I am sending you this tape that you will play over the air

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,960
to the millions of fans who listen to me.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,840
Ah, Hour of Slack, one of the greatest shows in the world!

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,020
And I have a new guest, a new person, who is here with me.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,100
Yes, Mr. Pee-Pee will like to introduce his son, Baby Pee-Wee.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,640
Hello, this is Baby Pee-Wee. Are you nice today?

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,240
I'm very nice, I've always been very nice.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,120
And how big are you, Mr. Pee-Pee Jr.?

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,300
I'm 20, playing on my daddy.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,220
Son, what did I tell you about bragging?

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000
I told you that this is the Hour of Slack program.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,940
You should not brag, but if you do, be honest and tell us.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,440
How big is it really?

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,500
The listening audience of Hour of Slack would really like to know.

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,380
I'm always trying to make as you have ever said.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,940
Ah, like father, like son. Oh, the momentum. Oh!

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,780
Well, I just want to say hello and thank you, Hour of Slack,

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,640
and Ivan Stang, for playing this tape.

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,100
And if I could do anything for anybody, ooh, just come over anytime. Bye-bye.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,480
Bye-bye!

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,980
Bob loves you. Bob loves you. Bob loves you.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,880
Bob loves you. Bob loves you. Bob loves you.

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,180
Anyway, I'd say, you're broadcasting from Berkeley, California into the Bay Area.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,760
And, uh, he's in Dallas, you know.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,620
And there's people in Dallas who don't know the difference between James Joyce and Joyce Brothers, so...

28
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,560
That's why you have to lecture them.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,200
And besides, I think you should sometimes lecture your audiences.

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,140
You are a doctor after all.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,960
You're up there in front of them all.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
They're the ones that are having to listen to you.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,660
You have the controls.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,880
You have the microphone.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,000
All they can do is either listen or not listen.

36
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,800
You put them in a binary state.

37
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,260
A passive binary state.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,040
They can either listen to what you have to say or not listen to what you have to say.

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
They can turn you on or turn you off.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,180
And perhaps until the moment they tune you in, you're nothing but a way-front probability.

41
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,120
You don't really exist for them.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,320
But there's nothing wrong with stomping a few butts.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:42,840
I've always believed that one of our most important functions in this church has been to administer a good kick in the ass.

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,080
Maybe if you kick them hard enough in the ass, it pops their eyes open.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,880
And a jolt of surprise opens up their lobes.

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
They see something.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,860
It registers.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,200
The devil owes you money, friend.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,520
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,280
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil!

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,600
We gotta root him out!

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,900
Burn out the hate!

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,280
Burn out the radiation!

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Burn out the fire!

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,940
These words may be harsh.

56
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,380
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists.

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,420
The modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
But I don't care what they say.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,300
I'll keep preaching.

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,700
If you go down, pull them with you, Praise Bob.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,040
Help me, somebody.

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,380
Let there be slack.

63
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,100
Bob.

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,300
Bob.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,000
Bob.

66
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,080
Bob.

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,520
Bob.

68
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Bob.

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,800
Bob.

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,760
Bob.

71
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,020
Bob.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,020
Bob.

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,500


74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:40,760
Bob.

75
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:40,980
Bob.

76
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,320
Bob.

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:41,640
Bob.

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:41,700
Bob.

79
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,280
Bob.

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,360
Bob.

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,540
Bob.

82
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,600
Bob.

83
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,540
Bob.

84
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:43,840
Bob.

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


86
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


90
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:43,840


93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

94
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
Can you hear me?

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
Yes, I think you can.

96
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,520
A severe indictment.

97
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,880
The Church of the Subgenius is a negative 273-day exploit of religion.

98
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,420
It is a solution waiting for its problem.

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,020
It is the nameless mission.

100
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,440
and it is the mandatory indulgence.

101
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,560
A society for non-joiners?

102
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
A mail-order mind-control cult?

103
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,600
A joke?

104
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,760
It is anything you need it to be

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,680
in order to part with that membership fee today.

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,380
From the Dobbs.Town Mirror.

107
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,440
Things to see, say, do, think, know, and buy.

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
We'll have more of that later.

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,680
I'm still laid up and lying down

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,200
with a bad back, friends.

111
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,660
A little yard work accident

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,360
that set me back a bit.

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,620
And I...

114
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:11,920
I...

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,000
I...

116
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,300
I said I was going to do a new show.

117
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm going to try to put some new stuff in here.

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
But a whole lot of this,

119
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,240
Hour of Slack number 1,801,

120
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,720
is from the olden days,

121
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,420
Hour of Slack number 38,

122
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,140
which I think was not

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,160
one of the ones that's archived.

124
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,520
I recently unearthed master copies of shows

125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,960
that aren't on the David Bauchner stack.

126
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,660
I think I've got a whole stash of a thousand old shows.

127
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,440
This one was not in that stash, I don't think.

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,640
Number 38, and a lot of it is from our old Media Barrage albums,

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,660
including unreleased ones.

130
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,040
Number 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 were never out on CD.

131
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,200
And we never pushed them all that hard.

132
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,180
They existed on cassettes.

133
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,240
I digitized.

134
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,220
I digitized them.

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,260
Long since.

136
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,580
But not on...

137
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,000
We never did try to sell them on CD.

138
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,700
I might put them on Bandcamp,

139
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,200
if my back feels better.

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,860
But in the meantime, friends,

141
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,700
here's the big news!

142
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,400
The Subgenius movie is out.

143
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,280
The documentary,

144
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,840
with the title,

145
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

146
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,460
documentary directed by

147
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,940
Sandy,

148
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,920
Kay Boone,

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,280
2019,

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,760
is out.

151
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,800
You can see it on the internet.

152
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,860
It's for rent or purchase

153
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,860
on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, Fandango Now,

154
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,620
Foodoo,

155
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,800
and also YouTube.

156
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,300
And I'll be surprised if it doesn't pop up on Netflix also.

157
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,620
But it is showing now.

158
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,920
It started out as a movie.

159
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,500
It started this morning.

160
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,060
And it's gotten fabulous reviews.

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,720
I mean,

162
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,980
maybe one in 20 reviews goes,

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,960
well, this group wasn't as important

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,540
as the movie makes them out to be.

165
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,980
But that's the worst thing they can say about it.

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,560
Generally, everybody who sees it

167
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
thinks it's really, really funny

168
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,960
and open their eyes to certain things.

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,480
Of course, a lot of people had extreme misconceptions

170
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,520
about Church of the Subgenius.

171
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,460
And this movie will continue.

172
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
To protect us with those misconceptions.

173
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,840
You can go to the homepage of subgenius.com

174
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,380
and there'll be a link there

175
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,920
to this link,

176
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,880
which shows you all the links

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,100
you would need to know about this movie.

178
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,080
Dr. Onan Canobite

179
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,620
is maintaining an updated list

180
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,300
of who's showing the movie

181
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,360
and a giant list of all the reviews.

182
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,520
And I mean, there's like,

183
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,920
25 or 30 reviews already, at least.

184
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Some of them are older from the film festival year,

185
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,420
but a whole lot of them are new, brand new.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,840
And that's a fun read.

187
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,680
And you can find all of those at

188
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,020
dobstown.org.

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,480
Not dobbs.town,

190
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,500
but a new one called dobstown.org,

191
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,760
which Onan, Uncle Onan,

192
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,400
set up, evidently,

193
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,840
to have released,

194
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,240
you know, updated lists

195
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,180
of where the movie is showing.

196
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,020
Of course, he's in it a fair amount

197
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,360
at different ages,

198
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,100
different stages of his life.

199
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,140
Like I am, and Dr. Philo Drummond,

200
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,580
and Paul Mavridis,

201
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,600
and Dr. Hal, and Puzzling Evidence,

202
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,080
and Sterno, and Papa Joe,

203
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,860
and Susan Flusie, and...

204
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,900
Hold on.

205
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,060
Let's give him a hug.

206
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


207
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


208
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


209
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


210
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


211
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


212
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,060


213
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,080
and there're a whole lot

214
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,820
of other people.

215
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,300
It really focuses on the olden days,

216
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,240
although it does also cover

217
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
the modern strangenesses that happened.

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,280
It's great.

219
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,800
It's a really, really fun movie.

220
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,240
All the details, again, are at dobstown.org,

221
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,080
which you can also find in the front page of subgenius.com.

222
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,600
And it's on Amazon Prime and Apple TV and Fandango Now and Vudu and YouTube.

223
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,800
But it's not free.

224
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,960
By the way, contributors to the movie who were promised a DVD

225
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,560
will get their DVD after the movie has had a chance to make a little bit of money

226
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,800
before you subgeniuses go and spread bootleg copies of it

227
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,560
as MP4s all over the dang Internet where everybody will be seeing it for free.

228
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,480
That's fine later, but let Sandy make a little bit of her money back.

229
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,540
It was a very expensive movie because she hired

230
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,940
the very best of her money.

231
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,440
The best people.

232
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,780
And you'll see what I mean.

233
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,840
If you look at it, look at it a couple of times.

234
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,780
Listen to the sound.

235
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,840
Listen to what's going on in the background of the soundtrack

236
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,680
and little effects and throwaway things.

237
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,340
I forget the name of the guy who did that, but he was a great sound mixer.

238
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,560
The music is great.

239
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,400
It's, well, especially the Rudy Schwartz project

240
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,080
that's used at the very end.

241
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
But, yeah.

242
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,720
The movie is out.

243
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm hoping we'll double our membership sales,

244
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,220
which have actually been pretty good during this coronavirus era.

245
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,260
Isn't that strange?

246
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,740
Everybody's brokered and they've ever been

247
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,580
and they send their last amount,

248
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,620
which I'm not supposed to say on public-supported radio,

249
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,820
to me at our P.O. box

250
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,680
or with our website links.

251
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Anyway, yeah, that movie, the movie is coming.

252
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,220
And you'll see.

253
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,060
It's really fun.

254
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,100
Coincidence?

255
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,460
It's no one ever or everybody always.

256
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,380
Which side are you on?

257
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,080
You'll have to be more extreme than the most extreme extremist.

258
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,420
More fundamental than the most fundamental fundamentalist.

259
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,920
And more progressive than the most progressive.

260
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,720
Progressive, progressive.

261
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,160
If you want their answers.

262
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,360
If you want an answer from Bob,

263
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,960
then I'm quite sure it's less work and cheaper.

264
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,800
But you get to be a fanatic anyway.

265
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
It's win-win for Bob.

266
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,860
And that is from the Dobbs Dock Town Mirror,

267
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,160
which is published by Reverend Onan Canabite,

268
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,900
mayor of Dobbs Dock Town,

269
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,080
and the Dobs Dock Town.

270
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,060
Subgenius members can participate in Dobbs Dock Town online

271
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,440
and get free or nearly copies of paper products,

272
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,300
like the Dobbs Dock Town Mirror,

273
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,040
which also says this item of national interest.

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,380
Most members of the Church of the Subgenius

275
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,380
take on a new name upon the advent of their initiation.

276
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,880
This is standard practice for any male or female.

277
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:46,880


278
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,040
The name is not a standard.

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,100
It's a standard of the order of mind control called.

280
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,740
What sets ours apart, and above the rest,

281
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,240
is that you're not limited to one persona,

282
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,240
and it doesn't have to be your real self or your best side.

283
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,900
Quite plenty of subgeniuses are jerks

284
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,940
until you meet them in real life.

285
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,220
Or just the opposite.

286
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,040
Praise Bob.

287
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,580
Words of wisdom from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

288
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,960
And now this.

289
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,700
We're going to take you now into that service in progress

290
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,700
where we are sharing on the subject,

291
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,840
Can a Christian be demon possessed?

292
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,400
Friends, the conspiracy all together has something like

293
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,160
50 or 60 thousand nuclear weapons.

294
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,980
How many does the church have?

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,100
Only three.

296
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,820
But yet we dare to fight the

297
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,980
We're going to do it.

298
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,440
We're going to fight them.

299
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
We don't care how many we get.

300
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,940
Because friends, it's always the crazy people.

301
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,240
It's always the eccentrics, the outsiders,

302
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,920
that are dumb enough to take on the conspiracy.

303
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,460
Oh yes, friends.

304
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,500
Another rule of the church of the subgenius.

305
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,540
Don't just eat that hamburger.

306
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,820
Eat the hell out of it.

307
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,880
Friends, do you know how to have a good time?

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,640
Say yes.

309
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,180
Yes!

310
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,180
Do you know how to have a good time?

311
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,080
Yes!

312
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,180
Do you need Bob to have a good time?

313
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,720
Yes!

314
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,180
No! No!

315
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,060
Bob once said, now we're right.

316
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,800
You don't have to have Bob to have a good time.

317
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,140
That's how you know whether you're a subgenius.

318
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,880
If you, do you need Bob?

319
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,620
No!

320
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,380
Then you have Bob in your life, my friends.

321
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,320
Bob has already entered your life.

322
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,560
We can't fight them, but they can't win.

323
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,280
And it's, it's who's like them.

324
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,300
The sorrow of world religions.

325
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,780
Bob is out there, it's the Robin Hood of religions.

326
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,880
Bob's out there scratching a bloody B on the beefy seat of that monstrous conspiracy.

327
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, friends.

328
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

329
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, we're going to tell you a lot about the Men in Black tonight.

330
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,580
This is our Men in Black show.

331
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,560
We have come to make the Bob show.

332
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,840
What are they saying right now, Bob?

333
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,160
Bob, Bob, Bob.

334
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,780
We have come to make you function.

335
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,860
We're not here to destroy.

336
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,380
The Men in Black.

337
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,920
We are here to employ.

338
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,500
We have come to make you function.

339
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,760
So we can eat you at our functions.

340
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,760
Well, we're going to talk about the Men in Black tonight.

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,060
Because UFO aliens are already living among us, friends.

342
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,580
That's right.

343
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,700
Evil aliens in the form of subversive Men in Black

344
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,100
are infiltrating Earth secretly, preparing for a takeover of our planet, say the experts.

345
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,320
Electronics expert, Oskar Magoski, reveals that he's traveled through galaxies following their evil plans

346
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,480
ever since he was contacted by friendly aliens ten years ago

347
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,180
and told of the planned takeover.

348
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,180
We cannot identify the Men in Black.

349
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
They are humanoid in appearance.

350
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,520
We know them by their actions.

351
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,500
They penetrate every level of life.

352
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,080
The Men in Black wear dark business suits and do the dirty work such as terrorism.

353
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,280
They drive big black cars.

354
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,100
The classic bad guy image.

355
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,480
The Illuminati, however, manipulate politicians and financiers.

356
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,000
You know, friends,

357
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:57,320
they're all just dancing around the pipe of bulb dobs.

358
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:04,020
And bulb dobs might be able to change your life.

359
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,000
If you grab this chance,

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,860
if you send three lousy guilders,

361
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,760
and what is three guilders nowadays?

362
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,180
It's nothing.

363
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,060
If you send those three guilders to Dallas, Texas,

364
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,960
and we will once more give you the address,

365
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,620
you will be saved.

366
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,040
And you might not believe what happens to you if you're saved.

367
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,960
And that address, once again, my friends, is P.O. Box...

368
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,080
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

369
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,740
And you can address it personally to Bob.

370
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,860
And it's spelled J.R.

371
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,900
Open quotation marks.

372
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,580
B.O.B.

373
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,260
Close quotation marks.

374
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Dobbs.

375
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,420
Well, that...

376
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,900
Oh, yes, friends.

377
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,660
That...

378
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,680
That was broadcast on a pirate radio station

379
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,800
around midnight of June in Amsterdam, Holland.

380
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,720
Pretty weird, eh?

381
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,880
It gets as far away as Amsterdam,

382
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,760
and we got those three guilders in the mail.

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,660
Sure, he makes some saved money.

384
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,480
What did he do to those young women that time?

385
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,800
Well, I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

386
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,940
I know that Bob will do all of the sign in the long run.

387
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,020
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

388
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
In our lives.

389
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,520
In 1981.

390
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,100
And in 1984, my little brother.

391
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,440
And in 1991.

392
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:12,460
And in 1995, when they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

393
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,600
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

394
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,800
And we'll leave our earthly things behind,

395
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,500
and we'll go and join the Hexists from God only knows what strange planet they come from,

396
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,420
if they really even exist.

397
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:49,040
Well, I don't think I know if I need to buy the universe.

398
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,280
But I do believe we'll look outside to see if we're Carwynians.

399
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,860
Subgenius can be cheerful,

400
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,140
but at least such things as godly and noble London

401
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


402
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


403
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,140


404
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,500
To prettier came on and endless the alleged

405
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,440
I'm going to pretend to fall depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities,

406
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,060
but I don't want to get lost in the dark.

407
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,100
I want to tell you something.

408
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,620
Hello there, my friends.

409
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,400
This is Reverend Dr. Sardonicus J. Chaos.

410
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,780
Yes, dear friends.

411
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,480
I have a little case history I'd like to relate to you.

412
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,920
All the names of the people and towns in this have been changed to protect the insane.

413
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:40,040
This story concerns a former associate of mine, the Reverend Albert Radwell.

414
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,040
He used to be a fine, fine colleague of mine in the church, my own chaotic church of Nege.

415
00:20:51,480 --> 00:21:01,420
And he was doing fine until, well, I'm going to read you excerpts from his journey.

416
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,860
He wrote a journal that he wrote before he was committed.

417
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,460
The first entry here I'm going to read from is dated on December 12th.

418
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,840
It doesn't have a year listed.

419
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,300
I gave my two weeks notice that I am leaving my job at the power plant.

420
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,180
My supervisor was a bit disturbed by this sudden, seemingly motiveless action of mine.

421
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,700
But I feel like I have no choice.

422
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,680
I must leave.

423
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,280
This town is infinite.

424
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,080
Infiltrated by the men in black.

425
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:42,900
This fanatical group composed of every sort of hideous, hideous people.

426
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,760
And these vermin have had me under observation for the past two weeks.

427
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,700
I knew that they were keeping an eye on me when that black Mercedes, which I have never seen before,

428
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,480
followed me to within half a block from my house.

429
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,340
They must think that.

430
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,480
I know too much about them.

431
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,380
Actually, I know very little about these men in black.

432
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,680
I wish that I knew what they're going to do next, but it's really up to them to make the next move.

433
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,820
Damn it, I feel so powerless, so, so confused.

434
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,060
All I can do is play a waiting game and hope that they don't make their move while I am asleep.

435
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,620
Next entry.

436
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,080
December 17th.

437
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,760
Well, I have lived to see the end of another week.

438
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,220
Next week.

439
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,220
Next week is my last hit to the power plant and my last in this town.

440
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm worried that the men in black will send someone after me before I can get out of town.

441
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,880
What are they waiting for?

442
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,700
This not knowing is making me apprehensive.

443
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:54,520
My telephone has been making strange clicking sounds, and I fear that my conversations are now being wiretapped.

444
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,160
Of course, I have spoken to no one about these men in black, and I do not plan to.

445
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,180
So what will they gain from tapping my phone?

446
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,780
I have no idea.

447
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,520
At what point will all this be over with?

448
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:14,980
I suspect that they will stop at nothing in order to preserve the security of their organization.

449
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,360
Only time will tell.

450
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,240
I have no idea.

451
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,240


452
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,180
Next entry is December 23rd.

453
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,460
There was an explosion today in one of the plant's generators.

454
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,560
A company official said that sabotage is suspected.

455
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,200
A company official said that sabotage is suspected.

456
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,420
And I have my own suspicions as to the party responsible for this sabotage.

457
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,820
Because my workstation is only 15 meters or so away from the generator in question.

458
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,280
Fortunately, I was at lunch when the blast occurred.

459
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,560
This is making me a nervous wreck.

460
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm relieved that this is my last day here at the plant.

461
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,420
After giving the matter some more thought, though, I have decided the explosion was meant only as a warning.

462
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,860
Because they have watched me closely enough to know that I was at lunch.

463
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,540
And therefore I would not be hurt.

464
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,280
How very considerate.

465
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,280
Anyway, this journal goes on and on.

466
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:22,360
And, uh, apparently, uh, we're not sure what exactly happened to him, but he did end up being committed.

467
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,860
He's our former, former, uh, co-worker here at the church, Dr. Albert Radwell.

468
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:40,980
And, uh, we don't know whether this, uh, his being committed is a result of, uh, the men in black or his own delusions concerning them.

469
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:53,100
There's a secret society of scheming aliens that have already gained control of education, politics, private banking, major law firms, and philanthropic foundations.

470
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,400
A researcher, Jerome Eden, explains that evil extraterrestrials will use propaganda to destroy the planet.

471
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,160
And to subvert mankind so that no one will even notice they're in control until it's too late.

472
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,760
This is the Men in Black Show.

473
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,660
The knowledge must have come from outer space.

474
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,380
The knowledge must have come from outer space.

475
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,460
Watch the heavenlies.

476
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,620
It's your spaceship out of control.

477
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
Does that sound fearful, my friend?

478
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,000
Would you say, Jesus, a final great space event as Christ returned to the earth?

479
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:56,440
This is just another one of those kooky concepts that people get and try to pass it off for gospel truth.

480
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,980
You continue to believe in the rapture and look for Jesus Christ.

481
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,360
And you're going to be a man of God.

482
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,360


483
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,360


484
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,760
Because he's coming very soon.

485
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,760
And I seen one of them flying right by over my car.

486
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,240
And they stopped my car.

487
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,560
And they took me in.

488
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,460
And they said, Jimmy, Jimmy, we're real.

489
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,060
We're here.

490
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,580
We're here to help you.

491
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,100
You understand?

492
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,320
We're here to help you and your mother and all those dear to you and your friends and brother Roloff.

493
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,560
And we're going to stop the evil that's going on in the world.

494
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,880
We're going to come down.

495
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,340
And we're going to help those evil people.

496
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,320
And we're going to help those evil people find themselves.

497
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,720
You're going to help us, Jimmy.

498
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,800
You're going to help us.

499
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,600
You're going to tell us which ones are the evil people that we need to correct.

500
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,700
Now, you're going to help us, Jimmy, okay?

501
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,160
And then they got back in their spaceship and they flew off.

502
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,500
And I just found myself in my car again.

503
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,980
And I drove on down to that 7-Eleven.

504
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,440
And my father, of course, he's dead.

505
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,220
But they're keeping the water on him.

506
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,680
He's okay.

507
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,880
They're keeping him cool.

508
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,740
People say I'm crazy.

509
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,140
I don't lie.

510
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,180
He told me.

511
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,500
He said, I see little men.

512
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,360
And he held his fingers like this.

513
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,440
It's illusions.

514
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,560
He said, I see little men about three inches high.

515
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,600
He said, I'm over in Spain or somewhere like that.

516
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,200
He said, I even go over into a place like that.

517
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,660
And he said, I see these little objects and these little men and all these little things.

518
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,180
And if your heart doesn't go out for something like that, I don't want you to know my heart goes out for people like that.

519
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,820
And I want you to know something else.

520
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,440
Those people are actually, you know what they're doing?

521
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,700
Those people are really reaching out, trying to find something.

522
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:50,800
And if they can just realize that Jesus has the answer, that Christ has everything that they're looking for, and Christ can let them get on high, lift them up and put them on the high way and give them joy and peace in their life.

523
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,360
You'll not want any more joy.

524
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,900
You'll not want any more hell.

525
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,100
You'll not want any more joy.

526
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,180
You'll not want any more hell.

527
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,060
You'll not want any more hell.

528
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,280
Press pop.

529
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,460
Press pop.

530
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

531
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:27,080
But, friends, let's begin our sermon tonight by looking to the Book of the Subject.

532
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,100
Chapter 11, The UFO Made Me Do It.

533
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,060
For these observations on the men in black.

534
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,900
But first, one short quote.

535
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,440
Stretch forth thy hands on high.

536
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,720
Rescue me and deliver me from the many waters.

537
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,360
From the hands of aliens whose mouths speak lies.

538
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,700
And whose right hand is the hand of falsehood.

539
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,080
Psalms 144.7

540
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,780
And be not forgetful to entertain strangers.

541
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,580
For thereby some have entertained angels unaware.

542
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,220
That was said by St. Paul the contactee.

543
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,480
But.

544
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,640
Ignore all that.

545
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:33,280
Any sensible subgenius knows that Republican and Democrat are laughably meaningless terms for identical pawns in a bigger game.

546
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,600
What they didn't understand was just how little differences there are between any political parties.

547
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,600
Anywhere on the political spectrum.

548
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,860
Looking in perspective at the whole conspiracy.

549
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,260
From a vantage point several steps back.

550
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,700
From the big screen.

551
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,600
From the circular monster.

552
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
They all begin to look the same.

553
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,860
It's a big vice.

554
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,860
With radical and reactionary rioters forming the bottom half.

555
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,080
And a fake establishment at the top half.

556
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,380
And the earth itself is being squeezed in between.

557
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,320
With both subgeniuses and humans getting all smushed up together.

558
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,740
The humans don't seem to mind.

559
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,700
But what's bad is the nature of the things.

560
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:20,700


561
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,980
The things that are using the big vice.

562
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,900
Every political group claims that under them the people will run things.

563
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,580
But when the people find out what's really going on.

564
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
They'll just run.

565
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,600
It wouldn't be so bad if the manipulators were at least human.

566
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,180
If they were at least bipeds.

567
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,480
Now before I say this let me tell you this.

568
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,680
I didn't vote for neither one of them.

569
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,400
One day in the not too distant future.

570
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,560
You funny Americans that play that old funny unethical game.

571
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,260
That goes to the polls with pride and dignity.

572
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,460
And stoop to the lowness of always voting for the lesser of the two evils.

573
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,960
It looks like somewhere that funny history ain't too far back.

574
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,700
That's how them Germans got in trouble.

575
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,040
And let Hitler and them Nazis slip up on them.

576
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,560
And y'all go with pride.

577
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:20,660


578
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,440
And dignity.

579
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,480
The forces exist without definite form.

580
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,020
But only with an intention.

581
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,640
And a thirst to gain form.

582
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,660
To take on life.

583
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,520
We are what gives them shape.

584
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,000
It is an energy we possess.

585
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,400
Slack.

586
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:49,320
That they vampirize in order to lock their non-materiality onto our material world.

587
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:58,840
Their natural energy stems from nothing less than the fitful dreams of the Elder Gods.

588
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:09,560
And except for top brass, most of our military has no idea that the country is run by puppets

589
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,600
kept dancing by inhuman hands from above.

590
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,320
That the line of control goes upward.

591
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:34,600
Behind each bigwig in the smoke-filled boardrooms of the conspiracy's New York bunkers is a shadowy consultant telling him how to deal his cards.

592
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:44,280
And while the human insiders may squabble among themselves, the men in black behind them work as one.

593
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,140
Bob knows.

594
00:32:46,140 --> 00:33:01,000
Bob has sat in on their calm, civilized get-togethers and noticed that the slightest ghastly murmuring from one of these creatures is enough to make a senator break into a cold sweat.

595
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,540
A prime minister suddenly changes tune.

596
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,820
A CIA operative inexplicably decide not to give the complete report.

597
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,120
And when the migraine machine is activated in the brain, the brain is completely paralyzed.

598
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,120


599
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:28,580
And in those boardrooms, all arguments with the plan are cut short faster than Darth Vader's mind beams can stoke a death car, Captain.

600
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,040
That's not true.

601
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:40,900
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

602
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,100
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1912, the subgenius theology of the apocalypse is a vision of the apocalypse.

603
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,100


604
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:08,920
The evolution of this verse from Scylla,qualified their duty by part of уже died for a long time to save the human race.

605
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:08,960
The

606
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,760
Nevada

607
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:10,400
I

608
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,360
Digital

Network

derecho

611
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,080
ف

612
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,740
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

613
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,460
I'm Midnight Ramble.

614
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,160
All Midnight Rambles faces are not black.

615
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,800
What's at harm is as black as midnight.

616
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,220
I'm talking to you.

617
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,440
Oh, yes, dear friends.

618
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,540
It looks like someone's ready to fall victim to our little plan here.

619
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,880
No, I think that Gary has mysterious...

620
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
Oh, could this be Gary?

621
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,320
Is this Gary?

622
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,420
Hello!

623
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,620
Who's this?

624
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,400
It's Professor.

625
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm Mickey Grant.

626
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,840
Now, how many copies of Book of the Subgenius were you able to distribute, Professor Grant?

627
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,000
39500 Bob Davison.

628
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,520
You released?

629
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,660
Hello?

630
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

631
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:23,600


632
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,320
That's a crank call.

633
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,800
Excuse me, Professor Grant.

634
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
We had the conspiracy trying to break in there.

635
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,720
I know, I know.

636
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,940
It's all the Deng Xiaoping friends.

637
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,560
They always interrupt and cause trouble.

638
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,240
We got 25,000 distributed in a land journal.

639
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:41,780
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

640
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


641
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


642
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


643
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:41,780


644
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:48,640
And in June, we got another 10,000 books out.

645
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,080
They're kind of confused.

646
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,560
Most of them were Muslims, like I said.

647
00:35:52,660 --> 00:36:01,300
I explained to them that Bob Dobbs was a latter-day Muhammad, and they said, oh, hi-ho, hi-ho!

648
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,680
Oh, yes, dear friends.

649
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,680
In case you're totally confused, this is actually a call from our fellow minister who just returned

650
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,600
from the tour of China.

651
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,500
Yes, and our...

652
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:11,760
And our...

653
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:11,760


654
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:11,760


655
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,600
Member in China, Xia Li, is so excited.

656
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,200
I played him the last broadcast, and he's doing much research and talking with the people.

657
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,240
You must remember the people.

658
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,600
He is distributing literature, taking his very life in hand.

659
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,920
Oh, that's Tai Pan.

660
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,000
Li Jing, the Pope of all China, Dr. Grant is referring to, friends.

661
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,080
And this is serious work.

662
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,380
I mean, when you spread the word of Bob in China...

663
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,740
399, oh, 404, do you realize?

664
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,920
No, we won't.

665
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,780
No, we won't.

666
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,480
They can't be released.

667
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,260
Oh, they keep interrupting to stop the broadcast.

668
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,260
All the way from China, their arm reaches out!

669
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:58,320
Friends, this is the first long-distance calls KANON has ever received from the mainland China.

670
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,800
Friends, we need more martyrs for the church.

671
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,860
If you live in a communist country...

672
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,220
They're reaching out all the way in the U.S. to interrupt and stop all of our work!

673
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,240
And the men in black are working right alongside him.

674
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,740
The whole country is watching.

675
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


676
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


677
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


678
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


679
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


680
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


681
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:11,740


682
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,440
The whole time.

683
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,040
Yes, evil aliens in the form of subversive men in black

684
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,400
are infiltrating Earth, secretly preparing for a takeover of our planet.

685
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm a man.

686
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,840
It's true.

687
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,580
They're even on the Great Wall.

688
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,580
They use the Great Wall as a guidepost to land their ships.

689
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,380
All those sinister men's in black.

690
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,060
The Great Wall spells welcome in the simple alien tongue.

691
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,240
Oh, yes, friends.

692
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,960
Oh, my gosh, they've completely cut us off.

693
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm afraid there's only one thing to do in a case like that.

694
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:53,780
But the other one with the evil face,

695
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,100
he looks like a Nazi.

696
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,920
He's a Nazi.

697
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,860
Did he have on a uniform?

698
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,780
Yes, yes.

699
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,980
Did they have faces?

700
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,500
Like other people?

701
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,160
His eyes are slant.

702
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,800
Angels don't have any emotions.

703
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,640
Doesn't make them any difference either way.

704
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,800
All they're programmed to do is what God tells them to do.

705
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,540
And they'll hearken only to the voice of the Lord Almighty God.

706
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,720
And they are sent to be servants.

707
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,260
They are sent to be...

708
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,340
To be...

709
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,660
Slave and servant to the heirs of salvation.

710
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,100
Ministering spirits.

711
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,460
Sent to minister for those who shall be heirs unto salvation.

712
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,620
Let us note in passing that the true symbol of the conspiracy,

713
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,100
the eye in the pyramid,

714
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,940
was presented to Thomas Jefferson by a mysterious man in black.

715
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:08,400
The actual emblem for the conspiracy is a plastic spoon, fork, and knife.

716
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,560
Partially crossed in an ill travesty of the Christian cross death sign.

717
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,940
The reason for this stupid logo?

718
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,880
Plastic, because that's the nature of it all.

719
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,860
The eating utensils, because they eat us.

720
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,440
The men in black are cannibals.

721
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,780
Not so much in the sense of devouring human flesh,

722
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,140
for they do that only on special occasions.

723
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,980
But in the sense that they consume our energy.

724
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,380
The men in black die.

725
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,520
They do eat human flesh as often as possible.

726
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,020
And they draw off our psychic juices.

727
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,000
And they're small timers compared to their masters.

728
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,660
And all the angels of God will begin to work and intercede and operate

729
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,780
and look under the affairs around it.

730
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,440
I mean they'll begin to work in every direction.

731
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,940
They don't sleep either.

732
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,300
They're not emotional.

733
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,380
Angels don't...

734
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,140
They don't have any emotion.

735
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,100
All they're programmed to do is what God tells them to do.

736
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,880
And they'll hearken only to the voice of the Lord Almighty God.

737
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,840
The Bible says your angel will not forgive you.

738
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,740
They don't have to come here from heaven.

739
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,580
The Bible said they're all sent forth.

740
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,060
They're all already here.

741
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,860
You've got to have substantial proof or you're just another nut.

742
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Friends, you hear what he said?

743
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,380
You're just another nut.

744
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,500
Unless you've got the secret file.

745
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,120
While we're on, I must say the divival last night at the Fantasy Fair was a resounding success.

746
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,420
I had to carry bags of money out of there.

747
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,180
Some of it was a tad burnt.

748
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,340
But, you know, we had to make certain sacrifices to the gods before we can keep it all.

749
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,840
Who are we talking to on the phone right here?

750
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,580
This is Saint St. DeBrien.

751
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,240
Oh good.

752
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,800
Well, you...

753
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
You called back then, didn't you?

754
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah, yeah.

755
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,160
Good for you.

756
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,500
I'm here with Pope Robert de Bob, the Pope on the Rope.

757
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,740
We're here with the 69th Impervious Narcoleptic Church of the Blistered Screaming Hooter of Bob.

758
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:20,700
Excellent.

759
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,560
Praise God.

760
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,840
You had something about the men in black.

762
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,580
Let me have that again.

763
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,180
Okay.

764
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,580
Well, I'm here to tell you, friends, about how the men in black are taking over our minds by filling us up with factoids.

765
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,120
Little bits of useless information that can do nothing for us.

766
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,720
Because, friends, how awful.

767
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,660
How often have you sat and stared, loose-jawed and mumbling, into that cyclopean's cathode ray slack vacuum,

768
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:52,800
and awakened to find that six hours had passed, the hours and minutes sucked into the polished, colorful void of TV land like a camp accident of Brenda Vaccaro?

769
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,120
Where did that time go?

770
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,800
Where was your time control then, friends?

771
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:04,720
And how often have you been forced to spend seven hours in a cramped and mind-numbing room with dozens of pink normals,

772
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,700
adding and indicting the peaceful strains of the night?

773
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,140
And the screams of Lionel Richie falling gently like the silk teddy on a soup commercial model?

774
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:19,560
And again, you wait to find that the hours have disappeared and your time spent, but nothing is different from before.

775
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,700
But is it? Has nothing changed?

776
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,660
Oh, you poor, poor lost soul.

777
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,360
You're barreling down the slackless freeway that conspiracies set you on,

778
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,500
careening wildly past the JoJo's and fern bars where more false slack is readily available

779
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,680
and clearer $4 bottles of clout.

780
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,720
And you're a grown-up, an individual servings of unsweetened sugar.

781
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,180
You're losing your soul, brother, and you'll probably never miss it till it's gone.

782
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,580
But wait, you say. I'm a pretty bright guy.

783
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,580
I keep up on the world around me. I know what's going on, right?

784
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,200
Oh, son, you're lost and don't even know it.

785
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,620
And why? How did the cons suck your soul out and leave you a used, discarded condom?

786
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,740
It was easy, friend. They stole your ability to dream.

787
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,720
And that was simple, too.

788
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,040
They pumped you full of factoids until there was nothing left but what they filled you up with.

789
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,020
And just what are these factoids?

790
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,600
Well, friends, let me tell you a little story.

791
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,460
Before the dawn of man, when we were all naturally asleep,

792
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,340
our universes suffused with thictoids, the amino acids of the imagination.

793
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,260
We lived dreams, we breathed fantasies, we nocturnally emitted freshets of fancy.

794
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,560
And after the rude awakening,

795
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,140
consumption of thictoids dropped off dramatically, as illustrated on this chart.

796
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,940
Can you see this in the back row?

797
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,860
Oh, yeah. Hold it up higher. I can't see it.

798
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,260
So what happened?

799
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,360
Give me my glasses.

800
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,840
The conspiracists found a way to capture those thictoids that make life bearable

801
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,000
and twist them to their own enslaving purpose.

802
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,540
They codified them into an art which they can control.

803
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,420
No heads can roll in the Iliad without the sappy moral instruction of virtue.

804
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,660
No boffin the queen without progenerating a noble city.

805
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,860
In short, no basic fun without a lesson.

806
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,380
And yet we bought it until the conspiracy came up with something even more insidious.

807
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,200
Facts.

808
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,200
You can't dispute the facts, they'd tell us, because facts are immutable.

809
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,340
They're how the world is.

810
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,240
But they forgot that eventually we'd find out what the facts really were and we'd seize control.

811
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,340
What happened then was obvious.

812
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,020
They panicked.

813
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,420
If they couldn't keep the facts from us, they'd lose control.

814
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,380
What could they do?

815
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,480
Friends, don't believe for a moment that the black boys are stupid.

816
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,220
They saw the way clearly.

817
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,120
They can't kill the facts.

818
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,820
They can't completely control fictions.

819
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,340
So the conspiracy is drowning them all with something more powerful than spermacidal douches,

820
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,780
more insidious than crabs, and more palatable than Coca-Cola.

821
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,020
What is it?

822
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,800
Friends, the conspiracy is pumping us with factoids.

823
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,880
The very stuff of infotainment.

824
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,480
The lip gloss on Vanna White.

825
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,360
None of those people on that are timely to the truth.

826
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
What do you mean?

827
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:03,100
What are you saying?

828
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,780
What are you saying?

829
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,560
I think that, wouldn't that, uh, factoids, didn't that come from Norman Mailer about how

830
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,520
he wrote a book about how he made it with Marilyn Monroe?

831
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,800
Yeah, exactly.

832
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,140
The news about Gavin McCloud and fights between Linda Evans and Joan Collins.

833
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:16,680
Right.

834
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,160
Yeah.

835
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,220
Ed McMahon's laugh.

836
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,400
They're cable TV millionaires and they don't exist.

837
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,120
Yeah.

838
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,360
Well, thanks a lot.

839
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,080
And thanks a lot for that insight into the men in black, if indeed that was insight into

840
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,680
the men in black.

841
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,360
And we've got a little bit more.

842
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,540
Right.

843
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,640
More up.

844
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:39,700
It's being aggravated to start a war that will put a stumbling block in the way of a

845
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,900
further development to save the first third dimensional door.

846
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:51,340
If the Air Force does have a UFO on their hands, where would they hide it?

847
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,920
This hour, Mr. Secretary.

848
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,640
All right.

849
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,400
Where are we, Bob?

850
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,020
The code is broken.

851
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:57,920
Trouble?

852
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,540
Big.

853
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,660
Security?

854
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,520
I have the code.

855
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,600
I'll take it off for me.

856
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,040
The lid on tight.

857
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,960
Well, take it off for me.

858
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,680
The message is Mars needs women.

859
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,480
Mars needs.

860
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,020
It's a gag.

861
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,260
It's a prank.

862
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,080
It's a fake.

863
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,980
I don't think so, sir.

864
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,800
The door will be saved in time, Bob.

865
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,960
Yeah.

866
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,260
Yeah.

867
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,080


868
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,620
I don't think so, sir.

869
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,340
I don't think so, sir.

870
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,320
Yeah.

871
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,380
Well, that's a little bit more than a radio.

872
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,020
Be careful.

873
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,160


874
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,380
Okay.

875
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,260
Bye.

876
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:10,860
Bye.

877
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


878
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


879
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


880
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:10,860


881
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,120


882
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:11,120


883
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:11,280
Bye.

884
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,980
Bye.

885
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:31,120
I like things to be like that.

886
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,680
Things and people can't always be the same.

887
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,640
Hello, I'm a Martian. I hope I speak your language.

888
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,640
This is a recording.

889
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,160
Take me to your leader.

890
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,960
And the ancient Hebrews didn't think it was so funny either

891
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,420
when huge, noisy heliopters abducted and brainwashed Ezekiel and Elijah,

892
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,640
rained diseased frogs on the Egyptians, and turned rivers to blood.

893
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,480
In fact, much of the time they mistook them for Yahweh's angels,

894
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:17,860
just as today's holy rollers mistake demonic possession for the spirit of Jesus.

895
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:28,080
The men in black appeared to Abraham to tell him that his barren, aged wife Sarah would bear children, Genesis 18.

896
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:39,120
Later in Genesis, one of these beings, disguised as an angel, wrestled with Jacob and put his hip out of joint just by touching it.

897
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,540
The Watchers manipulate people and nations in many ways.

898
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,960
The crudest ones drink.

899
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,140
Some drag people into their saucers and hypnotize them.

900
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:09,400
Others work through dreams, telepathy, seances, automatic writing, Ouija boards, blank recording tape, and microwave beams of pink light used to brain-rape their victims.

901
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,080
I was in one place and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room where nobody was listening to me.

902
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,960
Well, our most persistent caller of the night, the Watchers, said,

903
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,420
Gary's on the line.

904
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,840
Are you Gary?

905
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,180
Yeah, I'm Gary.

906
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,540
Okay, Gary, you got a book called what?

907
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,200
Clear Intent.

908
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,640
Okay, let's have some details about the men in black, Gary. Come on, fire it at us.

909
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,860
Well, I've just started reading the book, but I can say one thing.

910
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,260
There was a wave of UFO sightings that occurred during the 70s at military bases.

911
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,540
70% of UFO sightings occur at military bases.

912
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,080
They've been doing all sorts of insidious stuff, and you can believe they're trying to cover it up.

913
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,380
The government don't know what's going on, or do they know what's going on? No one really knows.

914
00:49:53,660 --> 00:50:00,400
I think they're just a little part of what's going on. Remember, Gary, it's one conspiracy.

915
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:14,280
You know, you could say, okay, Coke is in Red China and Pepsi's in Russia because the Republicans put the concession in Russia and the Democrats put it in Red China.

916
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,380
It's all one conspiracy.

917
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,080
Yeah, I believe that.

918
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,800
All right.

919
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,640
Praise Bob, Gary.

920
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,380
Praise Bob.

921
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,340
Thanks for keeping trying to call us back.

922
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,260
We've had a rugged night.

923
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,620
Okay.

924
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:23,840
Praise.

925
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,320
The men in black don't want us to tell the truth.

926
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,780
Millions of people have been contacted, and every single one gets a different story.

927
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:35,540
But what if the stories which the contactees remember are just decoy strategies?

928
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,540
We're not here to destroy.

929
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,080
We are here to employ.

930
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,860
Hello?

931
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,500
Hello?

932
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,420
Yes, dear brother.

933
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,920
How can you hate us in our quest for forbidden knowledge?

934
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,420
I just called to say I am one of the men in black.

935
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,140
Oh, we always get excited!

936
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,660
They're all Bob or they're really the men in black or they're really Jehovah's God.

937
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,160
Ha ha!

938
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,060
Hey, but it's true!

939
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,860
It's true!

940
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,960
Yeah, I'll prove it real quick!

941
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,020
Alright, I've been watching you staying and you too, naked.

942
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,240
How would you like a nice FBI investigation?

943
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,660
Bobby has an emergency, 828-9500, will you please...

944
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,200
No, operator, that's a... Please make that guy pay.

945
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,300
Sir?

946
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:53,700
Make that guy pay. I want that guy's number and I want it on my desk in the morning.

947
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,260
I don't want that guy on the line.

948
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:00,920
Praise Bob!

949
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,600
Praise, praise, praise!

950
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,460
Millions of people have been contacted and every single one gets a different story.

951
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:16,260
But what if the stories which the contactees remember are just decoy strategies?

952
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,600
What if the men in black are inflicting some unknown kind of subliminal brainwashing,

953
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:30,600
with all of these people getting the same instructions implanted secretly, all to be triggered at once, at some crucial time?

954
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,580
Say, just before the X-ist leaves?

955
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:44,220
Or are we being set up for the sudden unleashing of an army of crazed, gun-toting Manchurian candidates?

956
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:51,740
Is this perhaps what the Christian rapture means, which the fighting Jesus never discussed?

957
00:52:52,600 --> 00:53:01,680
If the scales dropped from our eyes for a moment, my friends, would we see a sky swarming with demonic entities?

958
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,520
Yes.

959
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:11,740
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, and it wasn't really a dream, until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

960
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,160
And suddenly it all came back to me.

961
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,520
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life,

962
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,400
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me, and made me talk.

963
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,080
And talk. I'll talk tonight. And talk.

964
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,300
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

965
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:38,680
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

966
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,440
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

967
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:48,180
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

968
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:55,620
No time could do as he chose.

969
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:02,080
In one time, he could extend his finger down into the world of man,

970
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:09,040
and his swan-tons swirling around as we would stir up a cold fishbowl,

971
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,600
causing events which no man can explain.

972
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:16,960
Yucca Teasma!

973
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,740
Far.

974
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,860
Yucca Teasma!

975
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,360
Far.

976
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,020
Say, uh, you want some of this Mary Yucca Teasma, partner?

977
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,960
Yes, she's hungry. I'll get the peanut one by the way.

978
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,660
Perhaps the ugliest aspect of the whole business

979
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:45,600
is that the human conspiracy aids and abets them whenever possible.

980
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:52,260
These sick traitors to Earth are operating on the same string of promises Hitler was.

981
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,160
That if they play along,

982
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,000
the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow of hell

983
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:06,480
would make them lords over a new race of Aryan super-normals.

984
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,900
Of course, oil sheiks are told it will be Arab super-normals,

985
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,140
and African despots are told it will be African super-normals, and so on.

986
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,320
Deep inside the hollow Earth, in Hitler's library,

987
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:22,060
yes, he still lives, or at least his head does,

988
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,040
there exists a book called Beware of Bob.

989
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,000
For the Church has been fighting the war

990
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,400
against these creatures since Admiral Byrd discovered the entrance

991
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,900
to their domain at the Pole.

992
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,160
And so we find that there are two groups of supernatural teams

993
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,120
exerting influence on the bovine, pliable minds of humans.

994
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,380
The Watchers are the silence group,

995
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,840
attempting to smother our potential to evolve,

996
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,720
and carrying the basic message of lay off.

997
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,720
Our rivals, Jehovah One's shock group,

998
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,240
are saying, get ready!

999
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,980
Trying, in a sense, to condition us to the idea that we are not alone.

1000
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:16,180
One is a cosmic infection, the other a cosmic inoculation.

1001
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,120
Somebody's faith is being tested,

1002
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:29,280
and the stark fist of removal is raised in judgment,

1003
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,100
poised for a great evacuation,

1004
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,800
a movement, an elimination, and a wiping

1005
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,680
from the face of the Earth.

1006
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,760
Not to be confused with the Rapture, which is a minor thing.

1007
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,580
Some geniuses do it nightly.

1008
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,260
They rapture in their sleep,

1009
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:49,880
and in the morning are raised incorruptible, yet changed.

1010
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,700
But then, the Rapture might be for real,

1011
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,980
but more like Night of the Living Dead.

1012
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,360
Some geniuses leading the living in battle against these heathen,

1013
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,700
false Christian golems,

1014
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,740
because Rapture is from the same root word as rape.

1015
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,460
Oh, hear ye, ye of the deaf ear!

1016
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,440
The Lord saith, Heads up!

1017
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,800
And the people will feel the lash of the thousand scourges

1018
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,560
of the tribulations, even, yea, lo!

1019
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,320
Verily unto the final rapture

1020
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,820
of the equilibrium of the scales of time,

1021
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,680
Omicron Epsilon,

1022
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,640
the vision beholding itself.

1023
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,640
Repent, ye mockers!

1024
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,560
Elijah puffeth scornfully on his pipe, though he smileth.

1025
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,960
Wake up! Get off your butt!

1026
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,880
The Church of the Subgenius heals ruined members of a crumbling society,

1027
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,500
and you'll laugh all the way to the fully equipped biohazard bunker

1028
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,660
when Bob lets you in on the real joke.

1029

There's also the Internet.

1047
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,600
And, the Internet is a place where you should

1048

always be speaking of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1049
