1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call the advent of the angelic host.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,840
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world, only his predictions are just a little different.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:38,280
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact, the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them, will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses, the true believer subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,480
And believe it or not, plenty of people, 4,000 of them so far and more every day, have already joined up.

5
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,040
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,400
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

7
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,000
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,340
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,440
Remember now, it's no surprise, if I should be found dead someday, I'll think that you were in the way.

10
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,400
Oh, gimme Bob.

11
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,080
Confusing that face.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,180
With my own.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,660
Can't remember my place.

14
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,820
Bob's Rude.

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:31,340
My role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,900
When the men from Planet X arrive.

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,780
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous, it may sound ridiculous to many believers out there.

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,520
Are you saying they're all nuts, all those people?

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,300
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,940
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbund.

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,820
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,520
Evil stalks them.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,740
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,140
So they come down in flying saucers.

25
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,700
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

26
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,580
We don't know what to do.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
We're here all alone.

28
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,780
The planets are fading.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,240
The blood is running.

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,040
The lights were fading.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,720
And they stalked us one by one.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,440
Okay.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,840
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,380
FRIENDSHOP!

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,100
Are we controlled by secret forces?

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,700
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,280
Do people think you're strange?

38
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Do you?

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,760
Then you may be on the right track.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,080
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

41
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,820
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:50,820


43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,020
Kill me!

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,360
Kill me!

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,400
Kill me!

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,980
Kill me!

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,480
Kill me!

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,100
Kill me!

49
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,260
Kill me!

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,840
Kill me!

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:01,840


52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,320
Goodbye.

53
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,660
Goodbye.

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,420
Goodbye.

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,460
Goodbye, Earth.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
Night, little monkeys in your cage.

57
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,780
Night, night.

58
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,920
All your great skyscrapers, your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries,

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,520
discoveries, your symphonies, your armies, your concentration camps, all of it was for nothing.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,600
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries, your mini-

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:41,720
As a wink, a tiny spark, dying ember in the middle of thousands and billions of light years of empty, cold space.

62
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,520
Glowing, stinky hole in your third eye.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
You are about as important as a cork in the ocean, my friend.

64
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,280
Think of a cockroach, if you would.

65
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,500
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long, but just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.

66
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,700
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird exes, archons, whatever the hell they are.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,280
They don't notice you. They don't care about you.

68
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,280
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,460
But don't think you're some kind of a big deal just because God or some-

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,440
Aliens happen to pick you up by the scruff of your neck and show you a thing or two.

71
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,960
They're in there with you. They're in the room with you.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,280
You can't see them. You can't smell them. You can't taste them.

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:43,000
But they're in the room with you and they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the pono rack, with the- with the digital- with everything.

74
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,360
And with the airwaves.

75
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:57,660
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,600
But it's the only way we can stop them.

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,420
The human mind. The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,560
It has no way of converting this knowledge or energy into a practical use.

79
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,320
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way, the ability to transmit it.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,040
And convert and receive radio signals.

81
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,880
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.

82
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,080
They are our correspondence with a world you could never fathom.

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:44,640
It's square to your round. It's cheesy to your musky. It's black to your white. It's green to your red. It's out of focus to your sharp image.

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,040
To the rat in the cheese. The cheese.

85
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,580
The cheese is the universe.

86
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,380
Do the rat, baby. Do it one more time.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,220
Everybody love to watch it go down. Do the rat. Do the rat. Do the rat.

88
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,220
There are more things in this cheese than your little science has ever dreamt of, Mickey.

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:17,660
I've been stuck here for so long. Just wondering when it's gonna end. When it's gonna blow up. When this sun is gonna go nova.

90
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,720
I just wanna know.

91
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,700
Could that be what's happening today? If you think X day was just Bob's way of saying, well, it's just aliens or something.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,520
Don't feel bad that God's gonna supernova your sun unexpectedly for no particular reason. No special timing.

93
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,580
Just happen to do it around the time Bob said something what's gonna happen.

94
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,380
It's nice you let us know around the time, because, you know, if we was more godlike, we could have made our plans accordingly. But...

95
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,980
It's kinda like we... We're kinda like the old dog that just got too sick and we... You take the old dog out in the woods, you go,

96
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,140
Here, old dog. Here's a big ol' hunk of raw meat. Mmm, isn't that good?

97
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:10,860
And when that dog turns around to gum that raw meat, you pull out your .45 and blow his poor, pathetic, old doggy brains out, because it's the kindest thing to do.

98
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,920
Is that what our planet is? That old dog?

99
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,020
Is...

100
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,360
Are we that old dog just being put out to play?

101
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,360


102
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Is that what our planet is?

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,000
Is our planet just being made a pasture, put out on the ice, flows toothless to fend for itself or go under?

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,980
Is it?

105
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,600
Is our planet... to... Is our planet being sent off to the rest home?

106
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,220
Yeah, like everything's gotta have its time and go. Maybe our time already came and went, and we didn't even know it.

107
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,800
All things must pass.

108
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,300
We was laughin' and playin' them Dionysian dances by the old Greek riverside.

109
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,160
Them were the days.

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,040
Jumping through hoops and wrestling with bears.

111
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,180
And then we invented hydrogen energy and decided to blow us up some bombs and have tooth decay.

112
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,460
And then have tooth decay.

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,180
And then before we knew it, nobody knew the truth.

114
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,820
Nobody was well anymore.

115
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,420
Nobody was even really alive.

116
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,900
They were just going, going, going.

117
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,420
We thought we had the ultimate weapon.

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Turned out God had it all along.

119
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,920
We thought we were going to hold a gun to our own head and we didn't even get the chance.

120
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,120
No, we thought we were so prideful.

121
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,800
We thought we could destroy ourselves.

122
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Mother Nature showed us what for.

123
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,120
Hey, you boys think you can wreck your environment with them factories and bombs?

124
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,800
Let me show you a thing or two.

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,540
Here, I'll just spit this little spit wad into that sun thing.

126
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,300
That little light bulb you got lighting you up.

127
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,180
Look very calmly and clearly at the question, Mr. Pavilion.

128
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,700
Counting down the minutes to the end of the solar system.

129
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,360
What you usually think of first in a situation like this is who benefits?

130
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,540
Earth first.

131
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,020
Who takes all?

132
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,100
There's a power play going on.

133
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,420
The sun's getting bigger.

134
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,540
It's getting weirder.

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,140
It's getting flatter and longer.

136
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,040
More sideways and more everything.

137
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,600
It's not.

138
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,700
You know, Mars will probably be real tropical in about three hours.

139
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,680
If we could get to Mars in about three hours, it would probably be real nice.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,680
But then by the time we got there, Pluto would be getting all tropical and we'd have to get there.

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
Pluto, man.

142
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,240
And then.

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,880
Oh, yeah.

144
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,780
There's going to be like.

145
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,420
I don't know.

146
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,340
He's on Pluto and you'd be.

147
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,760
I don't know if I got enough rocket motors for Pluto.

148
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
Yeah, that's the thing.

149
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:18,740
I don't know.

150
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,880
We're going to be able to make it.

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,100
No academy of the planet.

152
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,840
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

153
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,140
Blarzo, you have earned this.

154
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
What about.

155
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,320
What about this reputed Jesus Starfleet that was supposed to have shown up.

156
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,740
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlock into the colony.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,920
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,060
What a space ovation.

159
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
Now let's wheel another.

160
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,420
Now in celebration of this great occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

161
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,620
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will have a great time.

162
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,920
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in outer space.

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,680
Bob.

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,760
X day shall come sooner or later.

165
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,480
That X is nothing but a cross that's fallen over on its side and somebody jumped on it.

166
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,600
Banged it up.

167
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,760
There is hope.

168
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,140
There shall be hope.

169
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,820
You know.

170
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,440
We sit and worry, oh gosh, if only the X's had come.

171
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,980
We could have had a new government where Bob was the leader and since he's never around there'd be no laws and we could do anything we want.

172
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,480
We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday and watch boring crap,

173
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,620
you'd go to church Saturday night and get drunk.

174
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Drunk muffin.

175
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,120
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness blah blah blah blah blah.

176
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,640
Friends, what are we waiting for?

177
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:19,620
Are we really waiting on some invisible monsters in the sky or some space things or some pipe smoking salesman with a good line?

178
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,320
Friends, I say quit waiting.

179
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,180
Do it yourself.

180
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Make your own slack.

181
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,920
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

182
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,940
You must learn to think for yourself but only Bob can show you how.

183
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,100
Question authority or else.

184
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,100


185
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,100


186
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,100


187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,100


188
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,100


189
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,880
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

190
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,520
Praise fucking Bob.

191
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,300
Hey, what's going on?

192
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:00,040
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack and a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

193
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:08,100
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and Andy reached the sky,

194
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,100
reaches the men from Planet X, the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

195
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,380
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
They're going to...

197
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:28,920
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

198
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:36,580
And only the subgenii, the dues paying, book buying, receipt in the pocket paid in full to the church subgenii,

199
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,120
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,420
The rest of them?

201
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,180
It's a tough world, Jack.

202
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,840
That's right, friends.

203
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,520
A red letter day.

204
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,900
Yes, a red letter day.

205
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,380


206
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:55,720
And it is July 5th, year 2001.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,780
What a delightful day.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,320
And there the gigantic flying saucers come down out of the blue sky...

209
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,940
They certainly are beautiful.

210
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,560
...to pick up the happy-go-lucky subgenius.

211
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,260
...the subgeniuses...

212
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,420
...collecting the hills...

213
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,520
...and their pets...

214
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,020
...bluebirds...

215
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,940
...and all their worldly goods...

216
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,580
...and swallows...

217
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,840
...because, friends, you can take it with you when you're a subgenius, sure.

218
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,780
A throne of gold can be yours.

219
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,040
You can take off and get it on with...

220
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,060
And Dave here, who will be your driver throughout our space.

221
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,420
Step in. Step in, please.

222
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,480
Stand clear of the closing door.

223
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,600
Step in, please.

224
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,980
Stand clear of the closing door.

225
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,220
Red line, please, only.

226
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
Blue line to the left.

227
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,840
Red line to the right.

228
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,420
Hey, hey.

229
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:48,860
Welcome, and we'll be embarking for, well, wherever these escape vessels escape to.

230
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,080
No one's ever asked, and we're not telling.

231
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,820
What's gonna happen to your children?

232
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,360
What's gonna happen to your children?

233
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,860
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created...

234
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,460
...when this society we've created...

235
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,820
...air conditioners...

236
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,880
...air conditioners...

237
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,760
...station wagons with wooden sides...

238
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,280
...station wagons with wooden sides...

239
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,080
...they're cautious, indeed.

240
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,680
...a retired actor...

241
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,800
...orange mail, between a politician...

242
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,200
...orange mail...

243
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,660
What happens when that collapses?

244
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,020
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

245
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,400
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

246
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,980
That's when the man from Planet X-9...

247
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius...

248
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,460
...I'm down to save the members of the subgenius journey.

249
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,120
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

250
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,140
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

251
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,740
Friends and neighbours are flying.

252
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,960
Earth. I come to you from a long, long ways off. I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

253
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,920
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours. I hate them with all my heart.

254
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,660
They are inhuman and to be destroyed. What is your objective? You are not ready, but we will still save you.

255
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,360
I'll be right here.

256
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:19,700
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars. Now, this man was invisible to me, except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

257
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,780
By 1998, every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin,

258
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,640
traitor,

259
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,720
freaky, and hippie is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

260
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,960
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

261
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:47,760
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism. Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

262
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,400
Perhaps. Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

263
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
Such a forewarning

264
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:57,640
of the world is not enough.

265
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:57,640


266
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,000
The ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

267
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,100
But for the fact that many of Nostradamus' other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

268
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,500
But the old ones are coming back.

269
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm going to let them through.

270
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:26,020
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

271
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,720
Do I surprise you?

272
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,600
A little, yes.

273
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:32,500
Hmm.

274
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,540
We weren't always like this.

275
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,740
After the moon fell from the sky, the earth could no longer sustain the species.

276
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,260
Some managed to stay above.

277
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,440
The rest of us escaped underground.

278
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,900
Then centuries later, when we tried to re-emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.

279
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:13,040
The vedran Proteus'

280
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,660
are initial cut off.

281
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,000


282
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,000


283
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,520
No.

284
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,500
Killyer is just an abstract.

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,220
Digital.

286
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,660
Our cerebral abilities.

287
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,080
You control their thoughts.

288
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,560
Not just theirs.

289
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,900
Heli.

290
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,220
So it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals?

291
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,320
That's their role here.

292
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,540
To be your food?

293
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,500
Yes.

294
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,860
And for those who are suitable to be breeding vessels for our other colonies.

295
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,440
You see, I am just one of many.

296
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,900
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

297
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
What else could it be?

298
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,760
Frightening as the thought may be, it could happen.

299
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
The sun rises.

300
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,300
It will become dark.

301
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,500
The moon blood red.

302
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,420
The stars of the heavens will fall.

303
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,200
There will be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming.

304
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,120
The islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets.

305
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,280
And the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

306
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,340
It's all coming.

307
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,720
Yes, I'm ready now.

308
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,720
Then close your eyes.

309
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,900
And tap your heels together three times.

310
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,780
And think to yourself.

311
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,100
There's no place.

312
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:46,900
No seemingly.

313
00:18:46,900 --> 00:19:04,100
Where else is it possible to get so Vamos?

314
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:08,620


315
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,240
Well I mean I can.

316
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,380
No much that can innocent people

317
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,460
who love making video games try to get to that limit.

318
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,440
A rare Bob J.R. Bob Dobbs

319
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,200
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air

320
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,000
And the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,920
And the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin

322
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,860
And the grin and the bob

323
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,620
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!

324
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,840
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!

325
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,840
Plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry

326
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,500
With some alien force from outer space

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,260
That seeps into the human body and takes over

328
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,300
What if there is a form of life in space?

329
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,040
Not on some planet, but just drifting

330
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,980
Not life as we know it

331
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,580
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy

332
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,400
With no organic structure, invisible

333
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,220
Invisible?

334
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,800
Now the rocket passed through its path

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,940
It entered the rocket

336
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,240
It found living specimens of our form of life

337
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,500
Cell organisms, humans

338
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,040
Exactly

339
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,920
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures

340
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,480
What about it?

341
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,440
What a way to invade the earth

342
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,780
Now look, sir, I'm not over-intelligent

343
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,600
You saw the film, you know what happened

344
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,960
Holy God knows where and how far that rocket traveled

345
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,560
Something got into that rocket

346
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,480
And it's found other forms of life

347
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,840
The cactus

348
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,540
You mean Kuruza?

349
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,140
The cactus

350
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,800
He's now in the shell of the man being transformed

351
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,820
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation

352
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,860
There could be an affinity, a union between plant and animal

353
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,220
With the ability to destroy

354
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,200
And possess

355
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,600
And not

356
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:54,800
An alien cannot invade a dead man

357
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,780
We're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement

358
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,860
You know, some people say church is subgenius

359
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,480
So they get involved in it and they say

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,680
After about six or seven

361
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,600
They get real involved

362
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,040
They jump into the internet intercourse of the church and so forth

363
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,620
And after about six months they're going

364
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,460
God, this is worse than hospitalization

365
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,700
High school

366
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,220
The popular ones pick on the wimps even worse than in real life

367
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,520
Yes, friend, it is like the high school from hell

368
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, wish you were here alone from hell

369
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,580
Hey, I'll be dancing through the flames

370
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,420
Like a devil in disguise

371
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,580
Yeah, you can hear me sing

372
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,180
But not by sunlight

373
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,680
Yeah, you can hear me sing

374
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,640
Alone from hell

375
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,980
I'm gonna get a lay

376
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,120
And a fire around my neck

377
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,980
Because she ever cares

378
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,940
Oh, hell, what the heck

379
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,300
I'm packing my duds

380
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,180
And I'm high from hell

381
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,680
Oh

382
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,160
Oh

383
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,400
Oh

384
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,040
Oh

385
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh

386
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,020


387
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,280
Oh

388
00:22:43,480 --> 00:23:13,480


389
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:43,480


390
00:23:43,480 --> 00:24:13,480


391
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:13,600
Oh

392
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh

393
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh

394
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,020
Oh

395
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,720
Oh

396
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Oh

397
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,460
Oh

398
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,620
Oh

399
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,880
Oh

400
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,700
Oh

401
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh

402
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,500


403
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh

404
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:34,880


405
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:34,880


406
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:34,980
Oh

407
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


408
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


409
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,520
Oh

410
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:37,540
Oh

411
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:37,700
Oh

412
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:37,920
Oh

413
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,840
Oh

414
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,820
For all the human race

415
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,860
Me me, me me, me me

416
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,220
Me me, me me, me me

417
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,500
Me me, me me, me me

418
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:57,600
Me me, me me, me me

419
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,920
Me me, me me, me me

420
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,160
Me me, me me, me me

421
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,220
Me me, me me, me me

422
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,660
I thought you wanted to see the light of the sun

423
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,600
I thought the world was so dark

424
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,380
I thought there was never a stop

425
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,740
But I followed you out the door

426
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,400
And climbed the ladder down

427
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,620
I saw the Martians on the floor

428
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,060
Dancing in the sand

429
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,100
Me me, me me, me me

430
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,920
Me me, me me, me me

431
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,100
Me me, me me, me me

432
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,360
Me me, me me, me me

433
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,140
You see now I've pushed one man

434
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,400
So I won't surprise

435
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,940
But see the Martians twisting round

436
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,220
For my very life

437
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,360
They did the locomotion

438
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,240
And the honey-conny too

439
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,600
I couldn't win a single bit

440
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,860
Martians don't rule

441
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
They don't steer their horses

442
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,380
They don't do a thing

443
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,380


444
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,380


445
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,380


446
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,380


447
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,680
I just Fraktion Blow theIE

448
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,180
I roll the Hendry

449
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,660
They're goodbye

450
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,160
I fell of a great rock

451
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,440
I'm shitting on the ground

452
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,960
They took me to this vacation ground

453
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,280
The master has to fight

454
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,500
space.

455
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,480
I know he's sitting in there

456
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,920
in the control room now

457
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,840
listening to everything I say

458
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,980
but I really don't care.

459
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,940
We're not going to tell you

460
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,580
what to do.

461
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,820
We're not going to.

462
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,500
We won't do it.

463
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,960
We will not tell you what to do.

464
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,220
That's what the conspiracy does.

465
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,520
You have to decide.

466
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,920
The conspiracy will tell you

467
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,380
what to do.

468
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,620
Bob won't tell you.

469
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,140
We won't tell you what to do

470
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,280
because we only tell you

471
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,940
how to think.

472
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,480
And you will pay to know

473
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,420
what you really think.

474
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,240
You can learn to think

475
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,740
for yourself

476
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,640
but only Bob Dobbs

477
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,820
can show you how.

478
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,680
The earth was bleeding

479
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,240
thick black blood

480
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,820
and it smelled like blood

481
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,900
and it looked like blood.

482
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,700
Oh yeah.

483
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,540
And every day

484
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,900
every day I'd wait for my daddy

485
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,920
to come home from work

486
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
and he'd come into the house

487
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,020
and he'd be all covered

488
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,720
in that thick blood.

489
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,280
Black blood.

490
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,180
He'd have that blood

491
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,840
in his hair.

492
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,880
He'd have that blood

493
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,760
in his clothes.

494
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,720
He'd have that blood

495
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,940
caked around his nails.

496
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,440
He was covered in that blood.

497
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,540
And I'd look up at my daddy

498
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,720
all covered with that blood

499
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,320
and I'd say

500
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,200
Daddy

501
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,320
someday I want to be

502
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,800
just like you.

503
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,800
Uncorrected personality traits

504
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,480
that seem whimsical in a child

505
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,140
may prove to be ugly

506
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,160
in a fully grown adult.

507
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,720
Lack of involvement

508
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,860
with the father

509
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,340
or over-involvement

510
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,300
with the mother

511
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,380
can result in lack of ability

512
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,520
to relate to sexual peace.

513
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,020
And in homosexual leanings

514
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,180
narcissism, transsexuality

515
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,360
curls from the waist up

516
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,480
and from the waist down

517
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,100
attempts to be your own love object.

518
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,840
Reconcile your parents to you

519
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,380
by becoming both at once.

520
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,860
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man

521
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,500
but...

522
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,400
This tends to get overlooked

523
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,880
by our mother fixated

524
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,540
overweight sexist media.

525
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:50,520
So

526
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,420
uncorrected personality traits

527
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,240
that seem whimsical in a child

528
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,920
may prove to be ugly

529
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,020
in a fully grown adult.

530
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,800
If you give in to them

531
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
every time they cry

532
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,040
they will become little tyrants

533
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,880
but they won't remember why.

534
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,980
Then when they are thwarted

535
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:12,720
they will be thwarted.

536
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,500
By people in later life

537
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,580
they will become psychotic

538
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,820
and they won't make an ideal husband or wife.

539
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,280
The spoiled baby grows into

540
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,720
the escapist teenager

541
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,920
who's the adult alcoholic

542
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,680
who's the middle-aged suicide boy.

543
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,000
So uncorrected personality traits

544
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,800
that seem whimsical in a child

545
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,460
may prove to be ugly

546
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,720
in a fully grown adult.

547
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,860
When them saucers come

548
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,180
you're gonna need a clean pair of underwear.

549
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,660

00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,360

551
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,100

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,880
But it won't be an accident

553
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,820
brothers and sisters.

560
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,200

How do you burn?

565
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,700
You will pour tar

566
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,500
in your saving evidence

567
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,000
But all of it's going to burn!

568
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,120
Equivine

569
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,880

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,240
Yes, you mine, you tiny mind!

572
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,660
You're born!

573
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,720


574
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,720


575
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,720


576
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:42,720


577
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,060
All the parts you fall behind, oh no, oh no, oh no!

578
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,100
You're gonna burn!

579
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:01,820
We've got bomb and they don't! And for that we can hate them! Hate them! Hate them!

580
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:13,380
Fire! To destroy all you've done! Fire! To end all you've become!

581
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,220
I'm feeling fine!

582
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,220
You've been living like a little girl

583
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,800
In the middle of your little life

584
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,040
You've been over

585
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,200
Burn your mind, your tiny mind

586
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,920
You know you've really been so blind

587
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,660
Now's your time, burn your mind

588
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,020
You're falling far too far behind

589
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,060
Woooooooo!

The bleeding flesh of the earth

592
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,000
And the broken bones of time

593
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,780
Can I get a praise ball?

594
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,640
Yes!

595
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,060

Into the grave!

600
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,360

00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:56,660


642
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,160
Why? Why? They're afraid to wash their genitals.

643
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,360
They don't want God to think they're masturbating.

00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,960
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

645

They have next day to fear.

650
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,420
I was born to see 2,000 years

651
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,500
A magic page upon the planet

652
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:56,660
I was born to see 2,000 years

653
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,180
Extinction seems to be a plausible risk

654
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,220
Whatever happens, we're a part of a race

655
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:15,400
My God, I've been waiting for this moment

656
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:25,700
Oh, my God, I've been waiting for this moment to come

657
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,640

Thanks, you're well for my years

659
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,040
Singing in the millennium with you

660
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,280

661
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520

662
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,680
Singing in the millennium with you

663
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,120
I've got nothing to worry about.

664
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,540
I could go out and murder 100 people tonight.

665
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,440
Conspiracy's gonna do nothing.

666
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:55,680
I've got nothing to worry about.

667
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,600
I've got my membership card.

668
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,920
Oh, they could give me the death penalty.

669
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,160
But I'll just rise again.

670
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,220
They could give me life in prison.

671
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,520
But their life won't be as long as mine.

672
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,600
I'll outlive them.

673
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,140
After all, they've only got a few months to live.

674
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,220
Bob will come to spring me.

675
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,900
I know he will.

676
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,840
Yeah, brothers and sisters.

But there's not a lot of time remaining for you.

679
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,640
There's not a lot of time remaining for you.

680
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,660
It's just a few months.

681
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,120
A few months away.

682
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,620
Y'all are gonna die.

683
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,060
No church will stand on you.

684
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,200
No church will stand on you.

685
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,720
You're gonna die.

686
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,300
Oh, yeah.

687
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,340
The river is rising, brothers and sisters.

688
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,480
The river is rising.

689
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,640
And you're gonna turn around.

690
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Bob Dobbs and his church of the subchangists

691
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,940
are offering you a personal flotation device.

692
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,520
Yes.

693
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,300
A mighty surfboard of slack

694
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,320
so that you can hang ten

695
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,820
and touch the shagging river.

696
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
Okay.

697
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,620

701
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,060

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,140


704
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,940
Who's going to make those

705
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,520

706
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,840

709
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:17,840


710
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,560

I've been waiting for this moment to come

714
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,120
Oh my God

715
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,960
I've been waiting for this moment to come

716
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,720
Taste the salt of my tears

717

Take it in my body, I'm with you

Ah, hello. It's nice to see you all here.

723
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
Now, as the more perceptive of you probably realize by now,

724
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,780
this is hell.

725
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,260
And I am the devil.

726
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,860
Good evening.

727
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,940
But you can call me Toby, if you like.

728
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,240
We try to keep things informal here,

729
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,840
as well as infernal.

730
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,380
Um, that's just a little joke of mine.

731
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,760
I tell it every time.

732
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,460
Now, you're all here for...

733
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,960
eternity.

734
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,820
Ooh.

735
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,500
Which I hardly need tell you is a heck of a long time.

736
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,960
Um, so you'll all get to know each other pretty well by the end.

737
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,260
But for now, I'm going to have to split you up into groups.

738
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,540
Will you stop screaming?

739
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,980
Now, murderers, murderers, over here, please.

740
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,200
Thank you.

741
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,540
Thank you.

742
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,120
Uh, looters and pillagers, over here.

743
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,280
Thieves, if you could join them.

744
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200
And lawyers, you're in that group.

745
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:03,840


746
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,420
.

747
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,020
Thank you very much.

748
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,920
Uh, fornicators, if you could step forward.

749
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,340
.

750
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,860
My God, there are a lot of you.

751
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,260
Uh, can I split you up into adulterers and the rest.

752
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:24,020
Male adulterers, if you could just form a line in front of that small guillotine in the corner.

753
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,220
.

754
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,720
Okay, um, atheists.

755
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,160
Atheists, over here, please.

756
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,000
You must be feeling a right bunch of nitwit.

757
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,720
.

758
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,920
And finally, Christians.

759
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,280
Christians, ah, yes, I'm sorry, I'm afraid the Jews were right.

760
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,880
.

761
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,820
That'd be really kind, thank you.

762
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,080
Okay, right, well, are there any questions?

763
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,760
Yes.

764
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,500
No, I'm afraid we don't have any toilets.

765
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:53,660
.

766
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,420
Um, if you'd read your Bible, you might have seen that it was damnation without relief.

767
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,500
.

768
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:07,420
So if you didn't go before you came, then I'm afraid you're not going to enjoy yourself very much.

769
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,740
.

770
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,600
But then I believe that's the idea.

771
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:10,260
.

772
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:10,260


773
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,540
.

774
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:11,580
.

775
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,260
.

776
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,780
.

777
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:12,780


778
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,420
.

779
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:36,900
.

780
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,340
.

781
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:39,500
.

782
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,100
.

783
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,540
.

784
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,760
.

785
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,020
.

786
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,100
.

787
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:55,520
.

788
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:14,880
The Two J карren manufacturer ze Yet here.

789
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:14,900


790
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:14,920
.

791
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:14,940
.

792
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:14,960
.

793
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:14,980
.

794
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,000
.

795
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,020
.

796
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


797
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


798
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


799
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


800
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


801
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


802
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


803
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,020


804
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:24,760
The crystals contained a concentration of human steroids and sex hormones, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.

805
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:36,500
The resulting preparations were widely used to boost fertility, increase sexual potency, treat various sexual disorders, and in some cases, even encourage the growth of the beard.

806
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:15,000

807
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:20,100
edited by Potter Nostril, I believe, several years ago.

808
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:26,200
And he was using some recordings of a Dr. Legume rant

809
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,900
that I'm guessing was from the late 90s or early 2000s,

810
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,360
millions, somewhere along in there.

811
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,980
Anyway, yes, it's X Day.

812
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,140
Is it coming?

813
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,620
We've been too busy.

814
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,660
Packing the van to do a show.

815
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,080
But we did 1,000 shows.

816
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,540
Actually, 1,627 shows, I think, already.

817
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:03,900
And we've been using a lot of clips from those many olden shows.

818
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:09,340
Can't even begin to give credits for all of that stuff.

819
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,900
Although, as I said, the last 20 minutes

820
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,000
involved Dr. Legume.

821
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,660
Dr. Legume's ranting and Potter Nostril's editing.

822
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,300
That's almost all we know.

823
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,980
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

824
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,320
Thank you.

825
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,620
See you on the saucers.

826
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,580
We're all extraterrestrials

827
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,160
On a cycle that is ancestral

828
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,140
We're off to see the wizard

829
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,920
On a paradise among the stars

830
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,540
We're all extraterrestrials

831
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,040
Extra!

832
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,200
Extra!

833
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,800


834
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000


835
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000


836
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000


837
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000


838
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,120
You think by now, we'd all be in the mud

839
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,320
10, 9, 8, 7.

840
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,000
And we're off to see the wizard

841
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,000


842
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,460
six five four three two one

843
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:19,720

in my blue suede shoes and my hair was covered with goo

847
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,560
i was listening to my radio and waving all the chicks

848
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,320
when the music stopped and the newsman said

849

You know, I never really got the chance to get in line with your church and help you out.

881
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,260
But I saw something in the afterlife.

882

And I just wanted to sit down and shake your hand and say I'm a real supporter of Bob and whatnot.

I think somebody else wants to meet you.

00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,480
I think Sammy Davies Jr. would like to sit down and have a word with you.

890
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,900
Hey, look, I'll see you later, man.

00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,420
Oh, yeah.

I'm sorry.

903
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,780
I had the wrong table.

904
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,820
Why?

905
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,400
You know, it's great being rich and famous and having.

906
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:35,120
It's only been, what, two hours since 7 a.m.

907
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
The rupture happened.

908
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,220
It happened two hours ago.

909
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,240
And already, I've stuffed my face, masturbated, met Elvis.

910
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,520
I've done all the things I never, ever did before.

911
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,480
More champagne, monsieur?

912
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,700
Oh, thank you.

913
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,200
Thank you.

914
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,700
Hey, what other celebrities are around?

915
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,320
Lenny Bruce?

916
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,000
Happy to be on my planet?

917
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,440
I think Mr. Bruce is in the other room at the bar.

918
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,760
I bet I will go and...

919
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,840
Oh, I'll have to.

920
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,220
Oh, don't bother him.

921
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,100
Don't bother him right now.

922
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,140
No, no, no.

923
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,480
Anything for your pleasure.

924
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,660
It may take a few minutes, but I will bring him, eh?

925
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,560
Wow.

926
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,720
You know, it would have been creepy if Lenny Bruce had just suddenly appeared before I even got to ask.

927
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,240
Hey, you're the guy.

928
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,860
Hey, hey, hey.

929
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,380
You're the guy.

930
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:20,880
You're the guy.

931
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,260
You're the guy.

932
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,640
You're the guy.

933
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,920
You're the guy.

934
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,340
And the first time, I remember, I was the only Jew.

935
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:25,700
Do you remember?

936
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,400
You remember that shtick I did?

937
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,880
I think it was at the Village.

938
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,800
I had no idea.

939
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,440
It was at the Vanguard.

940
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,240
I've got a bootleg of that, man.

941
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,400
The only Jew in Ohio.

942
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,140
Do you remember that shtick?

943
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,600
Yeah, yeah.

944
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,160
That was you.

945
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,360
That was you, man.

946
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,440
I remember that was you all the way because I was there.

947
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,380
I'm in Canton, Ohio.

948
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,560
I'm in Canton, Ohio.

949
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,720
And I drive, it's like a VFW hall or something like that.

950
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,100
That's only four years old?

951
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,720
They drive me out to this VFW hall.

952
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,420
And there are these pictures of, they say it's Bob there.

953
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,080
There's all these pictures of Bob everywhere.

954
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,600
And the next thing you know, I see you're standing there.

955
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,920
Man.

956
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,600
Oh, look, he's shooting up.

957
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,700
Wow.

958
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,420
Do you, can you OD?

959
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,020
By the way, can you OD on the air?

960
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,280
Oh, I guess so.

961
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,160
Bummer.

962
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:17,320
Oh, well, he was just one of the beautiful sex goddesses in the form of one of my heroes, Lenny Bruce.

963
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,440
I'm sorry, monsieur.

964
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,920
Today is monsieur Bruce's birthday.

965
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:24,040
And as you know, he always gets the China white on his birthday.

966
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,680
And we'd have to clean him up.

967
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,580
He'll be right back, perhaps at another time.

968
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,940
Man, that is so cool.

969
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,960
And Elvis is over there singing just a song just for me.

970
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,500
Boy, this church of the subgenius stuff was great.

971
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:45,460
It was well worth all that Xeroxing and this.

972
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,940
Hey, man.

973
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:46,740
Hey, Reverend.

974
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,140
You remember me?

975
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,140
Hey, what are you doing, man?

976
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,460
I'm going to heap a do-wunky, buddy.

977
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,000
I need some help, man.

978
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,400
Now, wait a minute.

979
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,300
I know.

980
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,980
I've retired now.

981
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,960
It's after X days.

982
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,880
You subgeniuses shouldn't need any help.

983
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,120
Yeah, but see, some things don't work.

984
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,120


985
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,800
They don't work out the way we always had them planned.

986
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,480
I don't know how to explain this.

987
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:14,100
But, see, everything is just going perfectly fine until, well, things didn't start going so good.

988
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,860
Well, wait a minute.

989
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,980
This is my perfect escape vessel living fantasy.

990
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,280
What are you doing here raining on my parade?

991
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,760
Well, you know, it's not exactly paradise, Rev.

992
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,140
I guess there were a few more episodes to follow X day.

993
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,400
And you see...

994
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:33,960
I command you.

995
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,520
To disappear.

996
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,860
Sorry, man.

997
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
This is for real.

998
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,320
He didn't...

999
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,540
Wait a minute.

1000
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,360
Look, here's the deal.

1001
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,200
I should be able to...

1002
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,320
Anything I want should happen.

1003
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,200
The stuff...

1004
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,880
Lonesome Cowboy Dave be gone.

1005
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:45,580
Hey, man.

1006
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,060
Listen, I'll put it to you in like a pop culture way.

1007
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,680
You ever see that movie, uh...

1008
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,540
What was it called?

1009
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,780
Not Giardo's, uh...

1010
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:52,620
Anovus.

1011
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,080
It was almost by Stanislav's Lamb.

1012
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,480
It was about this year's star, see?

1013
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,400
And the people got too close to it, see?

1014
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,260
Whatever they thought was real...

1015
00:53:59,260 --> 00:53:59,640
Solaris.

1016
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,460
Solaris, yeah.

1017
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,320
Yeah, that's it.

1018
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:01,820
Solaris.

1019
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,940
And the guy starts...

1020
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,740
Well, you see...

1021
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,620
The stuff, you know, that was in your champagne

1022
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,520
that made you think Lenny Bruce and all them guys...

1023
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,040
Well, uh...

1024
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,360
This stuff's kind of...

1025
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,740
It's bootleg, man.

1026
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,540
It's not very good.

1027
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,260
All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

1028
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,140
Some people are actually dying and staying dead.

1029
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:19,920
What?

1030
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,060
Other people are wishing for beautiful alien checks, God,

1031
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,740
to come and perform oral sex on them,

1032
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,060
and their heads explode, and they don't get up,

1033
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,760
and they keep on staying in pain.

1034
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,120
Wait a minute.

1035
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,280
Oh, man, it's pretty bad.

1036
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:31,680
Look, Elvis...

1037
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,560
That's not really Elvis.

1038
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,420
Elvis is just a record.

1039
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,340
That's right.

1040
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,140
What do you...

1041
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,920
Wait a minute.

1042
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,380
What's outside those viewports?

1043
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,740
That's outer space, right?

1044
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,100
Right.

1045
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,720
Wait a minute.

1046
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,760
That's what I'm trying to explain to you, man.

1047
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,280
Wait, those are just little Christmas lights

1048
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,360
on a conveyor belt.

1049
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:43,700
Yeah.

1050
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,400
What the...

1051
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,680
Wait a minute.

1052
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,960
Yeah, it's a rat burger.

1053
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:47,460
You mean...

1054
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,200
Dude, wait a minute.

1055
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,260
It's wearing off, man.

1056
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:51,820


1057
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,260
We've been gypped?

1058
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,660
Not only gypped, we might be dying right now.

1059
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,840
What about the 90...

1060
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,140
Well, if we're dying, then we ought to at least get 90 bucks.

1061
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,040
No, no, no, no.

1062
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,980
We gotta search around for some kind of antidote pudding

1063
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,480
for this stuff.

1064
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,720
It's something to make us sleep.

1065
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,080
These go to one or the other different levels.

1066
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,040
Bob cheated us.

1067
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,500
I can't...

1068
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,620
That's impossible.

1069
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,620
Or else he's screwed up.

1070
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,440
But how could Bob screw...

1071
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,900
He cheated us, man.

1072
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,960
He cheated us.

1073
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,100
He screwed up the trick.

1074
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,220
Bob's not smart enough to cheat us.

1075
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,560
But Jesus can...

1076
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,600
Where's Jesus?

1077
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,200
Look, man.

1078
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,780
I haven't seen Jesus since the rupture.

1079
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,860
I don't know nothing about the conspiracy stuff.

1080
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,600
And it's Jesus and Bob without playing golf?

1081
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,220
All of a sudden.

1082
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:32,680
Yeah.

1083
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,560
Yeah, you're right.

1084
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,480
You're getting a lot trickier, man.

1085
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,280
I feel like I'm seizing.

1086
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,320
Look at your fingernails, man.

1087
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,860
You're bleeding, bro.

1088
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,540
They're falling off.

1089
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,420
Yeah, you're bleeding.

1090
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,640
You're coming loose.

1091
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,820
And I'm bleeding, too.

1092
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,520
Look at this.

1093
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,100
It's on my nose.

1094
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,180
I'm bleeding.

1095
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,720
We're going to find Jesus.

1096
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,160
With Bob.

1097
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:48,260
He didn't cheat.

1098
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,020
Yeah.

1099
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,920
Yeah.

1100
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,900
I said, do us high.

1101
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,240
Well, let me just lie.

1102
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,640
I said, do us high.

1103
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,020
Well, let me just lie.

1104
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,300
Yeah, you ain't never gonna have it.

1105
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,320
And you ain't no friend.

1106
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,920
You ain't no friend.

1107
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,860
Knowing her fate,

1108
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,020
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

1109
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,940
On board were the Twelve.

1110
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,860
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,

1111
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,680
and the other so-called gods of our legends.

1112
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:21,940
But not Bob.

1113
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,560
The gods they were.

1114
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,920
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,

1115
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,040
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

1116
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,720
And there was much rejoicing and singing at Exeter.

1117
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,860
But we'll have to wait another year.

1118
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,460
Hail, the sex goddesses.

1119
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,860
Because they did show up at Exeter.

1120
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,260
A new day.

1121
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,320
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial Yeti DNA.

1122
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,540
Level C.

1123
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,220
Well, we're gonna have to go north and south and east and west.

1124
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,920
And we gotta wait another year, yeah.

1125
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,240
But we're gonna fill up a new pipe.

1126
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,480
We're gonna wait for the sun to shine.

1127
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,720
We're gonna turn around and we're gonna see the sun.

1128
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


1129
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


1130
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720

00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:31,800
like

1152
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:35,600
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me

1153
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,060
That that shouldn't use it, that that shouldn't lose it

1154
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,060
But all that shouldn't do

1155
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,020
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

1156
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,880
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

1157
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,860
It's gonna be me, and it's gonna be you

1158
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,960
We're gonna do everything we want to

1159
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,220
It's gotta be now, and I can't wait

1160
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,500
To think about the fear and all that pain at hand

1161
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,420
Oh, like a flaming baton

1162
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,720
That's better than a twirl

1163
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,540
Like George Bush on acid

1164
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,740
Singing to Duke of

1165
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,660
Gonna be a new world, gonna be a new world

1166
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,100
I'm not saying

1167
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,060
To anyone's life works

1168
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,140
There's nothing left for you to say

1169
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,420
Soon you'll be dead anyway

1170
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:48,880
Well, no one here is getting out alive

1171
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,580
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care

1172
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:59,380
So close your eyes and get your self-doubt

1173
01:00:59,380 --> 01:00:59,940
And I'm not saying

1174
01:00:59,940 --> 01:00:59,940


1175
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,480
And think about the times you've been and what they've been

1176
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,160
To me it's nothing

1177
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,700
To me it's nothing

1178
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,380
To me it's nothing

1179
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,860
To me it's nothing

1180
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,060
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

1181
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:27,080
That's why we might as well take our time

1182
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:36,360
Looking for a way and searching for the way out

1183
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,160
Angels ride free in your mind

1184
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,700
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try

1185
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,020
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild

1186
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,300
Amen

1187
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,320
Get hip

1188
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,940
Climb up, bud

1189
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,580
Let your ship

1190
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,420
Speed boy

1191
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,880
We know

1192
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,220
No king of freedom yet

1193
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,200
Come and go

1194
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,940
No king of freedom yet

1195
01:01:59,940 --> 01:01:59,940


1196
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,920
Go Apollo 69

1197
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,660
Rocket baby, walk the line

1198
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,100
Feed the fire, now's the time

1199
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,680
Fly Apollo 69, yeah

1200
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,500
The beginning was the end

1201
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,880
Of everything now

1202
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,500
The ape regards his tail

1203
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,940
He's stuck in the middle of the sea

1204
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,120
He's

1205
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:36,120


1206
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,460
However

1207
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,340
The burning

1208
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1209
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,340


1210
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,360
Yeah

1211
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,700
Not in heat

1212
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,940
Probably right now

1213
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,280
Burn like a red coal carpet

1214
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,820
Mad bull has lost its way

1215
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,040
Born children

1216
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,460
It's just a shot away

1217
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,580
It's just a shot away

1218
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,040
Born children

1219
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,700
It's just a shot away

1220
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Shot away, shot away

1221
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,220
Okay, friends on the internet, where I can flog our swag legally,

1222
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,980
if you want to help yourself and the Church of the Subgenius

1223
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,740
and get a pretty cool package with like 25 different nifty things in it,

1224
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,060
like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,

1225
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,020
you need to go to subgenius.com and click to become a minister.

1226
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,720
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get,

1227
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,560
and you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum,

1228
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:03,200
which is members only, and we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1229
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,620
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1230
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,300
Isn't that funny?

1231
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,600
We also have things like T-shirts and damn near everything you can think of,

1232
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:12,840
with Bob's face on it.

1233
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,940
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics on coffee mugs and so forth.

1234
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:24,880
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs

1235
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,080
and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1236
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,720
And best of all, from our main online store,

1237
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,280
you can buy the book of the subgenius,

1238
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,940
which is by far the greatest thing we have ever done.

1239
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:43,400
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1240
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,500
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1241
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,120
For that matter, your address on the puffy envelope is handwritten by me also,

1242
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,940
so it keeps my fingers nimble.

1243
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,420
That's subgenius.com.

1244
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,640
And remember, it's only money.
