1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Now I know there are some pretty strong opinions over what to do with the legions of myopically-minded half-witted pinks,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,580
and it seems these opinions have widened the great divide between the clinches of our little church of the inside joke.

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,020
Of course, I speak of the rift between the intellectual evangelicals,

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:28,320
hoping to save the human race from extinction by enslaving them for menial labor, experimentation, human sacrifice, and sexual exploitation.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,380
The militant holocaustals striving to completely snuff out the moronic masses of this planet.

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,800
And virtually every other clinch is unbranching haphazardly off the backs and carcasses of Bob's conquest.

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,980
A massive pit of collective ideals and abnormality.

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,160
A cacophony of white noise.

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,140
A stream of consciousness so muddled through the muddying of our sacred shores by the trample of individuals

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,300
beating our collective chests loud enough to rock them.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,220
And to bury heavens above.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,900
This pit has become so wide and so full, I can't see the other side.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:13,760
Friends, I have stared into the abyss of my twisted soul, and I have seen the true face of terror.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,400
Who is that face?

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,860
Who is that face?

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,080
Who is that face?

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,220
It is Bob.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,720
Friends, I must tell you I wouldn't give two shits for what happens to this planet or the stagnant pink races.

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,360
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius, I am here to remind you that we are all followers of Bob for the same damn reason.

20
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,680
No matter what opinions we hold.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,680
The divine pronouncement of Dobbs proclaims we will be on the X's ships getting our eternal freak on with the uber sex goddesses on our journey to Planet X.

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,460
As long as we keep our senses about us.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,620
Common sense.

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Sense of humor.

25
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,680
And dollars and cents.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,440
Bob has seen my dreams, so I got nothing to worry about.

27
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Bob is in my corner because I'm in his pocket.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,800
Why should I care about infighting, rivalry, and feuding within the Church?

29
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,380
Fuck the pinks.

30
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,900
Leave them alone or kill them all.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,800
It just doesn't matter.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,360
At this point, we're all nothing more than performing monkeys here to tickle the twisted funny bone of the creatures of the Carmel Cosmos.

33
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,900
Bob sold it.

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,320
We smoked it.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,660
That settles it.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,500
See, you're so busy fighting over whose vision sounds better that you seem to forget the best part of all of this.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Sex.

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,900
With.

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,320
Aliens.

40
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,540
We're going to be living it up.

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,780
Way up in the motherfucking mothership getting our fancies tickled by the most exotic extradition.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,740
The most extraterrestrial intersexuals this galaxy has ever known.

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,740
So you keep your propaganda.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
You keep hold of your hate.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,640
I know where I'll be come July 5th, 1998.

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,300
And it's gonna be a glorious sight.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,420
Thank you, Reverend Suds Pasha.

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,240
That was from the fourth of seven amazing YouTube videos he's produced so far.

49
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,780
After 16 shows derived from our 14 hours of work,

50
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,420
and 16 X-Day recordings,

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,700
we're moving on now to Starwood,

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,520
a very different festival held immediately after the X-Day drills,

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,880
in the very same place, Wisteria.

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,580
These two festivals make for quite an unforgettable two weeks every summer.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,660
For various reasons,

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,200
I have ended up having certain responsibilities at Starwood,

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,120
such as helping light the bonfire,

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
making location recordings,

59
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,760
and delivering a sermon from the main stage.

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,140
All coming up on this Hour of Slack number 1339.

61
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,920
How's it going?

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,900
Doing a report for Hour of Slack on Starwood.

63
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,660
Alright.

64
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:12,800
Yeah.

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,000
I was actually critiquing how far off the cues were on the bonfire light.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
See, I had a script.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,020
Oh, yeah.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
When they were rehearsing it,

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,500
I wrote all the stuff down.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,600
And, uh, oddly enough,

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,040
I think some of them may have had a drink or something.

72
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,580
Woo!

73
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,960
That's good enough for me.

74
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,160
Remember,

75
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
people watch the line of drinking

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
to make sure you have alcohol and fire

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,300
on every level of your home.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,920
Remember,

79
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,600
if someone in your household

80
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,520
smokes under the influence of fire,

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,480
you must be aware of Ontario.

82
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,600
Remember,

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,740
I'm a dangerous drinker.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,120
Remember,

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,780
there's more to responsible drinking

86
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,360
than alcohol and fire

87
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
on every level of your home.

88
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,500
Remember,

89
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,120
Hour of Slack.

90
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,640
Maybe that thing is so fucking cool,

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,500
I can't believe it.

92
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
The living nervous system?

93
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:14,900
Yeah.

94
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,260
Uh, friends,

95
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,300
we're at Starwood.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,100
Pyra Sonic is playing a little bit of Starwood.

97
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,100


98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,100


99
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,100


100
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,280
Although you can't see the band,

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,280
all you can see is some fire twirlers.

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,340
Is that what they're called?

103
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,100
With those little fire...

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,460
Yeah, fire spinners.

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,400
Fire spinners.

106
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,160
And one of the waking dream guys

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,580
is walking around with this giant puppet

108
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,020
that looks like a glowing nervous system

109
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,880
that keeps changing colors and lines.

110
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,780
And it's dancing,

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,700
and it's 12 feet tall

112
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,200
over the top of this six-foot-tall guy's head.

113
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,260
It looks like one of those Alex Gray paintings

114
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,700
of a nervous system person.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
But jazzy.

116
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,380
Yeah, real colorful and jazzy.

117
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,920
Not anatomically correct.

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,880
No, not at all.

119
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Just a wild...

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,340
Abstract wire man of neon colored...

121
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,560
Yes.

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,640
Neon glow.

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Those are just guys down there

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
doing the fire twirling, aren't they?

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you mean those are just guys down there?

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,040
Yeah, there's no...

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,800
I don't see anybody on the stage,

128
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,100
although they could be on the stage

129
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,500
and since the stage isn't lit,

130
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,560
we just can't see them.

131
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,160
I don't know if that's live didgeridoo

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,940
or if that's something recorded or what.

133
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,840
That's probably Ron's music.

134
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,740
Yeah.

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,080
It's gotta be Ron's music.

136
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,400
My complaint is that

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,860
it isn't topless girls doing the fire twirling.

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,100
Oh, there will be.

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,500
There are always sexy girls twirling fire.

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,520
I think they're all down at the damn G-spot

141
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,300
is what I think.

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,020
I think we should go down there.

143
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,360
We did go down there, friends.

144
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,500
We got down in there.

145
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,400
Starwood is great fun

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
even if you're one of the cops there

147
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,760
as Princess Wee and I are.

148
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,300
In fact, the whole reason I live in Cleveland

149
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,320
and married to Princess Wee

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,420
and no lonesome cowboy Dave, etc.

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,540
is because Jeff Rosenbaum

152
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,620
invited me to speak at Starwood in 1990.

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,800
It was a bit more raw then,

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,320
and raw was a frequent speaker.

155
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,140
Starwood started in 1980

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,380
and next year will be the 32nd Starwood Festival.

157
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,740
You can look at starwoodfestival.com

158
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,760
for more information.

159
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,620
The music in the background

160
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,800
is from one of the many drum jams

161
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,800
that happen continuously there, day and night.

162
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,980
Before we go back to Starwood, though,

163
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,140
let's step into 14X Day one last time

164
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,360
with Dr. Hal describing the Church of All Worlds,

165
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,740
on whose podcast I will then be heard yakking.

166
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,640
That, in turn, will be followed by

167
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,600
the first half of my sermon to the pagans.

168
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,680
Here's a question handed to us

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,800
by the donator of the Oberon beer.

170
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,500
Is the Church of All Worlds

171
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,160
the one based on Stranger in a Strange Land

172
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,500
by Heinlein?

173
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,580
Heinlein is spelled Hein-land.

174
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,420
Hein-land.

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,940
I think we know that Robert Heinlein...

176
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,280
Exiled to Hein-land.

177
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,360
The land that is behind everyone else.

178
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,940
Yes, it is.

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,000
It is based on that.

180
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,940
It started as that.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,920
That was the starting impulse.

182
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,360
But fortunately, thanks to the omnipresence of evolution,

183
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,520
it has mutated somewhat,

184
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
and somewhat more interestingly.

185
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,420
When the full version of that novel

186
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,760
was released,

187
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,680
the authors, directors cut, as it were.

188
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,740
Many were disappointed

189
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,480
in the things which had been cut out.

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,780
And it became a less forgiving book.

191
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,740
But the Church of All Worlds goes on,

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,860
and we ecumenically wish them support.

193
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,380
Just don't get too close.

194
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,660
Yeah, I've seen their water sharing ceremonies

195
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,280
in the pool at Brushwood.

196
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
The water is always a different color afterwards.

197
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,900
Yes, they take that far too literally.

198
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,360
Water shared is life shared.

199
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,800
Founded by Oberon Zell in 1962,

200
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,240
the Church of All Worlds is one of the oldest neo-pagan religions

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,980
and the first to claim the identity of pagan.

202
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,440
Inspired by Heinlein's sci-fi novel,

203
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,740
Stranger in a Strange Land,

204
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,980
CAW has been a major influence

205
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,980
in the emergence of modern paganism.

206
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,260
Originating the ritual of water sharing,

207
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,960
CAW was the first church to legally ordain women as priestesses

208
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,060
and to sanction gay and poly marriages.

209
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,900
Zellart got us.

210
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,000
Enter the next at www.caw.org.

211
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,560
Good evening.

212
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm Oberon.

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,840
And I'm Arielle.

214
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,340
And this is our show.

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,900
Okay.

216
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,320
Well, hey, this week we're coming to you live from doing,

217
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,700
from Starwood, number 31.

218
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,720
Yay.

219
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,840
Yay, everybody.

220
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,680
At the beautiful pagan sanctuary of Wisteria

221
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,440
near Pomeroy in southern Ohio,

222
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,760
where it is bloody hot.

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
Our guest tonight will be Ivan Stang,

224
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,720
founder and High Muckety Muck of the Church of the Subgenius,

225
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,140
and Ian Corrigan, Bard and Druid,

226
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,100
and Jeff Rosenbaum,

227
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,340
one of the main organizers of Starwood.

228
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,380
I've been to just about every Starwood

229
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,920
for more than a quarter of a century now,

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,340
and it's always a high point in my year.

231
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,060
Arielle was here last year,

232
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,900
but Arielle, you weren't able to do this year.

233
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm sorry.

234
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,080
But you'll be speaking to us from your home in rural Tennessee.

235
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,040
Mm-hmm.

236
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,540
Well, I'm sorry that I'm not there either.

237
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,200
Yeah.

238
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,760
Sounds like you are having a good time.

239
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,280
How's the turnout?

240
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,480
Well, you know, I haven't really had a chance

241
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,720
to poke my head out and look around,

242
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,760
but maybe Jeff can tell us how many folks are here.

243
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,780
But everything is off to a great start.

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,960
It's been an interesting adventure getting here,

245
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,740
but that's another whole story.

246
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,400
I want to really turn to the really wonderful guest line

247
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,120
that we've got tonight,

248
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,440
and our first one is Reverend Ivan Stang,

249
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,700
who is the author and publisher of the first Screed,

250
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,800
of the Church of the Subgenius.

251
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,080
I hope that some of you out there have heard of this

252
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,500
and will be enjoying this.

253
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,520
He is credited with founding the church

254
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,140
with his friend, fellow Drummond, in 1977,

255
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,120
although Stang himself denies this

256
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,580
and claims the organization was founded in 1953

257
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,500
by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

258
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,220
Since the publication of the first Subgenius pamphlet in 1980,

259
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,040
Ivan has embarked on a worldwide crusade,

260
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,000
spanning at least three continents,

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,140
and has been a great evidence to promote the church.

262
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,260
In 2006, Ivan created a new subgenius book

263
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,780
for Thunder's Mouth Press,

264
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
the Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack,

265
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,800
the Bobliographon.

266
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,780
He has appeared on several national radio and television shows,

267
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,080
including the Jon Stewart Show on MTV.

268
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,060
Stang is an instructor on the faculty of the Mabee Logic Academy.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,540
Both he and J.R. Bob Dobbs appear as characters

270
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,520
in John Shirley's science fiction novel,

271
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,520
Camus of Kadazar, The Black Hole of Carcosa.

272
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,160
Welcome, Ivan. How are you?

273
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,880
I am living in Slack.

274
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,980
Good. Well, it's good to have you on the show.

275
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,960
So, I'm going to just turn you loose here.

276
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,540
Tell our listeners whatever you want to

277
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,960
about the Church of the Subgenius,

278
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
and maybe you might start off by telling us what you mean by that.

279
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,980
Well, you'll notice that we didn't, you know,

280
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,220
call it the Church of the Genius.

281
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,480
Yes, we noticed that.

282
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,640
I have to remind people of that every day or so.

283
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,300
And the reason for that is,

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,400
in some ways, we're the most honest religion,

285
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,400
because we're the one that admits it's all a bunch of made-up baloney.

286
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,900
It was certainly in our case.

287
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,140
The thing is, we subgeniuses,

288
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,020
not being geniuses,

289
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,620
don't claim to know everything.

290
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,320
In fact, you know, most religions are centered around

291
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,620
why we are here,

292
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
who made the universe,

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,900
what's it all for, and so forth.

294
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,240
Well, we're the ones who don't expect to know the answer.

295
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,480
And in fact, whenever we hear somebody trying to tell us an answer

296
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,180
to those big questions,

297
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,220
we get a little bit suspicious.

298
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,800
Well, an honest prophet.

299
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,440
Yes, we certainly want to make an honest buck

300
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,400
off of every prophecy that we can pull off.

301
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,980
Hello?

302
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,160
Hello?

303
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,680
Did he get cut off?

304
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,740
Yeah, it's all right.

305
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,020
The conspiracy of the normal people are trying to interfere.

306
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,040
One of the basic tenets of the Church of the Subgenius

307
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,240
that was revealed to Bob by the evil space monster Jehovah One is that,

308
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,300
now this may sound exactly like the same spiel

309
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,940
that every crackpot, kook, and religious nut out there says,

310
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,780
but there has always been a conspiracy of normal people

311
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,680
inadvertently robbing away the slack of all the weirdos,

312
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,580
abnormals, class clowns, disbelievers, and so forth.

313
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,220
We're very interested in disbelievers and believers,

314
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,680
especially those who'll believe anything.

315
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,620
Yeah.

316
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,120
There's a seeker born every minute, isn't there?

317
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,140
Right.

318
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,700
But the important thing about the Church of the Subgenius,

319
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,180
as we say, we're not expecting eternal answers to everything.

320
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,180
We'll be lucky to get one truthful answer to a simple question

321
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,000
like, what's two plus two?

322
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,060
That's the kind of thing we can depend on.

323
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,560
And therefore, although we worship our Savior,

324
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs, unquestioningly,

325
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,900
he instructed us to worship him very, very questioningly.

326
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,040
In fact, he is supposed to be the world's first short-duration personal savior,

327
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,620
or a short-durper-sav, as the ascended masters say it in Tibetan.

328
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,580
Short-durper-sav.

329
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,300
You know, it's a world of planned obsolescence,

330
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,920
and a personal savior that works one year may not work for you the next year.

331
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:46,560
So, J.R. Bob is great for people who are just coming off of a bad religion,

332
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,340
and they need something that's more devoted to slack

333
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,880
than to punishment or correct behavior or whatever.

334
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,420
Bob doesn't care about your sins

335
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,160
and wouldn't be well-connected enough to forgive your sins anyway,

336
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,780
but he brings a great excuse for your sins.

337
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,260
And it works for a while.

338
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,800
After that, you may have to move on to something else.

339
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,880
And we don't mind as long as we get your $30 ministership ordainment first.

340
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,860
We really do ordain people, by the way.

341
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:27,820
A subgenius ordainment is just as real as an ordainment in the Catholic Church legally.

342
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,040
If I perform more marriages than I can count,

343
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,880
and if those weren't legal,

344
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,900
then a lot of people wasted money on divorces, let me tell you.

345
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,440
For a bunch of faithless, really, most of the subgeniuses are what you'd call kind of skeptics.

346
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,260
They got burned out on some religion or another,

347
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,200
and they weren't ready to go with anybody with a straight face.

348
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,360
So we've centered on someone with a really twisted face,

349
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,480
and that is the face of Bob Dobbs.

350
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,220
And we have absolute and total faith in Bob's face.

351
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,260
Not in his wisdom, which changes from day to day,

352
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,000
but just in the face.

353
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,400
And unfortunately, we're on the radio, you can't see a picture of him,

354
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,740
but at least we have a picture of him.

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,900
I mean, do the Christians have a photograph of Jesus, for instance?

356
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,900
You can't even...

357
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,220
There might be photographs of Muhammad, but they'll kill you if you show it.

358
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Well, we just have drawings of Bob now, technically, though, don't we?

359
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,700
No, he posed for photographs for ads all through the 50s and 40s.

360
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:49,480
If you look through any old Better Homes and Gardens or Popular Mechanics from the 50s and 60s,

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,540
you'll see all these pictures of this square-looking, pipe-faced guy.

362
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,960
Always has a pipe, and he's always in slack.

363
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,880
He's in a hammock, or he's fishing.

364
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,600
He's advertising beer.

365
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,820
And he's always with some babe.

366
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,080
That's his wife, Connie.

367
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,040
And that is how we know that he's a real being.

368
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,260
He really does exist.

369
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,400
Of course, because he's smart, he avoids his mindless followers,

370
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,380
the subgeniuses, or the Bobbies, as some people call them.

371
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,660
I was probably one of the first Bobbies.

372
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,300
Bobbies.

373
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,860
The interesting thing about the subgenius thing,

374
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,000
is that it started out as a series of books,

375
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,320
but nobody reads anymore.

376
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,020
So it turned into a series of radio shows.

377
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,660
There's a show in Atlanta,

378
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,620
I mean, not podcasts, but real broadcast shows.

379
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,960
The one in San Francisco has been on since 1982.

380
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,120
I started the Hour of Slack in Dallas in 1985.

381
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,800
Susie the Fleece started hers in Atlanta.

382
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,040
And there's a bunch of other spin-offs and so forth

383
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,320
that have been going on for all this time.

384
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,800
You're still doing a weekly show, aren't you?

385
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh, absolutely. I have to.

386
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,040
Otherwise, I'd have to get a real job.

387
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I actually make a perfectly reasonable living

388
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,000
selling Xeroxes of material I wrote when I was 26,

389
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,660
when Violet first turned me on to Bob.

390
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,380
That's how much slack you can get from being a subgenius.

391
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,020
But you have to take it completely unseriously.

392
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,700
In a very serious way.

393
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,740
The thing that surprised me the most over the last 30 years

394
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,380
is what a social group it turned into.

395
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:46,100
We have church meetings called devivals every couple of months,

396
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,340
and every year we await the prophesied end of the world.

397
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,220
Wasn't that supposed to happen yesterday or something?

398
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,220
It will happen on July 5, 1998.

399
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,600
By the fact that we've had to stand in some field

400
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,420
waiting for the saucers every single July 5 since then

401
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,480
indicates to us proof that, as Bob was saying,

402
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,440
there is a vast conspiracy that's been messing with the dates.

403
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,460
Our friend St. Stymie Bergerac or Jeff Rosenbaum

404
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,020
mentioned that daylight savings time

405
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,780
is one of their ways of shaving hours off the calendar.

406
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,240
So we don't really know what year this is.

407
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,060
We don't really even know what planet this is.

408
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,920
All we know is that Bob is the living avatar of slack.

409
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,100
We don't question that.

410
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,960
We know that the only way to prove that you're a subgenius

411
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,160
is to give up that which means the most to you, money.

412
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,240
In our case, $30.

413
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,980
By sending it in, right?

414
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,680
Prices could go up any time.

415
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,620
We preach.

416
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,380
Just about everything you want to hear.

417
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
Polyamory? Sure. Go for it.

418
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,120
Cool.

419
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,600
Monsters from outer space? Sure.

420
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,800
Now, Oberon, your group, Church of All Worlds,

421
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,440
has references to a famous science fiction book.

422
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,300
Oh, absolutely. Stranger in a Strange Land.

423
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,520
It was our origin myth story, you know.

424
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,720
Right. We're the same way,

425
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,680
except that we stole from a lot more science fiction books,

426
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,600
including the ones that Jesus wrote.

427
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,140
The books that Jesus supposedly narrated,

428
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,940
and the books of the apostles,

429
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,300
all the way back to Gilgamesh,

430
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,260
and your latest hit sci-fi movie.

431
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,780
That's where most of our religious doctrine comes from.

432
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,160
You know how when you were a kid,

433
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,280
you'd find your dad's hidden stash of books,

434
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,820
and you'd skim through them looking for the good parts?

435
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,380
That's what we did with religious books.

436
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,940
Oh, that's cool.

437
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,480
And it created a sort of Frankenstein's monster

438
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,380
that will live forever out of mostly dead religions.

439
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,940
So we have a lot of relation to the Discordians.

440
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,960
We actually are not based on that.

441
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,880
I did not hear about them until after I was turned on to Bob and so forth.

442
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,420
But I was lucky enough to be friends with Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shay,

443
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,940
and we owed them a vast debt.

444
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,720
Yeah.

445
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,780
And I would never deny that.

446
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,080
I think that Kerry and Bob and the Discordian thing

447
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,800
was part of a secret conspiracy behind the entire pagan movement.

448
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,180
As far as I know, every group and every leader and founder

449
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,320
was a Discordian at some point.

450
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, I'll be discussing that on Saturday night at Star Wars,

451
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,960
The Secret Origins of the Entire New Age.

452
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,380
As for Kerry Thornley,

453
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,040
he became a hardcore subgenius in the last years before his death.

454
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Although he then became a paranoid hardcore subgenius

455
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,440
and thought that I was out to kill him or something.

456
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,420
But, you know, Kerry had his own way of seeing things.

457
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,700
Do you ever have problems with people taking this too seriously

458
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,080
and missing the sort of the point?

459
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,640
Well, you know, Oberon, the funny thing is,

460
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,840
I didn't expect as...

461
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,500
Well, of course, we're as serious as any other religion,

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,060
but no, I didn't expect as many to take it as seriously

463
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,860
in such stupid ways,

464
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,520
where they get the lies and believe the jokes.

465
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,580
And I nowadays spend about half of my time deprogramming the zombies

466
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,120
that insist that there's something supernatural about all of this.

467
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,260
It's scary. I run into that same problem myself, you know.

468
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,260
Really, yeah.

469
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,460
People just don't give enough credit to the hard work of artists.

470
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,420
I know, I know. That's the problem, isn't it?

471
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,020
Well, but on the other hand,

472
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,520
a lot of those artists won't admit that that's all it is.

473
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,900
You know, I received the word from the thing up there in the sky.

474
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,120
Well, I've received lots of words from those things up in the sky,

475
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,340
and it always scared the bee-Jesus out of me.

476
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,340
I always figured that too many of these religions

477
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,120
don't really acknowledge that they are all started with science fiction stories, you know?

478
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,420
Well, of course not.

479
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,880
That would ruin the whole thing.

480
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,020
The Church of the Subgenius only works as an underground, non-mainstream religion.

481
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,140
The minute everybody got into it and agreed with it,

482
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,080
that would be the most horrible nightmare in the world.

483
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,060
In fact, if we ever get a movie made,

484
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,640
it'll be a horror movie about the day that they all believe.

485
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,320
So...

486
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,060
Ooh.

487
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,400
Not everyone is called to be saved.

488
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,260
Not everyone can be saved.

489
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,300
A lot of people are much better off...

490
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,160
Well, as Bob said,

491
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,180
pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

492
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,260
The problem is most people don't have enough imagination to have their own delusions,

493
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,020
so they relax in the safety of Rush Limbaugh's delusions

494
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,580
or Billy Graham's delusions or whatnot.

495
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,260
So, whatever.

496
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,180
As long as they stay relaxed and aren't causing me any trouble, that's fine.

497
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
Just in case anybody wondered,

498
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,120
I was not raised in a religious household.

499
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
We were what you might call secular humanist scientists.

500
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,800
And so I don't have a bone to pick with any particular religion.

501
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,480
I'm a monster fan and a sci-fi fan.

502
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,220
And to me, the world of religion is just

503
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,860
very similar to the world of classic monster movies.

504
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,380
It's just older.

505
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,260
Well, I think that's about right.

506
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,380
I can certainly concur with that.

507
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

508
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,920
and everybody in between,

509
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,280
I, the Reverend Sister Fat Mandy, do hereby call you to the main stage area.

510
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,300
At this time,

511
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,520
I'm the one and unfortunately only Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Septuagint

512
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,380
is about to impart some incredibly important knowledge.

513
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,180
For many of you, he needs no introduction.

514
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,900
For those of you who are as yet unsaved,

515
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:38,760
I suggest you get your $30 now for your chance to purchase guaranteed salvation

516
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,100
or triple your money back.

517
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,240
Without any further ado,

518
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,280
I would like to now engage in the sacred art of the church.

519
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,560
And I'm going to now invite the Reverend Father Stang

520
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,560


521
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,000
the most important part of fat chick fist mastication

522
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,660
with which we shall call forth the spirits to bless

523
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,080
this absolutely unholy holy gathering.

524
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,460
.

525
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,780
.

526
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:32,780


527
