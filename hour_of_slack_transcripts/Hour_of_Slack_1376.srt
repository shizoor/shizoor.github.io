1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
You want to see my minister's card?

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,920
Buddy, be glad I don't rip your heart out and make you eat it right now.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
The radio, remember? Make it work.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,380
The hour of slug!

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,220
So you did bust it.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,120
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,060
Tonight it better.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,220
Can't you smell it?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,040
Hello, X-Men.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,340
Hello, subgenia.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,680
We can't see you out there.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,100
All right.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,000
We've got a message from Bob.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,980
Yes, he's watching. He sees us.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,640
He spies on you.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,580
His highness, yes, he.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
He follows. He knows you. Knows everything you do.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,180
Dobbs' heads are all around. Trust me, I know.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,520
His third eye will track you down wherever you go.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,800
The whole slug is what he's found. Think you shall grow.

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,140
Bob Dobbs is watching you.

22
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,620
J-R-Bob, yes, he's watching. He sees us.

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,240
He spies on you.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,680
His highness, yes, yes, he.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,960
He follows. He knows you. Knows everything you do.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,400
Don't look now. Don't try to stop. He's right behind.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,040
Smoking is happening from within your mind.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,340
Remember every thought to finish out mind.

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,400
Bob Dobbs is watching you.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,980
J-Rob, yes, he's watching you.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,860
J-Rob, yes, he's watching. He sees us.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,220
He's following you.

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,440
He spies on you.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,120
His highness, yes, he.

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,940
He follows. He knows you. Knows everything you do.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,340
J-Rob, yes, he's watching. He sees us.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,520
He's following you.

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,860
He spies on you.

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,820
His highness, yes, yes, he follows.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,920
He's following you.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,460
He knows everything you do.

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,320
He wins.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,600
HeWhere?

47
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,800
A…?

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,180
You're never a bad boy.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,200
You are always the bad boy.

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,820
And the other three are very dark.

51
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,040
It's all about you, baby.

52
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,620
Oh, many, manyüllons.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,040
Besides Puma Gus.

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,460
It's so true.

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,660
Come on.

56
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,940
Andrew Liempeo, Tommy Amoeba, and more.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Before this song, we heard Leemur's intro

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,720
and a little bit of Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
More of both coming up.

60
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,740
This show, Hour of Slack number 1376,

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,080
from the Church of the Subgenius,

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,060
will, later, reveal exactly what went down

63
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,360
at 7 a.m. on July 5th of this conspiracy year

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,960
ostensibly called 2012.

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, right.

66
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,420
First, we'll hear the last of the live radio

67
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,400
done from the Wisteria Cafe stage

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
the day before the world ended.

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,520
In this case, with Dr. Howell,

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
Priestess Pisces, Dr. Legume,

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,040
and yours truly, Reverend Stack.

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,980
And we'll hear the incredible, heart-rending sermon

73
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,240
by Reverend Susie DeFluze.

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,540
Incidentally, there are a ton of photos from this event

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,920
in the events section of subgenius.com.

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,580
A not-safe...

77
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,760
for-work photos.

78
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,900
Not that I, myself, ever look at the Internet.

79
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,700
Anyway, I don't know.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,500
Stang says he never looks at the Internet.

81
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
There's all sorts of good discoveries

82
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,780
that have come to light.

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,220
We're having auction things brought up.

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm going to need a much stronger pornography

85
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,740
after hearing about that.

86
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,160
He didn't know about the giant flying dragon

87
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,820
hat-sig-opter-ex-stampima that was recently discovered.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaking of the auction,

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,820
this is a nice little warning.

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,280
Unidentified,

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,380
unidentified flying objects,

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,820
sometimes treated lightly by the press

93
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,420
and referred to as flying saucers,

94
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,500
must be rapidly and accurately identified

95
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,940
as serious U.S. AF business in the ZI.

96
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,100
As AFR 2000-2 points out,

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,200
the Air Force concern with these sightings is threefold.

98
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,740
First of all, is the object a threat

99
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,840
to the defense of the United States?

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,380
Second, does it contribute

101
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,260
to significant damage to the United States?

102
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,260


103
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,260


104
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,260


105
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,720
Third, does it contribute to significant technical

106
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
or scientific knowledge?

107
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,380
And there is the inherent U.S. AF responsibility

108
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,300
to explain to the American people

109
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,060
through public information media what is going on in their skies.

110
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,540
The phenomenon or actual objects, it's redacted,

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,820
bear with me, the phenomenon or actual objects,

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,160
redacted UFOs will tend to increase with public more aware

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,860
of the goings on in space.

114
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,200
But still inclined to assume apprehension.

115
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,040
Technical and defense considerations will continue

116
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,380
to exist in this area.

117
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,260
Apparently this will be available at the auction.

118
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,120
It's a famous book.

119
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Flying Saucers, Serious Business.

120
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,260
By Frank Edwards.

121
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,300
It's a classic of occult UFO cookery.

122
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Which book is that?

123
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,240
Famous, Frank Edwards.

124
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,820
It's almost as cool as a George Adamski book.

125
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,480
So start counting your dollars now, brothers and sisters.

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,060
I have a counter opinion to offer.

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,300
Flying Saucers, Serious Business.

128
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,640
And on the back, there's some great questions

129
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,040
that they promise will be answered.

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,140
What was the mysterious solid object

131
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,340
that struck a comet jetliner in the flight over India?

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,220
A pie plate or reflections in the atmosphere.

133
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,880
Has modern science already communicated

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,200
with intelligent beings from outer space?

135
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,800
Dry cleaning bags filled with marsh gas.

136
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,080
Or mass insanity.

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,000
Why have UFOs undergone drastic design changes

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,280
in the past 60 years?

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,780
A lack of imagination.

140
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,160
What was that thing that followed a Polaris missile in 1961

141
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,280
and caused the radar tracking gear to lock on it instead of the missile?

142
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,900
A weather balloon hooked on a count of the goose.

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,860
How could British television viewers pick up signals

144
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,080
from a Texas TV station that had gone out of business

145
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,780
three years earlier?

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,040
Static.

147
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,040
And refraction on the Heaviside layer.

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,760
What was the strange substance that dribbled

149
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,280
from a crippled disk over Brazil in 1954?

150
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,960
We call it Gremlin Gleet.

151
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,260
I was going to call it Gordon, but okay.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,820
What was the reason for the mysterious power blackouts

153
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,800
in the Northwest and Southwest in the fall of 1965?

154
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,720
10,000 to the 25th vibrators turned on simultaneously.

155
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,020
What will the next UFO phase be?

156
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,340
And what are its unprecedented implications

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,420
for the human race?

158
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,680
We call it X-Day.

159
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,320
Anyway, if you want to indulge in UFOlogy,

160
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,000
that's going to be something you can do

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,180
as you accumulate your storehouse of treasures

162
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,120
to take with you on the pleasure saucers.

163
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,980
Remember, unlike that other cult where you're only allowed

164
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,180
to take one suitcase,

165
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,600
you can take as much luggage as you want

166
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,240
and not be charged by the bag on the saucers.

167
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,880
In fact, you can go back and...

168
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,760
Back me up, Stang. This is right, isn't it?

169
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,600
It is right?

170
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,680
Well, I'll just say it is right.

171
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,080
I'm sure if there is a baggage fee,

172
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,720
it's fairly reasonable.

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
They wouldn't have a baggage fee.

174
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,180
Weight is not a problem.

175
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,620
Why should there be a baggage fee?

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
Space is not a problem.

177
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,460
It's just your soul, you know?

178
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,380
I mean, it's not like you needed it anyway.

179
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,920
And I mean, what's a soul for a baggage fee?

180
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,880
You know, I mean, did you notice your soul?

181
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,480
You know, are you going to miss it?

182
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,080
There might be a soul charge.

183
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm just saying there's no baggage charge.

184
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,460
Your stateroom will be quite large enough

185
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,440
to accommodate you and your so-called soul.

186
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,240
I wonder if Lagume would like to sit up here

187
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,980
with these gentlemen for a while.

188
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Well, of course, we welcome them.

189
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,360
I think it would be very nice.

190
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,200
Dr. Lagume?

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,780
Dr. Lagume would like to go to an extra meditation chamber.

192
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,300
Oh, okay.

193
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,060
We do need a cantankerous replacement for a few minutes.

194
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,600
I said Dr. Lagume would be a very good replacement.

195
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,040
Can you pee for me while you're gone?

196
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,340
Sure.

197
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,820
Which one do you want me to pee from?

198
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,100
Just as much as you can get out.

199
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay.

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,220
It's going to take you half an hour.

201
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,520
I can tell you that right now.

202
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
From PR News in Washington,

203
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm blaming the fire on the Syrian military.

204
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Police say at least three-quarters of a percent

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,200
to 3.62289 percent.

206
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,160
PR News.

207
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:35,980
PR News.

208
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,840
At last check on Wall Street,

209
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,320
21-12-23, 5-2-81-4-13-70.

210
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,100
But an attorney says this is PR News.

211
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,960
President Obama is currently speaking in Ohio.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,600
It's part of a two-day plan to resume whale hunting

213
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,540
in Pennsylvania this week.

214
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,180
Many Chinese academics are urging an end

215
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,660
to the country's PR News in Washington.

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,340
All women have periods.

217
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,420
Now we're joined by Dr. Lagume.

218
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,080
He's going to talk about periods, he said.

219
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,200
Hard doctrine as opposed to all this

220
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,000
namby-pamby, wishy-washy speculation.

221
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
Well, you know, he said he's going to come up here

222
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,800
and talk about periods since I did the sex talk.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
Well, he could talk about the Jurassic period,

224
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,620
the Holocene period.

225
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,120
I missed all of them. I'm sorry.

226
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,000
Or the period we're in now, the Anthropocene period.

227
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,660
Tell us about that special time.

228
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,300
That special time?

229
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,260
The special time.

230
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,860
Well, everybody has the special time.

231
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
The time when the Star Wars Christmas special is on?

232
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,780
The special time is when you pass the X-Day turd, isn't it?

233
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah, yeah, I read about the X-Day turd.

234
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,380
Did we do that yesterday or did we do that at WCSB?

235
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,080
There's your mic.

236
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,520
I think it was mentioned there in an elliptical fashion.

237
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,260
I assume, okay, everybody who's new here

238
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,260
has probably actually read the program book.

239
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,980
We'll read it.

240
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,120
People who have been to X-Days before

241
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,480
habitually ignore the program book.

242
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,700
Pisces and I know that because people are constantly

243
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,380
asking us what's happening next.

244
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,560
When is this?

245
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,380
Well, and here's the message from Lagume

246
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
because he can't read it.

247
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,020
A message from Dr. Katahdin Lagume.

248
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,960
Nobody likes to talk about this.

249
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,740
No, wait.

250
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,040
That's wrong.

251
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,660
It's the other thing.

252
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,100
Everybody likes to talk about this.

253
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,420
I speak, of course, about shitting.

254
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,200
Everybody does it.

255
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,220
However, when you get to X-Day,

256
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,020
you may well find that you won't do it.

257
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,320
You've been on the road for a few days,

258
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,960
eating at Burger God Hungerfucker,

259
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,980
or worse, 7-Eleven,

260
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,280
and you finally made it to X-Day.

261
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,600
You're excited.

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,760
You're happy to see your old friends

263
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,020
and make some new ones.

264
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,940
And your natural schedule is the same.

265
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,420
You're full of eating, sleeping, drinking,

266
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,920
and pretty much everything else

267
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
is suddenly altered significantly.

268
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,160
You may not notice it first,

269
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,660
but then suddenly,

270
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,460
you'll feel a rumble

271
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,620
from the deep in your lower abdomen

272
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,320
about the third day of the event.

273
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,900
I hate to interrupt,

274
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,400
but on screen is the shitting cladocerone.

275
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,620
It's a...

276
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,340
What happens to be on screen is...

277
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:15,740
Oh, true.

278
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,000
...some footage of a water flea

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,380
or a daphnia with severe diarrhea

280
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,920
that craps every seven seconds.

281
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,200
Inconceivably tiny turds

282
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
being emitted by this organism.

283
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,520
That's the X-Day turd

284
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,240
from the X-Day pond animal.

285
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,840
And just like the fellow on the screen,

286
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,760
you make grimaces

287
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,000
and start counting on your fingers,

288
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,740
trying to remember the last time

289
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,620
that you took a shit.

290
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,260
Suddenly, you will bolt upright

291
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,300
and make an awkward exit

292
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,760
from your circle of friends

293
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,060
and a fast beeline

294
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,180
to the nearest excremeditation chamber.

295
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,420
Be prepared.

296
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,600
It may be a long wait once you get inside.

297
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,540
You might want to bring a book

298
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
or perhaps a little cardboard pine tree

299
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,800
from your rearview mirror.

300
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,500
At this point, your adventure begins.

301
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,260
You're about to give birth

302
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,240
to the X-Day turd.

303
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,760
It may erupt from your ass

304
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
with the power of a thousand exploding suns.

305
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,680
Or more likely,

306
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,440
you will feel like Auguste Rodin's

307
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,100
famous sculpture, The Thinker,

308
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,320
depicting a man frozen forever

309
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,000
in the act of dropping a mammoth deuce.

310
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,840
Either way, it's gonna hurt.

311
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,480
And you're gonna sweat

312
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,140
in that stench-filled plastic dookie box

313
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,280
as you strain to keep your intestines inside your body.

314
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,220
Don't panic.

315
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,920
Embrace the pain.

316
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,920
This is the purest form of gut blowout.

317
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,360
There's at least a 36% chance

318
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,080
that you'll survive this experience.

319
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,260
And when and if you do,

320
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,280
you will emerge from the chamber

321
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,080
feeling like a new Yeti.

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,380
You will experience

323
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,580
a sense of accomplishment,

324
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,060
possibly only surpassed

325
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,760
by defeating a giant cyborg, Chuck Norris,

326
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,680
in single combat

327
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,000
while simultaneously curing bear AIDS.

328
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,260
Rejoice, pilgrim.

329
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,940
If you get that far,

330
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,500
the rest is all cake.

331
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Did I do it justice?

332
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah, you did good.

333
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,040
Actually, while you were doing that,

334
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,560
Reverend Stang was videotaping me

335
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,940
moving my lips to it,

336
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,600
so it's got your voice coming out.

337
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,020
Oh, okay.

338
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,980
That will confuse some people later.

339
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,180
Yeah, they already think I control your mind.

340
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,320
Legume controls everybody's mind.

341
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,720
But in most cases,

342
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,520
very little control is required

343
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,100
because there's so little to control.

344
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,380
Coming up, a song by Pisces and Suds Pasha,

345
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,040
recorded about two hours after they were married,

346
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,940
come to think of it,

347
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,620
with apologies to Leonard Cohen.

348
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm breaking the song, but I'm not going to do it.

349
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,500
I'm going to put the song up into two parts

350
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,220
because they screwed up in the middle

351
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,600
and you don't need to hear that part.

352
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,700
Following that, a little more live radio

353
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,280
and then actual recordings of the events

354
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,980
that took place on the Wisteria Field

355
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,900
in the middle of the huge stone circle

356
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,640
at 7 a.m., July 5th,

357
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,860
in a year that turns out to definitely not be 1998.

358
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,280
But then we're not really sure if that was July either

359
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,440
or if this planet is even the so-called Earth.

360
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,120
We're going to do a little sweet song for you guys.

361
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,900
Yeah.

362
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,900
Yeah, let's do it.

363
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,760
I heard there was a group of freaks

364
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,680
Who waited for the world to cease

365
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,300
You don't really care about this, do ya?

366
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,260
It was a mist, the fourth, the fifth

367
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,920
The saucers fell, no saucer lives

368
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,280
Bob is sadly learning

369
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,220
Dobbs will screw ya

370
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,520
Dobbs will screw ya

371
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,480
Dobbs will screw ya

372
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,040
If, say, on the off chance

373
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,500
that we have the year wrong again

374
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,840
and the saucers don't show up

375
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,520
in about 16 months,

376
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:20,820
or in about 15 hours,

377
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,020
I brought some survivalist books with me

378
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,580
and I can teach you how to live off of roadkill

379
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,820
and the...

380
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,220
There's an appealing prospect.

381
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,480
And bugs.

382
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,400
If you're...

383
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,520
If we all run out of water

384
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,900
and catch up with the rest of Ohio,

385
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,760
you understand most of Ohio is dying right now.

386
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,460
They have no water, no electricity,

387
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,120
and worst of all, no internet.

388
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,500
So they're losing their minds,

389
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,660
shooting each other in the streets.

390
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
Friends, if that does happen here,

391
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,840
the eyeballs of all mammals

392
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
have water in them,

393
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,000
which you can suck out.

394
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,740
So if you're not smart enough

395
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,360
to wrap a plastic bag around a tree limb

396
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,280
and collect water by condensation,

397
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,600
find roadkill and suck the water out of its eyeballs

398
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,680
and it won't hurt ya.

399
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,240
That's really pure stuff in there.

400
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,520
We already told them to cut the scent glands out,

401
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,900
the scent glands off of dogs and cats

402
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
before you skin and gut them.

403
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,660
Right.

404
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,500
Dog isn't bad.

405
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,480
I have not had cat,

406
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,560
but I would not hesitate.

407
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
Believe me.

408
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,540
The important thing is to get rid of...

409
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,660
Get the gallbladder out

410
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,340
before it messes up all the meat.

411
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,900
You gotta get the guts away from the meat.

412
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,660
You don't want to penetrate the peritoneum either.

413
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,160
Right.

414
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,940
The scent glands...

415
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,040
There are scent glands around the butts

416
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,400
of dogs and cats.

417
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,720
So I'm gonna have to ask you

418
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,540
to take your pocket knife

419
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,060
and remove those

420
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,960
before you present them to me.

421
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,940
Thank you.

422
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,800
Thank you, Reverend Stane.

423
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,620
And I prefer my monkey brains medium well,

424
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,260
personally.

425
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,440
Bob likes them well done, I guess.

426
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,800
Perhaps it won't come to that.

427
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,940
We'll have to wait and see.

428
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,340
Do I need it?

429
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,620
Let's see, do I need a script?

430
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,580
No, I don't think I need a script.

431
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,900
Do I need a knife?

432
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,320
A gun?

433
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,540
Yes, a gun!

434
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,220
That's what I've always been lacking at these things.

435
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,640
You didn't bring the gun?

436
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,200
No.

437
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,880
I should have brought a gun

438
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,380
so I could just haul off and kill everybody.

439
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,660
Look, the saucers aren't coming, okay?

440
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,700
It's a lie.

441
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm gonna Jonestown y'all right now.

442
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,980
We always forget the Kool-Aid.

443
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,820
Damn.

444
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,680
Alright, well, if this outfit doesn't get them here,

445
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,960
they're never fucking coming.

446
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
This is the last chance.

447
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,480
Wow, yeah, that's pretty hot stuff.

448
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,300
It is.

449
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,560
Subgenius...

450
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,580
Yeah, I have a new crown,

451
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,080
hoping that'll beckon them.

452
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,080
Maybe the subgenius vomit in my feet will bring them.

453
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,240
This'll be the first time,

454
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,700
no, the second time only that I'll be in here and so...

455
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:09,960
Alright.

456
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,640
So maybe they'll come because I'm here.

457
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,440
Well, wait, yeah.

458
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,580
Yeah, maybe they'll avoid us because you're here.

459
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,180
There's Hal.

460
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,380
Philo's coming in his box.

461
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


462
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


463
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,920
He's going to want a hat and he's going to want a bathrobe.

464
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,720
They want to hang on the back of the car.

465
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,780
This ain't burning, man.

466
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,560
I woke up this morning and I'm out of propane so I can't put no hot water in there.

467
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:29,940
Aw.

468
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,900
Well, there'll be rocket exhaust to heat that thing up pretty soon.

469
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,000
Bring your container to the circle and we'll warm the water for you.

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,640
I'm not worried about that.

471
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,040
I need it now.

472
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,160
We got beer if you're an animal.

473
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,340
I'm sure I'll be hitting that in about 45 minutes no matter what.

474
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,040
I'm just fine now.

475
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,780
I'm going to be back in bed in about 45 minutes, however this pans out.

476
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,400
That's all I care about.

477
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,280
You can just run them down. They're going to be resurrected in a minute.

478
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,820
Children on the path.

479
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,600
It never ceases to amaze me that anybody gets up for this at all.

480
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,020
This car will be unmanned.

481
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,000
Last year, we had a film crew here.

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,320
And I decided that the way I would handle the awkward thing where everybody stares at me,

483
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,200
waiting as if I was Bob or The Exes,

484
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,620
that I would walk around and interview people.

485
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,840
And I'll do that again.

486
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,500
We've got 15 minutes left of life.

487
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,180
I already did lose.

488
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,140
Did you stay awake all night?

489
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,600
I've been awake. I haven't slept yet.

490
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,500
I've been looking up and I haven't seen any lights.

491
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,200
Normally I'll see a UFO or two, but I haven't seen anything yet.

492
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,980
These are all the lights.

493
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,520
This is not like your regular UFOs.

494
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,000
You'll just suddenly burst into flame.

495
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,920
If you see people screaming, that's just part of the transition.

496
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,000
It's just like taking your shoes off.

497
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,600
You know, kicking off all beat up.

498
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,500
Who stayed up all night? Raise your hand.

499
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,460
No, come on.

500
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,300
I swam with sequins drinking.

501
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,260
You didn't stay up.

502
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:05,960
That's true.

503
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,020
Who got a little sleep? Raise your hand.

504
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,920
I got a little sleep.

505
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,540
Papa Joe has got his captains.

506
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,900
His captains.

507
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,660
I prefer to think of it as a saucer cap.

508
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,520
The saucer cap.

509
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,940
Princess, we have a new crown.

510
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,880
And I got a haircut for this one.

511
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,880
It does seem to be emanating a special power.

512
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,180
Well, I can promise you all this.

513
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,460
Whatever, however it goes, in 45 minutes we're going to be back in bed.

514
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,420
With a beard.

515
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,380
With a beard.

516
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:34,820
Yes.

517
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,660
With the exits.

518
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,240
Did you get some sleep?

519
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,100
Yes, sir.

520
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,040
I did. I'm feeling very bright eyed and bushy.

521
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,080
Very bushy.

522
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,580
Very, very bushy.

523
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,300
Philo, you're not in your tuxedo.

524
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,400
I was expecting you to be all put on in just a little bit.

525
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,300
Ten minutes and all those mosquito bites will be gone.

526
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,200
Yeah, two.

527
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,440
Wow, this is the most people I've seen for the next day and morning.

528
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,860
Guys, your black eye's almost healed up.

529
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,780
Oh yeah, it is.

530
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,840
Yeah, and the people aren't hitting you every ten minutes anymore?

531
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,080
No, no, not so much.

532
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,660
Changed your behavior a little bit?

533
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:11,920
Yeah.

534
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,300
Now we should get in the center of the circle here.

535
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,580
You need five seconds.

536
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,540
Oh, it's the center of the death right, I mean the uh, beam up machine.

537
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,480
Come on, Bob.

538
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,300
Wake up.

539
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,280
Yeah, yeah, we should be in the middle of the circle.

540
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,920
Reverend Sting, isn't it true that the men's bathrooms are just as good as the women's

541
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,660
bathrooms on the pleasure saucers?

542
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,300
That's all the time.

543
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,940
We already had the big...

544
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,900
Well, you won't need bathrooms unless you want them.

545
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,080
Well, we want them.

546
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,660
What are you talking about?

547
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,600
If you want to just sit and shit all day for eternity, you can do that.

548
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:42,960
That'd be great.

549
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,960
You got a problem with that?

550
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,340
We were promised that, right?

551
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:45,880
Yeah.

552
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,680
I still want to take a big dump in the morning.

553
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,200
Me too.

554
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,040
But I don't have to do it all day.

555
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,180
It's most satisfying.

556
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,180
It's orgasmic.

557
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,820
It's like a non-fact that people have a spirit.

558
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,960
Okay, seven minutes till 7 a.m.

559
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,680
Seven minutes till 7 a.m.

560
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
Do we hold hands?

561
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,220
Do we...

562
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
No, no, we usually do a countdown.

563
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,240
Who's gonna watch the words?

564
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,920
My watch happens to be locked to sidereal time by a satellite, so it doesn't have a second

565
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,960
hand, so I have to get it.

566
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,960


567
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,960


568
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,960


569
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,960


570
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:12,960


571
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,020
I guess that part did.

572
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:24,120
By the way, every year some old buddy of mine always goes, somebody, and they'll say this

573
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,420
rather bitterly, somebody said it would be 7 a.m.

574
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,240
Somebody says that every year.

575
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:30,820
Yeah.

576
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,980
What do they say every year?

577
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
Somebody had to decide it was 7 a.m.

578
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,200
What?

579
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,620
Why'd you have to decide that?

580
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,940
The ex-Jehovah One informed Bob what was gonna happen, and it wasn't like somebody said it

581
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


582
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


583
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


584
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


585
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


586
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


587
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


588
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:42,940


589
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,140
I mean, I sat down and went, so...

590
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,120
That's like going to the airport and saying, somebody had to decide this plane thing's

591
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,520
off now.

592
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,940
I paid 35 bucks, where's my Kool-Aid?

593
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,820
Right.

594
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,620
Well, give me your eternal salvation back and we can talk.

595
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,540
We pass out the un-Kool-Aid.

596
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,340
I calculated the other day that I've now done 1,372 hours of slack.

597
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,720
And I'm tired of it.

598
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm ready to let the best of me go.

599
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


600
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


601
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


602
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


603
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


604
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:12,920


605
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,540
I can't believe that they let me go.

606
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,280
I'm ready to let Lombs start heisting right now.

607
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,420
No, no, no.

608
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
Right here, you can get all that.

609
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,420
You gotta turn off the air.

610
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,020
Oh, look, there is Kool-Aid.

611
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,520
All right.

612
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,020
Believe it to Abnorm Ninehill, one of the three people left with a brain cell in his

613
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,160
brain.

614
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,580
This is un-Kool-Aid.

615
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,260
You're going all out.

616
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,780
Does it have LSD in it?

617
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,000
No.

618
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,820
Damn it.

619
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes, it does.

620
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,580
Probably doesn't even have vodka in it.

621
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,720
Boy, this is some shitty Kool-Aid that's on.

622
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:42,900


623
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:42,900


624
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:42,900


625
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:42,900


626
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay, here it is.

627
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,220
What's wrong with these people?

628
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,300
It's my cross to bear right there, buddy.

629
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,700
Four cross pipes.

630
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,880
Give me the countdown.

631
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,760
The ducted jump is the official.

632
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:06,300
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

633
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,520
One, two, three.

634
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,160
I can't take it.

635
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,600
We are full.

636
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,260
Full.

637
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,480
Take your swing.

638
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,380
The time is up.

639
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,280
Let's do the traditional.

640
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,200
After 15 years, 15 years, this is what we get.

641
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,980
My God.

642
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,960
Look at old Ivan's thing.

643
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,420
I'm so sad.

644
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,180
But it's a church.

645
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,480
It's a church.

646
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
It's a sub-church.

647
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,800
So care, because everything's caring.

648
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,000
I hate to say it.

649
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
We have done this before.

650
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,740
I'll try it.

651
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,620
This will technically be the 17th time.

652
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,380
This is the 17th time that you and me have spent here.

653
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,140
And him.

654
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,120
If you can't afford the real stuff.

655
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,800
Did I say cunt on any of your shows?

656
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,460
Did I say cunt?

657
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,860
I mean, it's like talking about cunts.

658
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,640
Cunts.

659
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,520
Yeah, let's have a cunt.

660
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,320
Everybody's been waiting with baiting.

661
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,860
Let's have a cunt down.

662
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,020
Masturbating breath.

663
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,760
Let's sacrifice banjo balls.

664
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,520
Dr. Dark says we have to have a cunt down.

665
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,340
I agree with cunt down.

666
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,920
When they promised him he would be aboard a pleasure saucer with all those delicious

667
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,000
hussies, he didn't realize he was going to be one of the hussies.

668
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,700
Well, that's the funny thing.

669
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,420
You know, we could all end up in jars.

670
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
You know, you would think if you can't.

671
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,980
Thinking we're on the pleasure saucer.

672
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
In fact, we could be in a jar.

673
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,040
Thinking we're standing here right now.

674
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,380
Ah!

675
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,320
Okay, run around screaming now.

676
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,980
It's all over.

677
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,260
Damn it.

678
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,660
Another.

679
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,380
You know what this means.

680
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,740
We have to finish the rest of X Day.

681
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
But that's okay.

682
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,340
We'll try it.

683
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,120
And Starwood.

684
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,400
Right here, Rock.

685
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,100
That means you have to work right now.

686
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,300
We're going to Starwood.

687
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,580
Our friends have used us.

688
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,480
It's so mundane.

689
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,140
It's like, damn.

690
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,120
It might be a signal that they're looking for it.

691
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,000
They need some way to hook us up.

692
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,260
Well, you know, I think we're going to have to do it.

693
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,260


694
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,260


695
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,260


696
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,260


697
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,720
You know, one year we tried pointing our butts at the sky, spelling out Bob's name

698
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,960
in butt cheeks.

699
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,240
You only needed one butt on either end of Bob because that formed the two quotes.

700
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,220
If you can't afford the real saucers, can't you at least afford real cyanide?

701
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,260
I mean, this is...

702
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,540
Trying to get one last bit.

703
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,040
Yeah, even the cyanide was crapped out.

704
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,980
Damn!

705
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,340
Last person we needed.

706
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,180
Has anybody fallen over dead yet?

707
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:36,240
No.

708
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,500
We're not going to get that rule.

709
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,620
Now, see, not only did we not get the access, the cyanide didn't even work right.

710
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,660
Yeah, I'm dead.

711
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm dead.

712
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,700
I'm here to tell you something.

713
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,860
Last time I saw Doves, he was in Tilly's, passed out in his own sea van.

714
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,900
And I got to find that one Ivan Stang.

715
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,940
No, no, the man he was right there.

716
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,620
I can smell it weakly.

717
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,800
Heading for it 1130 Friday night.

718
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,100
Now, for those of you who've never been to a subgenius 7 a.m. thing, you guys, now

719
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,100
you know what it's like.

720
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Everybody stands around staring at me and I come up with some last minute bullshit.

721
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,960
Phyllis said, maybe they're birds or something.

722
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,740
There's always some idiotic theory.

723
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,340
They're tiny.

724
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,580
They're the size of quarters.

725
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,100
It's like Twilight Zone.

726
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,260
The bottom line is, once again, it's proved that we don't know what year or even planet

727
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,040
this is.

728
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,600
So...

729
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,740
Makeup?

730
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:44,580
If we have to do this every year until 8661 by gobs, that's Bob's message to you.

731
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,400
Don't commit suicide until 8662.

732
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,280
Then you might as well give up.

733
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:55,740
Is it not written somewhere that once you live as if the abduction can occur at any

734
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
particular moment and you should always be acting as if your very essence...

735
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,940
Right.

736
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,820
That's the thing.

737
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,100
He could come as a thief in the night.

738
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,920
He already did, actually, obviously.

739
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,860
We're all 35 bucks or 30 bucks lighter.

740
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,620
Well, Stang, did we throw you in the sinkhole?

741
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,180
Oh, no, there is no sinkhole, you see.

742
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,860
Well, there's a pond, but it's pretty far.

743
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,540
It's too far from here.

744
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,760
Well, you're kind of light.

745
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,660
Four or five of us could just pick you up.

746
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,780
Oh, yeah?

747
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,920
You think?

748
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,480
Well, actually, I was thinking, hey, was it John?

749
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,080
Yeah, we could just...

750
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


751
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


752
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


753
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


754
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


755
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


756
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


757
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


758
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


759
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,080


760
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,840
We could just shove him in the Jenkum chamber head first.

761
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,560
Yeah, that might work.

762
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,920
The extra meditation chamber.

763
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,240
Been there, done that.

764
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,400
How do you think...

765
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,620
What do you think I did all night?

766
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,840
You were huffing that...

767
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,020
I was huffing Jenkum all night long going, oh, Bob, oh, Bob, I see you, I see you.

768
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,400
Well, sorry it didn't work out your first sex day, but...

769
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:56,520
We did.

770
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,780
We were hoping you'd be the difference, you know?

771
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,240
I'm sorry we couldn't like...

772
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,980
So, in other words, it's your fault.

773
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:03,920
Well, I'm sorry.

774
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,040
Oh, I just thought of something.

775
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,260
I just remembered something I've been meaning to do, and I'll forget.

776
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,760
I need a recording of everyone in unison saying, and neither can we.

777
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,640
As you would imagine someone on a big screen saying, I can't believe you people are still

778
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,400
doing this.

779
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,740
And we need a recording of a crowd saying, and neither can we.

780
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,220
So on three...

781
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,600
Three.

782
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,980
I would like everyone to shout out, and neither can we.

783
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,060
And neither can we.

784
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,500
No, wait a minute, on three.

785
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,360
Neither can we.

786
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,940
No, on three.

787
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
No, no, no, wait, wait.

788
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,260
And neither can we.

789
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,320
Okay.

790
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,100
One, two, three.

791
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,320
And neither can we.

792
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,320
Yeah.

793
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,900
Fuck him.

794
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,500
Not even we?

795
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,440
Okay.

796
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,400
That's all I needed.

797
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
The idea is...

798
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,400
And neither can we.

799
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,120
I probably will be around forever.

800
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,900
All right.

801
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


802
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


803
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


804
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


805
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


806
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


807
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:03,900


808
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,300
Because I have that much hate in my heart.

809
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,120
I'm too ornery and mean.

810
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,180
And I still have too many bobbies to insult to die.

811
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,660
But I'd like to make a videotape.

812
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,640
Like in some old sci-fi story.

813
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,300
I'll even put on makeup so I look like I'm 80.

814
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,680
Where I basically, it's to be shown at every X day after I'm dead.

815
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,220
So that it's, they turn the projector on and there's me going,

816
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,580
I can't believe you people are still doing this.

817
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,440
And that's what that recording is for.

818
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,760
Then the whole crowd goes, and neither can we.

819
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:54,660
We have come to recite the magic mantra from Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.

820
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Do come, eh, do come, eh, do come, eh.

821
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,580
It's an invocation used to gather fools into a circle.

822
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,640
Oh, well, we don't need that.

823
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,360
This is where shit gets weird.

824
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,700
Do come, eh, do come, eh, do come, eh.

825
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,140
Do come, eh, do come, eh, do come, eh.

826
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
The fools are already gathered in a circle.

827
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,080
So is it worth walking in a circle?

828
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,000
Obviously.

829
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,020
No, I thought it was repent, quit your job, slack off.

830
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,940
And the fools come to the circle.

831
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,840
That's the translation.

832
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,280
Now how many of y'all here quit your jobs and maxed out your crap?

833
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,520
I did.

834
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:27,520


835
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,940
Janice did.

836
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,940
Potter and Ostril did.

837
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,100
Crash did.

838
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,660
I did, actually.

839
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,800
My credit card wasn't maxed out until I came to X-Day.

840
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,820
And I'll pay it off right before next X-Day, and then I'll max it out again.

841
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I gotta try fully nude.

842
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,440
I don't know what else to do.

843
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,840
You know, I'm starting to suspect this is a scam of some kind.

844
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,500
No way.

845
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,140
How could that be?

846
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,260
A preacher like Bob would lie or be wrong?

847
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,880
How could that be?

848
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,040
A holy man?

849
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,760
I know it sounds incredible.

850
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,800
But having sat out here and not been taken away by the saucers year after year,

851
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,200
I can't help but wonder whether we've been sold a bill of goods.

852
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,840
It's only been 17 years.

853
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,720
None of us are disappointed or anything.

854
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,420
Oh, wait a minute.

855
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,260
I miscounted.

856
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,180
I thought it was more than that.

857
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,920
Never mind.

858
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,760
It's another thing.

859
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,700
Yeah, but we'll...

860
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,520
No, this isn't a scam.

861
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,300
If it happens 20 times, then we'll know it might be a scam.

862
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,840
Maybe after 21, it's a scam.

863
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:44,280
Now, Nostradamus said the great king of something would come from the sky in July of 1999.

864
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:50,540
Edgar Cayce said that the great change would happen in 1998.

865
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,740
Yeah, but it's 2012.

866
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,680
I wonder why...

867
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,900
I wonder why Bob...

868
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,800
Ended up with one date from one prophet and one date from another prophet.

869
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,020
I just happened to be kind of coincidentally crammed together.

870
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,960
As awesome as it would be.

871
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,300
I just saved your life, Irvin Sting.

872
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,660
Huh?

873
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,960
What's with those of us...

874
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,420
Oh, nothing?

875
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:10,860
Why?

876
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,500
Why bother?

877
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,580
No, it's nothing.

878
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,740
Is it a kick me sign or a fuck me sign?

879
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,080
Do you remember that time?

880
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,340
No, I was going to light your ponytail.

881
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,720
You set your hair on fire and I stopped him.

882
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,600
Thank you.

883
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,240
You're welcome.

884
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,060
It worked the other X day.

885
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,500
I want to try it again.

886
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,940
But he just got a haircut.

887
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,880
Why would you do...

888
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,140
I don't know.

889
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:26,620
I don't know.

890
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


891
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


892
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


893
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


894
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


895
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


896
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


897
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


898
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


899
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:26,620


900
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,480
Because the ends are not...

901
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,180
The X day in 98, you two guys stood up there trying to burn your membership cards because...

902
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,580
What do you mean trying?

903
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,240
Well, yeah, but the thing was you had all lost your voices because you were such amateurs

904
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,040
that you couldn't explain what you were doing.

905
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
You weren't out with a fucking...

906
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,900
I had to basically go, oh, they're burning your membership cards because they don't want

907
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,920
to be on board saucers with a bunch of losers like y'all.

908
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,280
No.

909
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,880
As if we were all going to be on one saucer.

910
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,680
You mean we're not?

911
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,400
No.

912
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,100
What?

913
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,080
God damn it.

914
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,840
Have you not read your prescriptures?

915
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,700
I helped write them.

916
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,940
I didn't fucking say I had to read...

917
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,760
No, everybody gets their own saucer.

918
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,260
It's like the size of a planet.

919
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,040
I want a cup.

920
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,020
I'm so glad you agreed with me on that.

921
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,620
Oh, yeah.

922
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,880
There's no way, man.

923
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,460
Like we're going to be on one big shuttle.

924
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,120
Do you fucking...

925
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,140
Yeah, right.

926
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,920
I don't want to go on their ship with the rest of these assholes.

927
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,180
No, no, no.

928
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,600
No, I...

929
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,880
Next up, we have one of my favorite people and a brilliant contributor to this church.

930
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,740
She's already talking it down.

931
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,060
Everybody give a hand for Reverend Susie the Floozy.

932
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,660
Susie, there's a piece of...

933
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,220
Oh, yeah, the higher price spread.

934
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,400
These aren't ears.

935
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,720
What?

936
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,340
What did you say?

937
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,800
I can't hear you.

938
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,440
I'm the Reverend Susie the Floozy, the girl with the EZ Glide applicator, and I'm here

939
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,200
to give you a little bit of the truth.

940
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,800
I'm afraid that it's a sad truth.

941
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,040
It's an inconvenient truth.

942
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,400
It is an in-fucking-electable truth.

943
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,800
And the truth is that we're still on this goddamn planet.

944
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,040
What the hell?

945
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,440
What the bleeding hell, Bob?

946
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,700
I woke up this morning and we're still here.

947
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,000
My ass is still wedged into the stinking reality of this planet's insufficient atmosphere,

948
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,900
its crippling gravitational pull, and the near total absence of slack.

949
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,380
Slack.

950
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,800
Oh, in fact, there is such a dearth of slack on Cat Box Earth that we have to make our

951
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,280
own.

952
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,320
We have to create our own slack however we can.

953
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,480
And we have to do it.

954
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,500
We must do it because it's so intrinsic to our survival that we can't do otherwise.

955
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,900
Oh, here in this soul-sapping gravity well, we are subject not so much to the laws of

956
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,320
man.

957
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,080
But to the laws of this stinking goddamned planet.

958
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,620
And here we are stuck here.

959
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,260
Oh, the allegedly natural laws of this shit-ass orb are tearing us apart.

960
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,740
And to call it a planet?

961
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:46,260
They have the gall to call this Walmart-covered piece of shit a planet?

962
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,880
Oh.

963
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,380
This is a human race.

964
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,860
This is a humongous, unflushed corporate toilet clogged with corporate logos and bullshit.

965
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,920
It's choking us all on its rancid waste.

966
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to the next year the same way I'd be looking

967
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,760
forward to another firehose colonic.

968
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,180
And just for reference, I really don't like those.

969
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,200
I did try them once.

970
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,300
But oh, god.

971
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,160
What an ass burner.

972
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:25,660
I mean, it would be really, it would be quicker to have a firehose colonic than having to

973
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,640
live here in this place.

974
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:35,780
But you know, I think it's lucky that the Palmerhead blew itself up in 1998, the first

975
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,640
1998.

976
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,700
But it turned out not to be the true 1998.

977
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,580
Because I think Arnie knew what was going to happen.

978
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,080
And even he didn't want to stick around.

979
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,140


980
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,140


981
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,600
Oh, he knew the grid was coming down.

982
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,220
The sacred priest scriptures would start unreeling fact after fact.

983
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,760
Oh, the word of Dobbs would become truer than we knew.

984
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,680
Oh, and pigs are going to have to start eating each other to survive.

985
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,060
Well, we've all seen they're already on that agenda.

986
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,320
Oh.

987
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,140
Which kind of begs the thought that there are no original laws.

988
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,140


989
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,140


990
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,440
There are no ideas left in this place.

991
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,100
We've used it up.

992
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,980
We've tapped everything it has to offer.

993
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,460
Yet still, we are here.

994
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,300
I mean, think of it.

995
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,580
Google your own favorite particular phrase of your own coining.

996
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,840
And chances are it's a name of a shitty band somewhere.

997
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,700
There is nothing left.

998
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,900
Nothing.

999
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,800
But here we are.

1000
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,080
No fun.

1001
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,140
No fucks.

1002
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,060
No slaps.

1003
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,280
No back.

1004
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,040
Oh, fuck.

1005
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,960
And to further complicate matters, just look around you at the old doctors here.

1006
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,340
There's one glowing right there.

1007
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,260
Another one glowing over there, although he's not electronic.

1008
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:17,940
Oh, there are subgenius over men among us who stride this stinking planet like fucking gods.

1009
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
Oh.

1010
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,160
But they might be eternal.

1011
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,700
But there's a limit to how much an old doctor wants to put up with.

1012
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,040
I know I'm starting to feel the strain.

1013
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,320
Ah, jeez.

1014
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:46,020
We get fucking sick and tired of the constant, unremitting, savage erosion of the subgenius

1015
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,960
spirit trapped here in this planet.

1016
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,040
And I'm not even going to say that I'm not.

1017
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1018
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1019
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1020
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1021
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1022
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1023
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1024
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1025
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1026
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1027
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1028
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1029
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1030
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1031
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1032
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1033
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1034
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1035
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1036
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1037
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1038
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,040


1039
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,220
I'm just going to say that you're not.

1040
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,780
Oh, these mighty men of Dobbs have garnered laurels worth resting upon.

1041
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:03,680
But still they tread the boards and pound that pulpit just to bring you the slack that

1042
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,140
you need.

1043
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,860
Oh, but you know, seekers, getting slack in this slackless world does not depend only

1044
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,100
upon the only people you have heard so far.

1045
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:25,740
Our mighty yeti over men are but links in a long, long chain that spirals back through

1046
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:34,140
our civilization to the dawn of time, to the first Dobbs, the proto-Dobbs who came along

1047
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,100
and saw everything and said, this sucks.

1048
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:39,800
Why?

1049
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,980
And tried to make it better.

1050
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,080
These are not the last links in the chain.

1051
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,420
The chain is going to have to go on because we are stuck here.

1052
00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:00,720
We have got to take this fucking planet by both ears and wrench it, wrest our slack from

1053
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,300
it, and do whatever we can to make it a livable place.

1054
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,920
But you know, those doctors have been running a race.

1055
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,980
It's like a relay race.

1056
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,060
And they are about to slap the world.

1057
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,340
And they are about to put that baton right in somebody's hand and pass it on.

1058
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:30,120
But if there is no hand there, you, you are the fucking hands.

1059
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,700
You are the hands of Dobbs.

1060
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,000
All of you.

1061
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,140
Praise fucking Bob.

1062
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,460
Praise Bob.

1063
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,040
You are the ones who can bring your brothers slack because the subgenius, the subgenius

1064
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,420
must have slack.

1065
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,840
God damn it.

1066
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:02,480
But without a hand to grasp that baton, honey, we are dicked.

1067
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,340
And do you know how I mean dicked?

1068
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,320
Well, you know how it is when all of your crap decides to collect into a watermelon-sized

1069
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:24,580
bolus that threatens when it comes out to pull your entire elementary canal out of

1070
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,280
you up to your goddamn tonsils?

1071
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,960
Well, it's kinda like that.

1072
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:39,720
It's also like staple gunning your dick over your face to the back of your head.

1073
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,940
And then staple gunning your balls to your feet.

1074
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,460
Well, you've tried getting your slack the wrong way, dumbass.

1075
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,640
It's a lot like that.

1076
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,040
But it's also a lot like reaming out your colon with one of those big-ass metal chimney brushes

1077
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,660
and then squirting a little lime on it just to even it out.

1078
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,120
Now, combined with pissing off a whole den of rape bears,

1079
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,740
which I think we've got a missing Bobby, by the way.

1080
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,400
He was last seen covered with cherry, and I understand that attracts him.

1081
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,140
But put it all together, and that amount of pain is going to be what you're going to experience yourselves

1082
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,880
without slack, dumbasses.

1083
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
Up, up, up.

1084
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,820
I at least fear and admire doctors must be succeeded by a new generation

1085
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,340
because it is up to you to take on the medals to become the new makers of slack.

1086
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:59,180
I mean, we are stuck on this planet, and we may be here as fucking sad as it is to say.

1087
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,360
We might be stuck here a long fucking time.

1088
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,580
And if we are going to have a chance,

1089
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,280
for the love of Dobbs,

1090
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,820
you are going to have to make your heritage as a child of Bob.

1091
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,820
I didn't know I'd give you a homework assignment, huh?

1092
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,080
So think about it.

1093
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,160
Because our very lives as subgeniuses are at stake.

1094
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,120
Because without slack, I mean, you'd be living.

1095
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,640
But you wouldn't really be living a life worth living.

1096
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,580
The ball is in your court.

1097
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,000
The ball is Stang's.

1098
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:53,560
It's time for you to take Stang's ball and take it to places it's never been.

1099
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:05,100
And whatever you do, make that nut proud.

1100
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,400
Thank you.

1101
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,900
Y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all.

1102
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,120
Everyone, give Susie the Floozy a big hand!

1103
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,140
Woo!

1104
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,260
Stang's faith was strong but you needed proof.

1105
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,060
For thirty-five bucks you sought the truth.

1106
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,620
Yearly failures, well, they overcame.

1107
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1108
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1109
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1110
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1111
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1112
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1113
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1114
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1115
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:38,620


1116
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,460
But the truth was through you.

1117
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,920
You wailed and screamed into the air.

1118
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,720
Broke your pipe, ripped out your hair.

1119
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,480
From your lips you screamed out,

1120
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,500
Dobbs will screw you.

1121
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,340
Dobbs will screw you.

1122
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,220
Dobbs will screw you.

1123
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,260
Dobbs will screw you.

1124
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,780
Dobbs will screw you.

1125
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,220
You may have took Bob's name in vain.

1126
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,060
And, well, he may have felt the same.

1127
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,200
But if he did, well, really, what's it to you?

1128
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:27,840
Your pee stench lingers in every bill that you put in the foundation still.

1129
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,680
Still whispers bear the warnings,

1130
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,920
Dobbs will screw you.

1131
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,200
Dobbs will screw you.

1132
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,120
Dobbs will screw you.

1133
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,020
Dobbs will screw you.

1134
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,380
Dobbs will screw you.

1135
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,280
There'll be a time when we all know

1136
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,040
We watch the burning down below

1137
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,480
You wonder if you'll make it till the new year

1138
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,900
One day his promise will ring true.

1139
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,180
Yeah.

1140
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,700
You'll have your slack and you'll smoke it too.

1141
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,500
Forget the day we swore that Dobbs would screw you.

1142
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,280
Dobbs will screw you.

1143
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,200
Dobbs will screw you.

1144
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,200
Dobbs will screw you.

1145
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,860
Dobbs will screw you.

1146
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,180
Dobbs will screw you.

1147
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,360
Frop, frop slack.

1148
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:08,560
Up, up, slack.

1149
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,660
Flop, flop, slack.

1150
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,340
Pills, pills, pills, pills.

1151
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,500
Give me gentlemen kind of pills, flop.

1152
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,660
Pills, pills, pills, pills.

1153
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,800
Give me gentlemen kind of pills, flop.

1154
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,380
Flop, slack, flop, slack.

1155
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,460
Flop, slack, flop, flop, slack.

1156
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,200
Bop! Flack!

1157
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,820
Frock! Flack!

1158
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,220

Give me Gemcon Pillsbop!

1160
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,560
Give me Gemcon Pillsbop!

1161
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,820
Give me Gemcon Pillsbop!

1162
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,560
Do you have a, Frop stick

1163
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,840
Do you have a light

1164
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,180
Do you have a,

1165
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,740
Frop stick

1166
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,900

1168
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,240

00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,140
Do you have a, frop stick

1170
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,260
Let's get high tonight

1171
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,920
Give me MP Sim吸

1172
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,380

00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,420
Give me MP Sim mor玉

1174
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,700

00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,060
Give me MP Sim吸

1176
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,600

1177
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,520
Give me MP Sim cub

1178
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,860
Frop, Fluck, Slack

1179
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,960
Frop, Frop, Slack

1180
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,140
Frop, Frop, Slack

1181
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,740
Frop, Frop, Slack. An effective little anti-drug song, wouldn't you say?

1182
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,620
That's what it was, an anti-drug song. That's the message.

1183
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,320
If you use drugs, this is how you might end up.

1184
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,160
Terrifying.

1185
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,900
You're listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1186
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,900
You can get infinite gouts of information from our website, subgenius.com, if you are so inclined.

1187
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,340
The music in the background right now is DJ 2 Beans, the song Escape Vessel.

1188
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,180
Coming up, a short but sobering sermon by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

1189
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,260
and an inspirational gospel hymn by the Mutant Mountain Boys.

1190
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,560
But first...

1191
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,180
From Mr. Fernandez and Andy Lemur, PR News.

1192
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm suffering from prostate cancer.

1193
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,860
On the television talk shows this morning, President Obama came in third.

1194
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,060
Mr. Obama is hosting a NATO bombing in Chicago.

1195
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,560
President Obama says more lives will be lost there.

1196
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,200
PR News, Chicago.

1197
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,340
It's not.

1198
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,960
It appears Congress is about 500 feet from the chief of PR's nuclear program,

1199
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,120
and Congress would have to keep money that's already been spent.

1200
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
There's been almost daily violence since then.

1201
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,780
This is PR News.

1202
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,960
Without race, color, sex, language, religion, political opinion, or national or social origin.

1203
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:17,600
The only man ever found guilty in the 1988 PR News has died in Washington.

1204
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:26,540
You know, lately, I've been hearing and seeing a lot of people's pain and misery.

1205
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:35,720
People seem to have, or many people, very unfortunate childhoods and upbringings, maybe youth.

1206
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,980
And now they're older, they seem to carry a lot of this around with them as excess baggage.

1207
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:49,400
And I would have to say to them, look, we've all come from different circumstances,

1208
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,300
and we all have our own particular variety of things that have happened to us.

1209
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,940
But good or bad, to carry them around,

1210
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,480
with you for the rest of your life, long after the item has occurred,

1211
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,140
is, it's just excess baggage.

1212
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,680
It's what weighs you down.

1213
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,760
It's what makes you tired because you carry the psychic baggage around with you.

1214
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:21,300
The only thing that is true and matters is now, because that's where we all live.

1215
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,280
We all live now.

1216
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,980
We don't live in the past much as we'd like to, and much as we imagine the future.

1217
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,780
We are stuck.

1218
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,560
We're stuck with now.

1219
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,900
And now you don't need the bad memories, the guilt, the pain, the remorse.

1220
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,340
You don't need it.

1221
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,820
You may want it, and that's your psychological problem.

1222
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,240
But the thing is, the past is not something you carry around with you on your back.

1223
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,940
The past is something you should be able to access at will.

1224
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,540
The past should not rule your life.

1225
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,620
You should contain and rule your past.

1226
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,280
Now is what's important.

1227
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,360
Only now.

1228
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:03,700
And how we feel now, not how we used to feel or how we hope we'll feel,

1229
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,540
or what we used to think about this or what we hope we'll think about that,

1230
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,300
that's not important.

1231
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,980
What is important is now, what we think now, what we do now, what we hear and see now.

1232
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,900
We must live in the now.

1233
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,960
That doesn't mean now you don't think about the future or don't think about the past.

1234
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,260
It's just don't carry on.

1235
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,900
Don't carry the past around with you.

1236
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,720
It's much heavier than the future.

1237
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:41,000
And if you're not sure what you think about the future, well, you can pay Bob and find

1238
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,780
out what you really think.

1239
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,280
Here's one that's been played on the hour of slack a few times.

1240
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,040
This may have been heard before.

1241
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,800
Although that was played on the hour of slack, too.

1242
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:56,680
I don't know.

1243
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,260
I don't know.

1244
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,460
Here it goes.

1245
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,400
Ah ha!

1246
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,400
So scary!

1247
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,920
Oh, that was scary.

1248
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,100
Here goes my little help.

1249
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1250
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1251
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1252
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,100


1253
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,200


1254
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,340
We get to celebrate.

1255
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:39,540
ourselves I am mr. James T Quirk and I am Samantha aka Reverend dr. pastor prime

1256
00:55:44,960 --> 00:56:04,880
Reverend Robin mountain boy here nice to meet y'all you ain't seen me with my pants off

1257
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:36,980
look away from nothing to that billowing from your life work and talk away there's a hole in

1258
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,420
your soul that is burning you

1259
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:43,440
out like where's blacked and will never decay

1260
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:52,320
check for the turtle slack from to the billowing

1261
00:56:52,320 --> 00:57:01,780
with your back from the pigs to the billowing

1262
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:30,160
if responsibilities get ready to bear and you're blind walk through life so

1263
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:39,280
there's a hypnotic man who is back on a from his disembodied head

1264
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,560
always there

1265
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:49,380
from the pinks to the billowing

1266
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,240
look away

1267
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,860
from the face to that billowing

1268
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:24,640
if your conflicts with normals bring struggles and strife

1269
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:33,240
then onward your fendings and look away from nothing to that billowing

1270
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,600
there's a waiting and I'll stand for you

1271
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,520
you look away from the things to the billowing pipe there's a waiting and I'll stand for you

1272
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:39,520


1273
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:46,540
look away from the things to the billowing pipe

1274
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:57,020
triple bob on your money back from the pinks to the billowing pipe

1275
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:09,400
and neither can we

1276
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:09,520
and neither can we

1277
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,100
god is

1278
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,720
there is no more money

1279
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,180
we gotta get some money

1280
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:34,200
friends we're glad you listened to this show and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months

1281
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,400
not just this show but subgenius.com and all the other archives sites

1282
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:39,500
you can find us on the web or on facebook

1283
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:39,500


1284
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:57,160
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages and help out financially as best you can.

1285
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:05,160
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1286
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,140
But some of you still have jobs.

1287
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:15,020
Even $5 makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1288
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,420
$50 makes an even bigger difference.

1289
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,880
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay jobs.

1290
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,020
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

1295
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,380
C'mon.

1296
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,140
Let's find that new broken heart.

1297

Just talk to my dad, and I'll throw out all of your paychecks.

1298
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:16,280
Just want to hear the hell you think about your life.

If you want us to do a finance job, we can.

1302
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:17,760
No shot?

1303
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,520
We're going to one night.

1304
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,580
An hour?

1305
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,480
Without coffee?

1306
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,360
