1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
Let me make this perfectly clear to you.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,940
The contents of this document are a matter of national security,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,620
constituting an assault on the character of several important party members,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,980
as well as a blatant violation of the Articles of Allegiance.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,300
Any discussion of this document or its contents will be regarded at the very least as an act of sedition,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,420
if not a willful act of treason.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,600
Ah, yes, dear friends, speaking here from Stang Ranch in Stang County, Texas, with no studio.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,520
This Hour of Slack was an easy one for me and a great change of pace

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:38,740
because it's all one fantastic old-school media barrage by the hard-working and talented Reverend Exister,

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,200
normally heard weekly on our sister subgenius show, The Ministry of Slack.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,980
It's a collage using what would be to him older movies and music,

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,120
and it reminds me of our carefully arranged media barrages that we used to create on reel-to-reel tape

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,660
back in the 80s before Hour of Slack was born.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,580
I don't think Bob or subgenius are mentioned at all, but it is pure subgenius.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,820
It's 90 minutes long, so this is only part one of Ship of State by Reverend Exister.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,400
You would do well to put it out of your mind.

17
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,060
My, what a peculiar place to have a party.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,020
You know, Dinah, we really shouldn't...

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,200
We're doing this.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,700
After all, we haven't been invited.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,640
And curiosity often leads to trouble.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,160
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,320
Goodbye, Dinah.

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,220
Goodbye!

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,120
Goodbye!

26
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,940
...before God, God, all prophets, and then wars, and then, of course, disease, and all...

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,920
...and all...

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
...and all...

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,300
...and all...

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,740
...and all...

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,760
...and all...

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,040
...and all...

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,640
...and all...

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,480
...and all...

35
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,540
...and all...

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,380
...and all...

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,580
The window opened and went straight to Kelly Dodson's room and called in the signer.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,720
I can't hear you guys.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,320
You need it for some reason.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,220
I don't think so.

41
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,540
Dodson says she put up a mic as the man attacked her.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,580
She choked him.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,200
She choked him.

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,760
Dodson says, I got a good look on your face.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,500
Thanks.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,000
And again, now you've turned to the next thing that happened.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,020
And then in verse 12, he opens the sixth seal.

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,320
And behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as hair, the moon as blood,

49
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,020
and stars of heaven fell, and he sees heavenly signs.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,260
What's the next thing that's described as a big intervention?

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,460
Can you believe that moment?

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, my gosh.

53
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,320
Well, after this I should be able to do nothing but falling down the stairs.

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
Oh, Mr. Bannis! Wait! Please!

55
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,460
Wait! Mr. Bannis! Mr. Bannis! Mr. Bannis!

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,580
Dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on Burr's stomach.

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,820
This city's afraid of me. I've seen its true face.

58
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,600
The streets are extended gutters, and the gutters are full of blood.

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,380
When the drains finally scap over, all the vermin will drown.

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
The economy will be ruined.

61
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,180
The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up around their waists.

62
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,800
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout,

63
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,240
Save us!

64
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,260
And all whisper,

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,860
No.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,380
Now the whole world stands on the brink, staring down into bloody hell.

67
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,040
All those intellectuals, smooth talkers.

68
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,640
And all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.

69
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Beneath me, this awful city, it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
And the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.

71
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,120
What do you suggest we do about it?

72
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,420
Retribution.

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,620
Nobody knows who you are. You can give it up.

74
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,540
Try and have a normal life.

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,600
Is that what you have now? A normal life?

76
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,500
When you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies,

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,920
past the human cockroaches talking about their heroin and child pornography,

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,000
do you really feel normal?

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,880
At least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,440
No.

81
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,540
You're hiding in plain sight.

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,440
You're right.

83
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,120
I have Совokijin that little人民

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,120


85
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,380


86
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,380


87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,460
It's the wave of nohara.

88
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:40,460


89
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,020
This wave is an Iranian wave.

90
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,480
It leaves a deep scar on our body.

91
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,980
Like choppers incc NFS.

92
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
Welcome to the archive.

93
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,080
You have selected historical file number 12-1.

94
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,500
In the beginning, there was man.

95
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,560
And for a time, it was good.

96
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,940
But humanity's so-called civil societies soon fell victim to vanity and corruption.

97
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,420
Thus did man become the architect of his own demise.

98
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,540
But for a time, it was good.

99
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,860
Because if you don't understand that, it's going to be very difficult for you to understand

100
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,320
this book.

101
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,860
The time when the Antichrist takes over, he's going to have full power.

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,420
And we read in Revelation chapter 13 and verse 1, John in his vision said, and I stood upon

103
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,100
the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads.

104
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,520
And I said, I'm going to take you to the sea.

105
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,520


106
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,520


107
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,260
So I said, well, if you're asking which edition I am, you're going to have five heads.

108
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,580
And then trying to complete that boom in the writing, two datas, five parts.

109
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,440
If I'm like a paper, there will be a paper bunny skin.

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,440


111
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,420
And I'd like to take 토� thinking, to come right to the point that the way I am is

112
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,420


113
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,520
seriously be吃ed up, that way instead of believing.

114
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,340
I wanted to engage in sof たффель.

115
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,340


116
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,240
To be honest, I wish I could have��게 principles as best a doctor would do.

117
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,120
It was a big Tiger from selbst dur�,橙 Imp Oleo.

120
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:48,520
Strangers have been on desperate land.

121
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
So the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet.

122
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,680
A final solution.

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,000
So.

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,420
And all the children are insane

125
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,900
Now if you don't understand this as I say, you won't crack the code, you won't understand what he's talking about.

126
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,960
All the children are insane

127
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,820
Wait for the surrey

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,260
Now, that brings up a real question.

129
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,440
Do we interpret the book of the revelation literally or symbolically?

130
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,280
Which do you think?

131
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,540
All right, you maggots.

132
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,800
I know we love you.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,760
You're ready.

134
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,300
Move out.

135
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,520
Hey Jesus, lane, you ain't going to believe this.

136
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,880
Look.

137
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,320
Hey.

138
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,900
Hi.

139
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,400
Hi.

140
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,300
So.

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,480
So.

142
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,160
Somewhere under the rainbow

143
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,400
Where you're at

144
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,980
Somewhere under the rainbow

145
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,380
Somewhere under the rainbow

146
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Somewhere under the rainbow

147
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:37,260
Somewhere under the rainbow

148
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,040
Dreams really do come true

149
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,660
Bless all forms of intelligence.

150
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,820
Your flesh is a relic of your vessel.

151
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,240
Your soul is a relic of your soul.

152
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,160
I'm here a week now, getting softer.

153
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,380
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.

154
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,180
Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.

155
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,180
Pretty sure I didn't even half as much as I've always sought before.

156
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,180


157
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,620

This message must resound throughout the entire Italy.

165
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,080
I want this country to realize that we stand on the edge of oblivion.

166
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,440
I want every man, woman, and child to understand how close we are to chaos.

167
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,940
I want every to remember why they need us.

168
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,940
Oh, stop it!

169
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,740
I can't say it's my job.

170
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,280
I need to get up up here.

171
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,300
It's the boys!

172
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,920
I need to get up.

173
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,500
I said, leave me alone!

174
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
I need to get up.

175
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:17,480


176
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,120
God exists, and he's American.

177
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,160
Now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept,

178
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,740
don't be alarmed.

179
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,400
That indicates only that you are still sane.

180
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,020
You are still sane.

181
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:44,580
You are still sane.

182
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,640
I am looking at the stars.

183
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,280
They're so far away.

184
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,480
And their light takes so long to reach us.

185
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,780
All we ever see of stars are their old photographs.

186
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,940
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm sorry.

188
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,020
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


190
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


191
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


192
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


193
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


194
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


195
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


196
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


197
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


198
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,020


199
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,180
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,280
I prefer the stillness here.

201
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,720
I am tired of Earth.

202
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,460
These people.

203
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.

204
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,080
This is not real.

205
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,260
And the real world lies somewhere else.

206
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,800
A typical mental delusion.

207
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,520
We get unbalanced kids like this all the time.

208
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,380
Reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people.

209
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,820
This world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that.

210
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,680
It's called denying reality.

211
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,160
It's, you know, just a self-defense mechanism for those type of kids.

212
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,460
Well, he's in another world now.

213
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,380
Make no mistake about that.

214
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,380
I'm sorry.

215
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,180
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,860
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm sorry.

219
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,240


220
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,240


221
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm so sorry.

222
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,340
I'm so sorry.

223
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,000
Getting stressed.

224
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,980
I said way too much.

225
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,720


227
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm sorry.

228
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,380
I blew off one of your 단지 стро sewer systems two years ago.

229
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm even more sorry than I am now .

230
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,200
Don't use that word.

231
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,200


232
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,540
radly on the format to�

233
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,140
I think I've seen more than half of that about you,artsu.

234
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,140


235
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,140


236
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,140


237
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,440
I think you all looking tous extravalent as you need me to.

238
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,520
I think I was always linked to a girl namedzone for the love between some of us who hat

239
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
we guys are.

240
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,240
Back talk.

241
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,500
the dreamers banished to obscurity

242
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,820
I'm trying to change all that

243
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,580
and I hope you are too

244
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,680
by dreaming

245
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,440
every day

246
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,920
dreaming with our hands

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
and dreaming with our minds

248
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,020
our planet is facing the greatest problems

249
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,720
it's ever faced

250
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:58,940
ever

251
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,060
so whatever you do don't be bored

252
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,020
this is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped to be alive

253
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,640
and things are just starting

254
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,860
so

255
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,320
they claim

256
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,820
they're

257
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,000
they're

258
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,000


259
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
labors are to build a heaven

260
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,720
yet their heaven is populated with ours

261
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,320
perhaps the world is not made

262
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,340
perhaps nothing is made

263
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
a clock

264
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,360
without a craftsman

265
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,500
it's too late

266
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,900
always has been

267
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,540
always will be

268
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,820
too late

269
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,680
, but we can't fight city hall

270
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,560
death and taxes

271
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,840
don't talk about politics or religion

272
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,460
this is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line

273
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,620
lay down GI, lay down GI

274
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,880
we saw it all through the 20th century

275
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,960
and now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize

276
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,400
that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze

277
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,940
we should not submit to dehumanization

278
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,560
I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world

279
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm concerned with what's happening in this world

280
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm concerned with the structure

281
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,620
I'm concerned with the systems of control

282
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
those that control my life

283
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,580
and those that seek to control it even more

284
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,240
I want freedom

285
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,400
that's what I want

286
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,780
and that's what Jason wants

287
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,460
it's up to each and every one of us to turn with just some of the greed

288
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,320
the hatred

289
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,800
the envy

290
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,600
and yes the insecurities

291
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,620
because that is the central mode of control

292
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,760
make us feel pathetic

293
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,160
small

294
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,420
so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty

295
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,180
our liberty

296
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,320
our destiny

297
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,600
we have got to realize we're being conditioned

298
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,900
on a mass scale

299
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,860
start challenging this corporate slave state

300
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,240
the 21st century is going to be a new century

301
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,000
not the century of slavery

302
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,840
not the century of lies

303
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,140
and issues of no significance

304
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,240
and classism

305
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,100
and statism

306
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,780
and all the rest of the modes of control

307
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,420
it's going to be the age of humankind

308
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,340
standing up for something pure

309
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,240
and something right

310
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,760
what a bunch of garbage

311
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,160
liberal

312
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,880
democrat

313
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,520
conservative

314
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,240
republican

315
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,960
it's all there to control

316
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,500
two sides of the same coin

317
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,320
two management teams

318
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,580
bidding for control

319
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,660
the CEO job

320
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,060
of slavery incorporated

321
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,400
the truth is out there in front of you

322
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,340
but they lay out this buffet of lies

323
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm sick of it

324
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,440
and I'm not going to take a bite out of it

325
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,240
do you got me?

326
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,380
resistance is not futile

327
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,900
we're going to win this thing

328
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,460
humankind is too good

329
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,200
we're not a bunch of underachievers

330
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
we're going to stand up

331
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,780
and we're going to be human beings

332
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,120
we're going to get fired up about the real things

333
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,160
the things that matter

334
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,200
creativity

335
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,100
and the dynamic human spirit

336
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,960
that refuses to submit

337
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,420
I have a greater responsibility

338
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,260
than you can possibly fathom

339
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
son we live in a world that has walls

340
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,260
and those walls have to be guarded

341
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,400
who's going to do it?

342
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,740
you?

343
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
you cursed my existence

344
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,380
you have that luxury

345
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,020
you have the luxury of not knowing what I know

346
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,580
that death while tragic

347
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,180
probably saves lives

348
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,440
and my existence while grotesque

349
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,040
and incomprehensible

350
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,300
to you

351
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,300


352
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,440
saves lives

353
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,200
you don't want the truth

354
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
because deep down in places

355
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,620
you don't talk about it

356
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:39,980
in parties

357
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,020
you want me on that wall

358
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,080
you need me on that wall

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,460
we use words like

360
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,860
honor

361
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,700
code

362
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,820
loyalty

363
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,260
we use these words as the backbone

364
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,960
of a life spent defending something

365
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,700
you use them as a punchline

366
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,400
I have neither the time

367
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,480
or the inclination

368
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,560
to explain myself

369
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,500
to a man who rises and sleeps

370
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,820
under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide

371
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,300
and then questions the matter of life

372
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,680
and the manner in which I provide it

373
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,580
I would rather you just said thank you

374
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,700
and went on your way

375
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,060
otherwise I suggest you pick up a weapon

376
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,300
and stand a post

377
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,540
either way

378
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,940
I don't give a damn

379
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,220
what you think you are entitled to

380
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,120
you're not supposed to see

381
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,760
you're not supposed to see

382
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,500
well I have some other

383
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,700
news to tell you

384
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,860
you're not supposed to see

385
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,940
the things get

386
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,860
confused out there

387
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,860
power

388
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,100
ideals

389
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,460
the old morality

390
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,080
because there's a conflict

391
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
in every human heart

392
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,320
between the rational and the irrational

393
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,340
between good and evil

394
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,340
and good does not always try

395
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
to be the same

396
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,100
sometimes the dark side

397
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,860
overcomes better angels of our nature

398
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,380
every man has got a breaking point

399
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,860
you and I have

400
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,220
you and I have

401
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,480
you and I have

402
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,100
you and I have

403
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,140
you and I have

404
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,920
you and I have

405
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,980
you and I have

406
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,340
you and I have

407
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:35,560
you and I have

408
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:35,920
you and I have

409
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,180
and I have

410
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,520
you and I have

411
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:36,520


412
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:36,520


413
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:36,520


414
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:56,320
a long day and should be your organization for a bunch of time and then we would like to see it even know me and her child totally get it and now that she has the blowing up ice cream concussion on me and I will send our好像 pitching a sale to the

415
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,700
of a straight razor

416
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,800
and surviving.

417
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
But we must kill them.

418
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,680
We must incinerate them.

419
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,760
Pig after pig.

420
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,820
Cow after cow.

421
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,140
Philip after Philip.

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,060
Mommy after mommy.

423
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,220
And they call me the assassin.

424
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,820
What do you call it?

425
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,540
The assassin.

426
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,660
The assassin.

427
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,960
The lion.

428
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,960
We have to be merciful

429
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,920
for those who lie.

430
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,860
Those

431
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,160
nabobs.

432
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
I hate them.

433
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,000
I hate them.

434
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,480
Very obviously,

435
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,540
he has gone insane.

436
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,380
He has gone insane.

437
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,460
Yes, sir.

438
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,040
Very much so, sir.

439
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
Obviously insane.

440
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,380
plea

441
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,280
Qu Mulligan.

442
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:26,320
The cat was sold out in the результат.

443
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,320


444
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,300
Hey, E-I-O-U.

445
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,020
Hey, E-I-O-U.

446
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,520
Hey, E-I-O-U.

447
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,320
Oh, U-E-I-O-A.

448
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,600
U-E-I-A.

449
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,500
Hey, E-I-O-U.

450
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,480
Who are you?

451
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,420
Why, I hardly know, sir.

452
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I've changed so many times since this morning, you see.

453
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,020
I do not see.

454
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,400
Explain yourself.

455
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm afraid I can't explain myself, sir, because I'm not myself, you know.

456
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,320
I do not know.

457
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,820
Well, I can't put it any more clearly, for it isn't clear to me.

458
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,300
You?

459
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,420
Who are you?

460
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,800
Well, don't you think you ought to tell me...

461
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,620
Who you are first?

462
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,960
Why?

463
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,020
Oh, dear.

464
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,080
Everything is so confusing.

465
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,260
It is not?

466
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,820
Well, it is to me.

467
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,940
Why?

468
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,380
Well, I can't...

469
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,300
I can't remember things as I used to, and...

470
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,720
Recy.

471
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,100
Hmm?

472
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,180
Oh, oh, oh, yes, sir.

473
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:58,920
Um...

474
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,100
How does the little busy bee improve each...

475
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,400
Stop!

476
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,860
That is not spoken correctly.

477
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
It goes...

478
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,300
Voila!

479
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,420
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran,

480
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,700
cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

481
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,580
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity,

482
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,720
is a vestige of the Vox Populi,

483
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,900
now vacant, vanished.

484
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,640
However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified,

485
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,080
and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin,

486
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,460
vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.

487
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,360
The only verdict is vengeance,

488
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,580
a vendetta,

489
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,780
held as a votive, not in vain,

490
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,620
for the value and veracity of such

491
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,540
shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.

492
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,080
Well, I must say, I've never heard it that way before.

493
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,080
I know.

494
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,200
I have improved it.

495
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,760
Well,

496
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,780
if you ask me...

497
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,180
You?

498
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,840
Who are you?

499
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,740
Shoot!

500
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
Boom!

501
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,040
capturing a maskedроп

502
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,360

Three

510

which to report

511
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,080
more

512
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,900
now

513
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,620
the care

514
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,900
free

515
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:49,980
lines

516
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,700
in the

517
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:50,700


518
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:50,700


519
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,780
The life we had before knowing all this.

520
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,960
Even if that life was just an illusion?

521
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,180
It's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world.

522
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,720
I've come to my senses. You should do the same.

523
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,040
I took the red pill because I wanted to know the truth.

524
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,580
But I don't care about the truth anymore.

525
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,460
What's real doesn't matter.

526
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,880
What's important is how we live our lives.

527
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,400
Are you listening to me?

528
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,680
You know I'm right.

529
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,960
But we can't go back. We know the truth now.

530
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,020
We can forget all of this.

531
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,100
I know how.

532
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,620
Trust me. Don't be afraid to look into your heart.

533
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,000
Say what you're really feeling.

534
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,600
Tell me.

535
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,720
I can't. I don't know.

536
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,800
Running away won't change anything!

537
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,320
You're the one that's running away!

538
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,500
Stop pretending!

539
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,680
Enough! I've had enough!

540
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,680
I don't want to see you again!

541
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,480
There's no time.

542
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,140
You can forget about it. I won't look away from the truth. I can't.

543
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,480
That's too bad. I'm sorry.

544
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,260
No!

545
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,340
No!

546
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,440
No!

547
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,360
No!

548
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,080
No!

549
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,500
No!

550
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,520
No!

551
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,620
No!

552
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,680
No!

553
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:51,680


554
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,560
No!

555
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,480
No!

556
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,760
This is no time for bragging!

557
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:17,760


558
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:17,760


559
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,380
This is a promise!

560
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,340
This is a promise!

561
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,680
This is how it works!

562
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,260
right from where I stand

563
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,580
Cause I'm the man

564
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,780
on the outside

565
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,820
looking in

566
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,040
Waiting on the first step

567
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,120
Show me where

568
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,880
the key is kept

569
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,800
Point me down

570
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,720
the right line

571
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,900
Because it's time

572
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,600
to let me in

573
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,400
From the cold

574
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,260
turn my land

575
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,880
into gold

576
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,360
Cause there's a chill wind

577
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,800
blowing in my soul

578
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,900
And I think I'm going

579
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,600
home

580
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,000
Flash the red

581
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,200
is what's

582
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,140
a deal

583
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,260
Got to make it

584
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,000
to the next meal

585
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,700
Try to keep up

586
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,280
with the turning

587
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,260
of the wheel

588
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,260
Mile after mile

589
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,580
I'm stuck

590
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,060
down off the stone

591
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,500
You turn to speak

592
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,380
that you're alone

593
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,980
A million miles

594
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,440
from home

595
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,100
You're on your own

596
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,560
So let me in

597
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,320
from the cold

598
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,200
Turn my land

599
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,700
into gold

600
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,560
Cause there's a chill wind

601
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,380
blowing in my soul

602
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,200
And I think I'm going home

603
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,740
Music

604
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,940
Be happy with what you got

605
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,480
Because the owners of this country

606
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,460
don't want that

607
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,660
I'm talking about the real owners now

608
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,040
The real owners

609
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,580
The big wealthy business

610
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,220
interested in controlling things

611
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,640
and make all the important decisions

612
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,160
Forget the politicians

613
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,700
The politicians are put there

614
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,520
to give you the idea

615
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,560
that you have freedom of thought

616
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:45,780
You have no choice

617
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,020
You don't

618
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,640
You have no choice

619
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,880
You have owners

620
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,240
They own you

621
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
They own everything

622
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,720
They own all the important land

623
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
They own and control the corporations

624
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,340
They've long since bought and paid

625
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,060
for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses

626
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,700
the City Halls

627
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,220
They've got the judges in their back pockets

628
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,140
And they own all the big media companies

629
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,080
So they control just about all the news

630
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,380
and information you get to hear

631
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,920
They got you by the balls

632
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,840
They spend billions of dollars every year

633
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,660
Lobbying

634
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,540
Lobbying to get one of these people here

635
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:15,540


636
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,000
They want

637
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,260
Well we know what they want

638
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,640
They want more for themselves

639
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,920
and less for everybody else

640
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,580
But I'll tell you what they don't want

641
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,000
They don't want a population of citizens

642
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,480
capable of critical thinking

643
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,740
I'll light my candlelight

644
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,760
And her by my side

645
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,440
And if she prefers

646
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,060
We never stay

647
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,520
together again

648
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,420
Someone sent the promised love

649
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,040
And I grabbed it with both hands

650
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,800
Now I'm the man on the inside looking out

651
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,240
Hear me shout

652
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,460
Come on in

653
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:15,520
Hear me shout

654
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,380
Hear me sing

655
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,800
What's the news

656
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,840
Where you been

657
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,560
Cause there's no wind left in my soul

658
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,380
And I've grown old

659
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,900
Music

660
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,720
They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table

661
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,700
And figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw the local board 30 fucking years ago

662
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,740
They don't want that

663
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,700
You know what they want?

664
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,700
They want obedient workers

665
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Obedient workers

666
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,160
People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork

667
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,720
And just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs

668
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,420
With the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime

669
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,680
And the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it

670
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,820
And now they're coming for your social security money

671
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,040
They want your fucking retirement money

672
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,020
They want it back

673
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,420
So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street

674
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,380
You know something?

675
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,040
They'll get it

676
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,940
They'll get it all fucking sooner or later

677
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,800
Cause they own this fucking place

678
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,020
It's a big club

679
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,920
You ain't in it

680
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,960
You and I are not in the big club

681
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,760
By the way it's the same big club they used to beat you over the head with all day long

682
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,920
When they tell you what to believe

683
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,520
All day long beating you over the head with their medians on you

684
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,660
What to believe, what to think, and what to buy

685
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,540
The table is tilted folks

686
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,740
The game is rigged

687
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,620
And nobody seems to notice

688
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,440
Nobody seems to care

689
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,480
Good honest hard working people

690
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,200
White collar, blue collar, doesn't matter what color shirt you have on

691
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,480
Good honest hard working people continue

692
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,120
These people of modest means continue to elect these rich cocksuckers

693
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,440
Who don't give a fuck about them

694
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,060
They don't give a fuck about you

695
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,720
They don't give a fuck about you

696
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,080
They don't care about you

697
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,880
At all

698
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,080
At all

699
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,880
At all

700
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:10,840
At all

701
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,260
At all

702
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,280
But nobody seems to notice

703
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,620
Nobody seems to care

704
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,120
That's what the owners count on

705
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,380
The fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant

706
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,240
Of the big red white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday

707
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,600
Because the owners in this country know the truth

708
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,560
It's called the American dream

709
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,100
Cause you have to be asleep to believe it

710
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,780
You're my girl.

711
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,380
So vulnerable about everything, it makes me sad.

712
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,520
Yeah, all right, let's keep that money machine rolling.

713
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,420
Can you give me sanctuary?

714
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,560
I must find a place to hide.

715
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,660
A place for me to hide.

716
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,240
Can you find me soft asylum?

717
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,660
I can't make it anymore.

718
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:51,940
The man is at the door.

719
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,760
The man is at the door.

720
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,500
The man is at the door.

721
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,840
This is the trip, the best part I really like.

722
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,480
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number.

723
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,140
Successful hills are here to stay.

724
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,820
Everything must be this way.

725
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,520
Gentle street where people play.

726
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,360
Welcome to the salt.

727
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,400
The South Parade.

728
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,000
All our lives we sweat and say.

729
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,700
Building for a Shatouk grade.

730
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,380
Must be something else we say.

731
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,220
Somehow to defend this place.

732
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,880
Everything must be this way.

733
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,660
Everything Must be this way.

734
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,340
The old man's gone, the Osprey!

735
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,340


736
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,340


737
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:58,340


738
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,080
When the space exploration rounds up, it'll be the corporations that will be moving.

739
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:14,560
The IBM Stellar Sphere, the Microsoft Galaxy, and Planet Starbucks.

740
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,160
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

741
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,580
I'd flip through catalogs and wonder, what kind of dining set defines me as a person?

742
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:38,640
Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and infections, proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working, indigenous peoples of wherever.

743
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,580
We used to read pornography, now it was the Horschau Collection.

744
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,320
The things you own end up owning you.

745
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,060
The soft parade has now begun.

746
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,160
The soft parade has now begun.

747
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,340
The soft parade has now begun.

748
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,940
Listen to the engines hum.

749
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,560
People out to have some fun.

750
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,040
Cobra on my left, leopard on my right.

751
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,260
Dear woman in a silk dress.

752
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,540
Girls with beads around their necks.

753
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,340
Kiss the hunter of the hunt.

754
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,840
Green vest to his recipe floor.

755
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,640
With lions in the night.

756
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,360
Out of sight.

757
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,300
The lights are getting brighter.

758
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,860
The lights are getting brighter.

759
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,160
The radio is moaning.

760
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,100
The radio is moaning.

761
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,400
Calling to the dogs.

762
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,080
There are still a few animals left out in the yard.

763
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,000
But it's dead harder.

764
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,700
To describe sailors.

765
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,000
To the under.

766
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,320
To the under.

767
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,560
This ain't nothing.

768
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,700
To describe sailors on the island.

769
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:41,840
This ain't nothing.

770
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,860
quizzes started in américan style.

771
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,560
hydrological athletics.

772
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,980
As the fabl Shaun

773
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,120
ev тан

774
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,860
telescopic

775
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:57,900
torpedoes

776
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,720
麼

777
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,520
Crawling on the door

778
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,860
Crawling on the door

779
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,200
Crawling on the door

780
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,600
Crawling on the door

781
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,840
Crawling on the door

782
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,160
Crawling on the door

783
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,380
You gotta meet your lady

784
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,640
You animals

785
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,900
At the crossroad

786
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,600
In the yard

787
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,100
But it's getting out of control

788
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,160
We're doing great

789
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,640
At the edge of town

790
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,940
Trying to come along

791
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,320
What good is this part of town

792
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,860
You and I

793
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,100
We need someone low

794
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,540
Bring your guard

795
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,700
Bring your guard

796
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,620
Bring your guard

797
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,920
When all else fails

798
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,200
We can whip the horse's eyes

799
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,280
And make them sleep

800
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,140
And sleep

801
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:57,640
And cry

802
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:57,140


803
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,500
And laugh

804
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,020
And offer you a drink

805
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,820
And a special

806
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,640
I know you have a goal

807
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,220
But do not call me

808
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,340
Don't leave the service line

809
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,520
It's a draw to you

810
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,580
But it's a loss to me

811
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,320
To make you a praise

812
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,900
Healthy in America

813
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,520
It's a new world

814
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,500
It's getting pretty hard

815
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,540
To take my line of work

816
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,580
Doing voices for radio commercials

817
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,020
All that's sleep

818
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,740
In fact

819
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,260
It'll get more and more

820
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,120
So I'm going to go

821
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,280
Every time I'm in the studio for a session, I feel just a little bit more hypocritical and guilty.

822
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:43,840
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor they'll can afford.

823
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:51,220
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about the situation, the better my work is.

824
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,040
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

825
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,640
I work four or five times a week.

826
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,720
I've even upped my rates.

827
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,640
I'm referring to a lapse of ethics.

828
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,500
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about it.

829
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,640
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a knockpiece, a conduit for someone else's concepts,

830
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:23,220
a faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.

831
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,180
Now what do you think?

832
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,800
Am I cutting my own throat here?

833
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,640
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?

834
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,880
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?

835
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,240
I don't know.

836
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,920
I can't answer that.

837
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,360
But I do know this.

838
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,960
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.

839
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,960
Well that's in our vital national interest.

840
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,020
And advertising is a natural process.

841
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,700
is only one small part of that conspiracy.

842
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,300
For the sake of peace.

843
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,940
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio,

844
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,380
nothing you can buy will make you a better person,

845
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,200
a happier person,

846
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,220
a more spiritually connected person,

847
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,880
can provide you with the things in life

848
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,880
that are truly important to the soul.

849
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,440
There are things that can never be turned into comics and marketed,

850
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,360
and these things must be searched for within each of us individually.

851
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,300
Every child must be taught these principles.

852
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,620
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

853
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,360
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away

854
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,600
from that disgusting bomb you just passed on the street,

855
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,800
then you too are part of that deception.

856
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,620
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields,

857
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,580
or a slave in the office,

858
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,520
or a slave in the big house on the hill.

859
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,460
You're still a slave,

860
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,020
and at best, a middle management slave,

861
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,940
frauding.

862
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:58,020
And whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor.

863
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,940
Sending a clear message.

864
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,380
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

865
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,920
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

866
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,660
And you will be replaced the very next day

867
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,080
by yet another well-groomed, well-oiled,

868
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,700
evil, brown-nosing slave.

869
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,580
This year's model.

870
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,220
You're inceptible.

871
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,480
Recently,

872
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,620
we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

873
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,820
Now what do you think brought all that about?

874
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,400
Was it because the communist system was flawed,

875
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,860
and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

876
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,480
No.

877
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,420
I don't think so.

878
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,820
I think it was because of the greedy,

879
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,020
myopic,

880
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,740
and insensitive bureaucrats who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

881
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,200
Interesting parallel, don't you think?

882
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,460
It's a good one.

883
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:02,280
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

884
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,380
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,

885
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,060
all too often,

886
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,380
we choose to emulate them.

887
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,940
To ape their postures,

888
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,600
their uniforms,

889
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,100
their speech patterns, their phraseology.

890
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,620
Stop acting like you're next on the docket,

891
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,900
because you aren't.

892
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,280
Stop acting like everything is alright.

893
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,760
Because you need.

894
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,640
Nothing is alright.

895
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,900
And if you can look around you at the state of this country,

896
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:35,540
and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,

897
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,280
and that their dominance just happened to fall first,

898
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,900
you are truly ignorant.

899
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,760
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate heap

900
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,100
and who lovingly sing to in all of his patriotic songs.

901
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,320
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,

902
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,560
remember, you're working at least three of those days

903
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,680
to pay off your accrued interest charges

904
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,980
and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe

905
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,400
as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

906
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,460
Don't expect an average.

907
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,380
That's 3% at the top.

908
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,400
The real inner circle is bleeding you dry.

909
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,880
It's bleeding this country dry,

910
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,660
not to mention what's left of this planet.

911
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,860
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders,

912
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,360
we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance,

913
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,120
oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

914
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Unlike any other man we have ever seen.

915
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,700
And why do we continue to do this?

916
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,840
Charity.

917
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,360
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

918
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,980
And why can't we learn from our collective histories?

919
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,600
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art

920
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,400
to the continued perpetration of this hoax?

921
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,920
For unavoidable power and our interests.

922
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,720
Poverty, prison, addiction, and despair.

923
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,900
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

924
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,720
Structure without freedom is fascism.

925
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,140
What are you?

926
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:24,840
An anarchist?

927
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,000
Or a fascist?

928
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,900
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

929
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,100
Convenience is not freedom.

930
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:41,980
And the government is not your friend.

931
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,940
Every child must be taught these principles

932
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:50,520
until this threat to America is removed.

933
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:10,820
And how is this height-ranging rhetoric being разаised

934
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:10,820


935
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,820
The best in the Se annexation.

936
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,480
With this taint of the racists of East Stream

937
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,480


938
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,480


939
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,480


940
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,520
It took us 40 years to defeat the probloume

941
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:18,880
of capitalism

942
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:18,940


943
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,580
55 0000 0000 segued fat,

944
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,000
I fr wearing lyricства as a populist.

945
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,540
Help the patriarchy to run again.

946
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,240
PROTESTIVE So-called populists.

947
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:24,800
What advertising has is chasing cars and clothes.

948
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,400
What jobs we hate is we buy shit we don't need.

949
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,100
We're the middle children of history, man.

950
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,080
No purpose or place.

951
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,380
We have no great war.

952
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,180
No great depression.

953
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,440
Our great war is a spiritual war.

954
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,240
Our great depression is our lives.

955
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,360
Our great depression is our lives.

956
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:22,360


957
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,840
Words will be used in lieu of conversation.

958
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,080
Words will always retain their power.

959
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,860
Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.

960
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,800
The enunciation of truth.

961
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,420
And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?

962
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,460
The End

963
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,360
Cruelty and injustice.

964
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,280
Intolerance and depression.

965
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,660
And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,

966
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,200
you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity.

967
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,700
How did this happen?

968
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,080
Who's to blame?

969
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,360
Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than I am.

970
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,380
Others, they will be held accountable.

971
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,900
But in truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.

972
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,640
I know why you did it.

973
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,060
I know you were afraid.

974
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,320
Who would you be?

975
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,460
War? Terror? Disease?

976
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,180
There were a myriad of problems which you conspired to corrupt your ways.

977
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,540
Reason?

978
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,260
And rob you of your common sense.

979
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,340
Fear got the best of you.

980
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,180
Fairness, justice and freedom are more than words.

981
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:04,960
They are perspectives.

982
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,720
But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel,

983
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,600
and if you would seek as I seek,

984
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,900
then I ask you to stand beside me.

985
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,620
If you're the one investigating my justice and freedom,

986
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,020
then I ask you to be the금 released.

987
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,380
The will of the decisions, the will of the problems.

988
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,380


989
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,300
It's not that fear.

990
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,580
Well, it is history.

991
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:45,900
What's theสν survivіса read наши свdoingr можAKE

992
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,480
It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting.

993
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,780
Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.

994
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,100
It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms.

995
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,840
It makes a difference to other people.

996
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,520
And it sets an example.

997
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,760
And in short, I think the message here is that we should never simply write ourselves off

998
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,160
and see ourselves as the victim of various forces.

999
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,260
It's always our decision who we are.

1000
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:19,940
The realm of the real spirit, the true artist, the saint, the philosopher, is rarely achieved.

1001
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,760
Why so few?

1002
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,820
Why is world history and evolution not stories of progress,

1003
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,580
rather this endless and futile edition of zeros,

1004
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,280
no greater values have developed?

1005
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,980
Hell, the Greeks, 3,000 years ago, were just as advanced as we are.

1006
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,980
So what are these barriers?

1007
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,120
What are the barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential?

1008
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,780
The answer to that can be found in another question, and that's this.

1009
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,720
Which is the most universal human characteristic?

1010
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,880
Fear or laziness?

1011
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,900
Reverend Exister of Ministry of Slack edited all of that, and we'll hear part two next week.

1012
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,060
You can find Ministry of Slack at...

1013
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,240
Well, it's a long...

1014
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:16,000
It's a long link, so just go to subgenius.com and click the radio button at the top,

1015
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,980
and you'll find all the details along with the other Subgenius shows and copies

1016
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,820
and logs of all our previous shows and the stations that play them and other information.

1017
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:31,020
Praise Bob, praise Reverend Exister, praise subgenius.com and everybody involved, even you.

1018
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,140
Sire, there is no more money.

1019
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,580
We gotta get some money.

1020
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:42,100
That dirty, perky, shark-a-back, flackin' wharton, fill-a-bunker-burton, perkaluma-burton,

1021
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,700
that's the worst thing I've ever heard.

1022
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,880
B-O-B.

1023
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:54,660
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1024
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,720
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1025
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:12,220
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that Slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page.

1026
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,180
Or the catalog store pages.

1027
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,600
And help out financially as best you can.

1028
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:25,580
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1029
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,520
But some of you still have jobs.

1030
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:35,380
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month, from enough of you.

1031
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,860
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1032
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,240
All we're saying is that...

1033
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,660
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1034
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,100
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1035
01:00:53,220 --> 01:01:04,580
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1036
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,820
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be Slack.

1037
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:12,480
We're here to help.

1038
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,900
If you ain't got no money, then...

1039
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:19,300
If you ain't got no money, then take your broke ass home.

1040
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,040
If you ain't got no money, then take your broke ass home.

1041
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,540
Zags! Money! Bob!

Zags! Money! Bob!

1052
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:48,700
Kill me!

1053

Zags! Money! Bob!
