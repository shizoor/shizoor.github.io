Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina...
Zilch! China kept calling Alameda!
Zilch, never mind for the more that pleases non-defense...
It is my opinion that the people are intending...
It isn't my opinion that the people are intending.
It isn't my opinion that the people are intending.
We don't have no time for that.
All we want is
is an hour of slack. Do you know where it's at? All you need is an hour of slack. Everyone needs a strained jacket. Hold it tight, let's all slack it. Everyone needs a strained jacket. Hold on tight, let's all slack it.
Don't run away! I gotta bob in my pants.
Oh, they all run away. I need help.
I gotta bob in my pants.
Will somebody help him?
Come on, ma'am.
I need to squat my bob.
I gotta squat my bob.
You tell me squat my bob...
...is right here.
He won't take it but a minute, Joel.
I gotta bob in my designer jeans.
I gotta bob in my pants.
It's clean bob.
I gotta bob in my shorts.
Don't smell.
I've trained it.
It's on really high.
I got a vibe in my shirt.
I'm going to get this vibe out of my pants.
I got to get this vibe.
I got to get this vibe.
I got to get this vibe.
Your time has come.
Your time has come to claim the quarters, raid the port, seize the flag, storm the ramparts, cross the waters, steal the guns.
Your time has come.
Open and wishing and praying for a clean escape.
From the worn out, torn out, burned out, same old ways.
Your time has come to kill the giant.
Feed my old bum.
Your time has come.
Show me your GPA.
And run root group, band.
Know if you're ready push, now and best.



I never really had to do anything.

Your time has come

Nothing I do
Is gonna fail
I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
That came me in the mail
And when I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
That Bob Dog sent me
I know I'll never land in jail
I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
It came to me in the mail
When I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
Me, me, me
Said it to me
Nothing that I do can fail
When I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
I feel so goddamn cool
When I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
When I'm wearing the t-shirt
That Bob Dog sent me
Nobody's gonna accuse me
Of being a fool
I'm wearing the t-shirt

You guys ready for a song?
Yeah!
Alright.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
As an intellectual, it is my duty to perform.
There's a responsibility to which I must inform.
All the people of the world wake up, you're asleep.
You're being land slaughtered like mindless sheep.
Aliens did 9-11, FEMA is taking our guns.
There's no go inside the pyramid, the earth does not read.
Follow the round the sun!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Cause you see, the police are really lizards.
The moon is owned by Jews.
The Freemasons will run Monsanto and there's fluoride in our booze.
We got chemtrails in the air, we got GPS in our shoes.
But trust me, because you know I care, what have you got to lose?
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!
Yes, sir!
False flag attack!

False flag...
Winter day and the beach is cloudy
Just blame heart
When your team loses the game

When you get locked out of your house

Only to declare a long-relieved labor
Forced a broken spirit
Homo sapiens

I like to eat meat
I like to make love
I'm talking about the water

Don't take my children away from me
Ah, yes, dear friends

Waiting is coming


We're playing this old and new music
That was new
That song was that was Dr. Argus fox,
and the right angles.
Recorded live in Florida, I think, earlier this year.
The song before that, the T-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me,
that was Glass Madness,
and he probably recorded that on a cassette recorder in 1981 or 82.
Wow.
He was a very early contributor and cranked out dozens of Bob songs.
I've been going into my older archives.
That song, Your Time Has Come,
was the Rainmakers from, I think, a 2014 album called Monster Movie
that wasn't on my radar, strangely enough, until just last week.
Full of great stuff.
There'll be more.
There'll be more Rainmakers playing soon.
Bob in My Pants, that was also Glass Madness,
with me overdubbing, I think.
Our title song, Slack It,
is by the Exposed Foreheads,
who are going to be playing the next song.
And that very beginning thing, Bob Dobbelina,
that was the monkeys.
The monkeys.
Yes, indeed.
Indeed.
And coming up soon, well, there'll be another Rainmakers song.
They're easy to spot because they're twangy.
And we're going to play a song spoken by G. Gordon Gordon,
hit man for Bob.
He really was a hit man for Bob,
and that's also the name of the song.
Unfortunately, the guy playing guitar on it,
which is really good,
is, I think, in prison for murder.
Aw.
Yeah.
But what we're going to play right now
is Exposed Foreheads.
Alles ist verboten.

I'm gonna croak and moan, say it's a new kind of singing.
I'm gonna go down swinging.
If I go blind.
Still have my sense of touch.
I'll just feel your body that much better.
If I go deaf, I'll blame Leo Fender.
Don't ask for who the bell tolls.
I can't hear it ringing.
I'm gonna go down swinging.
I'm gonna go down swinging.

It'll lose my sight.
I plan to keep on playing.
Sometimes you can see more with less information.

On the day he died.
He said, I think I'm finally learning something
Gotta go down thumping
If I go down
I'm going down to the country
Just a little farm shack
For my baby and me
And a couple old dogs
And no air conditioning
Chickens and a garden
And all that we can hear the guitar twanging
We're gonna go down swinging
If I go down
I'm gonna go down laughing
At all the cosmic change
Jokes that've been told to me
Watch the lines between
Profound and pointless
Just remember one thing
You can't forget about me
I'm swinging
Just remember me
Just remember me
I'm swinging
Just remember me




Just remember me
Well, how's the weather, Dave?
It sucks. How do you think it is?
Right. That's what I asked.
I just wanted to remind you of something depressing.
Actually, it was really hot here.
I mean, really hot.
We, we...
I had hoped to have a good time.
To avoid that part.
But we didn't.
It's still kind of hot.
We did get to see the grass turn overnight
from green to yellow
and become like glass.
It's like one minute,
all this grass out here is just...
It's full of chiggers
and knee-high.
And then suddenly it becomes just dead.
Dead, dead, dead.
And cracked.
Weird.
Yes, the grass becomes like glass.
When you step on it, it shatters.
That's when it's super hot.
I remember the only time I was in Tahash
in my entire life
and tumbleweeds.
I actually went out in front of the road
and trained me.
Yeah.
My wife reminded me that they're just tumbleweeds,
you cowboy type person.
I went, ooh, yo, ooh, ooh.
You're some cowboy.
Yeah, really.
We saw a Rudd Runner yesterday.
Yes.
Actual Rudd Runner.
They behave kind of like the cartoon Rudd Runner.
That's why they chose it.
I saw one day run across,
damn it, the hound dog sleeping back,
then do a back flip and shake his tail at him
and stick his tongue out and go boop, boop
and run off again.
I swear it's true.
They're so beautiful.
Their markings are really beautiful.
What about those bunny...
Oh, yeah.
And jackalopes.
The jackalopes...
Well, actually, they're a pest
because, you know, they're insectivores
and they...
They're...


They use their little antlers
to dig holes in your lawn.
We had a jackalope living under the porch.
My grandson saw it scamper off one day
and you saw...
You saw damn it chasing that jackalope.
Yes, I thought damn it caught the jackalope.
But I think he lets him go
so he can chase him again.
I think so, too.
You know, he could break its neck.
It's not any bigger than a rabbit.
Is that the dog's name is damn it?
Damn it spelled with an E.
D-A-M-M-E-T-T.
Damn it.
Ah.
Although it sounds the same as if you're...
Only with...
It's like D-Ham-it for Dashiell Hammett.
Yes, it's like Dashiell Hammett.
Damn it.
And he discovers various crimes
while he's a private...
This dog is kind of like that.
He's out to solve crimes
and stop them before they happen.
The crimes of pharma...
Do you have a pretty red-haired secretary?
That's true.
Yeah, it's great being able to have a big old dog.
It really is.
It makes you feel safe when you go for a walk.
And that's the least thing you are,
is safe when you take a walk.
Well, we're surrounded by deadly snakes,
all kinds of venomous reptiles.
You know, Texas horned lizards.
Those things spit poison blood into your eye.
You know that, right?
Horned toady lizards?
Actually, those guys have been driven out
all the way.
Out to West Texas by the fire ants
who came in and ate all of their diet
or competed with the red ants,
which are the main diet of horny toads.
And I spared the life of a huge red harvester ant hive
in our yard because I decided
I'd rather have them than the fire ants.
And I don't want to get in on the bad side
of the red harvester ants.
You don't want to...
Yeah.
You don't want them to...
to pinpoint you as an enemy.
They will eat your entire body.
Isn't that true?
Well, if you lay there still enough, they can, I suppose.
It might take a while.
It would be a bad way to commit suicide, Dave.
If that's how you're planning to commit suicide,
I'd think of something else.
Yeah.
Death by slow consumption by harvester ants.
That doesn't sound good.
No.
It would take a lot of discipline.
To be one of the ants?
No.
They're victim because it would take weeks.
Oh, you'd have to be very serious about being...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, I was going to ask you another Western question,
if I may.
What were these bunny-like things
only with real long bunny ears?
Much longer than Ohio bunny ears?
They're real long.
Those are jackalope.
That's the jackalope.
No, jackrabbits.
I was driving in the Great Basin area of Nevada,
a place where, like, gas stations are 100 miles an hour.
It was quite beautiful, but it was nighttime and it was moonlit.
And I thought I saw one of these, like, bunny rabbits
with the real, real super long ears.
And then I saw a bunch more, and I tried to swerve,
but suddenly I think I wiped out about, like, 10 of them.
I hear, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Oh, no, Dave.
And hundreds of them were crossing the road
without, you know, without any semblance of understanding
that a car was nearby.
Sorry, yeah.
Yeah.
By the time I would have stopped.
But what are they just, like, regular bunny?
They're not bunny rabbits.
What are they?
They're jackrabbits.
They're lemmings, Dave.
Those are the deadly long-eared lemming.
And it's a good thing that you ran over so many of them
because they're more venomous than lemurs.
And they would have followed me to my own death
by making me be the last person to jump off the cliff.
I know how they think.
They're like Republicans.
Or not.
I didn't mean that word.
You know what I'm saying.
I'm sure you don't.
Well, I have witnessed a migration of box turtles,
and that's across a highway,
and that's why there aren't many box turtles around anymore.
In fact, the guys, the boss man I was riding with
was deliberately hitting them.
It sickens me when I think of that.
And on X Day,
He'd do it.
He'd do it.


He was a nice guy generally,
but I'm going to have to turn him into a box turtle on X Day
and run over him a few times.
Yeah, I'm afraid he didn't.
That'd be juicy.
It's very important that we maintain a somber degree of funniness.
This comedy is very serious.
This board was working.
These mics were working through this board earlier.
Yeah, they are.
Do you have amazingly long fingers?
No, I don't.
Okay, but they seem that way.
Okay, well, I guess they do.
No, I have tiny hands, please.
Trump-like.
Whoa.
Today is your lucky day.
They seem slender like a young girl's.
What's this movie?
What movie is that?
I saw him whipping out his...
He was looking at...
Maybe this is some of those early Suzy flicks.
That would be something, dude.
Do you think that's what it is?
Oh, yeah, it's definitely Suzy porn from the 70s.
That's right.
What else could it be, peeps?
The depravity.
She was a dime.
TV and had equipment?
Argus probably has something.
I could watch this.
It's probably got something.
Cosmic probably has like a portable computer from the 80s.
Yeah, Cosmic designed one.
Yeah, they didn't make those anymore, so I designed one from a Pringles can and some duct tape.
So I made my own reel-to-reel projector with it.
Whoo!
Not letting shit stop me.
Fucking man.
And we're not letting Dave stop us, neither.
Nope.
Nope.
Nope.
Oh, there he is.
There's our Dave.
Mm-hmm.
Can you hear me or am I speaking Espanol, senor?
Very clear.
Oh, very clearly.
I can't hear you.
Yes.
Well, I think there's some spasmodic movements going on, especially since the centrifuge is returning.
What about a centrifuge?
I built a centrifuge recently made out of spittle and Cosmic wax and little pieces of old lunch cakes and vitamin C.
And what prompted you?
I'm not saying I enjoyed it.
I'm just saying that it's been quite a lugubrious experience.
Yes, Dave.
What was the impetus for your building of the centrifuge?
Are you making fun of me?
I am impetus.
Yeah, he's impetus.
I am not making fun of your impetus.
He has trouble with impetency.
I am, I am.
No, we were asking your motivation.
Why did you build a centrifuge?
Just to make yourself dizzy?
There's cheaper ways to do that.
Yeah, I was just going to say I'm already dizzy quite enough as it is.
Now, this is more to destabilize the subdominant, not sub-G's, but definitely subdominant.
Sub-dominant.
Hey, man, called that unofficial风, yo.
You created an en Eles toy, anderon, anderon.

In those days of crisis, kid, some people go gory on TV, maybe己 tea time on TV.
Ah.
Wally.
There's only through потch, that sort of thing.
While some people talk, but we don't know who's talking why.
Kriszmar?

No.
Just a little bit more.


And the most part of the elite system.
Yeah.
And since they're mostly on the side of the rich, then, I mean, I, well, but that's what you do.
Whatever you are that's bad, you say that's what the other guy is.
Well, I remember you just telling me recently over the last weekend from your beautiful home,
when your dog comes up and rests by your feet when you're up there working and stuff like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, man, I had this great connective thing with dogs and people and everything.
I forget what the hell I was doing.
Yeah, I could tell you forgot.
What did you say?
I'm sorry.
I said, whatever I said, you better pick up on it.
And I did, and I dropped it like a soap bucket.
Never mind, I quit.
It was slippery from the soap.
That's why you dropped it.
Yeah, soap.
Soapy.
Soapy sails.
At least I didn't bend over in the shower to collect my wits.
A slippery character, that lonesome cowboy, Dave.
Yes, he is.
Oh, you asked me while I was building a centrifuge, and I remember now.
I was going to take care of all my enemies.
Are you going to spin them to death?
Yeah, I'm going to make them dizzy.
Separate the liquids from the solids.
Yep.
Just like in the bathroom.
Oh, you know what?
No, that's what Dr. Hammond does his foul work.
I have an interesting religioscientific factoid that could break the hearts of many people, were they to believe me.
But it's true.
Or if they had hearts.
Well, the Air Force uses centrifuges, right, to train pilots.
Right.
So for incredible g-force of takeoff.
The Air Force has learned that they can induce a classic near-death...

out-of-body experience simply by spinning a person so fast that all the blood goes to the back of their head.
Isn't that interesting?
It's the exact same that people, these pilots who undergo this, report exactly the same sensations as people who have experienced what they call near-death experiences.
People who believe they have died and gone to the other side just long enough.
They don't have to see what it's like.
Well, they may be doing that, but they may also be seeing what it's like to have the blood flow in their brain altered.
I personally believe that.
And I think anybody who's listening right now should Google or otherwise search for Neighbor World, the book that I was doing.
There's a good change of subject.
I've got a copy.
I was tying in the subject, but now I'm having a hard time once again.
Remember what the connective...
Oh, yes.
The drug inducement as produced by centrifuges on the facial area, like when you're gyrating in a spoon gasm and stuff and listening to Jamaican music and your face starts going...
Like that.
And they do take selfies of it, but your face is all blurred out from the G-forces and stuff like that.
But people would just quite easily just stare at some light pattern for a short period of time and their minds would be changed.
And I think that's the key to the problem.

I'll show up now.
I'm sorry.
Dave, I have a copy of Neighbor World, and we were calling this the final proof.
But, Princess, we noticed something.
Noticed another mistake that you didn't notice and I didn't.
And it's on the back cover.
Your last name is spelled wrong again.
Oh.
It's spelled with a capital L on the front.
And on the inside...
In fact, Princess, we found...
Oh, no, I did.
I found that the copyright...
Your name was misspelled on the copyright thing, even though I had corrected your name right under it on the art credits.
Oh, shit.
So now, in theory, I guess what I have to do is go back and change the cover.
And then it'll be published for sure.
But I think if I do that...
Then we can go ahead and call it done.
And I'm hoping that by next week...
Well, actually, by the time the internet listeners hear this...
Not the Cleveland listeners, but the internet listeners in a few days...
In a few days...
You should be able to get on Amazon.com or CreateSpace or SubGenius.com
in the book part of the catalog and order Neighbor World by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And it's okay for me to say that because I'm not making any money off of it.
I will off of future books that we publish.
But...
But that means it's okay to talk about it on this public-supported radio station.
Oh, that was a good excuse.
And a guy...
You'll like this, Dave.
A subgenius who lives in Mexico.
And is a Mexican citizen.
Requested that I read more Neighbor World on Hour of Slack.
Because he said he really enjoyed it.
Listening to it on the bus.
Going to...
Cuernavaca or someplace.
Yeah, someplace.
This guy lives in...
Calexico or Mexicali.
One of those two towns.
Oh, so he's a Norteño type of dude.
Huh?
Oh, wait.
Is that a Norteño type of dude?
Or is that a...
He's a Mexican subgenius.
But I wonder where that state is.
It's...
Oh, I've almost been there.
It's a...
The very...
Like the León type area?
No.
It's right on the other side of the border.
South of the Salton Sea.
Yes, now it rings a belly button.
Calexico is a little California town.
Yes, I agree.
South of the bizarre Salton Sea.
And right across the border from that is...
Mexicali.
I may have those names reversed.
The one in the States is a wretched...
No, Mexicali is a place.
The one on the American side is a wretched, toxic place.
Indeed.
Well, people there are getting sick because the Salton Sea is just...
The government has quit trying to deal with it.
And it's just going to dry up and turn into a giant dust bowl of toxic, toxic crap.
It's making people very...
Very sick.
In that area.
Can I ask you a question right now?
Did we have a dream one time that we wrote the script, you and I, that was called Salton Sea?
Or did somebody already do that?
And it was like there's people, you know, living out their lives, living near the Salton Sea,
knowing that it's killing them, but it's so cheap to live there.
And they're just using this strange white, real bright white light and dark images from that Salton Sea area.
Did we do that?
Did we do that?
Or did somebody else do it?
I think somebody else did.
Okay.
I'm fascinated with that area.
Princess Wee and I got to drive through there and creep around the ruins.
Yes.
And take a lot of pictures.
There are still people living there and you can get a house for about 10 bucks.
But keep in mind that the temperatures reach 130 degrees in the summertime.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought that would be brilliant, you know.
Put down...
I think David Lynch is to shame dealing with an environment like that.
And the people who've escaped there because they want to get away from the law
or somehow they want to become Norwegians and they can't ice skate or anything like that.
You know, like the special chimpanzees with brassieres.
Oh, you can do stuff that no Norwegian can do.
At the Salton Sea, you can almost walk on the water.
It's like syrup.
It's beautiful looking, smells like dead fish.
And the beach is literally complete.
It's composed of fish bones, not sand.
Fish bones and bird bones.
Looks like syrup with a layer of cake on top.
Oh, boy.
Yes.
You know, wouldn't that be disturbing if you were to live in such a...
Well, it takes a special person to live there.
There's a couple of documentary movies about it that are fun.
Great name, too.
Salton Sea, period.
That's the name of the series.
And it's every bit darker than Lynch's Graveyard Spumatumies and Axel Spumatis.
Oh, it's like a cross between...
Living in Salton City or Bombay Beach would be like living in a David Lynch movie
directed by David Cronenberg.
It's auto-surrealism.
It's very surreal.
It's a very surreal environment.
And the fact that all of the buildings, almost all the buildings are in ruins and covered with graffiti.
Yes.
Man, it's a really...
I mean, I'd love to go back there more.
But that's why I happen to know about Mexicali and Calexico.
Yes.
Yeah, boy, do you have a great memory?
You just brought that all the way back to Calexico, which is also a great industrial byproduct.
At least when I...
Okay, there was...
First, there was my uncle, Pornicato.
Then my cousin, Desistin.
And then my other cousin, Fermano.
And they together decided to form a union of independent socialist states, you know?
But instead, they were overcome by grief and angst and nausea
and had to commit themselves into the middle institution
that we're also very proud of.
And we're glad that this industrial strength type of outlook towards everything,
is curing the addiction problem we have here in the United States.
Dave, did you have a nephew named Fromaggio?
No, I just made that up, but I was...
Oh, okay.
He said Pornicato.
Oh, Pornicato.
Okay, okay, sorry.
They're Italians.
Oh, don't worry.
You don't have to cry about that.
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't get stuck under the, you know, the falls, so to speak.
Well, here I found...
I can read a bit of Neighbor World for our friend
that describes, that sounds like it's talking about the Salton Sea towns.
It says here, these are screen directions,
Car Town, New Neighbors, Series of Shots, All Angles.
The first shot showed a scene of the Car Town family
that was so deformed by change,
Jerry-era tox mutations,
that you had to angle the source left
to VU them face-to-face.
This amazing genetic offering knew about guzzlers,
how to maintain them and keep them running,
even restored them to their original condition.
Well, that sounds like Reverend Angry Larry.
Yeah.
No, it's Reverend Angry Dave, which...
Ah, not cabbage rolls, which...
You know who I'm talking about.
Well, we should have X Day at the Salton Sea.
That would be even more deadly than having a Stein Ranch.
That would be really bizarre, man.
That's definitely...
You should do that online.
Well, actually, it's nice in the winter.
Photoshopping stuff and create a reality
that a bunch of fake newsers will love.
Oh, thanks for doing that.
I wish I was online right now, so I would do it.
Well, you know, we have to have a sec.
We have to have two X Days now,
according to the Beacon Project
and all the other stuff.
We've learned from that locker.
And the Salton Sea does look like the end of the world.
It looks like everything's over.
Yeah, if you do it during the wintertime,
it's actually kind of pleasant.
It's in the 70s in the middle of January
in the Salton Sea and Stein Ranch.
But...
Oh, by the way,
we've been thinking about our friends
in Houston, Austin, and San Marcos
and that whole part of Texas.
But people don't need to worry about us.
For one thing, we're not there.
And even if we were in Texas,
we'd be so far away from the coast,
it wouldn't matter.
Stanksville is not affected
because it's two states away from the coast.
Two normal-sized states.
So, yeah.
Well, I'm glad you brought up the abnormality
of the state of Texas
because we've wanted to know about
the little secret.
Oh, yeah.
The greatest little whorehouse in Texas
that you...
Hey, a mouse is eating my phone.
I hear it.
It does sound kind of like a mouse.
It sounds like he's chewing on the lawn.
Yeah.
Holy crap.
Throw him some cheese.
Throw him some cheese, Dave.
I'll try to find some cheese.
Wait, hang on.
Let's...
We can...
Now, Dave used to have the buzz.
Yes.
And we're not hearing the buzz,
but we're hearing...
You know, he's talking on a...
One of those old, old, old telephones
that have a wire going into it.
Uh-huh.
And it has a dial that goes around
and around and around.
I don't know about that,
but I know it's so ancient
that it's a landline.
And the line itself is cheesy.
And mice love cheese.
They like your name.
Can I call you back on my cell phone?
Uh, sure.
Sure.
Now it's stopped because I said that.
Right.
That's right.
Yeah, it's not...
You should have said that sooner.
As long as you don't move,
you have to hold completely stock still,
paralyzed,
not move.
Don't even move your tongue.
I'm doing that right now.
I'm totally immobile.
I'm totally immobile.
You sound immobile.
I do.
Oh, mini, mini mobile.
Yeah, it's not making much difference.
I'm going to have to call you back on my cell.
Is that all right?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Okay, I'll talk to you in a few seconds.
Okay, I'm going to drop you.
All right.
He's dropped.
He dropped you like a hot potato.
I'm monster hunting.
With this music.
Well, yeah, that is...
Music from my favorite video game, Monster Hunter,
which I don't get to play much
because I'm working so hard for Bob.
Actually, I'm working for myself,
but that also happens to have...
Well, my job is being a preacher for Church of the Subgenius
and office boy and janitor and carpenter and lawn...
Boy.
Oh, here's lawn manager.
And light bulb replacement person.
Ja.
You're Swedish over here, too.
Can you read me?
I can read you.
Well, sort of.
Can you read me loud and clear?
I can read you in this book neighbor world, but it's...
I don't always...
Well, there's been a couple of parts I didn't understand.
A couple of conversations between the characters where I'm thinking,
Dave must experience other people in a different manner than I do.
Because it was...
You're talking about parts that seem like they might be interior dialogue
and yet they're in the same paragraph with an actual retort?
No, no.
Oh.
I've never...
I mean, those characters work a job sort of like your real life job.
And I never had that real life job.
So I never had to deal with no-go-bo-go.
Or jerks.
Or jerks.
Like that.
I had to deal with completely different kinds of jerks.
Right.
But there's still many jerks in the whole field of endeavors.
Well, actually, I was in the field of documentary movie making.
So in that respect, I was pointing sources.
Actually, I'm working on the documentary now.
In fact, I'm working frenziedly on it.
Because those ladies making the subgenius documentary,
need a lot of help finding the cool old footage.
And only I can do that fast enough.
So I've been going through the ancient, ancient footage.
There's a bunch of Cleveland devival home movies.
With baby Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and baby Princess Wee,
and baby Reverend Stein, and living Chaz.
Baby Regan.
I love the babies.
And the baby Jesus.
I love baby Jesus.
I love all forms of babies.
I like to french fry them like a Korean tennis shoe,
and then melt them slowly over the cheese.
Yeah.
And yet you're against abortion.
And yet I'm still against abortion.
You're right.
You are my friend.
I hope Dr. Sinister is listening,
because he's got a lot of recipes for baby.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I hope.
I hope he gets to do his own barbecued pictures
of those chimpanzees modeling lingerie stuff.
You're getting me turned on now.
You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
Of course.
Hey, Charleston, our wonderful show host before us,
mentioned that he had read recently that some people were saying
that kids that are born now will live to be 150.
I thought that was really horrifying.
Because one of the things I'm most glad about is that I'm not going to be around
to see what is going on 150 years from now,
because I don't think it's going to be good.
Certainly not going to be pretty.
We have a very jaundiced view of the future, I must say.
Well, you know, the horrible thing is my grandkids will think it's normal.
Stuff that we would feel is horrifying,
but I could see my dad looking at modern times that way at the age of 88,
just before he died.
To him, everything was going to hell in a handbasket.
But it is getting, some things are getting worse.
People are remarkably ignorant these days.
And I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm part of the last generation
to have enough knowledge to understand what we're about to lose.
Because...
It's more incursive writing, believe me, Mr. Penrinship.
I fear for my grandchildren.
But to them, it'll be normal.
Yeah, that's the problem.
They think everything's freaking normal when it's like
we overlook a couple million dead people here and there and stuff.
Next thing you know, genocide is now wiping out 90 bazillion people
or the entire planet.
And it's still not a crime.
Well, I think it's...
I think it'll be Mother Nature that does most of it, really.
Yeah, I think they've been keeping the dams plugged down there
on the Gulf Coast for quite a while with the, you know,
temperature up here like 59 degrees and the temperature down there
in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico area and stuff like that,
like water temperatures of 90 degrees.
Come on, that's got to go somewhere.
And them violent hurricanes they said they was going to have?
Well, that's exactly what they had.
Was it a more violent hurricane?
I'm sorry.
Well, the important thing is our president two weeks ago
dismantled all of Obama's flood regulations.
Obama had put into place certain regulations to, you know,
to encourage cities to work harder on their infrastructure.
Infrastructure to avoid flooding.
Well, Trump decided that wasn't good for business.
So, no, they don't have to do that anymore.
It's okay to just let your city flood.
I guess, you know, it'll make money for the construction workers
and the rescue workers.
They have to come in and rebuild literally every single structure in Houston.
And the National Guard are supposed to be able to handle some of them,
and yet they're privatizing even rescue efforts.
I mean, yeah, they're supposed to make the scene when stuff like this happens.
I mean, at least that's what they get underpaid for and stuff.
Boy, talk about a greed cabal of greasy capitalist swine mongers
who are completely crazy.
You sound like you're describing my hero, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Completely crazy swine monger.
He is crazy.
Crazy.
A what monger?
Did I say that?
A greed monger.
I said that.
Oh.
Once again, you know, the chimpanzees with the fine, fine, fine lingerie.
Hey, Princess, we came up with a word for what we do.
Yes?
Extemperadio.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah.
I wrote it down.
Extemperadio.
Oh, speaking of which, just before you called in,
I was playing something that I didn't give credit for.
We'll probably hear a little bit more when I shut us down in about two minutes.
At Tarzan's radio station, it wasn't just Dr. Howell and me.
I ended up slacking off a lot of the time and letting other people do shows.
I was getting let throughout, and he was up on stage to counsel.
And the reason I got in came pretty require.

That was when I was doing a very cool job, it wasn't a delirious достumous performance

He was rather gloomy, but that was it.





that is at the front, 절� Hermes.
The Da劉e show off.
They created that show,겠?
Or I think they did that withき 어�pter show.
I didn't even say his name,2000.
I'm just starting to cut that stuff up.
God, there's hours and hours and hours of it from X Day.
But I think I'm going to save it until we get to Texas in five weeks and edit it.
Then, because here we've got the radio station.
And you sound a lot better on the radio.
Well, actually, you know what?
I was listening to some stuff we recorded from the Texas studio, and it sounds fine.
It sure does.
It sounded just about the same as this.
Yep.
With my crappy little microphones.
Yep.
With the bearskin rug looking down upon us as we record.
You don't get to see the bearskin rug, though.
No, but I have imagined voluptuous hot ladies, like, laying on the bearskin rug,
showing that there are apples and crying to the abnormal, you know, friendly creatures.
That would be a trick, because the bearskin rug is on the wall, not the floor.
Who says there has to be any kind of gravity involved?
Some of them, you know, like, fly like one.
Someone with a hefty dose of fly genes could crawl up the wall and begin singing one of those oafish dilemma songs about the new, you know.
Well, Dave, actually, in Texas, the gravity is a little stronger than it is in Ohio, because it's a bigger state.
Well, yeah, and you have to support more dinosaurs on the staying range, too.
And they always lived under the zero gravity zones back in the old days.
No.
There's more gravity, not less gravity.
Gravity is a little stronger in Texas.
That's why that rain is falling so hard there.
Oh, man.
It's not raining there, is it?
No, not in Stang'sville, not at Stang Ranch.
We'll be lucky to get a few drops from Harvey.
If Harvey spits a little bit on Stang Ranch, that would be great.
But you know what?
We have to go.
It's almost time to end the show.
Oh, no.
I didn't know that.
Well, I did actually know that.
I was imagining an elderly woman, like maybe about 95 years old, taking off her brazier and panties and chasing me around the entire housing area.
I mean, you know.
Well, thanks for sharing that with us, Dave.
I can see that's wishful thinking on your part.
Well, no.
Everybody should have their own dreams and wishes.
Come true.
Just like Santa Claus and all the elves and Jerry Lewis.
Okay, Dave.
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
Was I doing something wrong?
No.
I did nothing wrong.
Episode number 1637.
And for more information on the Church of the Subgenius, Hour of Slack, and the stuff that we play,
if you didn't get the credits, you can find them online at subgenius.com,
where you'll also be able to buy Dave's book, Neighbor World, soon.
And with that, Dave, we must go.
We must.
We have no choice.
Goodbye.
See you, Dave.
Goodbye.
That's it.
Okay, we'll pull that down.
Okay, now back to the lads of Thor.
You're seeing urine pod crust.
All right.
Is that good background music?
I think we should have a 70s background.
I feel like we should have the soundtrack to Holy Mountain by Jodorowsky playing.
You're so into that guy, man.
He's really good.
I've never listened to him.
Break open the fridge and get us some Pepsi.
Some Pepsi.
Don't.
Don't admit to any crimes in Caffeine that we could be prosecuted for at a later date.
You want the middle or you want the side?
Lucky Pierre.
You'll take the middle, Donnie.
Push back a little.
That's it.
Snuggle up.
Well, here's hoping everything records.
Well, we'll see.
We're professionals.
So, it's been an exciting time here at X-Day 2017, whatever the fuck we're calling it.
The last one.
The last one.
The good one.
The good one.
The one you.
Missed.
By not being here.
So, what'd we do so far?
Well.
Mayhem, peas.
Utter mayhem.
Right?
Exactly.
Bob's dead again.
Mayhem with a double M or something.
Surprise.
We're good this time.
Kill Bob.
He didn't see this one coming.
Or did he?
A lot of people didn't.
Did he?
I think he knew all along.
No.
No, I didn't.
No, I.
I.
I believe last night after the.
The radio transmission from the XS came through.
The feedback more than likely short circuited an XS implant in my own brain.
Which resulted in my.
Willing.
And forceful destruction of our deity.
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
What was the means by which you carried out this destruction?
I.
Dragged him.
him by a rope
around his neck
face down
in the gravel
and threw
him into a blazing
inferno. Head first into a blazing
inferno of death.
That's what we did to Bob.
Well, Argus, I was kind of hanging out.
Yeah, Pease again.
Everybody else was just roasting weenies on top of him.
You guys were like, oh, let's go burn Bob.
And at that point, they didn't
even know that it was the remains of Bob.
Some people were just like, oh, it's time
for hot dogs. Pease and I did
indeed burn hot dogs when we had
sharp sticks.
Sharp sticks in the dark.
Here was Syria.
You know, there's no lights out here.
There's a lot of ways you can trip. It's really
amazing there's so many surviving subgeniuses.
And the stones are very pointy.
Very pointed sticks.
Fucking pointy? Well, no, I'm talking about the stones
when you're just walking around on the ground.
You know, you don't want to be looking for sticks.
Ah, a fucking rock got my foot again.
Uh, don't tell me what to do.
I'll tell you what to do.
For our viewers at home.
I thought I was babysitting tonight.
You were supposed to be and then you
just stupidly decided to chase yourself again.
Yeah, go finish your applesauce.
Okay.
Where's Grandpa Pease today?
Not here.
That's exactly right, kids.
