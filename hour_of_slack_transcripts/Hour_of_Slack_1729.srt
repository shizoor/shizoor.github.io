1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,400
From the time-worn pages of the past, we have brought you...

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,760
The Self-Genius Power of Swarming!

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,420
Come, my son, my little habit. You at least may escape this awful curse.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,400
We must flee for our lives, away from these evil powers, to the sea.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,860
There you'll be safe, my son. There you'll be safe.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,700
Yeah, you're right, Dad, but a previous engagement forces me not to attend.

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,880
We, the left, should rehabilitate this. I know it doesn't sound very postmodern or cynical.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:53,380
This idea that there are out there quite ordinary guys, nothing special, but who all of a sudden, as if in a miracle, do something wonderful.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,340
The doorstep of a new millennium.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,820
Our obligation is to...

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,360
Listen to this, I put a little time in on this.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,160
And at the same time, restore its creative power.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,200
To reinvigorate our society...

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,580
And, uh...

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,200
Bring about a, uh, rebirth of, uh, democracy, uh...

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,340
Any questions?

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,900
Nice. Less is more.

18
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:26,120
When the riots and civil unrest went down about four years ago, you promised us federal funding to rebuild our community.

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,100
What happened?

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,680
No one's on it!

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,400
There's no one.

22
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,100
No one's on it.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,900
No one's on it.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,660
No one's on it.

25
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:34,660


26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,220
No one's on it.

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:35,240
No one's on it.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:35,260
No one's on it.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:43,300
Well, what happened was that, uh, we all knew that was gonna be big news for a while, so we all came down here, Bush, Clinton, Wilson, all of us.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,520
We got our pictures taken, told you what you wanted to hear, and we, we pretty much forgot about it.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,660
Oh, my God!

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,480
My God!

34
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,100
My God!

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,840
But here's the bigger issue.

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,460
It doesn't matter.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,840
how you say it. What matters is whether you believe it.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,560
Whereas

39
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,520
we're doing something constructive

40
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,560
for the truth.

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,820
I think I have some experience.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,320
So I think

43
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,760
I can share my experience

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,800
and I can

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,620
help or I can

46
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,460
take care of others'

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,020
heart or I can cure

48
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,220
others' worries.

49
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,240
That's why

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,660
conventional one-to-one relationships

51
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,920
between men and women will not be possible.

52
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,360
Well,

53
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,900
that may be so.

54
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,760
But I agree

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
with Dr. Latour that we should

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,580
be concerned with the

57
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,240
instinct for survival.

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm going to tell you a little bit about what

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,760
it is and then I will get

60
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,800
into a bit of why we're looking at this

61
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,940
and what this has to do with anything.

62
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,860
Many are suffering from schizophrenia

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,080
Plenty are destroyed mentally, really,

64
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,540
physically, mentally undALIли

65
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,540


66
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,540


67
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,900
mean us.

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,240
This is fun.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,160
We will do our best sharing

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,260
of truth to help

71
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,260


72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:52,260


73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,380
In one of our

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,320
Philo drive-in theater

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,980
and the Michael Pepe

76
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,940
trailer demolition.

77
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,860
We had all sorts of stuff

78
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,420
in that banner year

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,320
on the floor.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,560
Where the hell did you do that?

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh, my eyeball

82
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,300
is too long.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,300
Oh, now you've done it. Don't rub them.

84
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,400
Don't touch them.

85
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,920
You're right.

86
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,480
They'll fall out again.

87
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,140
It really hurts.

88
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
Oh, don't touch Scott Bates.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Another eyeball, and I've lost an eyeball.

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,280
I don't know what it takes.

91
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,420
If I have to jump in and explain

92
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,020
what I'm about to play here.

93
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

94
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,320
and you're listening to Hour of Slack

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,260
number 1729.

96
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,380
Last Thursday,

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,640
May 30th,

98
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,140
in this time zone,

99
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,680
the subgenius

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,000
documentary movie

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,440
by Sandy Boone opened

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,120
the San Francisco

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,860
International Film Festival.

104
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,660
And our

105
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,040
San Francisco buddies

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,340
who were in the movie, and some who

107
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
weren't, but

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,280
probably would have been if the movie was

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,540
longer, were at

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,500
the showing and did a Q&A

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,000
afterwards.

112
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,240
Then they were on the Puzzling Evidence

113
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,480
show. So what I'm going to be

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,860
playing on and off tonight,

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,360
interspersed with other things, is

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,640
those guys, the Puzzling

117
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,700
Evidence show, Dr.

118
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,080
Paul and Lies, talking about

119
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,120
the movie, and other

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,220
things. They go off on some

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,960
tangents. This is

122
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
edited, though. And in

123
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
between, there's some

124
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,160
media barrages, as we might call

125
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,020
them, by a new

126
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,020
contributor, Reverend Silas

127
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Jansen. So

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,080
for about half an hour, it'll be

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
Puzzling Evidence,

130
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,620
reaction to the movie,

131
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,020
the first time any of them

132
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,700
have saw it. Right, Princess Wee?

133
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
Right. Who's here with me.

134
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,180
And they liked

135
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,200
it. Praise Bob. Praise

136
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Bob. I was in a little anxiety

137
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,020
about that, and so was the director,

138
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,440
Sandy Boone, because there's not a pickier

139
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,160
audience for a

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,180
subgenius movie than

141
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,040
St. Paul Mavridis

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,720
of Lies and

143
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,780
Doug Wellman of Puzzling Evidence

144
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,080
and Dr. Howell.

145
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,140
But they,

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,840
like everyone else so far,

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,040
thought it was really good.

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
And of course, we all wish there were

149
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,060
certain things that could have been included,

150
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,040
but, you know, overall,

151
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,080
just, everybody's

152
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,060
thrilled, and so

153
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,680
let's return to that

154
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,140
Puzzling Evidence show

155
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,980
that was broadcast just last

156
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,380
Friday morning on

157
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,280
KPFA Berkeley.

158
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,140
And the Wee, Wee,

159
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,900
Wee, Wee, Wee,

160
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,840
praise Princess Wee,

161
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,380
hours.

162
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,020
It is about

163
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,940
what you think it's about.

164
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,820
You were right, I should have said,

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
now it's worse than before.

166
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,880
In fact, in all the ways that Bob's death resonates

167
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,820
with the members of

168
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,140
his generation.

169
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,720
They got him in his generation.

170
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,980
Oh, you stop bragging.

171
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,040
Hip.

172
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,740
So how do you feel about

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,000
that, now that it's all

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,020
out in the open, now that people are talking

175
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,800
about it after all these years?

176
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,720
Yeah, they gotta get used to it.

177
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,920
It's all over and done with. That's a long time.

178
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,340
That Bob stuff?

179
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:22,760
Yeah.

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,780
All of us

181
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,220
long-haired Bob people of those days.

182
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
On the Bob Killin' Ground.

183
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,140
I didn't have long hair, but those other guys did.

184
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,020
Yes, some of us

185
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,760
even had hair.

186
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,600
Yes, it was a hair restore.

187
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,900
It was a hairy time

188
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,100
when Bob got blasted on stage.

189
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,420
Yeah, but sometimes...

190
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,920
Sometimes you get up

191
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,640
and you just don't feel like Killin' Bob.

192
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,680
Ugh!

193
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,880
No, he's hard to kill. He's like weeds.

194
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,700
Even when he's whack.

195
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,860
But, I've seen it happen

196
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,820
more than once.

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,960
A Bob Whacker?

198
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,620
Yeah, there's usually one in every crowd.

199
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,020
A Bob Whacker. It has to be done right.

200
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,760
With the right, uh,

201
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,820
weapons.

202
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,220
I want to say I'm very excited about the fact

203
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,100
that the Reverend David Apocalypse

204
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,480
was one of the first people to speak

205
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,040
in the film.

206
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,300
Yes, did you notice that?

207
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,180
It was David Apocalypse's voice.

208
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,480
Oh, yeah.

209
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,800
It's hard to...

210
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,340
It was David Apocalypse's voice.

211
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,540
Hard to miss it.

212
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,320
No, I did not.

213
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes, from X-Day.

214
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Yeah, telling people to finish up

215
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,580
before the...

216
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,980
before the ship was showing up.

217
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

218
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,860
The one about, you finish your masturbation.

219
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,180
Oh, okay.

220
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,940
That's David Apocalypse.

221
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,700
That was funny, yeah.

222
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,300
He was there, and my girlfriend freaked out

223
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,380
and wanted me to take her away

224
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,300
from the David Apocalypse zone.

225
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,940
That happens.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,060
He was dressed up as a clown.

227
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,360
He was honking a horn, and she was terrified.

228
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,260
And so he went down the road,

229
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,080
but then he appeared further down the road

230
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
honking his horn.

231
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:57,700
He.

232
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,520
And then, later on, he came up very wryly

233
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,860
and made the peace symbol.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
You know, he saw I was ducking out on his show.

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
It wasn't my idea.

236
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,580
Him with a bullhorn is just peas and carrots, boys.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,040
Oh, peas was there, but not carrots.

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,200
She stayed home.

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
But Reverend Peas came several times.

240
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,940
It turned out to be quite a nice film.

241
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,060
After all the abuse we had been pelting him with,

242
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,960
he's a good guy.

243
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,920
He can jump right up on stage, join the band.

244
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,260
He improvises, thinks on his feet.

245
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,780
Meanwhile, Carrots, back at home,

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,940
keeps the home fires burning.

247
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,800
Forget who behind him.

248
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,160
Denying what's brown on the ground

249
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,640
All fighting for be

250
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:08,300
They were just literally

251
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,600
They were just actually

252
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:08,600


253
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,760
Look at her.

254
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,820
She actually outsourced the uniform from Esperanto

255
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,160
Overs�� Ryan .

256
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,300
I think you know what they're doing here

257
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,460
you know, that lots of queer times

258
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:13,460


259
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,740
It's not what you're doing.

260
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,080
Or the politians even love.

261
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,260
Not in the other world,

262
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,680
a lot of the time.

263
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Our public has been.

264
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,120
voice in his voice his echoing ghostly voice was added to the cacophony of oh well cacophony was

265
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,960
vaguely represented i might have been in there for like a frame you know i have to so you were

266
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,840
framed finney i i recognized my shirt because i had like a red white and blue tie-dye shirt

267
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:57,900
the lesser people yeah taking away from my screen time but other than that

268
00:11:59,760 --> 00:11:59,800
yeah

269
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,820
sterno and there's somebody else it was nice seeing everybody in there yeah explaining these

270
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,220
religious concepts

271
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,920
to a church yeah they should have had uh more

272
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,680
you know more that was the whole thing was this was a um

273
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,400
because that was when they i kind of relaxed from a lot of that one

274
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:38,840
back in the summer others it was all about haiti in the world i thought no it's not i hate let go

275
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,780
i was so excited to learn about the yeti tonight someone fed us that question so of course we had

276
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:55,200
give them the razamataz a five dollar answer they were talking about trump being kind of subjunius

277
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,300
and i wanted to make the joke well he is unfortunate yeti is our president and yet he

278
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:09,820
is our president that was one i made years ago on the puzzling evidence show because ronald wilson regan ronald wilson finance show because ronald wilson reagan the yeti هو proceeding i need to be there ever again

279
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,280
the 45th president of the United States,

280
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,000
had the sagittal crest,

281
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,180
which distinguishes not only the gorilla,

282
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,880
but the adult yeti.

283
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,260
And then after a pause, I would say,

284
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,820
yet he's our president.

285
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,880
Get it? Snark, snark, yak, yak, yak, yak.

286
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,340
If you look up, if you Google Bigfoot and Trump,

287
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,260
there's a side-by-side comparison of the Bigfoot film

288
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,240
and Trump walking away.

289
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,660
They do walk similarly.

290
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,580
And, of course, Bill Maher, a long time ago,

291
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,940
suggested that Trump's father was not Fred Trump,

292
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,260
but actually a red-haired baboon.

293
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,220
And he put both pictures up.

294
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,560
And Trump sued him,

295
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,280
saying that there was no evidence

296
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,060
that Fred Trump was a red-haired baboon.

297
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,540
I mean, Trump actually just took it totally seriously

298
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,860
and sued Bill Maher.

299
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,400
Did he really sue him, or did he threaten him?

300
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
He sued him, and it went nowhere.

301
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,720
It was thrown out of court.

302
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,660
But it is constantly brought back by Bill Maher,

303
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,460
who also came up with an interesting,

304
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,740
interesting nickname for Trump.

305
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know if you were following it.

306
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,280
Trump?

307
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,040
No.

308
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,700
Broca Hauntus.

309
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,960
It turns out that Trump's financial empire

310
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,820
is all in debt and in arrears and so forth.

311
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,400
Yeah, the brilliant businessman.

312
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,580
I'm not always thrilled by Bill Maher.

313
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,240
I know you're not.

314
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,980
But I'm going to give him that one.

315
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,820
I will...

316
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,040
Well, but he was attacked for, you know,

317
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,640
he's trespassing on Native Americans and blah, blah, blah.

318
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,560
But still, I thought it was funny

319
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,460
because Trump's...

320
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,820
He flings that around all the time.

321
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,040
Pocahontas said it.

322
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,180
So Trump now being called Broca Hauntus,

323
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,500
maybe he won't do that anymore to Elizabeth Warren.

324
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,880
From PR News in Washington,

325
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,740
I'm missing and killed a fifth earlier this month.

326
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,700
Ten inches of Iraqi civilians dropped on Houston today.

327
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,100
A group linked to Al-Qaeda in Iraq says it is kidding.

328
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says the same group

329
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
says the U.S. military says the White House says PR News.

330
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,800
Isn't over yet.

331
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,300
On Wall Street, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

332
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,620
The Supreme Court has refused to say this is PR.

333
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,140
The justices say plans pension pilots,

334
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,100
public pension plans, PR sports.

335
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,160
Pensions pay pilots profitable pension pensions push pilots.

336
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,100
Pension pension plan pension pilots pension plans PRs.

337
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,760
For the first time in more than 20 years,

338
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,900
whales have won a vote calling for resumption of PR News in Washington.

339
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,240
What they should do is...

340
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,160
Have Quentin Tarantino do a Star Trek movie.

341
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,400
And they were going to, but then the Star Trek fans were outraged

342
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,820
and wrote a million letters saying,

343
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,880
no, please don't let him do a Star Trek movie.

344
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,580
So is the Subgenius movie going to come out on DVD?

345
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,120
They don't have a distributor.

346
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,180
And her next stop is Melbourne, Australia.

347
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,320
I expect it will eventually be distributed

348
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,560
and it will be probably...

349
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Probably, I imagine, on cable TV.

350
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,220
That's what I'm thinking.

351
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm thinking, too, it'll be on Netflix one late, you know, 3 in the morning.

352
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,800
I actually learned a lot about the church that I didn't know.

353
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,280
So it's good for people.

354
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Yes, it was quite informative.

355
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,480
Yeah, yeah.

356
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,980
I never knew about the whole Papa Joe Mama controversy.

357
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh, well, that guy's a walking controversy, I gotta tell you.

358
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
I gasped.

359
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,380
I was so shocked at that behavior.

360
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,920
We used to go over and be on his show

361
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
at KCSU.

362
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,200
With the Columbine thing?

363
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,040
With the radio show?

364
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,180
The Papa Joe Mama Association of the Church of the Subgenius

365
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,080
with the so-called Trenchcoat Mafia

366
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,620
of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold

367
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:58,120
who were themselves influenced by the Matrix series

368
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,760
where they wear trench coats and kill a million people.

369
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,400
I was out walking my dogs one morning

370
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,860
and listening to NPR, as you do,

371
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,360
and then I heard that call.

372
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,900
And it's...

373
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,520
Do you know it was Kurt?

374
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,000
It took me a moment.

375
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,480
As soon as he said the word subgenius,

376
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,440
I realized it was Kurt faking a voice.

377
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,020
Yeah, you can tell his voice.

378
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,340
And I was shocked as he went on and on and on.

379
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,200
I went, oh, my God.

380
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,540
And then immediately the news about the Boston thing happened.

381
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,060
Well, they were banned in Boston,

382
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,500
but then they got an offer from the local Baptist church.

383
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,760
Although they couldn't enter the church,

384
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,380
they performed the whole show on the steps of the church

385
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,640
and people drove up and showed their car height,

386
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,140
but they didn't get to see the church.

387
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,740
And they were able to get in the car

388
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:39,740


389
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,500
Yeah, pretty wonderful.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Yep, that makes a great story.

391
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,720
At the original X-Day,

392
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,240
he seemed to be almost dressed up as a Nazi,

393
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,120
but he was a Russian.

394
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,620
He was dressed up.

395
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,580
He has his own SS uniform.

396
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,820
Mr. Von Kirsteiner is a very conflicted person.

397
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,140
He has a lot of Nazi uniforms.

398
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,520
So enough to where we were able to staff a whole...

399
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,060
Submarine full of Nazis.

400
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,340
Incorrectly Nazi.

401
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,660
There's a Nazi crew on it somewhere.

402
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,980
They're being catching the Nazis.

403
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,460
I'll never forget that cruise.

404
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,100
I thought that the film covered the dark side of the church,

405
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,960
but I think it did a very good objective job of that, too.

406
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,420
There's some controversial things.

407
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, it shows nobody tried to do that,

408
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,300
but it does creep in when you get a lot of creeps in the church.

409
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,080
But they didn't name names for the most part.

410
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
They didn't name the names and rake them up.

411
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,660
No, we don't want more lawsuits.

412
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,740
No, no.

413
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,380
So, um...

414
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, sure we do.

415
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,400
Probably as tears.

416
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,920
You don't have to pay.

417
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,600
I don't have to pay.

418
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,260
It'll be those guys that made all the money of the movie that'll pay.

419
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,980
The thing is, all it takes is for one crazy to commit a big crime and call himself a subgenius.

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,940
You see, then everybody will be digging it out and spinning it.

421
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,860
Nobody will care because you know what the thing, the angled end will be?

422
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,820
Look how old those guys are.

423
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,420
Compared to other churches, we've been amazingly scandal free, I think.

424
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:05,640
Yeah.

425
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,840
Compared to the small churches.

426
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
Yeah, nobody tried to shoot Bob early.

427
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,840
Well, I mean, yeah, that's true.

428
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,040
But they shot him many times afterwards in imitation of the original location.

429
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:23,700
I like that Bob came out of the limo first before the little poor beat up Bob had.

430
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,720
That horrible dummy that looks worse every year.

431
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,380
It's often dragged around.

432
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,980
So this year you'll have to watch the movie again and again.

433
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,400
Probably it will be shown.

434
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,600
It will be shown at X Day.

435
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh, good.

436
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Yeah, subgenius did something.

437
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480
They just think.

438
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,960
They were alive during Crosby, Stills and Nash.

439
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
That's how old they are.

440
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,880
And people were booing on Mr. Bush, on the former president.

441
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,520
They were booing him at the.

442
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,860
And the Reagan, too.

443
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,200
They were booing Bush in the clip.

444
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,140
That was the moment where he's standing in the rubble and they're booing.

445
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,640
And then Bush, you know, thinks fast.

446
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,520
And he pretends that the booing is for the terrorists.

447
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,640
And he takes control of it.

448
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
And he takes control of the crowd.

449
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,980
But they were originally booing him.

450
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,600
He did a pretty clever thing there.

451
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,100
He deflected the boos and got them on his side.

452
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,100
Well, we'll see.

453
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,360
We'll see if they recut the film and hopefully leave me out.

454
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,600
Well, maybe they'll keep you in but add weird soundtrack and words that you never made.

455
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,200
That was something I really enjoyed in this movie was she did.

456
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,380
Her editor, I'm sure it wasn't Sandy herself.

457
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,520
Because it would take somebody who plays with this stuff to know it.

458
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,580
But threw in little sound effects perfectly placed.

459
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,740
Yes, I saw them.

460
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,360
The little, little.

461
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,780
Oh, Philo dropping his pencil in the original whatever it is moving.

462
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,900
Just little things like that.

463
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,960
Really add.

464
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,660
Really make it seem like.

465
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,700
It's like one of those movies that you'd almost see something new every time you watch it.

466
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,380
Yeah.

467
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Especially my stuff.

468
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:10,480
Yeah.

469
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,380
Well, you came off pretty well.

470
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,200
Also, Lies, I thought, had some real good moments.

471
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,880
And Onan, too, was very good.

472
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,100
Yeah, Onan's always good.

473
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,000
I like the parts about how you found each other.

474
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,360
And, you know, like you were just, you found a tape and you played it on air.

475
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,480
And then they heard you and say, why are our voices on air?

476
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,760
And who is this guy?

477
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,020
And they even showed Bob Nelson.

478
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,780
Yeah, that was nice.

479
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,860
Because without Bob Nelson, there's no over the edge and no puzzle.

480
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,060
How did you get involved?

481
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, I, it's so long ago.

482
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,880
Oh, how did Hal get on the show?

483
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,380
How did Hal get involved with some genius?

484
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,400
Oh, I worked at Ripoff Press at the same time that Paul did.

485
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,940
And when they sent that pamphlet and read Fred Todd's.

486
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,300
And they threw it in the trash.

487
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,060
I was there.

488
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,300
I was also excited to find out that Paul always had that beard.

489
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,640
Well, not necessarily always.

490
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,260
Not when I first knew him.

491
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
But he has had it for a long time.

492
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,900
He used to have long hair, you know.

493
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,260
He looked like a little mushroom.

494
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
He looked like a tree from the back.

495
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,680
Actually, he looked like one of the percussion guys in Weather Report.

496
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,060
There was a guy who looked, a Puerto Rican guy who looked just like Paul.

497
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,540
Because he had giant hair.

498
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Really, I was envious of his giant 60s hair.

499
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:46,360
And then one day, we were on Market Street, Nora and myself, and for further information, another couple.

500
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,480
And we're trapped in the building by somebody who was on acid shooting up and down Market Street.

501
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,540
He called himself Chief Cherokee.

502
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,880
And Nora turned to Paul and said, your hair looks so 60s.

503
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,620
You should cut it off.

504
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,660
And to my shock, Paul said, no.

505
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:00,940
And I said, yes.

506
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,380
And then Nora gave him his haircut, his first haircut in many years.

507
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh, she did that, eh?

508
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,100
Yeah.

509
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,740
Well, you know, like Samson, his strength.

510
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,640
Exactly, yeah.

511
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,800
And he just fell over and he never did art again.

512
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,780
But here's the really scary part.

513
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,600
Researchers have recently rediscovered a number of documents translated last century,

514
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,920
buried in incomprehensible terms until modern knowledge caught up with former knowledge and was able to recognize it.

515
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,420
Because unconsciously, instinctively, they seek freedom.

516
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
What we must do is make them conscious.

517
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
Look, you want freedom anyway.

518
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,660
Let's be serious.

519
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,600
Let's sit down.

520
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,340
Let's plan it.

521
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,860
Let's wait protracted war.

522
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,520
And let's turn the system and walk on to liberation.

523
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,720
It's as simple as that.

524
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,940
What do you want?

525
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,120
Statement of purpose?

526
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,060
Should I email you?

527
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,620
Should I put this on your action item list?

528
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,620
You decide your own level of involvement.

529
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,880
I will.

530
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,660
I want to know certain things first.

531
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
The first rule of Project Mayhem.

532
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:54,640
Shut up.

533
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,040
I want to know what you're thinking.

534
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,960
Fuck what you know.

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,480
You need to forget about what you know.

536
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,160
That's your problem.

537
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,480
Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship, and especially...

538
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,500
You wouldn't allow me to feel empty.

539
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,640
You wouldn't allow me to feel like I'm not a part of this world, like I'm not a part of this life.

540
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,520
So did you feel alienated at some point in your life?

541
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,360
Yeah, I did. I did.

542
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,740
I felt very alienated.

543
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,500
I felt like I just, like everybody else was a part of something and I just wasn't.

544
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,180
And that may be where a new being is created, if you will.

545
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,400
A new experience within the physical realm.

546
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,380
And some of you might just be having the sense of who am I?

547
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:33,960
What am I?

548
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,200
What the heck is going on?

549
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,660
Isn't there a bong to be seen in that movie somewhere?

550
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,020
You mean, ripping around a bong?

551
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,300
Oh, the bong in the film.

552
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:42,820
Maybe not.

553
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,740
No, you're right.

554
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,800
There was a brief flash of a bong.

555
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,520
It's funny.

556
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,520
The audience did laugh, as they always do.

557
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,160
I could hear Ken Kniezel, one of the Smoke Pot guys, laughing.

558
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,020
Yeah, that was great.

559
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,500
He came just to laugh.

560
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,660
Good for him.

561
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,980
Movies need laughs, too.

562
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,460
Yeah.

563
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:07,360
I think Sandy was relaxing when she found the audience was, you know, on the side of the movie and worth laughing at all the right parts.

564
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,300
Was she nervous?

565
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,400
She was nervous.

566
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,680
She was nervous about the whole thing.

567
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:19,760
If she wasn't nervous, she certainly wouldn't sit in the audience and see the same damn movie again, which she's seen hundreds and hundreds of times.

568
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,060
But it's new with an audience, with people reacting to it.

569
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,120
Well, I'm glad she was pleased, because she did a lot of work and that was, you know.

570
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,360
She did a good show.

571
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:30,760
Yeah.

572
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,620
And kudos to her editor.

573
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,520
Yeah.

574
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,940
Yeah, lots of good editing there.

575
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,960
I wonder who that was who edited it.

576
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:48,540
Well, they had a lot to live up to with the whole Arise thing and stuff, so it's, you know, the gauntlet had been thrown many years ago.

577
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,640
They used some footage from Arise.

578
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,040
I saw, I recognized.

579
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,340
They used all sorts of footage.

580
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,620
Yeah, they had some good shots from various things.

581
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,960
Hey, wait, I'll do some business.

582
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,920
I'll do some business.

583
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,260
I'll do some business.

584
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,580
I'll do some business.

585
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:02,980
I'll do some business.

586
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,220
I'll do some business.

587
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,400
Can you telephone streaming?

588
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,000
Thirty-five years and I've learned to be content.

589
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,260
I just deal with the meat that's in here.

590
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,640
I just lay back and relax and keep my mind together.

591
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Because I now believe that I'm the one free.

592
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,860
The freest man in the world.

593
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,740
The rest of the world is locked up.

594
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,200
They are locked up.

595
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,140
I had to realize that myself.

596
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,120
I had to realize that I am now my higher self.

597
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,420
I am now all I need to manifest.

598
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,640
I am now all I need to be the person that I'm supposed to be.

599
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,180
Synchronic events are coming in life, but the common people are trained not to see them.

600
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,420
After many years of formal education,

601
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,880
and social programming,

602
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,100
most adults have lost their intuition and childhood innocence,

603
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,920
even with constant mental noises in the head.

604
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,660
Many people go through daily events on automatic pilot,

605
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,020
just like sleepwalking in daydreams.

606
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,320
When witnessing a striking synchronic instance,

607
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,400
people are unable to fathom it with the life they have.

608
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,060
They are not logical mind.

609
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,380
So they simply shrug it off as chance event or random coincidence.

610
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,400
Moving on with other businesses.

611
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:47,140
The way that we can start to learn how to manipulate our own reality

612
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,720
and to break out of this is by working with our own personal dream state.

613
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,300
Now to sleep.

614
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,660
Some people go right to sleep, others take longer.

615
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,380
Because David has regular sleeping habits,

616
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,060
he usually drops off very quickly.

617
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,560
I think pull the wool over your own eyes is extremely important.

618
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,980
We have all these weird delusions of our own,

619
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,100
but we don't have the conspiracies delusions.

620
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,440
We don't believe in Alex Jones, but we believe in Yetis and so on.

621
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,600
So it was pretty comprehensive.

622
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,940
And I was very relieved that it wasn't what I thought it would be,

623
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,000
which was something which stipulated that it all happened long ago

624
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,760
and is over with in the 80s.

625
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,380
And now everybody's old and nodding by the fire.

626
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,740
I think backwards and I do it for fun.

627
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,180
They say a godzillion is the highest number there is.

628
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,140
There's some movie on that.

629
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,380
A godzillion dollars?

630
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,580
I'll take that.

631
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:55,580


632
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,740
Yes, dear friends.

633
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:12,840
That was some fun talk there from the subgeniuses of Puzzling Evidence Show.

634
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,660
I will tell you that the editor of the movie they were talking about,

635
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,820
the subgenius movie, which is called J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

636
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,420
directed by Sandy Boone,

637
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,900
the editor was Lauren Sanders.

638
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:34,140
And they were right to be bragging her up because it's really incredible editing.

639
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:40,060
And I don't know who the lady was that was guesting on the show that particular night,

640
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,840
but I think I know who this one is.

641
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,760
Hello?

642
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Dave!

643
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,540
All of us knew.

644
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh, what a relief.

645
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,180
We hoped it was Dave.

646
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,740
I know. I feel so relieved myself right now.

647
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,080
I just collapsed on the floor.

648
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,300
I couldn't believe what I just saw.

649
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,860
Did you?

650
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,120
I thought it was great myself.

651
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,160
I enjoyed it.

652
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,260
Well, I don't know how you mean qualitatively,

653
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,920
but damn sure well could almost get killed by such an entity.

654
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,600
T.

655
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,540
Man, I'm still shaking in my boots.

656
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm not even wearing underpants right now.

657
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm glad you're okay, Dave.

658
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,300
God.

659
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,440
Oh, he's not talking.

660
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,260
I'm glad I'm okay, too.

661
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,920
He's not talking about the subgenius movie.

662
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,080
I thought that was what he was talking about there.

663
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,000
That's what I was talking about.

664
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
The subgenius movie.

665
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,420
Why do you think I mentioned taking off my underpants?

666
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,620
Okay.

667
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay.

668
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,280
You said that would sell, baby.

669
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,700
Man.

670
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,220
No, not you, Dave.

671
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,020
There was some...

672
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,720
Okay, you could have We Read it,

673
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,600
and it would make it sound much more like,

674
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,840
come and see the movie of the year.

675
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,360
Well, yeah.

676
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,520
Anything that Princess We reads sounds We Read.

677
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,300
And that's what everybody wants.

678
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,060
Yeah, you want to read it a couple times.

679
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,040
We read this.

680
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,900
You want a We Read, and we would...

681
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,100
Her musical voice from outer space.

682
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,920
Like the language castrati we have living near the river

683
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,000
down by the old middle stream.

684
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,960
You have castrati living down by the river?

685
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,980
They have their singing practices every Tuesday night,

686
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,520
and I guess there's some kind of muffin banquet.

687
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,840
After dinner, they get some of the local ministers and priests

688
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,980
and so forth of the various churches and religious entities,

689
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,980
and the old ladies go down and cook up goulash in the basement

690
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,680
without any shoes on.

691
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,460
Wow.

692
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,460
Castrati.

693
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,600
These are people who voluntarily got themselves castrated.

694
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Was that so that they could sing,

695
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,420
or just so they could concentrate?

696
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Or what?

697
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,880
No, it was for singing,

698
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,860
because for many years,

699
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,040
I guess it was one of the best choirs in the tri-state area,

700
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,000
if there is such a place,

701
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,660
but I guess there were plenty of them way back when.

702
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,420
And so that's how they got their name and their reputation.

703
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,800
Your father sang with...

704
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,220
It was a bloody mess in the first three years,

705
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,740
because they used the oatmeal and rubber band method.

706
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:16,740
Ouch.

707
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Yeah, that's what I say, too.

708
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,400
Why not something nice like that?

709
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,400


710
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,360
Like some oatmeal cream soap and a bag of whiskey or something.

711
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,780
Castrati.

712
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:26,980
Castrati.

713
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,420
There's one in the background.

714
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,240
You think that's just some soprano.

715
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,200
Oh, Dave can hear it.

716
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,860
It's not a soprano.

717
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,100
It's a high tenor who's been double...

718
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,860
Yeah, actually, that's...

719
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,320
He was a sumac.

720
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,580
That's our good friend Nenslow

721
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,700
after he joined the castrati and became a singer.

722
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,680
Well, he did...

723
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,340
He did...

724
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,480
He did have a sex change operation,

725
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,620
but it wasn't necessarily a change.

726
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
It was kind of just an adjustment.

727
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,160
Princess Wee is laughing at the idea of Nenslow singing this background music there,

728
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,620
because she knows Nenslow,

729
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
and it's as inappropriate as it could possibly be.

730
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,580
Well, he's probably got a big hairy face, right?

731
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:13,860
Yeah.

732
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,920
Well, he could...

733
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,060
I mean, it would work just as well if we had said,

734
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,280
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

735
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,440
except you're on the phone,

736
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,600
so obviously you can't be singing and recording at the same time.

737
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,700
Yeah, and when I'm on the phone,

738
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,500
how am I going to have a big hairy face at the same time as that?

739
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:27,880
Right.

740
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,580
I mean, all the Stanford professors and all the upset military men

741
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,800
couldn't put old Trumpty Trumpty back together again.

742
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,240
Trumpty Trumpty sat on the wall.

743
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,000
Trumpty Trumpty had his colon bag fall.

744
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,780
Trumpty Trumpty wasn't Trumpty, was he?

745
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,180
That's so unfair.

746
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,160
To pick on the president.

747
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,080
I know.

748
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,860
Why do you hate our freedoms, Dave?

749
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,960
How dare you pick on him?

750
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,500
That hurts his feelings.

751
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,140
That hurts the feelings of all the snowflakes that love the president

752
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,140
when you mock him like that.

753
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,600
That's just...

754
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,360
That's stretching.

755
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,500
He's there, I said,

756
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,800
why do you keep picking on him?

757
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,300
I said, well, how am I picking on him?

758
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,840
He's a millionaire, and I'm a flatulent fool, you know?

759
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,760
It's...

760
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,700
Well, why not both?

761
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,480
Anyway...

762
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,220
Well, I'm sure he's flatulent,

763
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,440
but I can't even imagine him releasing any sort of onerous gas

764
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,540
except for that that comes out of his mouth.

765
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,640
They were bad-mouthing the president on that San Francisco show that we were playing.

766
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh.

767
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,620
I removed some of it because it was so San Francisco.

768
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,520
You know, I...

769
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,040
Brita.

770
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,160
They don't know how that stuff plays in the Midwest here.

771
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,220
I mean, we're cool.

772
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,440
We're open-minded and everything, but...

773
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,820
I mean, yeah.

774
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,700
Jeez.

775
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,020
You know, some of the...

776
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Some of the...

777
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,000
fruit and nut stuff that California 40-cakes are into.

778
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,260
I just don't know.

779
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,660
Anyway, they love...

780
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
They saw the movie last night, Dave.

781
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
Or Thursday night.

782
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,220
They...

783
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,700
The movie...

784
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,660
The subgenius movie that you're not in.

785
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
Oh, I thought you meant the new Godzilla.

786
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,220
I'm sorry.

787
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,080
Well...

788
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,800
Actually, I'm sure a lot more people went to see that, but...

789
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,320
In San Francisco, they had a nice sellout crowd

790
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,020
the first night of the San Francisco International Film Festival.

791
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,600
The movie was extremely well received, as I figured it would.

792
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,300
The director, Sandy, was a little worried about that for some reason,

793
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,220
because she figured they'd be the pickiest audience, and they were.

794
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,580
And that's why they loved it the most.

795
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,820
So, that was a big relief for me and her,

796
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,580
just because I've been saying it was good to so many people.

797
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,420
I don't want to look bad.

798
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,960
You know, I have an ego, a little bit.

799
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,280
A tiny, tiny little bit of one.

800
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Right.

801
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,180
The smallest one that you could still call.

802
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,840
Just a slender sliver of an ego.

803
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,500
I'm sitting at the edge of the bed on the toes of the irogan.

804
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,260
Yeah.

805
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,860
Oh, look at him go.

806
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,060
He can run just like anyone.

807
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,960
Leggo my ego.

808
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,360
So...

809
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,580
So, yeah.

810
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,100
Yeah.

811
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,160
It was a successful...

812
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,840
One more successful showing,

813
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,780
and we're that much closer to some decent distribution

814
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,060
than we are to the show.

815
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,060


816
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,060


817
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,780
I'll have a distributor picking it up

818
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,600
so that I can finally get a copy myself

819
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,620
and start playing clips from it on the show.

820
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,040
I actually could pull some from the rough cut.

821
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,680
I do have access to that, but I've...

822
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,240
You know, we've sworn not to dilute it, you see,

823
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,340
until it's...

824
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,000
Everybody can see it.

825
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,960
Because it's actually pretty good,

826
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,600
even without you in it,

827
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,320
even without Princess Wee.

828
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,740
Even without you?

829
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,920
Actually, you're probably glimpsed in it,

830
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,100
you know, in a crowd scene,

831
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,720
in the back of your head or something.

832
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,180
And Princess Wee is in it right at the beginning,

833
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,340
holding a recorder at an X-Day gathering,

834
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,460
waiting for the saucers, and...

835
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,100
laughing at my humiliation.

836
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,760
Was that the time she stabbed him, Dennis?

837
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,820
It was every time.

838
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,260
That happened every time.

839
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,140
Oh.

840
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,160
Hey, we went to the...

841
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,060
I've been getting an onion snail mail,

842
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,340
they used to call it.

843
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,880
I don't know when, but of course I...

844
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,840
Snail mail. They still call it that.

845
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,600
The real old people.

846
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,020
Really, really old people call it that.

847
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,240
Yeah, like me.

848
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,780
Onion skin.

849
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,460
Yeah.

850
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,400
Nobody else even knows what it is.

851
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,900
You know, G5 is not a very good idea

852
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,180
when you look at it all the way,

853
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
if you like to consider technology.

854
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
What, G5? You mean the...

855
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,540
What?

856
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,260
The new...

857
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,420
Yeah, the Chinese are going to change the internet

858
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,660
into G5 instead of G4.

859
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,060
Gee whiz, I don't care.

860
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,100
Anyway, it'll all still work for a while,

861
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,220
and when it doesn't,

862
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,380
praise Bob.

863
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,740
I've got goats.

864
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,040
I've got goats.

865
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,680
Well, my brother has goats,

866
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,280
and I can go live off the goats.

867
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,360
You're going to have plenty of cheese

868
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,300
for a good long time.

869
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,000
That's... It's good for your health.

870
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,320
Suckle from them.

871
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,300
Let them sleep on top of me,

872
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,300
keeping me warm.

873
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,580
Just so long as you don't try and barbecue.

874
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,580
Well, no, that's the whole idea.

875
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,740
You know, after...

876
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,400
I mean, if you really depend on the goats,

877
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,740
sooner or later, you're going to have to barbecue them.

878
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,340
I've heard they're good.

879
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,980
Anyway, Dave, we...

880
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,740
Since we're still in Cleveland somehow...

881
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,600
Yes?

882
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,900
And they're still doing the Hessler Street Fair.

883
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,860
We went to it.

884
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,220
It may be the last one.

885
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:24,940
It's possible.

886
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,760
It was the 50th one.

887
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Yes.

888
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,920
There have been 50 of them.

889
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, it's going to be the last one for a long time, yeah.

890
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,300
Well, they're getting kind of burned out,

891
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,640
and the hospital is...

892
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,740
And the gentrification...

893
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,300
The gentrification has taken over the whole neighborhood,

894
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,600
and you just can't park there.

895
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,720
But we didn't have any trouble,

896
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,840
and we went in and we had...

897
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,160
We partied.

898
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,440
We saw several of the old Cleveland hippies that we know,

899
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,400
and they all know Princess Wee.

900
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,520
She's like a famous Cleveland hippie elder now.

901
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,220
I remember when she was just a hanger-on, like me.

902
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,480
And, you know, now she's a co-director of Starwood.

903
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,620
And that's what I really wanted to talk about was

904
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,540
not only is the Hessler Street Fair cool,

905
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,940
but it's over with for a while.

906
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,160
Starwood's still going on.

907
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,240
And, in fact, it starts July 9th or 10th or something,

908
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,960
right after the world ends.

909
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,380
So that may be a little awkward,

910
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,020
but we'll make sure it happens anyway on one of our saucers.

911
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,620
But, yes, Starwood's going to be really excellent this year.

912
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,600
Furman Supreme, the President of the United States,

913
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,480
is going to be at Starwood hanging out, doing workshops,

914
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:52,560
ranting, and just stumbling around with his megaphone, being funny.

915
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,840
And I've never met him.

916
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,420
I've talked to him on the phone a little bit.

917
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,600
I thought you had that thing going with his ex-wife.

918
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,880
No.

919
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,020
That was both of our ex-wives.

920
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,600
We're both the same.

921
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,500
Forget it. It's complicated.

922
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,620
You wouldn't understand.

923
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,380
It's one of those poly-mono things.

924
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,720
I didn't hear any of that, by the way.

925
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,200
Right, right.

926
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,980
Well, you were intended to stay out of the loop

927
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,100
while they were barbecuing the goats, you know what I mean?

928
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,980
I usually am.

929
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,240
Anyway, yeah, Furman Supreme's going to be there.

930
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,080
And our buddy John Shirley, the science fiction writer,

931
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,560
who has written some of the most bizarre and disturbing horror

932
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,840
and science fiction, both,

933
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,380
and some pretty strange fantasy,

934
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,620
and a whole lot of kids' cartoons, apparently.

935
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,560
That's how he paid off his alimony of all those marriages.

936
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,960
And he's a rock star.

937
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,480
So John Shirley's going to be there.

938
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,600
Yes, he wants to make sure that everyone has a pony.

939
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,800
No, that's Furman Supreme.

940
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,400
Furman Supreme has a pony for everybody.

941
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,280
I don't want a pony.

942
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,020
Dave, you can have my pony.

943
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,980
I don't like ponies.

944
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,660
I don't want a pony either.

945
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,060
I was hoping for a huge, a bushel full of food.

946
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,040
Yeah.

947
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,700
And you are right.

948
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,780
It is beginning on July 9th.

949
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,020
July 14th.

950
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,580
See, I did the math.

951
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,200
Yes, you did the math.

952
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
Because everybody will be dead after X-Day,

953
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,880
and they'll only have two days to resurrect and go to Starwood.

954
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,820
Take their shirts off and go to Starwood.

955
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,260
They usually keep their shirts on at X-Day, to tell the truth.

956
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,000
I thought we were having Starwood on your saucer.

957
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Sure.

958
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,740
Whichever.

959
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,240
And mine.

960
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,260
Yeah, whichever.

961
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,620
Our saucer will just beam the whole campground up with Syria.

962
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,200
Yeah.

963
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
I don't know how deep it goes.

964
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,300
That's going to be tricky.

965
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,380
Because Old Sequa's lair is there.

966
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,140
And for all we know, that goes to McElligot's Pond,

967
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,040
which is connected to the ocean at the center of the earth,

968
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,560
which is full of dinosaurs.

969
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,220
So, you know, I've got to beam all of that stuff up

970
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,740
just to have that one southern Ohio campground.

971
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,360
That's a lot of people.

972
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,220
And have those two hippie festivals.

973
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,700
Deep-beaming.

974
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,240
Well, the one.

975
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,920
The one.

976
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,240
And then you've got to wear them stupid big ears like Spock

977
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,140
to show that you're really hip to what's really going on.

978
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,500
I hate when hipsters do that, you know.

979
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,500
They ruin every movement, every social movement.

980
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,860
They just, they wipe their rectum with it and then throw it on the floor.

981
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,420
Oh, those big ears are cute.

982
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,540
I think those big Spock ears are cute.

983
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,360
Those big ears are fetching.

984
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,340
I really do.

985
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,720
I think they look really nice, especially on aging gilf hippie ladies.

986
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,720
They don't look so good on fae young men,

987
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,380
but I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.

988
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,240
So anyway, yeah, people who come to Agstay can then,

989
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,520
after the world ends, they can go straight over to Starwood.

990
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,640
Subgeniuses get a better deal than anybody else.

991
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,200
Isn't that weird?

992
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:15,700
The one group that probably believes the least in the kinds of things

993
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,560
that are taught at all those many varied workshops at Starwood,

994
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,120
those are the people who get in the cheapest,

995
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,500
thanks to Bob and the path of least resistance.

996
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,500
And the fact that the co-directors are also, you know,

997
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,100
on the board of directors of the Subgenius Foundation.

998
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,420
Yes, we're all married.

999
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, we're all married too.

1000
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,800
See, the way I see it, I listen to the music you're playing,

1001
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,680
I think of Dick Dale up on stage and a bunch of like dwarves,

1002
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,040
those tiny but kind of cute dwarves all dancing around to Miserloo.

1003
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,860
I think that's a beautiful statement.

1004
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,640
No, you're thinking of the amino acids.

1005
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:00,500
They play this old song, Miserloo.

1006
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,160
Miserloo.

1007
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,840
So do the lethargic acids too, but they were too elemental and 25-ish, you know?

1008
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,120
Well, and the amino acids played the whole thing in about one minute,

1009
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,160
real fast and loud, punk, surf punk style.

1010
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,900
I remember them doing that.

1011
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,640
That was the overall phrase, and then they were done.

1012
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,720
So I don't know about you, but Princess Wee and me and Dr. Howell

1013
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:35,360
are all going to be partying in Southern Ohio.

1014
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:40,300
And then the Devo-tional, the Devo fans, that's in July too.

1015
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:40,740
Yeah.

1016
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,660
And we're thinking we'll still be in Ohio then.

1017
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,160
Yeah.

1018
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,540
So I'll get to go to see the Devo-tional and meet the Devo's.

1019
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:55,120
In this case, the Devo that's going to be there is Bob, Bob II, Bob Motherspa.

1020
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,380
Mark's brother.

1021
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,620
Yeah.

1022
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:08,740
And Amy's brother and what's his name's cousin?

1023
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,040
Al.

1024
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:10,580
Al.

1025
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,420
Al's cousin, yeah.

1026
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,580
We've been playing songs, Dave.

1027
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,980
I don't know if you've been hearing them.

1028
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:23,960
We've been playing a lot of stuff by Al Motherspa's band, Massive Hot Dog Recall.

1029
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,780
This is where I'd cut to one if I had one.

1030
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,400
Yeah.

1031
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,100
This sounds like quite an embellishment, a wonderful name.

1032
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,700
And I certainly would have called attention to it had I apparently did not hear it or

1033
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,720
did not know that it was a big smelly hot dog thing that you had.

1034
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,720
It's hard to miss that band, Massive Hot Dog Recall with Al Motherspa.

1035
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,940
It's hard to miss because it's the only rock band I know of that uses a trombone as the

1036
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,960
main solo instrument.

1037
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:04,780
Al Motherspa, a cousin to the Devo's, I think, plays trombone and it's insane.

1038
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,520
It's completely nuts, but very well done.

1039
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:08,800
It sounds great.

1040
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:08,960
It's great.

1041
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:09,660
Yeah.

1042
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,340
It sounds real great.

1043
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,160
I must tell you that in my languishings in the area here with the one guy that's been

1044
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,700
helping me record some stuff and he's been also recording some, he performs the same function.

1045
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,680
He's a trombone player.

1046
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,120
He's a regular rock and roll musician.

1047
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:23,640
Yeah.

1048
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,300
But then he whips out that old trombone and it is a very weird experience to have your

1049
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:29,980
tromboners.

1050
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,380
Yeah.

1051
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,940
Not many bands have tromboners.

1052
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,500
The Swingin' Love Corpses did.

1053
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,660
Especially if you're not playing like Ska beat from 1994 or something.

1054
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,240
You know what I mean?

1055
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,200
Well, Colonel Sphinx Drummond did.

1056
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,320
He played Ska, trombone, and Swingin' Love Corpses in the 90s.

1057
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:49,560
Sure did.

1058
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,700
But that's what I said.

1059
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,640
That was in the 1990s.

1060
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,980
This is now, baby man.

1061
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,960
This is the time.

1062
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,140
This is now, man.

1063
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,140
Yeah, it is now.

1064
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,060
Well, there it is.

1065
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:02,680
Isn't that great?

1066
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,700
Woo, now.

1067
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,420
Let's live in the now.

1068
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,540
Whoop-de-doo.

1069
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,160
What's on TV in the now?

1070
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,140
What's going to be on in 10 minutes in the now?

1071
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,820
More to the point.

1072
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,620
There'll be a clip from Zingakaroo Gardens where Masura lives in the now.

1073
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1074
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1075
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1076
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1077
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1078
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1079
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1080
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1081
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1082
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1083
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1084
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1085
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1086
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1087
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1088
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:22,620


1089
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:29,520
And the kids all start cheering when they realize that Masura's going to make it and not be trapped by the evil Masura trappers.

1090
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,740
Dave, I get the impression that you kind of are anxious to see this new Godzilla movie.

1091
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,480
No, I'm more anxious to see Iron Sky again.

1092
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,380
Oh, it's on Netflix right now.

1093
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,460
Or is that Amazon?

1094
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,480
It's on one of those.

1095
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,300
Anyway, you saw Iron Sky?

1096
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,560
Yeah.

1097
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,300
That's the one with Sarah Palin as the president of the United States.

1098
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,600
And she meets Hitler riding a Tyrannosaurus at the Hollywood Theater.

1099
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:52,600


1100
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,660
And she's riding a hollow Earth at the end.

1101
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,040
Yeah, well.

1102
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,060
Or the beginning of the next one.

1103
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:03,140
The closeness to, you know, like what's really going on, man, that we don't get to know about.

1104
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,060
Did they tell us if they knew that Sarah Palin was riding a Tyrannosaurus in a hollow Earth?

1105
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,280
They did tell us.

1106
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,640
It's in that movie.

1107
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,300
Oh.

1108
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:14,760
Okay.

1109
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,900
You must not have been paying attention, Dave.

1110
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,380
I mean, anything they show in the movies is a hint.

1111
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:22,580
Oh.

1112
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,220
Of what they're about to do in real life.

1113
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:25,620
Right.

1114
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,400
Yeah.

1115
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,240
You should have figured that out yourself.

1116
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,180
It's obvious.

1117
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,180
It's self-evident, practically.

1118
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,560
I know.

1119
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,280
I was being such a crybaby there.

1120
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,720
I thought the Civil War was going to break out again between the East and the West.

1121
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,780
That's really going to be something to see.

1122
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,240
It's going to be a lot different than the old, you know.

1123
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,500
No.

1124
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,300
It's going to be the Civil War between the stupid people and the smart people.

1125
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,340
Where are you going to find enough smart people to have a war?

1126
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,060
That's it.

1127
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,240
That's the problem.

1128
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,140
Well, that's the problem.

1129
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:59,240
But because they're smart, they're worth like 20 or 30 stupid people in terms of the damage

1130
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,980
they can do once they put their mind to it.

1131
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,520
Most of them are just, you know, slacking off because they're the smart ones.

1132
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,160
They're not getting all agitated about everything.

1133
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,320
They're enjoying life.

1134
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,840
They're laying back and enjoying life like Bob.

1135
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:18,960
The Uncivil War.

1136
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,780
It smells like a barbecue right now.

1137
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:22,160
I can feel it.

1138
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,020
Is this Mark Mothersbrother right now wearing a brassiere?

1139
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:33,200
No, this is some really old, it's from a collection called Exotic Lounge.

1140
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,080
And this track is titled Hana Maui.

1141
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,500
But I don't know who did it.

1142
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,520
Oh, I love the early 1960s Hawaiian music.

1143
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,780
The atmospheres they used to put in the elevators.

1144
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,760
And it's just, it's just so good.

1145
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:57,080
Oh, man.

1146
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,360
Those were the days, I'm telling you, especially when I had enough time to really, you know,

1147
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,140
finish my experiments.

1148
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,720
Long before I was stopped by the state.

1149
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:17,360
Yeah, and the AMA and the Anti-Vivisectionist League and PETA.

1150
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,780
And every...

1151
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,760
Every...

1152
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,160
Basically, the UN, I think, stepped in to prevent your experiments from going any further.

1153
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,940
Well, wait a second, and they can't touch me because I don't live in the United States

1154
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,300
anymore.

1155
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,760
I'm now officially a Canadian citizen of the People's Republic of...

1156
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,020
What the hell's the name of that place?

1157
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,180
Oh, you're just living in Ashtabula, but you're really a Canadian citizen.

1158
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,600
That's right.

1159
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,040
I live in Canada.

1160
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,420
I live in Canada, and I have for quite some time now.

1161
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,580
In fact, I have royal blood in my roots.

1162
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,000
I don't know if you know this or not, but Queen Iliad and the Iliad and the other idiots

1163
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:08,080
dancing around there, they're not really related to Queen Elizabeth, but I am.

1164
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,480
Who isn't?

1165
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,320
Just about every Anglo in the country is related.

1166
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,180
They're all inbred royals.

1167
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:30,140
Even those Duck Dynasty guys are related to the Baron of Hanover and the King of Huff

1168
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,480
Hines.

1169
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,140
They're all interrelated.

1170
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,520
The Tsar, the Tsar's family.

1171
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,420
Well, the Tsar's skeleton's family.

1172
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,680
It gives meaning to the joke, the aristocrats, you know?

1173
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,140
Right.

1174
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,620
I mean, we have plenty of...

1175
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,120
Well, and it also puts it in context because that's the way those people really

1176
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,580
behave.

1177
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,300
Rich people, you know?

1178
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,040
Rich, powerful people.

1179
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,160
Well, that's the meaning of the joke.

1180
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:54,780
What?

1181
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,500
I can't believe it.

1182
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,300
I've never seen it.

1183
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,960
What do you call yourselves?

1184
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,360
Aristocrats.

1185
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,600
Titty boom, you know?

1186
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,760
It pretty much says it.

1187
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,360
Well, of course, that's the joke that can't be told on broadcast anything.

1188
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,980
There's a whole movie of it that Penn and Teller helped put together of just comedians

1189
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,160
talking about the law of the land, the law of the land, and the law of the land.

1190
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1191
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1192
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1193
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1194
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1195
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1196
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1197
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1198
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,160


1199
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,420
The horror and wonder of that one joke, almost 90-minute movie.

1200
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,600
The Aristocrats?

1201
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,240
Yeah.

1202
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:26,720
Yeah.

1203
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:27,900
Yeah.

1204
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,840
That's a great movie.

1205
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,920
Speaking of Penn Jillette, he's in that Subgenius movie a whole lot.

1206
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:39,860
Even though he never really channeled Bob or anything, he's always been a big supporter.

1207
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,680
And he's famous, so, you know, and he talks good.

1208
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,240
So, they used a whole bunch of him talking.

1209
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,400
Anybody with more than 35 cents in their pocket who can pronounce their own last name

1210
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,940
is good to go as far as you're concerned.

1211
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:53,960
Are you all right, all right?

1212
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,260
Well, yeah, with me, sure, yeah.

1213
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,920
I'm up for any program.

1214
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,880
But some editors and directors are a little more picky.

1215
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:09,640
That's why my version of the Subgenius documentary is, I think it's 47 hours long now.

1216
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,860
So, I haven't, nothing is cut.

1217
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,340
It includes everything.

1218
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,220
It doesn't have a title.

1219
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,720
It's not a title that we ever shot from both cameras.

1220
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,100
So, yeah, Sandy did a good job cutting it down.

1221
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,720
And her friend, her buddy there.

1222
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,200
She sure did.

1223
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:31,720
The unsung, you know, nobody knows the names of editors or producers or the cinematographers,

1224
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,680
for that matter, except a few, you know, super film buffs.

1225
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:42,540
But Lauren Sanders was the editor of the Subgenius movie, and I mentioned that several times,

1226
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,220
because by the time y'all finally got it, you were already in the movie.

1227
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:45,320
You were already in the movie.

1228
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,320


1229
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,320


1230
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:45,320


1231
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,860
And by the time we see the thing, you're gonna go,

1232
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,000
good Lord, that woman must have worked her butt off.

1233
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,640
And she did.

1234
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,180
Well...

1235
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,780
Well, I mean, yeah.

1236
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,660
There's a pretty good replica still attached.

1237
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,060
But I'm not supposed to get into that.

1238
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:07,880
The ladies of the Subgenius movie informed me that it was in bad taste for me to get

1239
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,440
on stage and go on and on and on about how, what a great shoot it was to be on, because

1240
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,200
there were so many people.

1241
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,200


1242
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,200


1243
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,200


1244
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,740
There were so many attractive ladies working on it.

1245
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,760
But you know, it's like, looks aren't everything.

1246
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,740
And that's like, me too.

1247
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,120
And I'm just focusing on surface values, and that's not right.

1248
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,760
But I couldn't help but...

1249
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,580
It's not PC, man.

1250
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,640
It was very noticeable.

1251
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,620
That's all I can say.

1252
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,500
It was something that was hard for me not to remark on it.

1253
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,820
Boy, you Texas pig and you snick.

1254
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,360
Sniveling large ass of a boydness.

1255
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,460
What's going on?

1256
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,560
Boyd.

1257
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,120
Devoid.

1258
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:46,820
Devoid.

1259
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:58,560
Not only is it a gang of strong, powerful, headstrong, smart women, and funny, but also...

1260
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,020
By golly.

1261
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,420
Well, I'm not supposed to talk about that aspect of it.

1262
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,180
So I won't.

1263
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:06,860
See, that's it.

1264
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,640
I'm a good boy.

1265
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,200
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack, which is a radio...

1266
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,900
It's actually a religious program.

1267
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,340
It's...

1268
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,840
I know it's kind of hard to imagine that, since we've been...

1269
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:24,420
Well, we've been talking about an important actual movie that's been made about our religion.

1270
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,000
And it's actually good.

1271
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,800
And we like it.

1272
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,400
Everybody who sees it likes it.

1273
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,320
That means that people who hate it are really gonna hate it.

1274
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,760
I can't wait for that to start.

1275
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,340
But first, it's gonna end up on Netflix, where the haters can see it to hate it.

1276
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,740
Or something.

1277
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,440
Anyway, Church of the Subgenius.

1278
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:51,880
You can learn more about it before the movie comes out at subgenius.com.

1279
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,580
And we actually do have simple descriptions in the book.

1280
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,960
They can find out about my book, Neighbor World, too.

1281
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,240
Right.

1282
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,800
Dave's book, Neighbor World, can be learned about there.

1283
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,560
And the book of the subgenius can be learned about.

1284
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,660
It's got more positive reproachments.

1285
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,580
Many videos can be learned.

1286
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:19,020
And subgenius.com as a URL can be learned.

1287
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,120
And every hour of slack that we've ever done.

1288
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:30,540
Which includes an awful lot of ESO Swamp Radio shows, basically.

1289
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,260
With the dumb callers cut out.

1290
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,880
It's all there.

1291
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,200
It's all there.

1292
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,120
All this color.

1293
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,560
Beautiful color art.

1294
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,220
All the ancient black everything.

1295
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,420
The scars.

1296
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,620
The mental illnesses.

1297
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,420
The suicide attempts.

1298
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,540
It's all there.

1299
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,500
The highlights and the dark side.

1300
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,060
The dark side is there, too.

1301
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,320
Wouldn't you want to present...

1302
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,460
What else would you want to present other than both the dark and the light of the whole?

1303
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,520
We present everything.

1304
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,200
It's a cross-section.

1305
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,240
It's not everything.

1306
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,180
But it's a fair cross-section.

1307
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,200
Because it includes lots of really stupid stuff.

1308
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,120
Yeah.

1309
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,040
It's enough to make you fear the police.

1310
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,240
And the regular army of the...

1311
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm sorry.

1312
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,420
It's called subgenius for a reason.

1313
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,800
Instead of genius.

1314
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:24,740
Anyway.

1315
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,780
It's also box 807.

1316
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,000
Glen Rose, Texas.

1317
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,480
76043.

1318
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:38,560
Although, for the next couple of months, we'll be using our old Cleveland Heights P.O. box, too.

1319
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,860
And getting the house ready.

1320
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,460
We have to go.

1321
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:49,620
I'm going to play a song by the Psychoskeletons, aptly titled, Think Before You Act.

1322
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,680
I think I made the intro movement too long for you, 영갛i .

1323
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:25,780
Will you play the ever-more mystical song?

1324
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:25,780


1325
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:25,780


1326
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:25,780


1327
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:25,780


1328
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:25,920
I have no idea what to do.

1329
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1330
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1331
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1332
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1333
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1334
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1335
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1336
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1337
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:25,920


1338
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,840
ToUUU RIP Special thanks to all Gyachiy.

1339
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,700
Thank you.

1340
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,540
Thank you.

1341
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,120
Thank you.

1342
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,660
Thank you.

1343
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,420
Thank you.
