1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,800
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,020
The Genius Power Bros.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,640
What?

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,800
I don't like it, Joe.

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,540
Yeah, me too.

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,540
We'll just have to sweat this out.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,120
Handle whatever it is when it happens.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,900
Joe, maybe if you went to him and said that you had a change of mind about...

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,120
Bob?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,840
Bob?

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,140
Bob?

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:32,680
Bob?

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,300
Bob?

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,420
Bob?

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,400
You make me sick.

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,460
Tell Bob.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,760
Let's bring it to vertical one more time.

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,900
I get to be another dumb American mime.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,820
Miles and miles and miles I go to get a word with whether conspiracy heads are dreaming like a jerk.

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,720
People pushing, collating, checking the mail.

22
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,640
What the hell going on here?

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,040
Pink belly, pink belly, pink belly, pink belly.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,980
People pushing, collating.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,900
Checking the mail.

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,000
Peter Cushing, soul critic.

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,720
The stupid emails.

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,380
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
But I don't want to be so into the squalid red lines.

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,900
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess.

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,580
What the hell going on here?

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,260
I just gotta...

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:28,640
What the hell going on here?

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,480
I just gotta...

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,340
I just gotta...

36
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,920
The oblivion of work is often interrupted by work.

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,520
But my favorite greats, which seems to never abate, as of late awaits a whole other day

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,060
when the space freight of the potential multiple may derive from this world I hate.

39
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,700
And on that day I'm gonna party like it's 1998.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,400
No one more pink nosing or whoring.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,540
All we'll be doing is soaring throughout the doors of perception, riding past the waves

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:58,960
of deception.

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,540
No word of reception into the arms of the goddesses.

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,040
It's beyond description.

45
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,620
What the hell going on here?

46
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,580
Heartache.

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,320
Lack.

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,740
It's 1998.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,400
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,780
But I don't want to be so into the squalid red lines.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,940
So I comply with all this stuff daily, I guess.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,420
I just gotta...

53
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,660
What the hell going on here?

54
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:27,620
Work.

55
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,500
I just gotta...

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


64
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,560
I just gotta...

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,580
Work.

67
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,640
Work.

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,780
Work.

69
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:28,780


70
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:28,880
Work.

71
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:28,880


72
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,760
C-C-C jeans.

73
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:41,840
Okay, I got the Fallavana hat on.

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:41,840


75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,500
M-my top.

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,540
Let's ring me for the wild Alsace.

77
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,060
Oh...

78
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,440
in big Vice.

79
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,020
STILL inufenwoven, at least, doves, n著 hen we're nearby!

80
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,280
Hmm...

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,460
What do we have...

82
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,400
L lag.

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,860
Co-Lading, checking the mail

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Table pushing, Co-Lading checking the mail

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Peter Cushing, Soulcrating the stupid emails

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,380
Don't know how they expect me to meet all these deadlines

87
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,740
But I don't want to resort to the Scarlet Red Line

88
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,920
So I can fly with all this stuff daily I guess

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,460
What the hell's going on?

90
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,180
I just got a

91
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,100
I need to get a

92
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,600
I need to get a

93
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,640
I need to get a new

94
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,440
Work slot

95
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,240
More door, more gore

96
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,980
Tour, more door

97
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,720
Store, four core

98
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,200
Back for more

99
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,460
What the hell's going on?

100
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,420
Often I feel like a ghost

101
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,120
Insubstantial

102
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,940
Drifting

103
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,240
Evanescent

104
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,040
Amidst waves of dumb circumstance

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
Living dead

106
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,940
Glimpses of life but

107
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,360
Distant

108
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,900
As behind a thick wall

109
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,180
I'm just a

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,420
Glass

111
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,360
The oblivion of work is often

112
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Interrupted

113
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,900
By work

114
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,980

116
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:37,660
Nope

121
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,600

122
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:51,860
できる

123
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,200
oy!

124
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,640
What the hell's going on here?

125
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,020
Pink belly, pink belly.

126
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,340
And with that song, Pink Belly,

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,260
we welcome Reverend Norell Preff to Hour of Slack.

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,920
In this case, the Hour of Slack number 913.

129
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,140
And there's a lot more where that came from.

130
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,300
As Reverend Norell Preff sent us a whole CD-R full of MP3s that he did

131
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,860
under the name Heavy Confetti.

132
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,180
And, in fact, that's www.heavyconfetti.com.

133
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,200
In fact, there'll be another one of those right after we stop talking to ourselves.

134
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,560
Submarine or something.

135
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:47,840
Huh?

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
I don't know. I was just talking to myself.

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,120
Yeah, me too, man.

138
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,340
Man, I'm having trouble following anything tonight because the devil.

139
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,200
The devil is...

140
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,980
The devil has gotten in there because they let the devil come in.

141
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,740
At Halloween, they just open their hearts to the devil.

142
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,820
He's looking behind every dumpster.

143
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
Now, what are you talking about?

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,380
I'm going to die, Jesus.

145
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,380
And I'm going to get so drunk I forget about Bob.

146
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,040
And I'm going to grow a single horn from my head.

147
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,260
And let the demons speak from my navel.

148
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,020
Actually, I wish I could get that excited about Halloween.

149
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,580
But, you know, it's a whole wow Halloween.

150
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,300
It's a special day.

151
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,620
You act like somebody you're not.

152
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,160
Like a Frankenstein?

153
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:25,900
You have a...

154
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,920
You say...

155
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,660
You pretend you're someone else.

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,540
You have a disguise all day.

157
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,780
What is the purpose?

158
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
You say you act crazy.

159
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,440
Oh, man.

160
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,640
Well, it's a special day.

161
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,200
Yeah, I understand.

162
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,800
Maybe for some people it is.

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,980
It just isn't the same when you do it.

164
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,520
You know, I used to love Halloween.

165
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,840
And yet now it's...

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,560
Now that I do it every day.

167
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,600
Oh, the first time I...

168
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,480
Now that every day is Halloween.

169
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,400
Ah.

170
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
Dubs.

171
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:51,880
Dubs.

172
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Dubs.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,840
Dubs.

174
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,380
Dubs.

175
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,600
Respecting you and your needs.

176
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,940
Now, where was I?

177
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:07,980
Dubs.

178
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:09,940
Dubs.

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:11,860
Dubs.

180
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Dubs.

181
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,680
Respecting you and your needs.

182
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,920
Repeat yourself, please.

183
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,180
Repeat yourself, please.

184
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,360
Repeat yourself, please.

185
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,500
Repeat yourself, please.

186
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,140
Dubs.

187
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,100
Dubs.

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Dubs.

189
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,440
Dubs.

190
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,580
Respecting you and your needs.

191
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,900
Do it, for real, Dubs.

192
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
Respecting you and your needs.

193
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,000
Now, where was I?

194
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,900
Now, where was I?

195
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,060
Boggs, are you creamy?

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
Shut up, Muppet.

197
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:01,520
I've CNEEKED

198
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,960
Ugh, you're homag0

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:02,960


200
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:02,960


201
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:02,960


202
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
Respecting you and your needs.

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,900
Repeat yourself, please.

204
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Repeat yourself, please.

205
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,940
Repeat yourself, pagesame Corh fulfillment

206
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:10,940


207
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,400
GSB

208
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I stay at home.

209
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,440
I stay at home at 9 40.

210
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:16,660


211
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:16,660


212
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,940
Now, where was I?

213
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,100
Drums.

214
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,920
Repeat yourself, please.

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,960
Now, where was I?

216
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,540
Respecting you and your needs.

217
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,920
Repeat yourself, please.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,620
Repeat yourself, please.

219
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:13,620


220
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,460
Where was I?

221
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,540
Norrell Preff, friends.

222
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,460
www.heavyconfetti.com

223
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,020
You ain't heard the last of him.

224
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,840
Now, friends, we all,

225
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,240
we all talk about Bob.

226
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,100
But do you have faith, friends?

227
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,280
Do you really have faith?

228
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,040
I'm going to tell you how much faith I have.

229
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,540
I have faith

230
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,080
that by the time

231
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,900
I leave this revival tonight,

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,940
Bob will have given me

233
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,620
a new car.

234
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,760
The Lord giveth,

235
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,600
somebody giveth,

236
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,560
me he taketh away,

237
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,920
and Bob laughs and laughs and laughs.

238
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,200
And he ain't laughing with us, friends.

239
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,640
And on the way back from Ex Day, I think,

240
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,440
perhaps it was that chair sitting in the middle of the highway

241
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,120
that we ran over coming around a curb.

242
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,920
It caused a little oil leak that later caused a little other thing.

243
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,140
And the I-van, the van that the church,

244
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,320
the church van, my friend, the church van, it went down.

245
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,920
I wish I could say it was the church van.

246
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
It was a conspiracy that put that chair there,

247
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,840
but it was probably one of my fellow subgeniuses.

248
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,080
He didn't strap it onto the pickup or something.

249
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,320
It all goes around, comes around.

250
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,620
I probably got that person's $30

251
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,080
and they destroyed my oil pan

252
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,040
and they destroyed my engine.

253
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,660
But I know that Bob,

254
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't even have to worry about this.

255
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,780
In fact, we just crashed Princess Wee's car

256
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,120
because we have so much faith.

257
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,120
We did it for fun.

258
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,240
Because I know,

259
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,640
then I will be,

260
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,660
somebody will come up to me and go,

261
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,260
God damn it, before I sober up,

262
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm going to use this title.

263
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,760
God, we need, Bob's right.

264
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,420
People, they don't dare to say it.

265
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,440
But it's true.

266
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,280
There really is a conspiracy of normal people

267
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,360
ganging up against the weirdos and abnormals.

268
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,240
It's been going on since the beginning of time

269
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,720
and it will continue.

270
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,620
And it continues even among the subgeniuses.

271
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,400
Who beat up even the weirdos among them.

272
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Who happen to be the ones with nice haircuts

273
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,500
and jobs and, you know,

274
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,100
no speech impediment at all.

275
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,740
The beautiful, handsome people,

276
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,080
the pretty people,

277
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,560
the lucky people.

278
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,780
Oh wait, no, that's Bob.

279
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,680
If it's Bob, it's okay.

280
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,160
See, boys, it's not queer if it's Bob.

281
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,700
From the Indie Bible,

282
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,620
praise God.

283
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,400
Quee-gee-bo.

284
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,560
And now, well, how about that Rush Limbaugh?

285
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,460
Although glass house dwellers shouldn't throw stones.

286
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,560
We've all had bad habits.

287
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,680
But Mr. Sister here in Cleveland

288
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,960
got hold of this incredible private recording, friends.

289
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,940
A private recording of Rush Limbaugh losing it.

290
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,600
Oh, I can handle it.

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,580
I can handle it.

292
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,020
I can handle it.

293
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,540
I can handle it.

294
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,700
I can handle it.

295
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,220
I can handle it.

296
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,440
I can handle it.

297
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,260
What's the matter?

298
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,060
You feel, you look depressed.

299
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,700
Are you depressed?

300
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,480
There's no reason to be depressed.

301
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,540
Do you want to work here?

302
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,820
You've got to stay alert.

303
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,340
Do you know how to do that?

304
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,580
Take a pill.

305
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
You don't want to be alert?

306
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,840
You like the fog?

307
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,880
Okay, fine.

308
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,260
Take a pill.

309
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,100
We've got pills for you to sleep just like that.

310
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,860
You want to maintain an even keel?

311
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,280
No ups, no downs?

312
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,080
Take a pill.

313
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,100
What is this pure chemical attitude for?

314
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,900
Taking pills.

315
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,220
Everybody takes them.

316
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,800
Doctors, lawyers, butcher, baker, candlestick maker.

317
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,100
Everybody.

318
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,340
Why do people feel so bad about feeling good?

319
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,660
Why can't they just take a pill?

320
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,660
Pain.

321
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,360
Also in my neck now.

322
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,340
Also in my neck now.

323
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,340
Also in my neck now.

324
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,380
Over the past several years I've tried to break my dependence on inaccuracies and distortions.

325
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,800
Pain.

326
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,340
Also in my neck now.

327
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,080
Also in my neck now.

328
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,360
Also in my neck now.

329
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,340
Also in my neck now.

330
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
I am a complete dick.

331
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,760
I am a complete dick.

332
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,760
I am a complete dick.

333
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,360
Pain.

334
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,340
Also in my neck now.

335
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,340
Also in my neck now.

336
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,380
Also in my neck now.

337
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,320
Also in my neck now.

338
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,720
The present time, the authorities are highly addicted.

339
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,680
The present time, the authorities are highly addicted.

340
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,500
For conquering great demons, they are said to be great demons.

341
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,540
For conquering great demons, they are said to be great demons.

342
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,000
Inaccuracies and distortions.

343
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,820
Inaccuracies and distortions.

344
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,920
It is what it is. I take it for what it is.

345
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,900
It is what it is. I take it for what it is.

346
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,500
Because when this is all over with, I look forward, and it actually is never going to be over.

347
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:14,520
I want you to know that I'm no role model. So I look forward to resuming our excursions into prescription painkillers together.

348
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,060
And this medication, it literally has sustained me.

349
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,900
And this medication, it literally has sustained me.

350
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,460
Also in the past several years I've tried to break my dependence on inaccuracies and distortions.

351
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,980
Over the past several years I've tried to...

352
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm only going to say that...

353
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,480
I'm only going to say that...

354
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm only going to say that...

355
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,340
I'm only going to say that I look forward to resuming our excursions into prescription painkillers together.

356
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
I'm only going to say that...

357
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm only going to say that...

358
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:45,760


359
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,880
I take it for what it is.

360
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,000
I take it for what it is.

361
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,960
I take it for what it is.

362
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,560
It is what it is.

363
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,080
It is what it is.

364
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,980
I重 what it is...

365
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,160
It is what it is.

366
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,420
I take it.

367
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,920
For what it is...

368
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,420
Pain!

369
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,340
Also in my neck now.

370
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,320
Also in my neck now.

371
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,340
Also in my neck now.

372
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,340
Also in my neck now.

373
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,160
It is what it is.

374
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,400
I take it.

375
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,380
Yet another mix by Nor Elbrecht.

376
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,640
How about that?

377
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,360
www.heavyconfetti.com

378
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,780
I guess this is the

379
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,540
Norrell Preff special show.

380
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,780
But now, for a few cuts,

381
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,860
let us slide back into

382
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,480
the world of Mr.

383
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,820
Fernando Nandeli

384
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,660
Murr and his trained

385
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,320
pills.

386
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,020
Reality is important.

387
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,740
All the experimental. Reality is

388
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,600
important. Experimental techniques.

389
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,080
Reality is important. Techniques.

390
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,000
None gave. Reality is important.

391
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,600
None gave. Amazing.

392
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,080
Reality is important. Amazing

393
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,000
results. Reality is important.

394
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Here being aligned.

395
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,920
Reality is important. Being aligned

396
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,960
for accuracy. Reality is important.

397
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,220
Okay. Okay, I'm a little

398
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,660
bit high. Oh, no!

399
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,180
Yes!

400
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,160
Yes!

401
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,020
Mom thinks I should be in jail.

402
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,780
Why does Bob

403
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,580
want this woman in jail?

404
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,720
I'm beginning to smell a big

405
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,940
fat commie rat.

406
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,980
Why would you do that

407
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,420
to me, Bob?

408
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
They try to make you

409
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,940
comfortable. They try to put you

410
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,640
in a

411
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,600
quite nice situation

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,820
with food that look

413
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,860
like, look more like

414
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,680
a dog food. Food

415
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,500
for wild animals.

416
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,440
Alright?

417
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,660
, okay.

418
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,780
This is the truth.

419
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,620
Huh? Oh, we're almost done.

420
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,960
Yeah, we're in the plan.

421
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,040
CD truth?

422
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,080
All spread out.

423
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,520
Like, naked.

424
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,500
Me and my girl Amy

425
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,940
and Chris

426
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,120
and Amanda.

427
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,520
We're all spread out in the plan.

428
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,660
Yeah. Here in Tremont.

429
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,940
Naked. Yeah.

430
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,780
Listen to your show.

431
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,880
Yeah. Oh, man. Under the

432
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,220
stars. Have the girls climb on the speaker.

433
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,100
Turn the bass up all

434
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,920
the way. Oh, man.

435
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,340
No.

436
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,060
There's no masturbation or anything.

437
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,500
There's just like

438
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,620
really good vibes, you know.

439
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,540
Cause it's like almost

440
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,520
after the half moon.

441
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,840
Yeah, I understand what that means.

442
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,980
Can you dig it? Yeah, this is terrorist talk.

443
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,960
This is double speak.

444
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,960
Okay, man. Yeah.

445
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,220
I think so. Yeah.

446
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,720
Or you know, alien. It could be alien

447
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,460
double speak. Well, it's

448
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,600
September 11th, and I, well,

449
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,220
no, it just finished being September.

450
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,740
It's not anymore. Now it's September 12th.

451
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,120
We're safe. So the balloon

452
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,300
has gone down. Oh, yeah.

453
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,260
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

454
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,520
All right. I'll grant you point one.

455
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,740
He is planning, but what's

456
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,700
he planning this time of year?

457
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,780
Barley, lima beans, maybe and

458
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,780
or and or what and

459
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,140
marijuana or some other illegal

460
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,180
crop. You know, he just could

461
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,660
be. Hold it.

462
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,160
We are back. We are back.

463
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,400
Going strong. We got our guests here in the studio.

464
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,500
We've got.

465
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,200
We have got sacred scribe number.

466
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
I don't know what the number is.

467
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,160
So 73273. It's always either 273 or 278.

468
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm sacred scribe number 273.

469
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,520
The prior 272 or.

470
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,900
It actually came to pretty bad ends.

471
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,740
Most of them. I've lasted longer than most.

472
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,260
Hmm. I don't know exactly what to attribute that to,

473
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,280
except for the fact that J.R. Bob Dobbs was killed during my watch.

474
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,240
So maybe it's been easier on me.

475
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,980
He's been killed a few times, though.

476
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,520
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. He came back.

477
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,080
It's you know, it's like killing Daffy Duck practically.

478
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,320
See, in those case, we don't.

479
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Those Christians talk about how their savior died and rose for them.

480
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,080
You.

481
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,660
Jesus only died and rose once.

482
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,760
Right. Right.

483
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,760
Well, that's a lot.

484
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,260
I mean, I'm not that we don't mean to to demean his achievement.

485
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,220
I mean, somebody has to come first.

486
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
True. But I mean.

487
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,760
And he wasn't really even the first, but he had the best publicist.

488
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,940
Definitely. Apollonius of Tyana did it.

489
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,620
Yeah. Who knows about him?

490
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,400
If you haven't seen Seven Faces of Dr.

491
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,300
Lowe recently, you're out of the loop, dude.

492
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,660
This is.

493
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,780
Also with me, Dr. Howell.

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,580
And Dr. Howell and Owl, the toast of stage, screen and radio and that game Half Life.

495
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,380
Oh, yes. I recognize your voice immediately.

496
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,440
Actually, I keep waiting for you to say I'm waiting here for my colleagues.

497
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,580
Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?

498
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,200
Those must be lines from the game.

499
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,460
Yes, they are. Yes.

500
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes. The secret passwords of those who know them.

501
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,860
Signifiers of a special and hidden bomb.

502
00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:03,100
And well, we went to a revival in the neighboring state of Indiana in the town of Indianapolis.

503
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,340
There weren't no Indians. There weren't no apples.

504
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,800
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

505
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,180
Just sprawling, dreadful urban waste.

506
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,480
Well, and the club.

507
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,440
Well, yes. And the club. Yes.

508
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,600
And it was full of girls.

509
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,380
And the girls. Yes. The girls.

510
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,940
And those beasts. There's lots of beasts.

511
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,060
True. Beasts.

512
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,620
And those beasts in Hofhorn and Skalihine.

513
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,140
The horrendous exemplars of nature gone haywire.

514
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,160
Okay. Does anybody else need to come forward and confess their sins and how the conspiracy

515
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,440
guilt demons live their ass?

516
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,320
Oh, there's at least one or two more people. All right.

517
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,480
All right. What is it that you, what's your name?

518
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,540
Stelio.

519
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay. What is it that you have done that can use these conspiracy guilt demons in your ass?

520
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,000
That would be copyright infringement.

521
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,380
Oh.

522
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,260
You're gonna get the RIA suit in your ass, man.

523
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,980
I need you to do a superposition on the pulpit.

524
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,600
Are you ready for a healing?

525
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,040
Oh, yeah.

526
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,820
Oh, yeah, baby. Woo!

527
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,020
Woo, woo, woo!

528
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,520
It's Stelio.

529
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,120
Oh, do you feel the demons have left your ass?

530
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,440
Oh, yeah.

531
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,640
Oh, yeah.

532
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,240
All right.

533
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,980
Oh, this one. Oh, yeah.

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,540
Oh, man.

535
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,140
Banjo Bob!

536
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,960
Oh, yeah, the guilt demons are strong in this one, I can tell. Banjo Bob! What have you

537
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,600
done? The conspiracy guilt demons are inhabiting your ass.

538
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,440
A Banjo Bob.

539
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,800
That's a laugh right there, let me tell you.

540
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,720
Assume a position on the pulpit.

541
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,540
Woo!

542
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,240
Oh, I like those pants. Woo!

543
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,680
Oh, baby.

544
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,000
Banjo Bob.

545
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,680
Oh, baby.

546
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,040
Oh, baby.

547
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,040


548
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,040


549
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,240
Banjo Bob.

550
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,180
I hate this game.

551
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,260
You feel the conspiracy guilt demons have left.

552
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,160
Oh, you need more?

553
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,060
Okay, okay.

554
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm dying.

555
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,420
Worms, worms, oh yeah, that's funny.

556
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,780
Oh yeah, they tell me to stop and they don't really want me to.

557
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,440
No, never stop.

558
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,940
Okay.

559
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:16,960
Reverend Nikki Deathchick at the Indianapolis Devival 2003 and now a rare recording of one

560
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,600
of the first ground breaking Dr. Bands.

561
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:20,980
A very, very special guest.

562
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:20,980


563
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,940
Spike Jones.

564
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,400
Speaking of which, the doctor band that we're hearing in the background

565
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,000
is the Swingin' Love Corpses in their latest ancient album,

566
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,040
The Bay Mix Keepers.

567
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,440
But now, next now, Spike Jones.

568
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:12,540
The Bay Mix Keepers

569
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:42,520
The Bay Mix Keepers

570
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,000
The Bay Mix Keepers

571
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,880
Bob Song.

572
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,940
Bob.

573
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,380
Bob.

574
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,280
Bob.

575
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,820
Slowly, hopefully, hopefully, slowly,

576
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,340
uh,

577
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,080
thisly with your giving.

578
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,800
What about the government, um, um,

579
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,900
back at the Congress,

580
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,800
five billion in cash for the airlines?

581
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,400
The United States and its quest against them.

582
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,840
But dot, dot, dot,

583
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,280
Charlie P. Hinaway says,

584
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,900
U.S. diplomats say,

585
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,880
and it's in the mountains you can see from Yemen's capital,

586
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,380
where Western diplomats say,

587
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,260
thousands of Arabs who'd say,

588
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,860
trained and fought in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda

589
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,400
beyond the reach of government authority

590
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,940
just over a porous border with southern Saudi-A.

591
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Suspects grew up.

592
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,980
Though the government has militant Islamist training camps

593
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,700
within its borders,

594
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,320
Well, there are obviously a number of cops

595
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,400
that have cops, cops, cops, cops.

596
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,960
Each night when I return the cab to the garage,

597
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
I have to clean the back seat.

598
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,360
I love you, Mama.

599
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,060
Ah, damn you!

600
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,800
I love you, Mama.

601
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,540
I ought to kill you right now.

602
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,540
I love you, Mama.

603
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,560
Mama.

604
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,220
Mama.

605
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,200
Mama.

606
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:07,780


607
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,640
God!

608
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,560
God!

609
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,680
God!

610
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,520
God damn you all to hell!

611
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,520
I love you, Mama.

612
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,940
You mean it!

613
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,380
You mean it!

614
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,720
Some nights I clean out the blood.

615
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,400
Brought to you by Fernanda Namby, Limor.

616
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,840
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

617
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,560
None. They screw in hot tubs.

618
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,720
Well, actually, there was an answer to that question.

619
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,060
It was something like 5,262.

620
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,780
5,260 to create the mass,

621
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,200
clustering compression shrinking machine,

622
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,180
and two to climb inside the light bulb.

623
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,940
Ooh, yes.

624
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,220
A subgenius joke.

625
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:06,020
Won a prize on a rock station about 25 years ago.

626
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,060
You see, the rest of you guys out there,

627
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,240
you're just not with it.

628
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,340
You don't understand the subtleties of this kind of humor.

629
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,420
You know, it's no wonder that we lose our patience with you sometimes,

630
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,840
because you just seem not to get it.

631
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,960
And it takes forever for you guys to come stumbling and halting away,

632
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,320
and to keep up with the rest of us.

633
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,360
Well, you gotta get on the ball.

634
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,920
Step up and hurry up, or we're just gonna leave you behind in the dust.

635
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,900
That's just the way it is.

636
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,200
Hmm.

637
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,860
This is lofty humor.

638
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,080
This is advanced, high-class humor we're doing here.

639
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,620
We're laying some high-class humor on you,

640
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,120
and you're just not picking up on it.

641
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,600
The lofty laugh in the dark.

642
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,880
The sneaker at the end of the bedpost.

643
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,940
Don't know why.

644
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,840
Where do people think they're, uh...

645
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,540
The chortle hidden in the basket of laundry.

646
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,080
We have them all, and you got nothing.

647
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:01,260
Oh!

648
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:01,940
Oh!

649
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,860
Oh!

650
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,800
My pants!

651
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,160
Oh!

652
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,460
I forgot to pull them off.

653
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,480
Oh!

654
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,900
It's a killer!

655
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,020
Gosh.

656
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,280
Oh, gosh.

657
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,040
Oh, lady!

658
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,200
Oh!

659
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:14,560
Oh!

660
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:14,860
Oh!

661
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,600
206.

662
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,260
This is a...

663
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,120
888-669-2323.

664
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,080
Call Jesus or Magdalene and, uh...

665
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,360
And get him out of bed.

666
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,680
The hour is late.

667
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,580
The moon is down.

668
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,400
I have not heard the clocks.

669
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,820
Come upon Jesus like a thief in the night

670
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,520
for a change.

671
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
And ye never know,

672
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,920
And ye never know when the master cometh.

673
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,100
Bob is coming, friends.

674
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,360
And by that,

675
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,380
I don't mean that Bob

676
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,780
Bob was somewhere else and is on his way here.

677
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,000
What I mean is Bob is coming.

678
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,240
When you come, that's Bob.

679
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,300
It's a gerund, Joko.

680
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,180
Bob is coming.

681
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,100
Yes.

682
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,380
It was only an allegory, that grinning face all the time

683
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,300
that you thought might represent something else

684
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,700
than what it represented, that moment of coital release.

685
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,300
That moment when the DNA gets its way.

686
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,700
When the floodgates are opened

687
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,700
and the biological imperative strides forth.

688
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,620
Man, this dirty talk is turning me on.

689
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm getting all hot and bothered.

690
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,200
Perhaps you'd like to look at this,

691
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,540
the official Columbia University Journal of Paleontological Research,

692
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,360
page 272.

693
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,460
Look at that spiral.

694
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,080
I've never seen amino acids do that before.

695
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,220
Well, this caused the fossilifer,

696
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,640
this prong in the case of the randy coelacanth,

697
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,700
first documented by Dr. E. L. Brundage and C. R. Runciter

698
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,260
in their reports with abstracts of 1999.

699
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,040
The randy coelacanth.

700
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,500
Yes, it was in quite a priapic state for many millions of years.

701
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,300
It's a hard fish to deal with, my friends.

702
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,720
Yes, the natives call it ungabulo nota,

703
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,260
which means sucker.

704
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,020
Which is odd, since there are no suckers anywhere on its body.

705
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,460
But perhaps they were actually referring to its place

706
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,720
in the great chain of all things as a chump for God and nature.

707
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,180
It's a monster.

708
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,140
It's a monster.

709
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,580
I've seen a monster, Dr. Hal.

710
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,420
I've seen this monster.

711
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,740
Well, you know, to them, maybe you're the monster.

712
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,800
Did you ever think of that?

713
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes, all the time.

714
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,340
Humans were the monsters.

715
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,560
God damn you all.

716
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,180
God damn.

717
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,240
A moment of realization searing a hot flash across our consciousness,

718
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
like the kiss of a whip.

719
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,160
This is the realization, the moment that you fear to meet

720
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,760
when you take that first great leap in the dark.

721
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,580
But it's all par for the course here on the Theological Information Highway.

722
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,500
We will relentlessly tell you the way it is,

723
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,940
and better you want to know that or not in the short time which has been allotted to us.

724
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,440
Nina Sam.

725
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,260
Ned Nena.

726
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,860
Sam!

727
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,580
Sammy.

728
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,380
Ned, dear.

729
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,900
Oh Ned, Ned, Ned.

730
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,880
Gordon, Sam.

731
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,380
Gordon.

732
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,120
Ned!

733
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,840
Sam.

734
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,520
I'm only Charlie.

735
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:36,960
Sam.

736
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,380
Gordon.

737
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,440
Gordon, Charlie, Gordon.

738
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,260
Charlie.

739
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,560
Nena.

740
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:39,960
Sam.

741
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,420
Gordon.

742
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:40,900
Gordon.

743
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,340
Gordon.

744
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
Charlie, Charlie, Daryl.

745
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,600
Daryl, Nino.

746
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,620
Madeline, Madeline.

747
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,140
Ned, Sam.

748
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,700
Sam.

749
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:45,960
Ned.

750
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,620
Sam, Sam.

751
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,480
Ned Sam.

752
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,460
My baby too.

753
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,700
I hate them. I want to be struck dead. I could watch them die.

754
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,600
No. Yes. No. Yes. Stop laughing.

755
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,740
Which side are you on?

756
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,560
Which side are you on?

757
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,280
Which side are you on?

758
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,120
Yes.

759
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,020
Which side are you on?

760
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,940
No.

761
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,900
Which side are you on?

762
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,700
Yes.

763
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,240
Which side are you on?

764
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,500
No.

765
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,160
Which side are you on?

766
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,280
Yes.

767
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,820
Which side are you on?

768
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,020
Which side are you on?

769
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,100
No.

770
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,860
Yes.

771
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
Yes.

772
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,820
I want y'all to check this out.

773
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,060
Yes.

774
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,460
Yes.

775
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:57,920
Yes.

776
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,100
No.

777
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:02,660
Yes.

778
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,180
Yes.

779
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,080

Yes.

783
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,480
Yes.

784
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,700
Yes.

785
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,880
Yes.

786
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:16,880


787
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:16,980
Yes.

788
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,740
No.

789
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,340
No.

790
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,040
No.

791
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:21,900
Yeah.

792
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes.

793
00:35:45,240 --> 00:36:14,920
No. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. Yes. Learn how to say no loud and clear. Yes. I want y'all to check this out. Yo. Now you know what I'm talking about.

794
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,340
You know what I'm saying?

795
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,380
You know what I'm saying?

796
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,540
You know what I'm saying?

797
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,700
And you'll know what time it is.

798
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,280
You know what I'm saying?

799
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,200
You know what I'm saying?

800
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,280
Check this out, though.

801
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,960
You know what I'm saying?

802
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,320
No.

803
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,180
You know what I'm saying?

804
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:24,980
You know.

805
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
You know what I'm saying?

806
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,640
No.

807
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,140
Because you can't.

808
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,460
You understand?

809
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,360
You know what I'm saying?

810
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,560
That's right.

811
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:29,980
That's good.

812
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,280
You know what I'm saying?

813
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,600
No.

814
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,440
You know what I'm saying?

815
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,240
Yo, man.

816
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,840
Not only that,

817
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,520
but yo,

818
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,460
you know what I'm saying?

819
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,600
And you'll know what time it is.

820
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,580
On, on, on.

821
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,460
Listen.

822
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
Some say I'm negative,

823
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,220
but they're not positive.

824
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,880
Some say I'm negative.

825
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,080
But they're not positive.

826
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,300
Some say I'm negative.

827
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,800
No.

828
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,080
No.

829
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,720
Some say I'm negative.

830
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,940
But they're not positive.

831
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,140
Some say I'm negative.

832
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,400
But they're not positive.

833
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,560
Some say I'm negative.

834
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,780
But they're not positive.

835
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,780
Some say I'm-

836
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:57,980
No.

837
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,320
No.

838
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,980
But they're not-

839
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,120
Yes?

840
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,460
Yes!

841
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,160
Say No!

842
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,060
Yes?

843
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,640
YES!

844
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:05,620
Say No!

845
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,840
And run home to tell your mom or dad.

846
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,540
Yes!

847
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,040
It's okay to say Noooo!

848
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,680
No!

849
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,220
Negative.

850
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:13,720
No.

851
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,260
Yes!

852
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,080
Say no.

853
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,860
One yes, yes, yes.

854
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,360
Yes!

855
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
It's okay to say no.

856
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:21,920
No.

857
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,400
No.

858
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,180
I got you.

859
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,500
No.

860
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,160
Yes!

861
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,520
No!

862
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,660
Yes!

863
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:27,720
No!

864
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,040
Yes!

865
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,100
Learn how to say no loud and clear.

866
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,080
No.

867
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,480
No.

868
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,200
No.

869
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,880
No.

870
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,480
No.

871
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,180
No.

872
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,740
No.

873
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
No smoking.

874
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Here, smoking is absolutely prohibited.

875
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,900
If you try again, it's always handcuffs for you.

876
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,000
One, two, three, two, oh, one.

877
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,220
Hey, give us a call up here.

878
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,240
216-686-5105.

879
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,020
We can shoot the breeze.

880
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,280
Actually, we can answer any question.

881
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,120
That is correct.

882
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,240
That's right.

883
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,060
Any question.

884
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,760
Any question.

885
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,700
Anything that is personally burdening your heart.

886
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,880
Ask Dr. Howell.

887
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,500
Dr. Howell is a doctor, and you can ask him, and he will answer.

888
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,220
Ask, and it shall be answered.

889
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:50,160
If you live in San Francisco, you have to pay to go see the Ask Dr. Howell show every

890
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,660
week.

891
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,180
Well, ultimately, you will pay to know what you really think, but if you attend my nightclub

892
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,340
act, you will be immaculated and seized up in the rupture.

893
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,500
And given the wedgie of faith.

894
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,660
Well, it's been known to happen.

895
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,760
That's right.

896
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,860
Bob by proxy, a bob by direct action.

897
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:18,640
It's still the same footprint that investigators have learned to recognize over the years.

898
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,100
The large, dobsley presence can not be hidden from the adroit.

899
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,660
Here's a question about a dream.

900
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,520
A dream.

901
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:31,940
Good.

902
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,280
We shall interpret your dream.

903
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
I had a dream.

904
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,660
I was loved of Bob.

905
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,760
Loved is in quotes.

906
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,360
I see.

907
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,840
I was loved of Bob.

908
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:41,840


909
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:41,840


910
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,600
It was so real, I could feel his pipe on my neck.

911
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,100
What does this mean?

912
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,800
Grab your ankle, sir.

913
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:58,720
It means that you were loved of Bob only in the most mechanical sense involved.

914
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,260
If Bob's teeth are still clenched and his pipe is still in place, you are receiving

915
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,440
only his perfunctory attentions, which I might add are better than most people ever

916
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,580
get or feel.

917
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:18,580
But do not confuse the love of Bob with the love between subgeniuses.

918
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:26,220
The love for Bob and the love of Bob for the subgenius clutch are two different things

919
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,400
and must always be so if the love of Bob is to have any validity or meaning.

920
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:41,560
Well, in that case, Dr. Howell, we must ask, why do the colorless ideas infect Bob?

921
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,780
Why do the colors of Bob affect us so?

922
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,580
Well, more people like bland food than like spicy food.

923
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,660
And more people like lack of ornamentation than furious baroque ornamentation.

924
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,180
The fact is the intensity which you would think one who longs to live life would seek

925
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,180
out is just a little too much for most people.

926
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,240
Why is this?

927
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,540
Because it tells them somehow on a subconscious level that they are not doing enough.

928
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:11,540


929
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,800
And are not getting enough.

930
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:21,940
And so it's easy for a colorless and bland idea to slide over us.

931
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,780
But there will always be someone who will, perhaps spasmodically, perhaps psychotically,

932
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:35,020
but still inject in one magnificent convulsion a little bit of color onto the scene.

933
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,240
And of course I'm going to hit you.

934
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,660
Well, all right, Dad.

935
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,260
If you want to hit me, go ahead.

936
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,680
You're right.

937
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,940
What a great trick I...

938
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,120
I bet I can never get one to hit me again.

939
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,440
Yeah.

940
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:56,860
Huh?

941
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,800
Oh, gosh, you think a guy could have some fun on his birthday?

942
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,300
Good night, Wally.

943
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,740
You know something, Beef?

944
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,300
Thanks.

945
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,580
You're welcome.

946
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:11,960


947
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,320
Huh?

948
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,260
Oh, that hurt my heart.

949
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,420
Now it's your turn to strip the best skin that science has to offer.

950
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,860
Clinical studies show you can make pores visible and accomplish an overall blotchiness,

951
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,040
stripping the skin of essential oils.

952
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,960
Plus, luxurious and elegant wrinkles and age spots

953
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,940
like these cost a dime in department stores or salons.

954
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,440
But if you call now, you can try the complete blotching age spots for hundreds of dollars.

955
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,220
This deep cleansing lotion effectively removes skin cells and an overall smoother, younger-looking complexion.

956
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,240
That's right.

957
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,180
Fernanda Nandeli-Murr.

958
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,540
And now, Dick Strong by Norel Prep.

959
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,360
Is everybody all right?

960
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,140
Okay, here.

961
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,040
No, wait.

962
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,740
What happened to Dick Strong?

963
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,280
Wait a minute.

964
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,040
Didn't he accompany you two?

965
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,900
You know...

966
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,420
Dick, Dick Strong.

967
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,420
Hey, Richard.

968
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,620
Where could he disappear?

969
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,440
Sparky, we don't know.

970
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,660
You and I, he could have been swallowed up by a glacier.

971
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,800
Richard!

972
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,620
Dick!

973
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,880
Dick Strong!

974
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,860
Oh, Dick!

975
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,060
Dick Strong!

976
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,020
Dick Strong!

977
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,780
Dick Strong!

978
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,340
Dick Strong!

979
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,520
Dick Strong!

980
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,460
Dick Strong!

981
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,460


982
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:40,860
No use.

983
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,000
Dick Strong is gone.

984
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,560
We'll never see him again.

985
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,560
Dick Strong by Norel Prep.

986
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,200
Dick Strong may be gone, but Dr. Howell is here.

987
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,740
Here's a sort of a how-to question, I guess, in practice.

988
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,340
How-to?

989
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,660
How do you escape being reduced to conspiracy?

990
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,880
Conspirian, quote, entertainment, unquote.

991
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,620
That makes a lot of sense.

992
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,860
Well, it takes effort.

993
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,660
It's easy to come home, be beaten down, be tired out, turn on the television, let the

994
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,540
conspiracy gestalt have its way with your mind.

995
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,420
But try a simple experiment.

996
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,840
Just turn off the sound.

997
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,720
Provide the soundtrack yourself.

998
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,000
Now you're already a participant.

999
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,660
Soon you will be able to dispense with the picture entirely.

1000
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:42,140
And provide all the programming available 24 hours a day on the inside of your eyelids.

1001
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,380
Practice makes perfect.

1002
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,460
And the way to avoid it is to make a little effort.

1003
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:55,340
Because the conspiracy makes it easy to fall into its blockist soup, but hard to extract

1004
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,580
yourself from its clinging, clammy, enveloping touch.

1005
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:00,140
Whoo!

1006
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,900
Whoo!

1007
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,320


1008
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:09,460
As that columnist in The Onion recently said, I've got an iPod player in my mind!

1009
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,540
All right.

1010
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,200
This is a kind of complicated question.

1011
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,500
My right arm is much larger than my left.

1012
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,200
How many times do we get questions like this?

1013
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,480
My so-and-so is bigger on this side than my so-and-so on the other side.

1014
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,780
I want to increase the size of the left arm, but it doesn't know how to love me right.

1015
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,300
All right.

1016
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1017
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1018
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1019
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1020
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1021
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1022
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1023
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1024
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1025
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,300


1026
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,940
I'm going to be honest with you.

1027
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:31,940


1028
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:31,940


1029
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,860
What should I do?

1030
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,020
Well, this is like the picture of the classic redneck who, if right-handed, has an enormous

1031
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:43,260
purple-veined, pumped-up right hand and a rather small, withered left hand.

1032
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,400
The thing to do to get rid of this asymmetry is, of course, to take steps.

1033
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,340
You might even have to lash your arm to your side.

1034
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,920
But this, I think, is going too far.

1035
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,380
Simply make sure that you are where it counts.

1036
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,640
And the dexterous.

1037
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:08,440
There is a natural tendency to balance out the length of your arms and the length of

1038
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,760
your legs and everything else.

1039
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,580
Remember, a man's reach must exceed his grasp.

1040
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,440
Or what's a heaven for?

1041
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:23,040
Before you're practicing with that left arm, though, don't handle these kinds of red peppers.

1042
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,140
That's extremely important.

1043
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,360
And I might also add, if you have had a runny nose, you might want to use a little bit

1044
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,360


1045
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:30,580
of Red Hand.

1046
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:30,580


1047
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,560
You're supposed to begin with a cactus.

1048
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,440
Some of them have tiny little spines that you can't even see, that it takes weeks to

1049
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,760
get out of your right hand.

1050
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,360
This would be an excellent time to start practicing with your left hand.

1051
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:49,040
Or you may end up in a world of hurt, or at least a continent of hurt or a large city of

1052
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,240
hurt.

1053
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:55,220
I can vouch that it can take up to 15 years for those little spines to re-emerge.

1054
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:55,640
Horrible.

1055
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,300
Those cacti really protect themselves.

1056
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,940
Well, we have only a few more, so let's have them.

1057
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,220
And then we'll be good to go.

1058
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,220


1059
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,220


1060
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,220


1061
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,220


1062
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:00,280
I've been practicing not very well.

1063
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,280


1064
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,860
this man I think this may be a personal or generic I can't tell where where is

1065
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,200
your third nipple

1066
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,480
just on this question where is your third that's assuming there is yeah well

1067
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,720
if there is it's internal but of course James Bond's enemy Scaramanga had a

1068
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,160
third nipple many people have a third nipple Cicero the Roman order had a

1069
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,080
third nipple my brother in fact has a supernumerary nipple yes you see

1070
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:41,460
sometimes the God of all things is a little extra generous with what he gives

1071
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,920
out sometimes the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away but remember what is

1072
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,420
fair depends on where you are in relation to the mouth of the cornucopia

1073
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,700
where are you in relation to your third nipple

1074
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,540
consider not your third nipple consider your third nostril and the laborious

1075
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,440
process which it will take to open it

1076
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,980
we're all here because the Church of the subgenius the cult with personality

1077
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,520
look in my eyes what do you see

1078
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,200
cult of personality

1079
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,480
I know your anger I know your dreams

1080
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,900
I've met everything you want to be

1081
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,780
I'm the cult of personality

1082
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,940
Like Clarice Thomas and Pee-wee

1083
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,580
I'm the cult of personality

1084
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,800
the cult of personality

1085
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,700
the cult of personality

1086
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,520
I exploit you, still you love me.

1087
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,000
I tell you one and one, make three.

1088
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,760
I'm the cult of personality.

1089
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,720
Like J.R. Bob's arms and Connie.

1090
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,440
I'm the cult of personality.

1091
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,780
The cult of personality.

1092
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,180
The cult of personality.

1093
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,160
The Duke of Uke.

1094
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,460
Friends from Portland, but live at IndieVival in Indianapolis.

1095
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,680
By the way, our background music is the Swingin' Love Corpses,

1097
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,540
And now, Limer.

1098
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,020
Commander.

1099
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,760
Speaking, Lieutenant.

1100
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,060
Skipper, the chief's been murdered.

1101
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,160
Murdered?

1102
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:30,580
Yes, he was murdered.

1103
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
He's dead.

1104
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,800
How is it done?

1105
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,260
Done?

1106
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,100
Well, there's your answer.

1107
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,220
What?

1108
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,080
Lions and tigers and bears.

1109
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,780
Renewing molecular sexnecks.

1110
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:44,900
What's that?

1111
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,560
No, you're wasting my time!

1112
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,460
Ahhhhh!

1113
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,520
Oh my!

1114
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:53,760
Ahhhhh! Oh my!

1115
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:53,960
What?

1116
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,660
Oh my!

1117
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,880
Oh, uh, someone's at the door.

1118
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,980
Dr. Ivan Stang ran down, around and around the narrow Castle Tower stairs toward the door

1119
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,840
to let in whoever has just caused the flashing light to appear.

1120
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,100
Dizzying array of things disturbing.

1121
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, those, those, uh, things that shoot electrical bolts that are inside those big glass things.

1122
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,520
I don't understand what they do, but they're very impressive and very high-tech looking.

1123
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,140
I had to, uh, turn the bottle, uh, miniature sitting the bottle, or candor, or whatever it is.

1124
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,480
Oh, so, candor.

1125
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
Yeah, so, that was...

1126
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,000
To make sure of nighttime and...

1127
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,260
That was why you ran downstairs?

1128
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,140
It wasn't because we had a special...

1129
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,160
No, we were late!

1130
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,380
It's like, uh, yeah, it was supposed to be nighttime for them a long time ago, and nobody

1131
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,860
had turned the jar away from that.

1132
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,920
It's like an egg.

1133
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,240
You gotta turn an egg.

1134
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,100
Right, exactly.

1135
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,780
They won't have any more little baby candorians in there.

1136
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:51,040
You know, if they did come out and get big, they'd all be, uh, incredibly super powerful,

1137
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,500
so, uh, they deserve it.

1138
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:52,500


1139
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,960
They deserve to be kept, uh, on ice.

1140
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,400
Right.

1141
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,420
Yes.

1142
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,540
This college radio station happens to have the bottled city of candor.

1143
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,420
It had to end up somewhere, like Oswald's rifle.

1144
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,220
We have that, too.

1145
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,760
You know, these things just come, uh, one way or the other, and they end up in the collector's

1146
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,600
room, trophy room, whatever you want to call it.

1147
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,700
That Mannlicher Carcano ain't worth a hooey.

1148
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:22,460
No, but it's a historical souvenir, and, uh, this here is, uh, supposed to be, uh, a, uh,

1149
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:22,460


1150
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,680
Cardinal Richelieu's pessary, it says, but it's hard to tell.

1151
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,520
This brown, shrunken thing, I, it's difficult.

1152
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,860
The years have not been kind to this artifact.

1153
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:40,660
You know, I understand, uh, they also had an example like that from Rasputin, the mad

1154
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,200
monk.

1155
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,460
Well, he was a monk.

1156
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,140
I didn't know if he had a pessary, but we've got, uh, uh, Jack Ruby's can opener.

1157
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:47,680
No kidding.

1158
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,540
We have it.

1159
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,640
And John Dillinger's can opener, so I've heard.

1160
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:51,840
Yes.

1161
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,600
It's four and a half inches longer than, than Ruby's.

1162
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,880
But, uh, you can see it right here.

1163
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,240
It's part of the object collection from the sub-genius.

1164
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,960
Keep it, keep it in the bag, man.

1165
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,240
Yes.

1166
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,220
Well, that's a church key that has opened many doors, I want to tell you.

1167
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,180
See, we have these things.

1168
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,380
We collect them because...

1169
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,580
What's this cuck bottle that says Fatty Arbuckle on the label?

1170
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,260
Oh, don't knock that pubic hair off the end.

1171
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:20,380
That was the subject of a celebrated, uh, court case, uh, Arbuckle versus Arbuckle versus

1172
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,040
Arbuckle.

1173
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,940
But, you know, he was exonerated all three times.

1174
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,740
Uh, that's not what history remembers, though.

1175
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,480
No, because history prefers the sleazy reek of a good story.

1176
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,780
You can get more of that here from WCSB.

1177
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,780
Then this planet will be reported as unsuitable.

1178
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,080
Repack the instruments and prepare for takeoff.

1179
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,500
We will continue our search in another solar system.

1180
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,020
And you can continue your search, dear friends, at upcoming sub-genius.

1181
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,100
That's right, sub-genius devivals coming up in November.

1182
00:53:55,360 --> 00:54:01,620
Uh, just for your information, I should let you know that on Saturday, November 15th,

1183
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:09,620
at Cleveland, Ohio, in the amazing Beachland Ballroom, there shall be an old-fashioned,

1184
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:15,240
old-timey, traditional Cleveland devival with yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank, Lonesome

1185
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,000
Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith, ESO, and a special movie show that I'm sure you'll

1186
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,080
love.

1187
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,220
And I'm putting together just to take advantage of the Beachland Ballroom's incredible screen

1188
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,000
on Saturday, November 15th.

1189
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:35,400
And then on Saturday, November 29th, in Detroit, Michigan, at the Magic Stick, the band heard

1190
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:42,520
in the background, friends, the amino acids themselves, with yours truly, Reverend Ivan

1191
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:50,980
Stank, and these other bands, the Christ Punchers, the Jollies, and MAN, that's a November 15th

1192
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:50,980


1193
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,820
show.

1194
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,720
And on Saturday, November 15th, at the Magic Stick, the Magic Stick, in Detroit, Michigan,

1195
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,140
just wanted to mention it.

1196
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:03,180
Other information is available at www.subgenius.com.

1197
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:10,020
If you happen to be listening from Europe, on November 22nd, Kennedy Day, there is a devival

1198
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:17,780
in Amsterdam, Holland, with Pope Black, Pope Phil Monty, in the wake of Mickey Finn, and

1199
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,960
Fred, and so many others.

1200
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,060
Friends, it's a...

1201
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,980
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1202
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1203
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1204
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1205
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1206
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1207
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1208
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1209
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1210
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1211
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1212
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1213
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1214
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:20,980


1215
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,080
You're not gonna tell those people you saw Martians running around down there.

1216
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,160
What would you say if I had found a Martian down there?

1217
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,460
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking!

1218
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:41,700
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, and you can get more information about

1219
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:48,020
the Church of the Subgenius from www.subgenius.com.

1220
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,980
Friends, if you've got some kind of tape, you can use it to get your own copy of the

1221
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:50,980


1222
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,680
tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think is suitable, is suitably bobbed and

1223
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:02,640
slacked up, and conspiracy bashing, and ear bone ripping, to play on this August radio

1224
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,100
show, then you can send that to me, Reverend Ivan Stang, at this address, Stang at the

1225
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:20,880
Post Office Box, 181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1226
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:23,820
44118.

1227
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,120
44118.

1228
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,360
That's Box 181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1229
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,260
44118.

1230
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,680
Praise Bob.

1231
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,360
Praise Bob.

1232
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,040
Hey, praise help.

1233
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,640
Help you eat it back.

1234
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,100
Run, run, run!

1235
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,540
And you know, let me say this.

1236
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,060
His number is 13013, and he also has an email address.

1237
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,160
It's dub, uh, at dub, uh, dot org.

1238
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,080
That's dub, uh, at dub, uh, dot org.

1239
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,860
And, uh, uh, he's also got a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

1240
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:50,860


1241
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:50,940
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1242
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:50,940


1243
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,420
It never gets any easier.

1244
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,380
Never!

1245
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,560
Well, I, I guess this is the end.

1246
00:56:58,860 --> 00:56:59,760
This is the end?

1247
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,120
My only friend.

1248
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,300
Well, folks, it's been, uh.

1249
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,080
No, it's the end.

1250
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,120
It's been, uh, insanity.

1251
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,480
It's been mass madness.

1252
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,780
And, uh, y'know, I hate to do this a half an hour before the next guy shows up, but

1253
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,360
I just don't want to be here another half hour.

1254
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,540
Can he start everything up again?

1255
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,840
Yeah, but he'll have to go get the key from the Orbit.

1256
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:20,840


1257
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,420
And crank up the generator.

1258
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,960
Plus, you know, I've got to be back here at 11 tomorrow.

1259
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,360
Oh, good Lord.

1260
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,820
It's been fun, folks.

1261
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,780
Our guests have been Dr. Hal Van Alen.

1262
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,560
Hi.

1263
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:41,140
Reverend Ivan Sang in the background, not doing very much.

1264
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,820
I drove.

1265
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,880
He's done enough already.

1266
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,540
Stumpy can drive good.

1267
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,100
That's the janitor he's talking about.

1268
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,360
He's resting on his laurels.

1269
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,820
Yes, with hardiness, extreme hardiness.

1270
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,260
It's starting to get a little soggy, so it's time to get up.

1271
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,380
Princess We Are Doe has fallen sound asleep.

1272
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,840
Well, I know where she's coming from.

1273
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,360
I'm going to get some shut-eye myself right about now.

1274
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,080
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1275
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,540
Well, you heard it here first and last.

1276
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,420
This has been a special extra-long edition of the Synesthesia program,

1277
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,220
and we hope you'll be here next week,

1278
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,320
except for...

1279
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,440
You assholes that have been calling the last hour.

1280
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,220
Yeah, I...

1281
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:23,600
Don't...

1282
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,660
Don't be here.

1283
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,280
Nobody loves you.

1284
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,840
Your mothers regret squeezing you out of their collective birth canals.

1285
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,140
They would have eaten you.

1286
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,080
They would have eaten you if they had known.

1287
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,160
Eat your young.

1288
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,120
That's my advice to all of you.

1289
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
That's Dr. Sinister's advice.

1290
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,160
That's me.

1291
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,700
Eat your young.

1292
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,640
And remember...

1293
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,440
To always wash behind your ears.

1294
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,000
And if you must die, here's what to do.

1295
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,180
Jump in Bob's pipe.

1296
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,060
Let him smoke you.

1297
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,900
I stole that line from one of the guests.

1298
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,300
I'm sorry.

1299
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,580
All right.

1300
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,380
Thank you very much.

1301
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,460
It has been...

1302
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,120
A pleasure.

1303
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,540
Take three.

1304
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,520
Take two.

1305
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,260
Take one.

1306
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,020
Quiet, please.

1307
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,200
Quiet, please.

1308
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:14,660
Recording.

1309
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,500
Quiet, please.

1310
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,120
We are recording.

1311
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,980
Customers are reminded that pickpockets

1312
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,180
are permitted anywhere on London Underground.

1313
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:23,680
Uh-oh.

1314
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,860
Please keep your pockets at this station.

1315
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,740
Customers are underground.

1316
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,460
All right.

1317
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,060
That's good.

1318
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,640
Good.

1319
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,200
Very nice.
