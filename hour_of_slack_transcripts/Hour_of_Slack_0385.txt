A time when the old standards
have crumbled as if hit by history's
greatest tidal wave of filth and
perversion and sexual promiscuity
undreamed of even
five years ago.
Nothing is sacred,
and the profane is sold in the open
marketplaces of our cities.
Men and women dance naked
before the high altars of some of our
once great churches,
while the stately hymns of Christendom
are replaced by the
staccato beat of the jungle rhythms
and the occult incantations
of the jellyhead generation.
And now,
the Self Genius
Hour of
Swatch!
I don't care.
I don't care what length I go to anymore.
All is fair and all that.
Something sick.
Something sordid, vicious, and
depraved.

An even more ominous development
in supernatural money emerged
in the late 18th century
when wholesale tampering with
God's magnetic laws
became a European craze.
The culprit
was the luminous Franz Mesmer,
who claimed to have discovered
the principles of what he called
animal magnetism.
Steeped in the doctrines
of Rosicrucianism,
the satanic cult which continues
to thrive in the United States today,
Mesmer claimed astrology
guided the body's systems
and that magnetized metals
could be used to cure illness.
What this devil worshipper
actually did was just disrupt
the soul's dual polarity and
concurrently affect the balancing magnetisms
of all human life.
Interestingly,
Mesmer and his followers,
the magnetopaths,
are considered the founders
of modern hypnosis and psychiatry.
Both of these schools also tamper
with affairs best left in divine hands.
The most famous of these schools

Mints for everyone!

It is the immutable light,

No one knows at this time
where Lee Harold Oswald is.
Having sex,
You're having sex.
Yeah.
It's just in that Lee Harvey Oswald was caught having sex in the movie theater in Dallas, Texas.
We confirm Lee Harvey Oswald was just nabbed having sex in a darkened movie theater in Dallas, Texas.
We now rejoin our scheduled broadcasters.
Ned, get a job out of show business.
You can't.
We're all sodomized.
You know what I mean?
In this sport, we're all made to line up and bend over and squeal like a pig.
You better let me in the centerfold, mister, or I'm going to make you bend over with me in that thing of yours.
I'm going to be holding a man and a shaved sow.
I have a career as a flobert.
I'm willing to shave a sow.
I'm willing to shave three sows and slap my mammy ten times and dump you in the river to boot of it.
What?
They don't like it when you shave their nipples.
You've got to avoid the nipples.
I think it would probably be painful, but in my case, I'm used to it.
They get tough and leathery when you do it.
But if you cover them with honey, then you can shave right over them.
You practice, you get perfect.
Like Jesus Christ.
Cover them with honey and they don't get hurt.
Well, they also taste better, too.
But I can't move my neck that far.
But that's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to shave a pig and I'm going to get in the centerfold.
And you can be in it with me, Dave.
I'm inviting you.
Well, I guess then I might as well take your salivary and your savory steaks and pies
and throw them in a bowl.
I'm going to have to shave them up a little.
I think this free association has gone too far.
Let's see.
Hi.
Yeah, no kidding.
Well, we got rid of the buzz.
Yes, there was a buzz.
It was trying to stop the show.
But I think we've got it under control now.
Yes, there's evil forces out there at all times,
some of whom have been on the air for the last ten minutes.
You just heard.
A little bit of Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz on Brain Rot Theater on WESB in Cleveland,
where those tapes come from.
All mixed up and mom mixed up with the KPFA Berkeley subgenius show with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence
tied up with Reagan's Polyp.
That's Sterno's new band.
In that band, they do.
In a given concert, they'll do 40 cover versions of Day Tripper, all exactly the same.
Most painful band ever.
Oh, but actually, there's more pain coming up.
This will be a bad show, dear friends, because we're being bad tonight.
Before I forget, I should mention also we heard from Lou Minotti.
Plan for.
Chaos.
Discussion about the Illuminati.
The Funky Bardos doing that thing.
And, uh, what else?
Reverend Ficus Strangulensis.
Okay, give me some slack.
All right, all right.
All right, all right.
And we got a new Rudy Schwartz project album in the mail just the other day from Reverend Joe Newman.
And he's got a song on here called Yodeling Satan.
I told you we're gonna be sort of bad tonight.
Um, and, uh, this kind of gets us started off.
This particular Rudy Schwartz album has, uh, quite a bit of, uh, liner notes.
And I'm gonna read you the liner notes about Yodeling Satan.
Yodeling Satan, this particular song, it's also the name of the album, is designed to get a rise out of idiots.
Beverly LaHaye of the Concerned Women for America.
A coalition of right-wing psychopaths has been quoted as saying that 40,000 to 60,000 ritual murders are committed each year by satanic cults.
Similar unsubstantiated nonsense is frequently repeated by certain police officers, quote, therapists, unquote, feminists, and journalists.
All apparently with very limited critical thinking skills.
Uh, not coincidentally, many of them have something to gain by perpetuating the myth.
Of satanic murders.
The normal murder estimate, I mean the satanic murder estimates by these people, exceed the FBI's normal murder count by approximately a factor of two.
To which Beverly responds that most murders go unreported.
No one has ever produced a shred of evidence that Satan exists, yet most Americans believe it anyway.
The FBI has been unable to uncover any evidence of satanic ritual murders and has written it off as a folk myth.
Despite this, police departments all over the country are jumping on the bandwagon, obviously sensing new funding opportunities.
Sick jerks like Jeff Dahmer are commonly lumped in with Satanism to lend an air of false legitimacy to the claims.
Fortunately, the ritual satanic murder abuse story is the lead in for the local, oh fortunately, excuse me, this print moves around on the page.
The closest fact similar to this is that the original story is a fake.



Families to Satan can be found within the fundamentalist Christian movement.
The next time you see a ritual satanic murder abuse story as the lead in for the local news, call the station and ask them to produce physical evidence for their story.
Other than spray painted graffiti near the local heavy metal club.
They won't have any.
This would all be funny if it weren't for the fact that people have had their doors kicked down in the middle of the night by ignorant redneck cops looking for members of the great Satanists.

The McCarthy era and the Salem witch trials come to mind.
Meanwhile, real Satanists are at home reading Mindless Drivel by Anton LaVey and wasting their lives just like members of any other stupid religion.
Well at least their prayers are heard and are drugged up.

Jesus Christ
There's always been racism in the church
And Father
There's racism everywhere
Even what about Father Augustine
The leader in the 1500s
When the church controlled the entire world
Yes, say Augustine
He was a black man from the northern part of Africa
And he felt that the Jews should only be kept alive
Because they lived
As a testimony to having brutalized Jesus Christ
And for that reason only
He believed that they should not all be wiped out
And mass genocide
Yes, that's the only reason he was a racist
He was a racist
And then later on the church tried to hide his identity
Just because he was born in Africa
Is that not right Father Grace
That's true and it's disgusting
It's an atrocity of nature
This is terrible!
Now we must correct the ways of the church
And that's why the church of the new faith
Is the church of Jesus Christ
And it is the only church of Jesus Christ
Satan!
Satan is taking over the world
Satan is the disgust of the world

I'm a lovely lady, happy to rot.
Hello, and welcome to our second tale on Brain Rot Radio Theatre.
Again, our story features America's most neurotic substance abuser,
and worst country singer, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
and his faceless Indian medicine man and psychiatrist, Psychopath Finder,
and their accident-prone ward and retarded musical sidekick, Scabby Days.
Our special guest star is Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.
We find our antiheroes at home in their RV parked near the toxic swamp.
The Reverend Stang has come all the way from Dallas
to Cleveland just to undergo psychotherapy with Psychopath Finder.
Stang is a total emotional wreck.
So there you have it, Psychopath Finder,
keeping the radio show on the air,
doing the devivals and working on the book,
and all the while this rip-off artist, Bob Beans,
keeps releasing albums and saying he started the Church of the Subgenius.
This is too much! I'm cracking up!
Drop the vial of antidote pudding!
The bat wouldn't retract!
Look, man, I need your fabled Native American medicine
to regain spiritual balance and internal harmony and all that kind of stuff.
Oh, no.
There, there. Relax, old ref boy.
Have a little Psychopath Finder 7 herb and 3 cheese smoking mixture.
Available through proper cable channels for only $29.95.
Guaranteed to make you cheesy.
And give insight into personal problems.
Here, you smoke them!
Oh, okay, uh...
Stang, care for some tender sweet chicken bladder strips while you trip Reverend?
Oh, uh, well, sure, sure, Dave.
Hey, Psychopath Finder, what does this have to do with my therapy?
Dave, please, leave patients alone.
Me trying to conduct therapy session here, I've been really upset.
He don't mind, right, Stangy? We're such big fans.
Yeah, yeah, big, huge electric fans.
Pulsating in the hot neon light.
I think T.S. Idiot said that, or Wendy Carlos Williams.
Listen, you two, either pipe down or you'll have to leave the room.
I'm trying to conduct a therapy session.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
That's some pretty strong smoking mixture there.
Ah, yes, soon you will become lucid and speak freely about what troubles you.
Well, this hang dog bust accentuating brassiere is chafing my nipples.
No, no, no, let's focus on problem with career.
This Canadian Mountie boot, Bob Beans, why is this hurting you?
This guy's totally without scruples.
He releases this stupid blithering material under the name of church.
He says he started the church.
He even conned Negative Land into believing that the stuff they recorded for him is authorized.
It's, I don't know, the squids are dying.
Very squished.
Here, I got some scruples you can have or use.
You could have them or use them.
You could scrape my nipples, too.
Just sign my earmuffs, please.
Please sign them.
Hey, Ivan, baby, you gotta hear this song I've been writing for the last five years about the followers of Jehovah One called,
called, Beat Me to a Pulpit.
I'm praying for some pain.
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I am praying for some pain.
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.
If I had a dollar for every lick in that I...
Ow.
Oh!
Oh, my head.
Why'd you hit me on the head with my guitar, psychic poodle fondler?
You two out.
Beverly stinks.
Come all the way from Texas to smoke cured.
My parental mythology.
Leave.
Go another room.
Yeah, I'll live with that.
I can live with that, you guys.
Oh, gosh.
If the vaunted aristocrat of the undergroom says so.
But you gotta hear my songs when I finish.
When we finish...
Split now!
Split!
And then you could autocrap my drool and snot and crush the earmuffs and hernia trusses and eye socket controllers and all the...
Leave now!
You love my songs.
Okay.
Okay.
We're unimportant.
But maybe we can listen through the hole in the wall.
Yeah, that whore still carries fond memories and tiny bits of my brain tissue.
Good.
We alone now.
Tell Motorcycle Mama all about problems.
Oh, God.
Sometimes I wish the guy was dead.
Don't have the cash to pay for the car.





I wish I could sue him.
I'm so mad I don't know what to do.
The squid or the...
Oh, there, there.
Let it all out.
Let it all out.
Oh, no, not all.
No need to urinate freely on expensive Navajo shrug shag.
Oh, okay.
Boy, I'm mad, psycho.
This guy's the son of some big media geek.
It's like the silver spoons against the tin cups, pal.
The same as it's always been.
In the normal consumer.




The conspiracy world.
Revenge.
If only, maybe we could use the Mooney skinners on him.
I'd like to take the big red stress.
Did you hear that, Scabby?
That K-neck or imposter is ruining our hero's life.
The word of Bob Dobbs, the one true or false Christian messiah, spat on so unseemly like
he...
Bob Dobbs is listening in heaven where everything's fine.
We should get out a big fat gun and shoot Bob Beans.
In his big fat gun.
That darn particle butt.
Why, oh why, oh why?
Why am I crying, Dave?
Where am I?
Hey, Scabby, wait a minute.
You hit on it.
What a hot dare.
What a media-engineered cult-like idea for the 90s.
You're brilliant, you idiot savon garbage.
We'll assassinate Bob Beans.
Or kidnap him.
Until he confesses the sordid truth of his miserable chicanery.
Scabby.
Huh?
You still got that plastic explosive you made for the last movement of your Peaceford
Pace for 12 out-of-tune violins which all simultaneously blow up?
Yeah.
Nobody wants to play it.
Can't find anyone to do the gig except your Ford-fired serenade.
Great, great.
You get the gel-ignite bomb violin thing, and I'll get my guitar.
We'll thumb to Toronto.
Walk across Lake Eridiculous.
We'll be heroes, man.
Here's exploding violin.
So I play it, yeah.
No, no, no.
Don't play that thing yet.
Don't play it.
Not until the last act of Bob the Slob Beans gets his.
Better leave Psychopath Finder a note.
I'll leave him a G-note.
Shh.
Now be very quiet.
I'm going to slide out the window.
Oh, wow.
I feel great now.
I'm rid of all that blasted anger and hatred.
I feel great.
Oh, totally released.
One with Bob Dobbs.
Yes, yes.
Indian Transplantal Therapy do much to reduce hostility.
You will function normally now.
Until you need more inexpensive patented herbal therapy.
Hey, could I maybe cop a bag of that to take back to the land of Dealey Plaza?
Sure.
What do you want, a quarter?
Yeah, what is it?
Like $60?
No, no, no.
$29.95 for you, oh great white chief of airwaves.
It's an honor to do business with you.
Oh, man.
I can't believe I felt so hateful.
As if all the ugly archons of Jehovah One had had me by my very flunads.
Oh, man.
I actually fantasized about killing the guy.
Oh, well.
Life's still beautiful.
Well, if it ever, ever was.
Okay.
Since our therapy over now,
let me call boys back into a room.
They so anxious to rap and jam with their hero and schmooze with you.
Yeah.
And Dave.
Yeah.
Scabby.
Yeah.
We finished.
Come back in and irritate Staggy.
Yeah.
Oh, boys.
What in the hell?
Well, let me go look.
Where are they?
Oh, no.
They leave note.
G note.
I wish they would leave C note.
Using special schematic powers,
me able to divine contents.
Oh, no.
It's say.
Don't stop us.
Me and Scabby's heading for Ontario to kill Bob the beans.
Or kidnap him until he's dead.
Or confessionals his sinfuls.
We believe that in some pitiful way,
this will endear us to Staggy.
And he will play my songs.
I thought divine was dead.
Remember in female trouble when he put the poodle between his legs?
Or was that flamingos?
Nevermind John Waters' film course.
We got to find Dave.
Believe me, this guy is nuts.
He might not have the heart to kill Bob Beans,
but he's sure to screw something up.
And Scabby, cripes.
He causes nuclear power plants accidents just with his mind.
Oh, yeah, right.
I was feeling so peaceful.
I forgot what's going on.
And so in great haste,
Psycho Pathfinder and Reverend Stang pursued crazy plans,
Cowboy Dave and Scabby the decomposing composer, but it was too late for thanks
to the miracle of electromagnetic radio waves, Dave and Scabby had already been
transmitted down the Queens Highway into the heart of Dun Tun Girardeau, eh?
Hey, hey, hey Sport, is this the home studio of Bob Beans? Well, sure better be, eh?
After all this crap on the radio about the Church of the Sub sandwich and
whatnot, eh? You'll find Bob Beans right behind that false front there.
See? There's the false front right there. Good, because we want to kill him with this exploding violin.
Be my guest, if he's Francophone or Sikh, he'll probably only get 30 days, eh?
Who is it? Who's there? Knock, knock! Who's there? This is stage cam radio.
Oh, oh, oh.
Hey, is Bob Beans behind this false front in here?
Come in. Now, Mr. Beans is with Brian Mulrooney right now, but oops, there he is.
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Sub Sandwiches. Former Prime Minister, I just want to say what a grand pleasure it was to work with you.
Daddy and John Majors and George Bush send their lovey. Just keep on conning the public and ripping off the real Church of the Subtrainings and by gum, we'll do whatever the hell we please, eh?
By gum, we'll do whatever the hell we please, eh?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, Brian Mulrooney, wasn't you a famous goalie for the Nordiques or Maple Leafs or something?
I'm afraid I can't answer that question, eh? I've got to get the puck out of here.
Next! Who are you and what do you want, eh?
Hey, you're Bob Beans. I'm watching Cow-Paw Dave and this here's Scabby, my violinist.
We got this band called Positive Land and we hear you are one true Church of the Subgenius and apostle of slack.
Where am I?
Yeah, we're volunteering our services, man. It teaches you about slack, old profit for profit.
Oh, slack, eh? Well, come on in then. You've come to the right man, eh? Slack, well, slack's all about geodesic domes and cars that burn chicken dung, eh? That's what it's all about, eh? Come into my office.
So, you want to make an album, eh? Well, there's no money in it, but you'll be helping the Church of the Subgenius.
No, we want to kidnap you.
Or kill you, whichever comes first.
Now, listen, I'm a sensible man, eh? I've got a mistress and 300 Swiss-backed Landry seems to feed. Don't do anything rash, eh?
Eh, make fun of my rash, will ya? If you do that, we're going to rape you, too.
Wait, wait, wait, take it easy.
I don't know, man.
You're a squirrel like a pig.
Hey, stop pelvic thrusting on that fiddle, Scabby. It might go off. Just climb out the window, Deans, or whatever Beans.
And whatever your name is. And onto the, into that waiting van we electromagnetically parked.
That's it. Slow and easy.
And so, they drove Beans all the way to Kitchener or Waterloo or some other God-forbidden place.
And rented a motel room.
There, they would force Beans to confess his sinful crimes or get a chance to hear Scabby's exploding violin masterpiece.
Meanwhile, Psycho Pathfinder's shamanistic seven senses were working overtime.
And he located Lonesome and Scabby without a problem.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, there it is. Motel me dream about. Me pull in. Me sure they they are there.
Oh, do we have to do this, Psycho Pathfinder?
I've been smoking your herbal mixture since we crossed the Peace Bridge.
And I'm grooving, man. Hey, does this stuff cause nasal tumors?
Ah, and there, room number seven just come into my mind just like in dream.
Hey, lay off Herbin. Come help me. Me put window next to ear and use supersonic shamanistic hearing.
Oh, no, Nancy and, uh, my, my Maggie. Come on over here now.
Oh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Uh-oh.
Wrong room. Wrong room. Wrong room. Wrong room.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no. Come on. Let's stay, man.
Oh, come on. They must be in ski room six.
Okay, Beans. Okay, Beans. Okay, Beans. This is your last chance to recant your lies.
I'm gonna start singing again.
Oh, no. Anything but that, eh?
Dave! Scabby! Unhand that man!
We can't cut off his hands until we rape him with this canister of holy air.
Available only from Z-Day and the Real, Real, Real Church of the Subgenius for only $29,999.
Boyles, please. For Bob Dobbs' sake. I mean, let him go. So he crapped on honesty in the name of slack.
He knew not what he doo-dooed. I mean, at least he was a sinner. Cut him some slack.
But if we let him go, he'll just do it.
He'll do it all over again.
That's what I mean.
Oh, no, no, no. Please untie me. I swear I'll somehow try to come up with my own ideas and concepts.
It'll be hard, but I'll try. I swear, eh?
Only if the holy Reverend Stang listens to Dave's songs and autobiographicals when I sing Blind Dog's Body.
What? Where am I?
Oh, yes. Dear friends, just let him go. Just as you are letting go.
Letting go.
Hey, that's from Don't Crush That Bozo and me and my entrenching tool.
Oh, thank you. I won't let you down. I've already got an idea for an original project.
I know. I'll call it Fire Sign Theater. Well, thanks again. And now I'm going to steal your van. Bye, suckers.
Wait, wait. What are you doing?
I can't believe it. How do you like that?
We freed this guy for life and he's already stealing again. What monstrous vermin.
That's from The Metamorphic Folkers by Franz Kaka. Or was it Pushkin and the Ethiopians?
Well, when Pushkin come to shove, me always say, slack gives and takes away. Amen, my little subgenie.
Yeah, ain't it mysterious how Bob works? Just now we can all ride back together.
And I can listen to my songs.
Uh, psycho, I'm going to need some more of that herb, man.
Okay, let me start rolling now.
Hey, Scabby, what'd you do with your violin?
Huh? I don't know where it is. Maybe I, uh...
Oh, boy, this cart works great. Hey, a violin case. Maybe there's some drugs in it, eh?
And maybe I can sell it as a genuine religious artifact to the Church of the Subgenius, eh? Maybe I can...
Coo-hah!
Hello, you're on cross-country checkup. What do you think about this Bob Bean's head-blown-up thing there?
You think it's somehow, it's kind of a rip-off of, uh...
another head of some kind blown off, or what do you think, eh?
Am I on the...am I on the radio now?
Ah, yes, dear friends, and you are on the radio...

well, with the Church of the Subgenius...

Your nipples are swollen, the true mark of a deal-making messiah.

Bob Genie, who will someday take what they need.

Bye.
I'm David Fishman.

Parlez-vous français?
Parlez-vous français?
Il n'y a pas que la grippe qui se donne
La rougeole ou les oreillons
Hooray, compagnons!
You can record my jock looking at a joint if you like.
It's called temple mandibular joint dysfunction, bud.
I've learned how to make it play.
My tongue's a pin and ready writer.
Did God write a book?
Does God want to talk about his son according to a book?
Well, why does God then think about his son?
Thou art fairer than the children of men.
Well, if that's what God thinks,
although Isaiah 53 says that when we see him there's no beauty which is desiring him,
God nevertheless says he's fairer than the children of men.
Why?
The FBI's elite hostage rescue team had been called into this.
And these are people who deal with the ending of situations,
often much more volatile situations, frankly, than what we're looking at now.
Cousin evidence?
Yeah.
Yeah, I really like you on the show.
But what happened to Dr. Howell?
What'd you do with him?
Nothing.
Oh, nothing.
Well, I can't hear him.
Dr. Howell.
Dr. Howell outwore his usefulness to the subgenius race and, of course, was...
Well, his body's now being used as a giant old-timey bathtub at the subgenius dude ranch in Irving.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
Oh, well, that makes sense.
He'll be back.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
He'll be back.
I was just curious.
The new and improved Howell will be back soon.
Every molecule of his body improved and made better for you, the listener.
Oh, boy.
And we have a special...
We have a special time here now where we talk about our unremembered memories.
Does anybody care?
Is anybody listening now?
What's wrong?
You can't be afraid of anything.
If you feel...
You are not properly sedated, call...
Immediately.
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.
We now take you live to an interview with President Wellman at his retreat in Dougie Punkport, California,
on the connection between the Colombian drug cartel and Wayne Newton's estranged brother, Harvey...
Huey, who was found recently gunned down in Oakland, California.
Mr. President?
Mr. President.
Apparently, President Wellman has stepped out for just a moment.
He'll get back to you after this message.
Um, no, we don't have enough time to do that whole rant.
Darn it.
It's a nice little rant.
We'll just have to do this.
Night.
Tears.
Rain.
I push the mercy button.
I'll do when you fall.
Time.
To die.
My God.
My God.
Why have you forgotten me?
Oh, God.
Dear Dr. Animal, my pooper worm, I'll call him Petey,
eats like nothing else.
Last night, in a feeding frenzy, he chomped a hole through my intestinal wall.
What should I do?
Signed, Henry the Herdiated Herbivorous Hermaphrodite.
Dear Herb,
Your little worm may squirm,
when a certain germ was introduced through his derm.
That's the thing to do.
Inject a small amount of virulent virus through this little fellow's epithelial wall.
Ah!
Then he'll die and fester in there,
and you'll have to send Fester, the performing hamster, up your colon in order to retrieve that little goner.
Then you can go to the general wing of the general hospital,
where people are generally used to removing hamsters and other objects.
And after that, you'll be home free, scot-free,
Yeehaw!
The true dialectic of subgenial understanding.
We hope this answers your question.
Do you like my headphones, Dave? Aren't they so, like, trendy?
I wish I could see your headphones. I would like them.
They are pretty. They're very pretty.
What color are they? Are they black?
Oh, they're black with red.
Black headphones.
Black headphones with a red thing going over the top, kind of like a stellar nimbus thing going...
Yeah, stellar nimbus.
...around his head, as if he was like a little baby.
They're very high-tech looking.
Chazus. Chazus Christ.
They look like headphones that...
...George Jetson would wear.
No, you look Christ-like tonight, Chaz. You look like Christ with big, weird, like, you know, techno ears.
Oh, yeah, smarter!
Well, God made man, but he used a monster to do it.
Hates in the plan.
Oh, I need to prove it.
I can walk like an ape, talk like an ape, do what monkeys do.
Well, God made man. But he used a monster to do it.

Oh, God made man. But a monkey supplies the group.
The jim-jam jumpin' jive makes you hep hep on the mellow side.
Skiddle-a boo skiddle-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a.
Going, going, going, going, ya-da-da.
Now, I told you about the jumpin' jive.
Jim-jam jumpin' jive.

Jim-jam jumpin' jive. The jumpin' jive.
Jim-jam jumpin' jive. The jumpin' jive.
I know you dug this mellow jive
Cause you dig it on the mellow side
Yes, dear friends, we do dig it on the mellow side over here.
How you all feeling tonight?
Any Led Zeppelin fans out here?
Here's a phrase called the Immigrant Song.
You all feeling okay?
Any Beatles fans out there tonight?

Let's do Day Tripper for him.

Good.
Anyone want to give me a cigarette?
I'm just going to take one.
One, two, three, four!
