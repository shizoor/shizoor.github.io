1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
As you know, friends, instead of a world getting closer to slack, we see it going to the prigs and prudes.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:16,300
The two opposed sides of the conspiracy both ravaging our privacy and personal freedoms.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,760
Deep-seated fear of sex that hobbles, yet sickly motivates both the radical left and the fundamentalist right.

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Both are trying to force their politically correct or morally correct rulebook into our brains.

5
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:48,300
And yes, dear friends, tonight we tackle the problem of, well, the new stark fist.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,600
It's a church publication.

7
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,540
Many of my listeners probably never seen one, and some probably would not want to see the new one.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,820
Yes, we're looking at dissent within the church from those who...

9
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,700
Well, you know, what they're saying is...

10
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,940
If only we could keep those rednecks out of the church.

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,560
But friends, you know, sure, we may have lost a thousand feminazi bobby prigs,

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,860
but we gained at least five true yeti ultra-vixens for Connie that I know of,

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,620
and that...

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:34,440
That, my friends, is worth those one thousand mal-aligned normals two hundred times over.

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,580
And besides, none of them asked for their money back,

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,560
and none of them had contributed anything to the print or electronic propaganda of the ministry anyway,

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,160
so, friends, well...

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,180
You know, you first have to say that which must not be said

19
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,080
in order to say that which...

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,720
must be said, you might say.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,500
Well, anyway, we're here in the Bible Belt,

22
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,320
unbuckling the Bible Belt, my friends,

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,160
so that its pants may, as we've said so many times,

24
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,440
fall to its knees,

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,060
and it may gaze upon its own...

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,980
most private...

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,600
desires.

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,860
Yes.

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,200
Ha, ha, ha.

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,620
The following includes graphic depictions that may be inappropriate for...

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,080
While some of these images may be titillating or provocative,

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,020
we consider them to be...

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,540
distasteful...

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,420
grotesque...

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,300
shocking...

36
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,500
satanic...

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,560
overkill...

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
pretentious...

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,880
misunderstood...

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,180
overkill...

41
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,980
esoteric...

42
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,760
obscene...

43
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,100
off-the-dhouser...

44
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,100


45
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,400
stinky ...

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,720
and now...

47
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,240
Subgenius...

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,240


49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,240


50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,240


51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,240


52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,240


53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,980
The Subgenius...

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,100
Subgenius...

55
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,580
Our hope...

56
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:39,800
Subgenius...

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,800


58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Swag!

59
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:40,700


60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,680
The producers of this program share your outrage at the shameless use of this kind of filthy,

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,980
The producers of this program share your outrage at the shameless use of this kind of filthy,

62
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,740
lanzadaозь на ванхе undone цивилиз س gefragt,

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,300
Disgusting and abusive trash.

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Oh, don't try to deny it.

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,740
You have been bad.

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,380
Very, very bad.

67
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
A bad subgenius.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,480
Quote me, book of the subgenius, page 132, paragraph 3.

69
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,140
Write this instant.

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,320
I didn't think you could do it.

71
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,380
And the ledger of souls here shows that you haven't spent more than $10 on holy church products in two years.

72
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,620
Some high priest of sacred abnormality you are.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,260
Well, bitch goddess Connie Dobbs knows just what to do about that.

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,780
Don't try to wheedle your way out of this.

75
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,800
You're going to get what's coming to you.

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,060
And I think you know just what that is.

77
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,620
That's right, you slackless backslider.

78
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,040
The punishment cone.

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,360
Go get it right now.

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,260
Bring it to me.

81
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,900
Not that way, you idiot.

82
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,140
Wipe off the Devo blood first.

83
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,080
Now, see this.

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,300
You know what this is, don't you?

85
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,200
Well, I want you to take those big red straps and strap it to your head.

86
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,040
That's right, your head.

87
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,120
Do as I say.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,200
Why?

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Can't you understand English, you worm?

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
God, you look ridiculous.

91
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,940
You have no idea how pathetic you look to me right now.

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,100
I wish your so-called guru Bob could see you now.

93
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,280
Some warrior of endless slack.

94
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
Wouldn't he be impressed?

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,220
Why, you'd make even Bob puke.

96
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,680
Well, I'm going to beat the pingness out of your withered little soul.

97
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,080
And then after that, I'm going to beat the Yeti back into it.

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,540
Now get down on our knees, you whining Bobby.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,820
Mindless, useless, little cult fanatic slack vampire.

100
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,600
You're not worthy of kissing Bob's mighty toes.

101
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,160
Assume submission posture number three.

102
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Mistress Connie commands you now.

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,960
Get into those restraints right now. Hurry up, that's it.

104
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,060
Just like a little doggy.

105
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,980
Grover, you slutty little slave.

106
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Worship me, beg.

107
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,740
Take that, and that, and that.

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,920
Now here's one for good measure.

109
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,900
You never know pleasure until you've tasted real pain.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,500
You'll never know slack until it's been taken away.

111
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,140
So, I guess that makes just your lucky day, doesn't it?

112
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,100
So, I guess that makes just your lucky day, doesn't it?

113
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,020
Silence that whimpering.

114
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,280
You're playing by my rules now, buster.

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
Put on that mask.

116
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,260
That's it, over your head.

117
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Strap it on tight.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,320
Ooh.

119
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,000
Now I'm going to button those eye flaps shut so you can't see what I'm going to do to you.

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,780
Now bend down and I'll lock you into position.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,980
Now, listen closely to me.

122
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm going to put something up against your mouth.

123
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,620
See there,ze uhh uhh,

124
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,500
What are they doing?

125
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,240
What are they doing?

126
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,400
Totally sexy.

127
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,280
Lobby is the epitome of sexual connotations

128
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,040
Obvious!

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,560
...yuh heened!

130
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,200
It's a sexy church.

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,060
Not something that Swagger'd come after you.

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,400
See, you had to wait for months and years before Swagger was going to be a sexy church.

133
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
If you are having sex, you are not in it.

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,260
We're not talking about some kind of church where you go out and pick up church-going women

135
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,460
and kind of like play with yourself in front of them.

136
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,900
Bob goes for the whole thing, man.

137
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,880
Bob goes straight for the glam.

138
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,260
Bob's into all-out fornication and glam manipulation.

139
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,400
That's right. Bob is the swingin' meat Jesus.

140
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,220
And in Bob's church, women get to be on top.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,660
Swingin' meat Jesus, yep.

142
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,480
The swingin' meat Jesus.

143
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,780
Women get to be on top.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Bob can be on top and on bottom simultaneously.

145
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,980
Simultaneously.

146
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,840
You can plant Bob and it will grow into a beautiful tree.

147
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,060
Start fornicating.

148
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,380
Well, we're ready.

149
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,420
His vigor, incontestable.

150
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:47,740
His vitality, incredible.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
Indestructible.

152
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,620
Inexplicable.

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,980
Mad.

154
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,820
Mean.

155
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,400
And mighty.

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,300
What is that making of?

157
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,660
Come with me.

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,100
I want to show you a few things.

159
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,100
I want to show you a few things.

160
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,180
I want to show you a few things.

161
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,400
I want to show you a few things.

162
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,400


163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,820
Here we are.

164
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
The growth corridor.

165
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,500
What are they?

166
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,560
These are the most genetically altered human beings.

167
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,980
You see, my dear, a long time ago, when the planet was barren,

168
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,880
the aliens descended upon the Earth and created man.

169
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Aliens?

170
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,560
That's right.

171
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,000
Man was created as the ultimate organic weapon.

172
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,880
And these are the next step in the evolutionary process.

173
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,580
Warriors developed by the aliens from the human species.

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,300
In times past, they were known as...

175
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,740
Genius.

176
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,760
Can you imagine?

177
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
These lovely creatures in the White House.

178
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,420
In every seat of power.

179
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,600
In every country around the world.

180
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Bob.

181
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,900
There's an organic mechanism created by the aliens.

182
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,620
It becomes a protective suit of armor.

183
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,640
Only one guy...

184
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:39,880
Bob.

185
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
Has been found.

186
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,280
But not one clue on how to activate that magnificent mechanism.

187
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,780
I need your help.

188
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,660
You know.

189
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,060
No.

190
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,440
I don't know.

191
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,960
I have no idea what he did.

192
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,120
Grotesque little creatures, aren't they?

193
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,220
You could easily become one of them.

194
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,620
That's right, Bob.

195
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,280
Post office box one and four.

196
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,280
Three or six.

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,060
A rare specimen.

198
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,080
Indeed.

199
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
With beauty...

200
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,220
Like yours.

201
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,480
The results might not be so hideous.

202
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,620
But I make no promises.

203
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,020
Every citizen has a duty to learn more about the menace that threatens his future.

204
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,060
His home.

205
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,180
His children.

206
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,780
The peace of the world.

207
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,260
And that is why we have created this tape.

208
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,020
If you will take the time to inform yourself,

209
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,320
you will find that Magnividoism holds no mysteries.

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,320
Its leaders have blueprinted their objectives.

211
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,640
The time is far too late not to recognize this ism for what it is.

212
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,500
A threat to humanity and to each of us.

213
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,100
Moreover, there is the sobering fact that since the end of World War II,

214
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,720
we have spent billions of dollars to defend ourselves from the Magnividoid aggression.

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,380
This burden will continue to mount until the world is free from the Magnividoid menace.

216
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
This tape is an attempt to explain to you that Magnividoid menace is not just a mere illusion.

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000


218
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:43,880
This AI because Magnividoid

219
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,740
The answer involves many details and is not simple.

220
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,260
Most Magnavidoids are ordinary looking people.

221
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,720
Like your seatmate on the bus.

222
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,540
Or a clerk in one of your neighborhood stores.

223
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,840
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now, so that's no big deal.

224
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,600
So why not? So why not?

225
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

226
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,980
I don't know. You don't know.

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,500
And you will never know.

228
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,300
You have signed the application.

229
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,680
You do have the kit.

230
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
None of those things are important.

231
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,040
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

232
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,420
And when you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives

233
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,620
and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and...

234
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,740
everybody else is going to say about it.

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,500
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.

236
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,600
Why not? You don't know.

237
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,000
And you will never know.

238
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,700
And who knows? Just maybe.

239
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,700
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

240
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,240
You have signed the application.

241
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,420
What about me? Never mind.

242
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,380
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now, so that's no big deal.

243
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,980
Well, you are joining up with one of the most dynamic, major corporations in the world.

244
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,460
You're joining a group of dedicated people and an organization of great resources,

245
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,300
both human and material.

246
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,120
And you will never know.

247
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,040
None of those things are important.

248
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,460
You have signed the application.

249
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,740
Welcome aboard.

250
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,000
And we'll be looking forward to seeing you.

251
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,480
Whether at conventions in your area or as a new direct distributor.

252
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
Something says, look out, this guy is fishy.

253
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,040
Cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

254
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,000
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries,

255
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,460
the cruel and torturous executions,

256
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,820
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

257
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,220
They may not have found the key to affluence,

258
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,540
but they found...

259
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,660
an endless supply of dope,

260
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,260
uninhibited sex,

261
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,960
an endless supply of money.

262
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,760
What more than a space hogger on Earth

263
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,720
is the church of subgeniuses?

264
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't know.

265
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,040
Yes, you're soaking in it as it goes down the drain.

266
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,760
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

267
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,240
Bang.

268
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,560
Are you blaming God for atom bombs,

269
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,040
atomic warheads,

270
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,640
or something else?

271
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't know.

272
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,180
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

273
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,660
Why?

274
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,300
Bang.

275
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,640
Oh, okay.

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,920
Wow!

277
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,940
Man, that last infusion of joy

278
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,680
was really rocked by a scrabble.

279
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,640
40 years ago, I warned him.

280
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,040
Yes, even though I may be a dirty old monkey,

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,700
some folks think I'm lovable.

282
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,320
Take George Lunchpail, for instance.

283
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,180
He's caught in the middle of a battle he can't understand.

284
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,760
And it seems that the opponents in this struggle

285
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,220
are his kids and his wife.

286
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,560
Crime, human dignity, assaulted hedonism,

287
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,580
just about everything you can imagine comes his way.

288
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,820
At the end of a cast-iron red-hot shovel,

289
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,620
I have a whap right across his mug.

290
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,880
But I am okay,

291
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
because I've just had a mug of the most delicious

292
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,320
and jiving joy juice and rat poison.

293
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,020
It's the rocket fuel we use on this show,

294
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
and even though my carcass is rotting and stinking,

295
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,780
it pushes me forward.

296
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,840
You hear me? Okay?

297
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,960
I think because of your foolish,

298
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,700
miserly ways,

299
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,700
the result is nothing-nothing.

300
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,480
It can't mean something-nothing or nothing-something.

301
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,400
There's no energy, there's no mass,

302
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,960
there's no personality, there's just nothing.

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,120
Are we to fade or weakening from nothing-nothing

304
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,040
or something-nothing?

305
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,840
That's what we do here on the show.

306
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,440
America, we make sense.

307
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,500
Well, if I tell you what's happening,

308
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,540
I just can't.

309
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,100
Why?

310
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,400
Why?

311
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,880
Why?

312
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,320
Why?

313
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Why?

314
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
Why do they have to do that?

315
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, no.

316
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,660
Will you?

317
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,400
Of course.

318
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,440
Many of our so-called serendipitous insomniac listeners

319
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,980
don't even know the subject we're discussing,

320
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,700
and perhaps we shouldn't enlighten them

321
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,400
because if any sensitive person should investigate

322
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,100
the crucible of our focus,

323
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,280
their consciousness would be seared and burned

324
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,540
clean in the unholy fire of an insane communion.

325
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,800
But it's kind of fun, you know?

326
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
It's really not that bad.

327
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:08,980
Whee!

328
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,060
Whoopee!

329
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,820
Okay, well, that's a pretty good idea,

330
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,360
what I have to look forward to right now.

331
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,620
We're down on the floor of the El Morocco now

332
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,580
at the subgenius ball.

333
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
Hey, Doug, let me up.

334
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,940
You're laughing at me.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,340
I don't want to be down here on the floor.

336
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,000
We're laughing with you down there on the floor.

337
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,520
Hey, he was just saying,

338
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,580
he wanted me to do this.

339
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,020
I can get up any time I want.

340
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Yeah, I know.

341
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,300
It looks like you've got plenty of company

342
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,140
down there on the floor.

343
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,280
Why don't you tell us what's going on?

344
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Well, I'm helping initiate a new elbow crop

345
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,720
of subgeniates, etherettes as we call them.

346
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,860
The rocket rookies are in the other room being...

347
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,340
Here's the poop dog hat.

348
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,740
Oh, uh-oh, they're bringing out the poop dog hat.

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,640
You know, I, yeah, I...

350
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,740
Yeah, oh, there they go.

351
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,500
There go the subgeniates.

352
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,920
They're all running out.

353
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,640
I, it always happens.

354
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,000
They bring in that horrible, smelly poop dog hat.

355
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,400
You have a second, Gordon.

356
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,460
Puzzling evidence.

357
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,400
For World Federation President...

358
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,460
I don't agree.

359
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,280
Great guidance.

360
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,940
Earth Roman calling great guidance Roman.

361
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,140
Is this in accordance with the plan?

362
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,100
How can we triumph over the human

363
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,580
if we persist in their errors?

364
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
Error, error.

365
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,220
This fist is not for row men.

366
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,100
True to the human, nothing is as vile as the waste matter

367
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,140
which issues daily from the...

368
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,460
Or as sublime as the orgasm of the...

369
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,380
Which rewards the thrall of the genetic codex

370
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,620
within the germ plasm.

371
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,180
...program of today's broadcast media.

372
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,760
We don't need to descend to that level on the show as a sub.

373
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,960
But the row men, great guidance,

374
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,460
do not stand like rubes at the county fair,

375
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,940
carny, hypnotized, slack-jawed, and immobilized

376
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,140
at the mere mention of these things.

377
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,540
Okay, here we go.

378
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,200
Now, I just want to back up the show here,

379
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,840
and you, you, the listeners, tell us what you heard.

380
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,300
848445.

381
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
If you are a true believer...

382
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,280
Nay, it is for us, the row men,

383
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,700
to shunt and corral.

384
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,280
The lowing herds of cud-chewing human,

385
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,560
hither and yon, for our own high and noble purpose.

386
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:35,720
Okay, now look at this.

387
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,580
This is what we do.

388
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,500
This is when we pick them up.

389
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,000
And we, uh...

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,640
There we go.

391
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,340
Blast it up.

392
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,820
And we bring them up to the ship like this.

393
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,920
It's a buck-toothed po-buck.

394
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,180
And you can just lay them down like this.

395
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,880
From hell!

396
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,900
Oh, uh, excuse me.

397
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,720
Is this your, uh...

398
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:49,740
And then you can, uh,

399
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,780
re-beak them like this.

400
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,280
And back on the earth, you see?

401
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,900
Well, that's very easy for you to do.

402
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,700
I'm not gonna soil my lily-white hand.

403
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,360
You have the, uh, entire...

404
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,940
...soul wallet.

405
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,080
Eww!

406
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,660
Boy, you could catch something from that thing.

407
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,220
Eww!

408
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,480
...on the G. Gordon Gordon Radio Network, folks,

409
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,680
a flash clandestine recording.

410
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,020
Puzzlin' Evidence!

411
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Oh, no, no.

412
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,580
Our show is certainly not as organized as the Dance with Souls

413
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,280
Booker Show.

414
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:19,760
Yeah.

415
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah.

416
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:25,200
And certainly not as slick as the K&O M Diamond Dallas

417
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,440
Picks show.

418
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,620
Yeah, what about the St. Louis show?

419
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,680
And it's not as silly as the K&O M Diamond Dallas

420
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


421
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


422
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


423
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


424
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


425
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


426
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


427
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:29,680


428
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,020
Picks show.

429
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,100
It's not as silly as the Once in a While St. Louis show.

430
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,220
What is this we're listening to?

431
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:34,720
What is this?

432
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,120
Oh, this is just another show.

433
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,240
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

434
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,160
Bong cuckoo?

435
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,500
Convenience is not freedom.

436
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,840
Bong cuckoo?

437
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,040
And the government...

438
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
Hey, my friend!

439
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,540
...is not your friend.

440
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,920
Bong cuckoo wrong.

441
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,300
Thank you.

442
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,560
Sorry.

443
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,160
Uh, same side of show.

444
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,640
Go ahead.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,040
No censors.

446
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,640
Yeah.

447
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,640
Awesome.

448
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


449
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


450
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


451
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


452
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


453
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


454
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


455
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


456
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


457
00:20:59,660 --> 00:20:59,660


458
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,960
Our own high and noble purposes use these snares when we must, but we are never side-tracked

459
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,880
from our great work by them ourselves.

460
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,360
Do we not claim to be in opposition to the overarching conspiracy?

461
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,460
For it is surely a prime signature of this selfsame conspiracy that youthful males with

462
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:26,620
downy cheeks and undescended testes, gathering in locker rooms, bleat to each other as extrasomatic

463
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,900
recognition signals.

464
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,660
Those very conspicuous...

465
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:46,320
...connified litanies of Jejun scatology, which that selfsame conspiracy promulgates to dampen all joy in the true gust of full-blooded, full-bellied yeti enjoyment of life's twin poles of pleasure and pain.

466
00:21:46,320 --> 00:22:05,280
How distasteful to a true rowman, overman. This seeping, septic, toxic fist does incalculable damage to our good cause, and we're all going to have to learn to live with its mephitic effects for an indefinitely long time to come.

467
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:16,300
Indeed, great guidance, rowman, this rowman knows of more than a few overmen who are now questioning whether the con hasn't irrevocably permeated the subgenie.

468
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:26,480
...with the publication of this leprous fist, making it time to jump ship. Among these are the pawman, the bofman, and the wellman.

469
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:36,460
But I, great guidance, rowman, shall never let myself sink into the sludge. I am no normal human. I am a rowman.

470
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,040
I proudly sport the hairy ape body of my yeti forebears.

471
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,300
Over my cephalon, I wear the dime-store space helmet of...

472
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,460
...the perverted science.

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:03,660
And in my heart, I bear undying hatred for all that would drag me down into an insufferable abyss of norm-worm normalcy with the media cretins, meat puppets, pseudo subslans, yuppies, puppies, and bobbies,

474
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:15,620
JC's, Rotarians, Republicans, rhubarb-eating, fence-straddling, would-be subgenius, mugwumps, sexually frustrated teenagers, and other unwholesome fetuses.

475
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,300
...and other unwholesome fetuses.

476
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,500
...and other unwholesome fetuses.

477
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,980
...from the conspiracy trough.

478
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,660
Sign me, a disgruntled subgenius.

479
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,080
Director, Marketing Research.

480
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,480
Dear disgruntled, although you may be sore at the star fist of removal,

481
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,600
see, not everybody may feel as you do.

482
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:43,940
Remember, the organization is for all sorts of people, even those you might not normally care to associate with.

483
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,160
So remember, don't be a...

484
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,320
a sourpuss subgenius, be happy.

485
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,320
The next issue of The Fist

486
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
may be all sweetness and light.

487
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,620
Until then, it is your job,

488
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,780
even your duty,

489
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,640
to sit down and shut up.

490
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,380
California Highway Patrol Officer

491
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,200
Alvin Yamaguchi caught a

492
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
35-pound carp

493
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,040
at the corner of Irvine Boulevard

494
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,000
and Lambert Road.

495
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,220
Yamaguchi, 35,

496
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,820
and partner Bill

497
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,740
grabbed a directing trowel.

498
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
There's a caller.

499
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,600
Hello?

500
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:19,540
Hello?

501
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,780
Are you guys coming in on the right frequency

502
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,460
or coming through my toaster today?

503
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,460
We're coming in on the bottom.

504
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,860
We're at the bottom of the frequency.

505
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,280
Look out.

506
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,800
Whoa!

507
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,440


508
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,380
Whoa!

509
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,740
Is that a real disgruntled

510
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,220
grunt?

511
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,380
Oh, excuse me.

512
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,720
Uh,

513
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,080
I overleaped myself.

514
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,340
I'm bounding over my steps.

515
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,520
Well, leaped and lizard.

516
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,520
Hurry.

517
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,500
Throw a towel over me.

518
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,560
What the hell's going on?

519
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
We're experiencing a static storm.

520
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,060
It has to do with the solar prominences

521
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,240
we observed yesterday from the rearward

522
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
portal of our space cruiser.

523
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,500
That one

524
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,440
looks like it might be a couple million

525
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,300
miles long.

526
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,600
A couple of

527
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,200
million miles long, dear friends.

528
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,660
Yes, and it was actually a disgruntled, uh,

529
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,260
a comment, but, you know,

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,560
hehehehe.

531
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,660
See, this just goes to show that we,

532
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,460
to prove that, uh, we do allow, uh,

533
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,780
dissent in the church of the subgenius,

534
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,480
while we'll even play it on the radio

535
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,060
before we flay them alive.

536
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,280
Kill them. Kill...

537
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,760
No.

538
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,960
Oh, just kidding.

539
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:40,920
Oh,

540
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,200
oh,

541
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,080
oh,

542
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,580
oh,

543
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


544
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


545
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


546
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


547
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


548
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


549
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


550
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


551
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


552
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


553
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


554
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:42,580


555
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,160
just kidding, dear friends.

556
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,640
That was Dr. Howl howling away,

557
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,240
howling, uh, uselessly against

558
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,460
the low-brow, uh,

559
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,240
stooping that we did

560
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,360
in, uh, our, uh, most recent church newsletter,

561
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,300
an experiment which has born wonderful,

562
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,140
wonderful fruit, including that very piece.

563
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,880
By the way, before, uh, those excerpts from the KPFA show,

564
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,960
the Puzzling Evidence Show,

565
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,500
some call it, uh, sorry, Puzzling Evidence, and, of course,

566
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,540
Dr. Howell, you heard about the Magnavido from the Screamin' Popeyes, who I think, I think,

567
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:26,540
you're getting a, oh, they liked, Raymond Scott there loved the Screamin' Popeyes, dear friends.

568
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,440
And why, let's see, it's getting near to, all right, about five minutes, we'll have to flip

569
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,760
the show over and play side two of the show, but in the meantime, I think we'll just peer deeper

570
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,600
and deeper into Bob's brain and just see what we can find.

571
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,040
Alabama, University of Alabama, University of Alabama, don't get me, Boogerman, have you ever

572
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,100
been talking to the Boogerman, I looked everywhere for him, Bob and the Devil.

573
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,700
Bob and the Devil.

574
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,660
We're in space, now believe it, it's real.

575
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,780
Why, why is it real?

576
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,180
Do you know where you are?

577
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,000
Nowhere.

578
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,300
Nowhere.

579
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Are you tired of trying to get that old clunker started every morning?

580
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,560
Well, jump in and get a pair of Bobco's nuclear boots with levitating green beam action.

581
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,160
Less than a starship, yet more than mere footwear, nuclear boots neatly fill in that yawning gap

582
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,240
between bicycles and undependable space shuttles.

583
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,260
Built-in sonic blaster sounds like a car horn the size of a bowling alley and lets them know

584
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,360
you're coming in a big way.

585
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,320
Really butch Teflon flight suits come in 12 colors and protect you from incineration at high velocities.

586
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,920
Give the cops the slip forever.

587
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,780
Speed traps have become a thing of the past.

588
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,940
And for boot failure below 1,000 feet,

589
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,960
you also get one hell of an airbag.

590
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,360
You'll survive but be ready to bounce for miles.

591
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,360
Comes with cushy activated charcoal, one size fits all liners that can handle even the worst cases of stink foot.

592
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Be the first in your town to break the sound barrier.

593
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
Disrupt schools, churches, businesses at will.

594
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,040
Don't bounce off the nice office buildings and make sure to dodge the high tension power lines.

595
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,800
Bobco takes no responsibility for snap necks or untimely decapitations.

596
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,120
And a safety note for you teenagers, our nuclear boots are not intended to be used for repeat head-on collisions even if it is fun.

597
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,920
Our nuclear helmets get mushy every time.

598
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:39,920


599
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,900
They're designed to be used after five or six direct multi-megaton impacts.

600
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes, jets and rockets become passe when you step into a pair of these ozone-ripping wonders.

601
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,820
When you can scare the angels of hell itself, Olympus can be your hot tub.

602
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,380
In a world as shaky as this one, industrial-grade levitating boots like these say something special about the people who wear them.

603
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,000
That they're in one big damn apocalyptic hurry, that's what.

604
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,920
Wouldn't you like to strap on a pair of these big boss blasting babies?

605
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,040
Well, sure you would.

606
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,820
So drive that rattling death trap of yours one last time.

607
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,240
Burn rubber and style as you hurtle to the shoe store.

608
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,920
And nab yourself a box full of the most deadly brain melons.

609
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,400
And the most deadly footwear on the planet, Bobco Nuclear Boots!

610
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,820
From the folks who brought you the Junior Gene Splicing Kit.

611
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,640
Subgenius Industries Unlimited!

612
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,320
...

613
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,820
You're reaching the end of side one of your subgenius radio ministry hour and slack show.

614
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,660
Please be prepared to switch your tape over to side two of your subgenius radio ministry hour and slack show.

615
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,040
Well, that was fine.

616
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,080
I think we have a good band.

617
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,000
At him, he sneezed.

618
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

619
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,900
Oh, we met a big moose with a loose tooth.

620
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,120
I said, it's a nice day.

621
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,380
And he said...

622
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,200
Without a physician.

623
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,460
He comes in the box.

624
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,600
Filling herself an abortion without a physician.

625
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,800
He comes in the box.

626
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,880
Filling herself an abortion without a physician.

627
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,120
He comes in the box.

628
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,920
Filling herself an abortion without...

629
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,640
Abuse and control.

630
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,680
Had at its first...

631
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:27,920
Control.

632
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Had at its first...

633
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,080
Abuse and control.

634
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,920
Follow phone.

635
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,580
Look out.

636
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,000
There, do you know that there's something burning over there?

637
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,280
And this, I do know.

638
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,760
The tender age of 60 hours...

639
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,800
So keep the little...

640
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,640
Gymnasium...

641
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,280
Out of the...

642
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,800
Ballparks.

643
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,040
Where's the stuff coming from?

644
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,760
From the gut.

645
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,520
And it's deadly.

646
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,600
It helps a lot.

647
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,220
Rule it out.

648
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:45,960
It's dangerous.

649
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
He has a good arm.

650
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,060
That doesn't mean anything, Steve.

651
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,080
It's dangerous.

652
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,040
He has a good arm.

653
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,300
That doesn't mean anything, Steve.

654
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,280
It's dangerous.

655
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,220
He has a good arm.

656
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,480
That doesn't mean anything, Steve.

657
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,760
I mean, if 카�

658
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,600
So cute.

659
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:09,700
idk

660
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,360
Start it, brother...

661
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,960
You really are one У dig a tiny hole.

662
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,280
You are scary with something like that after dreaming.

663
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,280


664
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:12,620
I see.

665
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,200
Again, don't ask him.

666
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
It's loud.

667
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:21,980
Up...

668
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,240


669
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,260
Down.

670
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,260


671
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,260


672
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:22,660
Down!

673
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,600
Up!

674
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,600


675
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,800
Up!

676
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,660
So high.

677
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:27,800
But it doesn't look like Ryan's lying.

678
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,920
He's our big brother at the moment.

679
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,680
Call his mom.

680
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,160
Cha-cha-chah, forward, back, cha-cha-chah, back, forward.

681
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,160
What you gonna play now?

682
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,120
Get up off of that thing, and shake it, you'll feel better.

683
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,000
Get up off of that thing, and shake it, you'll feel better now.

684
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,240
Get up off of that thing, and shake it, you'll feel better.

685
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,080
Get up off of that thing, and try to release that pressure.

686
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,880
Ha ha ha, good man!

687
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,480
Ha ha ha ha.

688
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,520
Ha ha ha ha.

689
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
Well, how about cutting a reaper out?

690
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,540
Ha ha ha ha.

691
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,480
Get up on the sheet, Arbor!

692
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,600
Ha ha ha ha.

693
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,480
I sure not feel good!

694
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,580
Ha ha ha ha.

695
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,880
Ha ha ha ha.

696
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,940
Ha ha ha ha.

697
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:18,880
Ha ha ha ha.

698
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:18,880


699
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,140
Let's do the music!

700
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,020
Let's do the music!

701
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,860
Let's do the music!

702
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:28,860


703
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,160
Let's do the music!

704
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,840
Let's do the music!

705
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,580
Let's do the music!

706
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,760
All we need is a drummer.

707
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,900
All we need is a drummer.

708
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,880
For people who only need a beat, yeah.

709
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:41,520
For people who only need a beat, yeah.

710
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,960
Beat this!

711
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,120
Beat this!

712
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,020
Beat that beat!

713
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,640
What's up with that bogey?

714
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,860
Play it!

715
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,460
Music kills us, feels un-bills us.

716
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,100
It kills us, it kills us, it kills us.

717
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,900
Kills us?

718
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,980
My kism!

719
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,660
Kism!

720
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,140
Kism!

721
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,140


722
00:33:59,440 --> 00:33:59,940
Kism!

723
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,460
Kism!

724
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,640
My hands in my pants and I need to dance!

725
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,020
Can't pass a beat, I can't pass a beat, I can't pass a beat, I can't pass a hit-bass!

726
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:09,840
Hit me!

727
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,420
Hit me!

728
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,280
Hit me!

729
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:13,760


730
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,760
And say, children, what does it all mean?

731
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,620
This stuff is real, you rich!

732
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,560
This stuff is real, you rich!

733
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,920
This stuff is real!

734
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:34,940


735
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:34,940


736
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,480
K Purple.

737
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:35,480


738
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:35,580


739
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,160
K Shorty.

740
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,520
K Gr majence.

741
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,980
K Salmar.

742
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,600
K J.

743
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,640
You're Russian, I'm American.

744
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,400
We're sitting across from each other.

745
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,500
Dealing man to man, person to person.

746
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,200
That is the point of this entire summit.

747
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,480
Yes, I'm glad you're here.

748
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,780
And let me just put it to you this way.

749
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,000
Are you ready to lay your cards on the table?

750
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,960
I am ready to make deal, Mr. President.

751
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,320
So am I. Let me just show you what I got right here.

752
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,220
I got a 1965 Willie Mays baseball card.

753
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,360
I'll trade you for your Roger Maris.

754
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
Wait, I gave you Whitey Ford last time.

755
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm entitled to better deal.

756
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,420
Well, this has the original gum in this collector's item.

757
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,180
And I did not anticipate this.

758
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,820
I'm just kidding about the baseball card thing.

759
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,380
Just trying to break the ice.

760
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,000
It's very effective, Mr. President.

761
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,460
Let's get down to the issues of the world, shall we?

762
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:26,720
Yes.

763
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,880
On the reunification of Germany.

764
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,180
Hold it. Hold on.

765
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,560
What?

766
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,120
Wait a minute.

767
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,300
Just don't move.

768
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,520
Hold on.

769
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,020
What is that on your head?

770
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,440
Oh, please, Mr. President.

771
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,860
Joke about the red spot on forehead made many times.

772
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,440
No, no, no, no.

773
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,160
It's not about the red spot.

774
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,700
It's it.

775
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,320
It's a tick.

776
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,100
By golly, that's a tick.

777
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,400
You serious?

778
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,380
Tick?

779
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,560
Yes, a tick.

780
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,540
Ticks are what those little spiders that cause Lyme disease.

781
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:52,780
Please, please.

782
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,180
Get tick, please.

783
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,220
Let me get that.

784
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,220
I don't want you to go back.

785
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,000
Hold on.

786
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,460
Hold still.

787
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Let me just slap right.

788
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,720
Mr. President, please.

789
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,120
No.

790
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,480
Is he gone now?

791
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,900
He's taken care of.

792
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,440
You don't want that darn Lyme disease.

793
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,840
That's the scourge of American white people that live in the suburbs.

794
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,420
Certainly, yes.

795
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,460
I don't want you to take that back to Russia now.

796
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,380
Please, let us get back to issues.

797
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,280
Yes, here's.

798
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,460
Now, about the intercontinental ballistic message.

799
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:17,900
Hold it.

800
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,440
Hold on.

801
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:18,880
What?

802
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,480
Don't move.

803
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,940
What is it now, Mr. President?

804
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,540
On your cheek.

805
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,820
Well, there's.

806
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,740
There he is.

807
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,280
I didn't get him the first time.

808
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,200
He's on your cheek, the tick that spreads Lyme disease.

809
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,860
Let me just.

810
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,380
We will continue now to deal with this important issue with him.

811
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,500
All right, now Lithuania.

812
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,860
Let's just get.

813
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,640
Mr. President.

814
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:37,940
Yes.

815
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,220
One moment, please.

816
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,080
All right, what?

817
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,200
What is this?

818
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,040
A small black spot on the face of yours.

819
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
I don't know what it is.

820
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,520
What do you say?

821
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:45,640


822
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,960
Just on my nose.

823
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,280
I got it right there.

824
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,360
Good.

825
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:49,600
Good.

826
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,160
He's taken care of.

827
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,740
You're learning about this tick stuff pretty fast, aren't you?

828
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,080
It could be fatal disease, I understand.

829
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
I've read in your Time magazine.

830
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,400
Now, this business about Germany getting back together.

831
00:36:59,420 --> 00:36:59,820
Mr. President, wait.

832
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,460
The little fellow, he's going to your stomach.

833
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:02,680
He's now.

834
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,200
I got it right now.

835
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,440
There.

836
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,360
That should take care of him, I hope.

837
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,840
All right, all right.

838
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,300
I'm not worried about ticks.

839
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,200
I had my shots.

840
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,500
Now.

841
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,340
This business about Germany getting back together.

842
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,720
Yes.

843
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,420
You want to make sure that they are not.

844
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,600
Yes, unification of Germany is.

845
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:16,840
Hold on.

846
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,420
Hold it right on your ear.

847
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,700
Let me get him.

848
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
I'll get him right over here.

849
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,900
I don't want the ear bite.

850
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,300
There's that little.

851
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,500
He's gone now.

852
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,300
Now, let's get back to this discussion.

853
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,940
And I hope that these ticks won't interrupt us anymore.

854
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,320
You have infestation.

855
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,620
Wait, on your forehead.

856
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,000
Where am I?

857
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,920
It's on your forehead.

858
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,240
No.

859
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,520
This little hopping creature.

860
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,300
Yes, I must get him.

861
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,900
He's right over here on your head.

862
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,700
No, it's on your head.

863
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,060
No, no, it's on your head.

864
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm afraid not.

865
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,560
No, Mr. President, wait.

866
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,160
You must let me.

867
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,280
Whoa, yes, sir.

868
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,500
Rebobby.

869
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,100
Well, let's see where we're at.

870
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,800
Dear friends, to tell you what you have been listening to,

871
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,540
once again, from the top of the half hour

872
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,300
or something like that, there was some media brawage

873
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,200
from, of course, the good Reverend Nick Nolan.

874
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,520
We heard also the nuclear boots, Bob's nuclear boots spot there

875
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,240
from Hellpoke Huey, some music from Sedition Commission

876
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:39,100
of Houston, Texas, Me by Cates and West, some little bits

877
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,360
of music from Nick Nolan.

878
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,520
He was a great guy.

879
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,700
He was a great guy.

880
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,120
And the little barrage, again, from Radio Sphincter

881
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,920
and Sam Morgan of Austin, I think.

882
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,180
The funky, funky music thing there by Steve Stein.

883
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,900
Oh, they must have loved that Sam Morgan.

884
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,160
And The Summit there by Bill Cates and Billy West.

885
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:10,180
And yes, dear friends, well now we, let's see how this,

886
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,400
I guess it has been sort of a battle.

887
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:22,160
But I guess what we should do here is clarify, perhaps,

888
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,060
some of the statements we made in a show a couple of weeks back,

889
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:34,140
what we might call the Yeti Lust Show, on men and women.

890
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:46,640
You see, friends, the men should, they should go off and get together to do so-called man things.

891
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,560
The most common example would be some variation on going to the lodge,

892
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,760
such as when the guys sit around and smoke stinky cigars, talk dirty, play bad jazz, etc.

893
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,940
And the women, the women should, should have their women.

894
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:10,120
Groups and so forth, where they sit around and drink and talk dirty and play bad jazz and so forth.

895
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,400
This makes the men more manly and the women more womanly.

896
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:24,540
And then the men and women can more passionately indulge in the most important lodge meeting,

897
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,840
that is, doing the man and woman things.

898
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,240
This does not mean just sex.

899
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,880
This includes talking.

900
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,620
And joking and everything else.

901
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:43,080
The man and the woman should try to be as purely themselves as possible,

902
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,820
so that when the times of, the holy times of communion come,

903
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:55,000
that new entity, the man and woman love entity,

904
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,500
is made all the stronger and healthier.

905
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,240
We're sick of people apologizing.

906
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,440
We're sick of people apologizing for the differences between men and women.

907
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,860
Apologizing, dear friends.

908
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,200
Those differences are God's greatest invention.

909
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,280
Nature's God, that is.

910
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,160
Don't get the wrong idea.

911
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,860
We're talking pre-Jehovah One.

912
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,700
But this sappy, new-agey, unisex fairy tale

913
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,420
has been taken to repellent extremes by well-meaning, screwed-up idiots.

914
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,380
The conspiracy couldn't be happier than to see every source of passion and truth

915
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,320
and beauty watered down to the point that they can control such virtues

916
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,380
through artificial replacements.

917
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,640
The only differences between the fundamentalist Khan's use of guilt as a control device

918
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:55,220
and the new-age Khan's use of it is that the former is based on old cartoon-like superstitions

919
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,240
while the latter is based on new, more subtle superstitions.

920
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,240
Now, this is not to say that...

921
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,440
all subgenius males must be swaggering he-men

922
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,500
and the women must be hookers with hearts of gold, although that is usually the case.

923
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,720
There are those who really are more naturally androgynous

924
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,600
and there are those who are flat-out...

925
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,760
well, to use Queer Nation's term, which we find liberatingly ornery.

926
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,420
Well, we just did.

927
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,280
Bob doesn't care what you are as long as you aren't pretending not to be it.

928
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,360
If you are androgynous...

929
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,860
or homosexual or whatever, then...

930
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,300
Durn it.

931
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,120
Be androgynous or homosexual or whatever, but do it to your heart's content,

932
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,360
not to some pinkly-correct self-help book's content.

933
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:55,200
What we're saying is that you mustn't let either side of the conspiracy steal away your passion and instincts,

934
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,280
because once they have those, they have it all.

935
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,360
That innermost, deepest part of your brain,

936
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,560
is the last place you can be truly free.

937
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,000
Truly, yourself, if you can sneak away physically from the others long enough,

938
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,080
you can keep that essence of yourself even in prison.

939
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:24,220
Yet, you can just as easily lose it as a prosperous, free civilian on the street

940
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:31,740
if you let them get to you with their nasty-minded, stomach-souring, anxiety-perpetuating regulations

941
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,100
and stereotypes.

942
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:43,600
Whoa! Now, does this mean that just because you feel the real you is a sadist and rapist and child molester

943
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,660
that you should be the real you by doing those things?

944
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,620
Get real! We will not fall into that conspiracy argument loop!

945
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,260
That's not the real you, that's the diseased you!

946
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,260
Rape or harassment of any kind is sick! Totally sick!

947
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,380
And if the subtenuous foundation had control of the courts, dear friends,

948
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:13,420
public castration without anesthetic on live TV would be the least of the sex criminals' worries.

949
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,700
Sex crimes involve victims. We're talking about sex.

950
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:23,440
That is, when one or more persons do things together because they all want to.

951
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:29,440
Children do not enter into this equation because by definition they cannot truly want to

952
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,160
the way an adult does, and those who argue for legalizing sex of any kind between adults and kids

953
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,960
should have their faces skinned!

954
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,780
Sex is anything mutually consensual between adults.

955
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,060
Anything else is a depraved crime, and even though the conspiracy is ultimately to blame,

956
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,940
anyone who calls itself a subgenius and is even thinking of perpetrating such a crime

957
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,220
should turn themselves into the conspiracy medical authorities immediately

958
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,420
and get themselves locked up and drowned.

959
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,240
Senseless.

960
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,640
Or find Jesus or something. Anything but that.

961
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:14,780
Bob has no feeling whatsoever for the rapist, the child molester, the wife beater.

962
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:20,500
He does not even think of them, because it's one of those things he truly cannot understand at all.

963
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:26,760
They are damned, truly damned, simply by his inattention.

964
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,140
Which means, dear friends, that come X-Day and the remote possibility that

965
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,020
Mwom didn't already have plans in this regard,

966
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,020
Bob would probably leave justice up to the kangaroo courts of the overmen and the uber-women.

967
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,200
But my God, if you all agree that you want to sodomize each other or chain each other up

968
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,900
or whatever the hell you strange people do, then go for it!

969
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,820
The conspiracy gets away with pushing you around in almost every other regard.

970
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,040
At least don't let them push you around in the bedroom.

971
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,400
Demonstrate your rebellion there, even if no one else sees.

972
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,480
That itself serves to remind you how little you care what they think.

973
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,460
Of course, you can't repent and quit your job every day, but you can,

974
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,840
just for the sake of doing it, just for your own satisfaction.

975
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,480
Break the rules and snub your nose at the normals there in the bedroom or the bathroom or the dungeon or wherever.

976
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,800
Break the rules by getting yourself in trouble.

977
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,980
And if you try to go like this, you'll end up getting yourself more turned on than they ever told you was possible.

978
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,080
Tell your partner your weird thoughts.

979
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,860
Deliberate upon the weird suggestions of your partner.

980
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,340
Take our word for it, Jesus doesn't care and Mom and Dad don't need to know.

981
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,480
The important thing is that you don't end up, well, screwing yourself.

982
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,320
For that is the conspiracy's plan for you.

983
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,880
When you so-called do it.

984
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,980
Therefore, do it real nasty, just like the normals don't want you to do.

985
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,280
Well, that sort of thing is what the church is all about.

986
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,960
Not just that, but that's not the only thing.

987
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,480
But when we did an all-nasty version of the stark fist of removal church journal,

988
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:15,680
some less fully liberated subgeniuses were afraid that the church hierarchy,

989
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,080
I guess especially the church hierarchy bold surrealist redneck southerners,

990
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:25,140
had rutted the magazine permanently into the gutter.

991
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:33,720
Well, friends, all we can say is do it just like the normals don't want you to do.

992
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:40,040
Well, easy for you to say, Bob, you may say.

993
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,840
Hell, I can't even find a date, much less indulge my true yeti urges.

994
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,460
Have you no mercy, Bob, they plead.

995
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,060
Well, dear friends, following the path of least respect,

996
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,200
least resistance should not be that hard.

997
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,760
In fact, it's supposed to be the easiest thing in the world.

998
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,720
So quit focusing all your attention on the search for a mate.

999
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,240
Keep up the requisite activity, but diffuse your attention so that you don't glow with desperation,

1000
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,820
which is a surefire subliminal auraic turnoff.

1001
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,700
Defocus your attention onto following the path of least resistance in all things.

1002
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,040
And as your overall luck begins falling into place,

1003
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,920
as slack,

1004
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,920
increases across the mental board,

1005
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,460
then your luck in getting some will naturally increase as well.

1006
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,820
That's another way of saying, I suppose, get ahead by giving up.

1007
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:38,680
You're not really giving up, you're actually temporarily reshuffling your priorities for a more rich and full perspective.

1008
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,480
Stop praying to Bob just for romance.

1009
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,220
Pray for everything!

1010
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,800
Vast wealth, perfect health without exercising,

1011
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,760
a second forehead stereo video deck,

1012
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:50,960
and

1013
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,480
the romance.

1014
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,140
All of it!

1015
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,880
Don't be a sitting daca, a target for binding demons by becoming a...

1016
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,860
a beacon, a vampire beacon of obsessive self-pity and unfulfilled need.

1017
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,020
If you fixate to the point of desperate compulsion on one thing,

1018
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,920
your mental eye will grow a saddle with Negi's name on it,

1019
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,520
and you'll be sure to blow it.

1020
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,120
Can't get that date on Friday night?

1021
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,060
Well, you've probably been neglecting your hobby of inventing practical non-pollutionary,

1022
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,080
including portable fusion reactors anyway.

1023
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:28,400
Or try culling up that blind girl in the apartment downstairs.

1024
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,240
She won't care how you look as long as you smell clean.

1025
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,000
And who knows, she might turn out to be a secret subgenius sex maniac

1026
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,500
with an even bigger collection of science fiction movie soundtrack albums than yours.

1027
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,780
And remember, dear friends,

1028
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,180
remember this one last thing,

1029
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,960
that you can always keep in your mind,

1030
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,540
no matter how bleak and terrible things get.

1031
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,160
You can always go fishing.

1032
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,880
Oh, thank you, and, uh...

1033
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,340
a good night.

1034
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,740
See you tomorrow.

1035
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,540
Thanks, Gary.

1036
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,060
See you, Gary.

1037
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,060


1038
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:45,760
Well, uh, how did you four guys begin your together life?

1039
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:45,920
What do you mean, two guys?

1040
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:45,920


1041
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,540
As you know her, we closely respect each other and we wouldn't have sex unless it's the two of us.

1042
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,380
Oh, I see.

1043
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,900
I wouldn't mistake

1044
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,100
you for civilians because you wouldn't hold it back.

1045
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,780
Thank you.

1046
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,700
Thank you.

1047
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,600
Thank you.

1048
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,000
Thank you.

1049
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,280
Thank you.

1050
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,060
Thank you.

1051
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,840
Thank you.

1052
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,620
Thank you.

1053
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,020
Thank you.

1054
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,080
Thank you.

1055
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,580
Thank you.

1056
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,320
Thank you.

1057
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,200
Thank you.

1058
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,200
Thank you.

1059
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,500
Thank you.

1060
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,720
Thank you.

1061
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,140
Thank you.

1062
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:01,540
Thank you.

1063
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:01,720
Thank you.

1064
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,100
Thank you.

1065
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,320
Thank you.

1066
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,000
Thank you thank you.

1067
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,920
Thank you.

1068
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:20,080
To the subtitles are providing a copy of EXCLUSIVE DR.

1069
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,080


1070
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,940
The song that refused to die.

1071
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,000
It was a stinky little old song.

1072
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,700
Yeah, this was a song that refused to die.

1073
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,640
It wouldn't go away.

1074
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,420
It just kept on lumbering along.

1075
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,260
Note after note.

1076
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,740
Packed in with such frenzy confusion

1077
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,220
that no one could understand a word, a lyric, a single meaning.

1078
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,280
But it was a song still.

1079
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,200
The drummer kept drumming.

1080
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,920
The bass player kept playing.

1081
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,180
The guitar player kept guitaring.

1082
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:55,060
And all the time the song lumbered along, refusing to die.

1083
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,600
Never would it die.

1084
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,880
Always seeking to renew itself.

1085
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,820
To refound its own self-identity.

1086
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,440
Somewhere deep within its inner being,

1087
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,680
it knew that it was a song.

1088
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:11,600
And it knew that it would refuse to die under any circumstances.

1089
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,540
That no matter how long the universe lasted,

1090
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,420
that no matter how long people,

1091
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,280
believed in things,

1092
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,560
no matter how long the human intellect was conscious,

1093
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,480
it was a true song.

1094
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,880
The one song that refused to die.

1095
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,620
Yeah, and even when people thought it was dead,

1096
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:39,500
it got back up and it walked around on all four legs.

1097
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,440
And then somebody shot off one leg.

1098
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,740
And then it got back up again on three legs.

1099
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,900
The song was...

1100
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,640
It lumbered around for a while again.

1101
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,400
On three legs.

1102
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,720
Out of control.

1103
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,560
They came at it with neutron howitzers.

1104
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,100
They had nuclear bombs.

1105
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,600
They had scud missiles.

1106
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,880
They had Patriot missiles shooting down the scud.

1107
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,780
They had everything trying to go up against the song.

1108
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,460
It refused to die.

1109
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,960
But it wouldn't be stopped.

1110
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,460
It was beyond being stopped or even being controlled.

1111
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,460
Tiny screaming, wild whining voices couldn't stop it.

1112
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,120
Guitars, speed and hats couldn't stop it.

1113
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,180
People with big sticks and boards couldn't stop it.

1114
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,080
Nothing could stop the song that refused to die.

1115
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,820
They shot it down.

1116
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,800
They stabbed it.

1117
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,380
They brought it back to life.

1118
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,580
They resurrected the song.

1119
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,880
And then before they knew it, it had to die.

1120
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,220
The mistake was that the song did not die.

1121
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:47,220


1122
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,620
They thought it couldn't die, but somehow or another it did die.

1123
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,400
It really wasn't the song that refused to die.

1124
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,640
It was the song that died easily.

1125
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:00,960
It was the song that forgot its own reasons for existence.

1126
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,060
It was the song that was a tiny pushover.

1127
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:13,160
It had no endurance whatsoever because it was the song that agreed to die.

1128
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,420
He has to get the show going.

1129
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,380
This is a big day.

1130
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:16,380


1131
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:16,380


1132
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:16,380


1133
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:16,440
They're going to be crushed.

1134
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1135
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1136
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1137
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1138
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1139
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1140
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1141
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:16,440


1142
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:25,180
It was the song that agreed to die after just a tiny bit of abuse,

1143
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,440
and the song that refused to die suddenly was bending over backwards in a hurry to die.

1144
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,500
It's a song that couldn't die fast enough.

1145
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,260
It's a song that stopped living before it ever died.

1146
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,180
It never even got a chance to live before it was dying.

1147
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,420
It was a useless song, a song that never had even a reason.

1148
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,120
It was a song that couldn't be conceived.

1149
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,080
It was a song that was pre-existing before man.

1150
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,720
But still, it couldn't wait to die.

1151
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,560
It wanted to die. It wanted to die so bad.
