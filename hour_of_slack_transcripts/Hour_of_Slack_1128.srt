1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,080
In just a moment, enjoy feverish activity.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,720
Oh!

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,220
But first...

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,440
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,640
Oh, boy!

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,020
But, gee whiz, I don't want them!

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,860
Oh, gee whiz!

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,980
I see. Well, I'll tell...

12
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,340
Who?

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,740
Oh, boy.

14
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,240
Yes, the electronic brain will analyze the results.

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,860
Goodbye.

16
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,560
Goodbye.

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,620
What?

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,740
We worship this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, who we've never met, which makes him that much more impressive.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,640
The reason we're here at the Cannabis Cup is because, for some reason,

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,180
something about the nature of our religion, our videotapes and so forth,

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,720
seems to have...

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,140
appealed to these potheads and cannabis smokers.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,080
I just don't understand that, except for the fact that what the religion that Bob preaches

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,620
is a religion devoted to slack.

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,900
Slack is the quality that we all want, but it's different for everybody.

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,880
The conspiracy of the normal people will try to make you swallow their form of slack,

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,340
and we, the subgeniuses, are what you might call the weirdos,

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,120
the disbelievers,

30
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,680
or people who believe anything,

31
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,120
who are fighting the conspiracy of the normal people,

32
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,500
in the name of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,720
Praise Bob.

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Praise Bob.

35
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,820
I, I, I, I, I...

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,800
I...

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,920
I...

38
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,600
I...

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,220
I...

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,080
I...

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,960
I...

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:52,960


48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,540
The subgenius.

49
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,740
Power of...

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,720
Power of...

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,720


52
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,720


53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,720


54
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,720


55
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,720


56
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm a dirty dog, I'm a thief, I'm a fraud, I'm a flake, I'm Bob.

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,020
Thank you, Bob. I'm glad to be here.

58
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,900
Now, just in case the boys and girls have never seen you, would you mind telling them what a Bob looks like?

59
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm big, big, about a foot. Yes, yes, I'm a very stiff one.

60
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,620
Tell the boys and girls why you're called Bob.

61
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,640
Bob, Bob, he really respects me because I destroy lots of horrors.

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,580
Are you nocturnal?

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,060
Yes, I love the night, Bob.

64
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,800
Oh, you must have.

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,960
Bob, yes. No way. Picked one off at a time. Bob, I had no failure.

66
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,940
I'll bet that was hard for you.

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,080
You've got it. Totally dark.

68
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Okay, I've got you.

69
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,200
Okay, Bob, Bob.

70
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,420
A totally dark night. It's heart-shaped.

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,300
Okay, Bob.

72
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,900
You're kidding.

73
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,160
Bob.

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,720
You're kidding.

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,720
Bob, and they're deadly.

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,700
Bob, and they're deadly.

77
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Any sound that comes from the left, Bob, you've got it.

78
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,440
These sounds go to my brain, Bob, and a little hor-hor-hor is drawn in my brain.

79
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,880
Vertical or up and down directions?

80
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,200
Yes, up and down.

81
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,120
How does that work?

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,260
Higher. How high?

83
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,180
Okay, I see now.

84
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,680
Down on the floor, come together.

85
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,220
Incredible.

86
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,540
Less than a half a second.

87
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,040
And instantly, even though it's totally black, Bob.

88
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,420
Bob.

89
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,700
Bob.

90
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,220
That Bob.

91
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,400
That part in my brain.

92
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,680
Bob.

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,020
That part in my brain now coming into my ears.

94
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,220
And you know what to do next.

95
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,700
To open up, and I'm on my way.

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Fantastic.

97
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,240
laff

98
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,060
double stomp

99
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,480

100
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,480

102
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,320

104
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,400


105
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,320

109
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm like a big summer gun, see how it flies.

110
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm a liar.

111
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
Sitting on a cornflake.

112
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,940
Waiting for the fact to come.

113
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,420
Corporation t-shirts, stupid floaty Tuesday men.

114
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,600
You've been a naughty boy, you'll let your face grow long.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,880
I am the end man.

116
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,540
They are the end men.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,540
I am the worst.

118
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,160
I am the worst.

119
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Mr. City Policeman sitting in a pretty little policeman in a row.

120
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,480
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run.

121
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,820
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying.

122
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm crying.

123
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,380
I'm crying.

124
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,680
He's all the best, sir.

125
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,500
Drinking all the dead dogs I've found.

126
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,160
Covered like a fish, wife, pornographic beast.

127
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,460
They're spoiled men and naughty girls, you'll let your pictures down.

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,100
I am the end man.

129
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,580
Now wake up little Susie.

130
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,880
They are the end man.

131
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,180
I am the worst.

132
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,080
Goo goo goo goo.

133
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,860
I am the end man.

134
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,520
I am the end man.

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,520


136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,520


137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,520


138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:01,520


139
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:16,860

Expat, expat, joking smokers

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,300
Don't you think the joke could upset you?

149
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,540
See how they smile like pigs in a stye

Loaming up the iPhone tower

154
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,880
Get down from the high

I am the Eggman

159
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,860
We are the Eggman

I am the Morris

163
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,560
Hoy...

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,220
Hoy...

165
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,760
Aujourd...

166
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,940
Hoy...

167
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,580
We'll be right back.

168
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:30,840
We'll be right back.

169
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,700
We'll be right back.

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,040
Yay!

171
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,180
We're here to change the brain cells inside your head.

172
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Bob can help you get rid of the brain cells you don't need, my friend.

173
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,300
With overwork and television,

174
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,540
the conspiracy has added more brain cells than you need.

175
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,700
We're here tonight to kill some of those brain cells.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
Your brain cells can't be afraid to say,

177
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,180
kill me, Bob, if you want to know slack.

178
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,680
You have to be ready to be killed by Bob.

179
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,480
Most of you don't even know what slack is.

180
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,140
You think you have slack.

181
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,380
I can afford to go out and party at the disco, etc., etc.

182
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,720
Now I can afford to go out and get some slack.

183
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,180
That's the biggest lie in the world.

184
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
And the church is full of lies.

185
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,340
But that's one lie we won't join in on.

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,780
As long as you believe you have to afford slack,

187
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,360
then you have to pay for slack.

188
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Your soul belongs to them.

189
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,080
But as long as you don't need money for slack, my friend,

190
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,720
the conspiracy cannot win.

191
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
So I have spoken from my script.

192
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,560
What?

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,980
So he has spoken?

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,420
We only have a limited time to kill those brain cells.

195
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,320
And so we have spoken.

196
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,180
So we have spoken.

197
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
A few short moments.

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,200
Fifty minutes, in fact, to kill every brain in your cells.

199
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
Friends, the world is ending.

200
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,580
You can see it in the website signsofwitness.com.

201
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,580
The birds are vanishing.

202
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,140
The polar bears are melting.

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,520
The tigers have all been eaten.

204
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,220
Genetically engineered chemtrails fall from the sky,

205
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,860
and all of us are dead.

206
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:00,860


207
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:00,860


208
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:00,860


209
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:00,860


210
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:00,860


211
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,100
All of our food is made of antibiotics.

212
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,780
People still name their teddy bears Muhammad, and that's bad.

213
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,080
But raping and killing civilians in Darfur, that's okay.

214
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,440
And China has declared cyber war on us all.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,780
And American brain viruses are in every airport in Africa.

216
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,920
American brain viruses?

217
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,260
Yes.

218
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,160
What makes them so much different, Shorty?

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,500
What makes an American brain virus a little bit more stylish?

220
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,840
A little more crinkly on the edges, corners, and pigment.

221
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,520
They make the Africans sicker, and the African viruses make the Americans sicker.

222
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,440
It makes the Africans more aggressive.

223
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,400
And vice versa, same with China, and you could name, slip, slide any country into that slot.

224
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,520
It makes them want to build skyscrapers, and tanks, and bullets, and guns, and cheese.

225
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
It makes them want to stomp in big, huge boots all over your family.

226
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
More skyscrapers!

227
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,700
More.

228
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,400
We need more.

229
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,220
We need to reach the skies.

230
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,600
Say, I should give, speaking of reaching for the skies, how about that cover of I Am the Walrus medley?

231
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,280
I'm scrying.

232
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,400
That was, I believe, Phineas Narco.

233
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,380
Reverend Phineas Narco put that together.

234
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,300
That was our Phineas, yes.

235
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,280
He's really good at that.

236
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,900
He's too bluster.

237
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,040
He's from National.

238
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,220
National Cynical Radio dot com.

239
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,720
National Cynical dot com.

240
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,680
One of those two.

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,200
I can't remember.

242
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,680
National Cynical Network?

243
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,280
Something's not right.

244
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,860
You're killing your own brain cells, Stang.

245
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,960
Tonight, we kill the brain cells of the public.

246
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,480
No.

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,380
Well, yes.

248
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,140
If the public has some brain cells left, then we can kill them, because there are none left for us to kill.

249
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,580
In our own brains.

250
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,180
No.

251
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,540
No.

252
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,380
Our brains have been homogenized into one uber cell.

253
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,040
Yes.

254
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,400
Well, Princess, we and I, we're glad that you have your brain cell, your one huge cell.

255
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,720
The monocelic surround it.

256
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,260
Because our...

257
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,420
It's like a sun.

258
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,100
It's like a planet.

259
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,560
Our two half-brain cells have been depleted completely.

260
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,640
Flattened.

261
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,500
Our brain cells are gone because we were at the Amsterdam Frop Cup devival.

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,300
And field trip.

263
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,060
In fact, actually, there's been two big devivals since I've last been on the radio live here.

264
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,220
And this...

265
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,060
Because we did...

266
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,640
There was the Baltimore devival.

267
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,280
You're in the town of Lord Baltimore, and then you're in...

268
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,080
No, the town of Tim Orr.

269
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,100
Timor?

270
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah.

271
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Tim Orr is what that town is named after.

272
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,740
East Timor?

273
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,100
Baltimore.

274
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Oh.

275
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,100
Reverend Tim Orr.

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,420
Oh, I thought it was named after Lord Baltimore.

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,680
And his white wig and his funny socks.

278
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,420
Tim didn't show up.

279
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,560
But everybody else...

280
00:12:59,560 --> 00:12:59,860
Baltimore...

281
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:07,340
Baltimore devival was wonderful, and we'll play tapes from that when we can edit the curse words out.

282
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:16,460
Same with the Amsterdam devival, when we can edit the brain cells back in.

283
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,920
Re-suture, re-snip, a little link here, a little snap there, a little whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

284
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,320
And they're all re-hexed.

285
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,720
Just like the Babalox.

286
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,620
Remember, the Babalox will keep up with you as long as you can keep up with it.

287
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,800
And if you don't want, then you don't have to.

288
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,400
Ah, shuffling through papers.

289
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,120
I see something.

290
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,220
It's...

291
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,760
Oh, my God.

292
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,480
It's a message from J.R. Bob Doobes.

293
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,180
Who the hell is Doobes?

294
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,800
Bob's cousin.

295
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,020
Bob Doobes?

296
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,320
The infamous Doobes family.

297
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,220
Doobes.

298
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,800
Yes, they were drug smugglers.

299
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,960
That explains why it's...

300
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,260
The Doobes brothers.

301
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not a pipe.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,120
They were also rock stars.

303
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,560
Yes, they were kind of third-level rock stars.

304
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,860
Many hits, but very few twits.

305
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,400
And look.

306
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,300
Oh, my God.

307
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:07,460
It says Doobes was married three times to an angular woman from Apachinata, a place in Spain, I guess.

308
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,000
What a lovely life.

309
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
A long and happy and healthy life, unlike the life of J.R.

310
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,280
J.R. Bob Doobes.

311
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,780
Who?

312
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,960
Insert name here.

313
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,540
Insert name here.

314
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,620
If only I could wedge my name in that little spot.

315
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,540
But there's no room above the title for me yet.

316
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,320
Well, there's ESQ, after all.

317
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,280
One of these days, though.

318
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,080
I've got a lot of other directors I have to kill.

319
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,500
Actually, I've got to start with Matt Grenning of Futurama.

320
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,260
You want to hurt him?

321
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,880
Oh, yeah.

322
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,200
I saw the new Futurama movie, which is a straight-to-DVB movie, last night.

323
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,600
And I cried because he had beat me.

324
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,540
Not only had he beat me to several good ideas I was going to use in that subgenius movie script,

325
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,400
but he pulled them off better than I was going to.

326
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,520
Damn him!

327
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,060
Don't worry about that.

328
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,620
Oh, well.

329
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,540
But I don't care, because my brain has been cleansed and flensed and resurrected

330
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,760
after our brainwashings there in Holland Headland, Holland.

331
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,060
So did you have to wear the little metal helmets with the cybles?

332
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,720
No, that's for the people in the cannabis cup, which was going on simultaneously.

333
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh.

334
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,940
We, however, were with the FROP Cup.

335
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,300
Now, Governor Rotnar and Dr. Howell were with us, and they were judges in the cannabis cup.

336
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,120
And Reverend Daddy Joseph of Jesus was there, and Claudia, his true yeti mate.

337
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,480
And they were vendors at the cannabis cup.

338
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,500
And we helped them.

339
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,420
We were willing, with some arm-bending, to go from coffee shop to coffee shop and advise them,

340
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
help them judge.

341
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,240
But we had our own business to do there.

342
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,560
We had devivals and radio shows, and we had the FROP Cup judging, which was different.

343
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,220
You know, FROP is not a drug.

344
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,520
FROP is an herb.

345
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:16,820
Well, first, you should probably describe the actual cannabis cup, and then describe the FROP Cup so we can make a comparative judgment.

346
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,800
Well, the cannabis cup is kind of a rip-off for dumb college kids, essentially.

347
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,860
They pay $175 to go and get a little program book at this big convention hall,

348
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,880
where they can also wander around.

349
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,540
Smoke cigarettes and buy overpriced Thai junk food.

350
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:40,240
And look at the latest in pot smoking technology, such as clear rolling papers.

351
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,240
Yes, transparent rolling papers.

352
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,960
Someone we know tried them.

353
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,440
And it's like the visible joint.

354
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,700
But they actually do work.

355
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,100
They're not very healthy, are they?

356
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,220
I'm told.

357
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,540
And...

358
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,620
Well, they make...

359
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,140
And...

360
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:54,620
And...

361
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:54,960
And...

362
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,020
And...

363
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,140
And...

364
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


365
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


366
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


367
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


368
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


369
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


370
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


371
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,140


372
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,160
And...

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,620
Well, I heard this year at the cup, the Copa de Oro,

374
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,340
that there was a randomness vector that interrupted both the FROP escapade and also the cannabis.

375
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,140
And not to mention the D-cup.

376
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,520
It spilled over into the D-cup as well, and the ex-porn star party.

377
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,620
Well, that happens a lot.

378
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,140
Which was last night.

379
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,860
On the shores of the good old Zyder Sea, there's a lot of flopping going on regularly.

380
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:25,640
As a matter of fact, we knew it was going to be a good trip when we walked into the apartment we were allowed to stay at,

381
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,020
except...

382
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
We couldn't walk in.

383
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,880
The door...

384
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,340
We couldn't open the door all the way because there were two subgeniuses making love sweet love

385
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:38,520
right in the middle of the living room floor of the apartment we thought we had all to ourselves.

386
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,860
But nay, a British subgeniusman...

387
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,200
Spreading orgasmatic rays everywhere.

388
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,680
An American subconnyite had met and fallen in instant lust.

389
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,360
Shoredurper lust, you might say.

390
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,140
Shoredurper lust?

391
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,960
Now, if it was...

392
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
He's a subgenius sort of affair.

393
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,840
We waited until they were through before we moved our suitcases in.

394
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,580
Wouldn't they naturally or subnaturally be making hate instead of making war?

395
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,080
I mean...

396
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,920
I mean...

397
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,600
No, instead of making love?

398
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,660
Well, you know, you said it was two subgenii copula...

399
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,080
Yes, they were doing sex hurt.

400
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,000
It's the divine battle between man and woman.

401
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,120
And so each one hurts in turn, or each one...

402
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,840
First he thrusts, and then she thrusts, and then he thrusts, and then she thrusts...

403
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:25,860
Ouch!

404
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:25,900
Ouch!

405
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:25,900


406
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,160
And then she lays her eggs, and he fertilizes the eggs.

407
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,360
And then he does a rhythmic dance, waving his waver over her waver.

408
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,880
Right.

409
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,480
Spelled W-A-I-A-I.

410
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,180
And then if he's the suicide show at the subgenius revival, such as our new friend Crazy White Sean,

411
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:53,520
after fertilizing the eggs, he hammers his member to a board and puts hooks in it and swings bowling balls from it.

412
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,600
Schwarzkogler, baby.

413
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,940
You know, we worked with...

414
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,260
We worked with sideshow marvels before at subgenius devivals, like the Great Circus Apocalypse and Andrew the Impaled.

415
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:11,240
But the aptly named Crazy White Sean was even harder working than the subgenius sideshow freaks that I've seen.

416
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,280
By a quantum leap.

417
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,800
Yeah, Princess, we couldn't look at it at all.

418
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,220
Also, I've got a list.

419
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,960
Actually, I have a nice list of what happened at the subgenius devival when...

420
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,540
I mean, it was a normal devival up to a point.

421
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,500
I preached.

422
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:25,580
I preached.

423
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,700
Dr. Hal preached to Pope Black and so forth.

424
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,760
Reverend Lucky Bastard.

425
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:36,520
But then Crazy White Sean, his performance involved in part, not necessarily in this order, and this is all true, friends,

426
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:48,660
drinking his urine, which was demonstrably his, eating worms and cockroaches, lining his penile and lips with mousetraps,

427
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,720
making a pincushion of his face and then blowing wine out the holes in his cheeks.

428
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,480
Stapling his...

429
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,700
His...

430
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Sack to his belly.

431
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,640
And stapling notes to his forehead.

432
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:09,760
Well, my grandfather used to staple his sack to his belly on the way home so he would not, you know, lose the procedure and have to go through configuration again.

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,900
Well, I just have never seen anybody do this before in, you know, modern times.

434
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,540
This guy, Crazy White Sean...

435
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,880
I mean...

436
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,460
Of crazywhiteshawn.com, if you don't believe me,

437
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,320
would suck live worms into his nose and then let them kind of...

438
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,700
Crawl live, still alive, out of his mouth.

439
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,080
He could work them in and out of his sinuses like that.

440
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,560
Well, that guy's old.

441
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
They do intestinal gags now.

442
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,900
Swinging billiard balls on chains.

443
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,060
You're right.

444
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,040
Actually, the real...

445
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,940
At the big devivals, we do the...

446
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:49,840
They open their guts up and let people play with their bowels and stuff, like you're saying, and palpate the liver.

447
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,080
Yeah, well, they say...

448
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,840
They're still beating hard in the audience's hand.

449
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,880
They say that a lot of those people are plants.

450
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,840
Anyway, I'm sorry.

451
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,800
The ones that, you know, come up and fondle the organs.

452
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,640
That's so to speak, yeah.

453
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
Speaking of plants...

454
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,560
Like vegetables, right?

455
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,640
The, um...

456
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,360
Some people don't understand what the cannabis cup is.

457
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,340
And, uh...

458
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,980
What a segue.

459
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,720
When you spend your $175 or whatever for a ticket,

460
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,640
they don't...

461
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,640
You don't sit at a big table with other judges and have silver goblets of bud brought to you.

462
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,200
No.

463
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,240
You have to...

464
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,660
You have to walk from coffee shop to coffee shop,

465
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,020
buy the contestant samples by the gram,

466
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,600
and judge smoke them,

467
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,140
and then pretend that you're turning in some kind of a ballot,

468
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,080
but in fact, all the winners are already picked.

469
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,660
It was G13 Hayes from Barney's this year, I think, was the top prize for those guys.

470
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,940
That's a true name now?

471
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,980
This is not a...

472
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,560
That's a Barney's Hayes-y thing?

473
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,420
Barney's G13 Hayes was the top winner, I think,

474
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:55,980
uh, what?

475
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,620
Princess Wee, I can't remember the...

476
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,260
Some of the other...

477
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,600
There's Blue Cheese was a good one this year.

478
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,580
These are real pot labels, by the way.

479
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,740
These are things that they call marijuana these days.

480
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,340
Amnesia Hayes.

481
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,080
The aptly named, uh, Amnesia Hayes.

482
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,180
But why a...

483
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,600
Isolator, because it's made with ice.

484
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,100
Well, I would think you would be very paranoid and sit in a corner while everyone else was also sitting in a different corner.

485
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,760
Now, where did the name Blue Cheese come from?

486
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,280
Is it like Blue Cheer being funny?

487
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,880
Or do you actually start smelling it?

488
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,980
Because it smells sort of like smegma.

489
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,580
Smegma.

490
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,880
The, um...

491
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,740
Now, this is all kid's stuff, though.

492
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,220
Princess Wee and I didn't...

493
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,480
We watched...

494
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,900
It was fun, actually, to go through the Canem's Cup and watch all this stuff.

495
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,540
But we didn't mess with that kid's stuff because we had to save our blood cells and brain cells for the Frop Cup.

496
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
And, uh...

497
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,300
Which was just amazing.

498
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,120
And I have a list of winners here of the Subgenius Frop Cup in Amsterdam.

499
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:04,260
Can I just say that I heard, as a rumor, before you read the names of the beauteous ones, that the Prime Minister of France, Sarkozylgian...

500
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,460
Yeah.

501
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,240
Put on a funny...

502
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,980
Sarcophagus.

503
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,860
Sarcophagus.

504
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,940
Put on a funny mustache and a wig so that he could attend the Frop judging.

505
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,040
All those Bilderberger guys were there.

506
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,540
In fact, we were at the Suzanne Bilderberger Gallery.

507
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,160
Had a big party for all the Bilderbergers and Burger Beisters.

508
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,140
Where CFR says...

509
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm not kidding.

510
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,400
Country fried...

511
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,880
You think I'm kidding?

512
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,540
I'm actually not kidding.

513
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,140
And those things did happen.

514
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,200
But, uh...

515
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,200
Yes, we...

516
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Let me list some of the winners here from the Frop Cup.

517
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,540
And these were all judged by subgeniuses.

518
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,980
Humans can't even handle this stuff.

519
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,960
The number one top winner was Super Jenkum Hayes.

520
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,100
Super Jenkum Hayes.

521
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,260
I don't know that brand.

522
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,640
From Zandy Smith's Laboratories.

523
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,060
Limburger Skunk.

524
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,660
Was second place.

525
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,740
And Bloody Cough Mist...

526
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,300
Ha.

527
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Was, I think, third place.

528
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:10,700
There was a special prize given to a strain called Former Genius Afghani.

529
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,760
And I think Bleepo Abernathy won with Candy Frappy Skunk Stool.

530
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,260
Now, was that a windowsill variety of the stool?

531
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,660
Was the stool a windowsill variety of stool?

532
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,420
No, it's outdoor.

533
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,020
Oh, okay.

534
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,700
I think it was outdoor.

535
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,660
Those are hard to keep track of, usually.

536
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:33,640
There was a Dutch one that was really good called Niederlobotomy, or Nederlobotomy.

537
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,000
I never was sure how to pronounce that.

538
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,180
I think, yeah.

539
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,600
See, Screaming Skull, Mind Crash, Hash, Brain Poo, Haze.

540
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,440
You're forgetting the Silver Schizo.

541
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,380
Yeah, Silver Schizo, Screaming Skull.

542
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,220
Mr. Nothinghead was...

543
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,780
That was a name.

544
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,560
Actually, I can't remember.

545
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,100
Mr. Nothinghead just zoned me.

546
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,480
Bionic Manson was popular, I think, just because of the name.

547
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,360
Probably, yeah.

548
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,620
You know, character recognition and reference thing.

549
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,500
And Black Trainwreck.

550
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,160
I forget who grew that.

551
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,060
Or I should say, I forget which Yeti dropped the fertilizer it was grown on,

552
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,460
or which Dead Tibetan Holy Man's grave it was grown on.

553
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,340
Yeah, you did say...

554
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,860
Because these are all grown on certain...

555
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Like, there's a Tibetan guy named Krunt.

556
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,380
Certain deaths, actually.

557
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,500
Certain dead guys, actually, you know.

558
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,400
Kimo Krunt Flash is grown on that Krunt's, Llama Krunt's grave.

559
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,960
Now, what was that necrohighlight?

560
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,300
I don't remember.

561
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,020
I mean, by definition.

562
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
That is a problem with...

563
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,880
Yeah, that's why you can't...

564
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,160
It's the one you least remember is the winner.

565
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,420
How was the Bloody Mist?

566
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,640
Well, you know, it was...

567
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Mint Mist.

568
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,580
But there's no recollection.

569
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,700
There's nothing left to hang on to recollection.

570
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,000
It's all dripping out of your ears now.

571
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,400
Oh, goo-goo on the head, spinning around.

572
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,360
That was the Bloody Lung Mist, or Bloody Cough Mist.

573
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,700
Now, speaking of bloody lungs,

574
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,720
Lunk, you know, is another category that got prizes.

575
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,400
There was Ice Lunk, which is...

576
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,700
Do you know what Lunk is?

577
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,460
Oh, it's the...

578
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,000
It's the...

579
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,000


580
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,580
It's the silly person who won't do his job.

581
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,180
Okay, say somebody's a heavy fropper.

582
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,160
Oh, he's a Lunk.

583
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
When they die...

584
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,820
You big Lunk.

585
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,540
When they die, the other people who are in the Lunk Club

586
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,820
get to smoke the scrapings from the lungs of a heavy smoker who has died.

587
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,820
It's lung junk.

588
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,160
It's like squeezing a frog's butt.

589
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,220
Right, but it's...

590
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,860
It used to be that you just, you know...

591
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,920
Like I'm in the club.

592
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,340
When I die, she'll...

593
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,360
Whichever one of us dies first...

594
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,600
Yeah.

595
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:53,920
...we get a scrap.

596
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,520
Yeah, I've seen your tag.

597
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,760
But we got...

598
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
They've made this Ice Lunk,

599
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,140
where they can make a Lunk more powerful

600
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,980
and get ten times as much, you know, whatever off of it.

601
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,680
Do they freeze dry at first,

602
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,160
or is it the Lunk is just from the usage?

603
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,900
I don't know, but I met the old lady who invented the process.

604
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,220
Wow.

605
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,520
Mila Bella or something like that,

606
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,480
and she was...

607
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,780
Doc Frop is a big fan of hers.

608
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,300
Is she also a Dutch sword?

609
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,240
Oh, they have Lunk oil,

610
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,720
which smells awful, but is...

611
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,380
You know, you put a little bit of it on a...

612
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,260
Dead person, and it will raise the dead.

613
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,960
And then sniff it, and it's better than Jenkum.

614
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,960
Death Lunk Hash,

615
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
which is...

616
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,240
I guess what that is, is like they...

617
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,240
They find people who've only smoked...

618
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,020
fresh,

619
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,240
and then scrape that from their lungs.

620
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,380
But it's not...

621
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,000
They can't use anybody who's been mixing it,

622
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,960
you know, with like tobacco or pot or anything.

623
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
It has to be pure.

624
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,260
Yeah, I thought, you know,

625
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,420
frash is real delicate.

626
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,140
Anyway.

627
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,840
So, I think that's...

628
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,780
Oh, blue brain damage was one of them.

629
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,980
Oh, I found...

630
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,840
Oh, Time Warp Mania dub.

631
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,340
Funny names.

632
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,000
So, does that one actually work?

633
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
Hey, speaking of funny names,

634
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
at the Cannabis Cup, there was one...

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,220
This is honestly true.

636
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,140
There was one called Princess Bob.

637
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,220
Indica.

638
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
Princess Bob Indica.

639
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,820
Well, what you're saying is that they changed genders

640
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,200
during the hydroponic procedure.

641
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,160
And that's the same thing they do with some of the frop

642
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,340
and some of the llama's graves.

643
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,800
They just change the light to like an organ blue light,

644
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,900
and it makes it more...

645
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,040
It'll change it from...

646
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,280
...digestible.

647
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,220
And I'm sorry, what?

648
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,260
Well, I think...

649
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,480
And they cross them, too.

650
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,540
They'll like crossbreed and make these hybrids,

651
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,860
where something is part pineapple death star

652
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,120
and part of its sonic death star.

653
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,160
And then they'll just boom sativa.

654
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,540
Man, if we could just remember what they felt like.

655
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,800
I know.

656
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,420
Well, but if you could,

657
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,400
you know you got ripped off.

658
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,000
If you could remember it,

659
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,160
you'd know it wasn't any good.

660
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,860
But if there was some way we could like,

661
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,960
you know, put some sort of memory device

662
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,900
or something in our brain that would record it

663
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,880
so we could view it afterwards, you know, after the...

664
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm sure that the RIAA will figure out a way to do that.

665
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,140
The record...

666
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,960
American Record Industry of America?

667
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,540
Right.

668
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh, okay.

669
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,280
They're ahead on spy techniques.

670
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,860
They're ahead of almost everybody, except the Chinese.

671
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,440
Well, that's because the Chinese are married into the British family now.

672
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,900
Well, and they're Chinese.

673
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,020
Well, no, they're part bird, too,

674
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,120
if you want to really, you know, get way, way, way back

675
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,780
about nine million years ago.

676
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,460
Or no, it was nine billion...

677
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,380
Nine was in there somewhere.

678
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,920
Well, we all were part bird back in the...

679
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,820
Oh, yeah.

680
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,980
Oh, yeah.

681
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,480
Only a little part, though.

682
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,700
Well, you don't want to be the littlest part

683
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,060
of the little part of the bird.

684
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,600
What's the word?

685
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,640
The bird is the word?

686
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,260
The bird.

687
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,640
Speaking of...

688
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,840
You know, you can talk about all your blueberry haze

689
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,120
and your super bubblegum stuff,

690
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,620
but there ain't nothing like a big old bottle

691
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,220
of Thunderbird wine from Modesto, California.

692
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,160
Yeah.

693
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,340
America's fine.

694
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,420
Aperitif wine.

695
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,320
Yeah, it's fine.

696
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,680
You can get it in the 12%...

697
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
You can get it in the 12% blue bottle

698
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,880
or your 19% red bottle.

699
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,560
Yeah, the red's always the one I win for.

700
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,420
No kidding, buddy.

701
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,980
Beat the damn bejesus out of white port and lemon juice.

702
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,400
That's the silliest damn drink any girl ever drank.

703
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,200
You need a red tea bird.

704
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,440
That's what you need, you know,

705
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,880
and then you wink three times and your eye falls out.

706
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,060
Thunderbird.

707
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,000
Serve very cold.

708
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,880
I actually just recited, I think,

709
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,560
all of the words on the label of the Thunderbird bottle.

710
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,860
I used to do that back when I was a kid.

711
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,080
You needed to...

712
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,040
I drank a lot of bottles of Thunderbird,

713
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,680
and that's why I'm the way you see me now.

714
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,020
I'm 25 years old, and look at me.

715
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,740
It looks more like 52, if you know what I mean.

716
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,400
Backwards.

717
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,760
25 is backwards, man.

718
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,920
And on those tea bird bottles,

719
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,340
do they also have the substantial alien gum?

720
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,040
Or any of the other, you know,

721
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,340
you may lose your body dust,

722
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,120
discorporated at any time?

723
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,140
I don't know.

724
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,140
Those used to come with a great comic book

725
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,520
on the inside label.

726
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,760
You know, once you drank the bottle,

727
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,240
you could read it through the bottle.

728
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,480
And there was some lantern jarred guy.

729
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,580
It was Hand Grenade Joe or something.

730
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,060
Hand Grenade Joe.

731
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,340
Yeah, Hand Grenade Joe and his little sidekick.

732
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,440
And Popeye Fishman.

733
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,120
Yeah, that's his name.

734
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,180
He was a short guy, kind of funny, you know.

735
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,100
Funny looking, I can't remember.

736
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,420
They never made any sense,

737
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,360
but that was the charm of it.

738
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,540
Yeah, especially when you can't get it out.

739
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,820
You got to that last drop.

740
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,900
You know, you kind of could make,

741
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,660
just come up with the lyrics as you wanted,

742
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,900
you know, as you pleased.

743
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,780
There was a rumor that Ernie Bushmiller

744
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,120
did the Hand Grenade Joe comics

745
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,560
on the inside label of the Thunderbird bottles.

746
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,680
You know, the guy did Nancy comics.

747
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Remember Nancy?

748
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,420
It was pre-Zippy surrealism.

749
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,840
Yeah.

750
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,720
See, that's how I could get confused.

751
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,620
I thought you were going to say Anheuser-Busch

752
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,020
or George Bush or something,

753
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
but I see there was no Bush in there.

754
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,360
Man, you know, George Bush is so awful

755
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,260
that I actually miss his grandfather,

756
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,300
Emperor Anheuser-Busch.

757
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,380
I mean, I never thought the day would come

758
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,140
when it was like, man,

759
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,540
George W. is so bad.

760
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,380
George Bush would be,

761
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,320
George Bush the first would be better.

762
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,080
Anheuser-Busch would be better.

763
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,840
Anheuser-Busch would be best for all of us,

764
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,500
or could be,

765
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,080
but this is not a commercial station,

766
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,360
but that's a real man,

767
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,000
well, if you want to call him a man,

768
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,380
that's a real corporate being,

769
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,340
or corporal.

770
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,440
Did I say that?

771
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,560
Corporal, real being's name.

772
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,020
I miss Nixon's head.

773
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,200
I miss the smell of his feet.

774
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
I'd save his brain if I could.

775
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,640
I'd save Nixon's brain if I could

776
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,040
if I thought that would replace George Bush's.

777
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,740
You're not the only one, lad.

778
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,680
There's a lot of people in the basement here

779
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,600
who would like a good whiff of Nixon's brain.

780
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,180
Tasty.

781
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,800
It's like that Orson's ads are brought.

782
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,880
I know.

783
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,520
Have you ever huffed the Fuhrer's brain?

784
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,380
Have you ever taken the extra time

785
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,160
to sniff a good Fuhrer?

786
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,280
No.

787
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,280
Sit on your knees in a casual pose.

788
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,360
Now appear very formal.

789
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,040
Remember, you're wearing a suit for a Fuhrer.

790
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,980
I'm all formal now.

791
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,240
A suit of cards.

792
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
You're the ace of ducks.

793
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,560
Now bend over and smell the Fuhrer's brain.

794
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,720
Ah!

795
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,240
Ah!

796
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,600
Ha ha!

797
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
Uber stench!

798
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,180
Uber stench!

799
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,280
Let me smell.

800
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,560
Smell.

801
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,400
Smell the Fuhrer's brain.

802
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,420
Max smell!

803
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,440
Max smell!

804
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,760
Max, please sit down.

805
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,120
Max smell!

806
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
It's only a demonstration.

807
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,080
And this is only a puff of what?

808
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,080
And only a gun in my hand.

809
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,160
It's not a real gun.

810
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,740
It's a...

811
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,480
beat handgun.

812
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,680
But it will still shoot you and kill you.

813
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,440
It's a gun from Dobbs!

814
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,860
Oh, I don't think it's a real gun from Dobbs.

815
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,060
They'll kill you if you have a toy gun.

816
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,940
They'll give you a medal if it's a real gun.

817
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,000
Princess Wee, do you remember having the rice table meal like Dave suggested?

818
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,020
Remember?

819
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,400
You're not allowed to use that word with me.

820
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,800
You know, remember?

821
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,380
Remember?

822
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:48,160
No, we went to the rice table restaurant, but we didn't get the rice table.

823
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,400
Lonesome Princess Dave.

824
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,760
It's true though, Lonesome Princess Dave.

825
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,680
You had suggested that...

826
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,220
You said, go to the Malaysian restaurant and have the rice table.

827
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,940
Well, that's what I heard was really, really swinging and Amsterdam-er.

828
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,640
Well, we saw...

829
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,000
We went by a place called Indonesian Restaurant.

830
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,740
I think that was the name of it.

831
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,280
How creative.

832
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,660
And they had a poster outside for the rice table.

833
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,480
And we ran in and then did not order the rice table.

834
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,460
But we saw the pictures of the rice table, just so you know.

835
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
It's exorbitantly large, right?

836
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,380
It was a bunch of bowls. It was a bunch of stuff.

837
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,640
But we had a bunch of other stuff.

838
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,100
Of equal quantity?

839
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,100
I think we had grüntesupp.

840
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,020
Grüntersupp?

841
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,220
Grüntersupp.

842
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,360
Was ist Grüntersupp?

843
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,100
Das Grüntersupp is like the drugs.

844
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,420
In the Badkammer.

845
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,440
I remember everything from every meal from every restaurant.

847
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I can tell you what everybody ate.

848
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,280
Every single one.

849
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,300
Governor Ragnar had duck.

850
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,500
That's right. He always had duck.

851
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,600
He had duck. That's easy to remember.

852
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,640
Ragnar wouldn't eat anything but duck.

853
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:58,720
Mmm.

854
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,160
But duck is very tender.

855
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,540
But duck was at the Indonesian place?

856
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,540
No, but duck was some stuff we smoked.

857
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,240
Oh.

858
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,980
Mixed with the Jack Harer.

859
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,840
We met Jack Harer, who for you non-pot smokers out there like ourselves.

860
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,140
Such a real name.

861
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,080
Pot connoisseurs would go,

862
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,680
Oh my God, you met Jack Harer?

863
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,500
Here's the interesting thing.

864
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,040
I didn't know what Jack Harer looked like or sounded like.

865
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,400
He's a guy that invented some real powerful drugs.

866
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,180
And he wrote a book.

867
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,400
He wrote a book called The Emperor Wears No Clothes,

868
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,300
which is a good history of the illegalization of hemp, etc.

869
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,400
Anyway, this is a guy that really smokes a lot of pot.

870
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,880
And he talks like this.

871
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,120
His voice is like this.

872
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,400
So I thought that figures.

873
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,720
If you were going to be a serious professional pot smoker,

874
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,500
that your voice would turn into a gravel pit.

875
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,480
He earned that voice.

876
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,800
Which mine seems to be doing right now.

877
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,160
Does he have indeed sarcophagi in his throat then?

878
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,900
Has he pushed this healthy drug into a non-healthy thing?

879
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,220
Or is he just has a, you know, a wispy voice?

880
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
He probably smokes cigarettes too.

881
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,980
I don't know.

882
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,460
I don't know nothing about it.

883
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,560
For a long, long, long time.

884
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,580
I do know that Christmas is coming.

885
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,180
And in Netherland, Neanderthal lands,

886
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,360
they have a different tradition than Santa Claus here.

887
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,320
They call it, actually our Santa Claus is based on.

888
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,660
Sinterklaas.

889
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,620
Sinterklaas.

890
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,140
Sinterklaas.

891
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,280
Sinterklaas.

892
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,120
And instead of a bunch of little elves,

893
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,200
he has a bunch of little Moors or Ethiopians,

894
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,360
depending on how you look at it.

895
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,420
But they're very, his main one is called Black Peter.

896
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,920
Well, that's a, that's a disturbance.

897
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,200
Have you ever heard of Black Peter?

898
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,320
That is a disease.

899
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,500
I've heard, I've heard a lot about Black Peter myself,

900
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,820
but this is somebody's name.

901
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,920
Although I thought it was by the necroprosis of the peanuts.

902
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,940
P-I-T-E-R.

903
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,740
Peter.

904
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,260
Peter.

905
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,400
Black Peter.

906
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:03,860
Black Peter.

907
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Or Schwarzpeter.

908
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,360
Schwarzpeter.

909
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:06,560


910
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,220
Is I think his name there.

911
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,300
Schwarzpeter.

912
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,640
Schwarzpeter.

913
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,840
And the funny thing is though that he's,

914
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,660
they have these graphic illustrations of him.

915
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,160
There's all these Santa, Sinterklaas,

916
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,880
who looks pretty much like Santa Claus.

917
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,040
But Black Peter is depicted in a way that is not offensive,

918
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,360
apparently in Europe,

919
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,860
but in the United States where we have this past unpleasant history.

920
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,720
He's wearing lipstick, right?

921
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,460
He's, yeah.

922
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,860
He's like something out of an old R. Crumb comic

923
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,760
that nobody got and got very angry about.

924
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,540
He's like something out of an old Max Fleischer cartoon

925
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,100
that they don't show anymore because you know.

926
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,920
He's like something out of a Tarzan movie that makes you go,

927
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,960
oh, no wonder they don't show those Tarzan movies anymore.

928
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,600
Yes, they don't show his fine garb.

929
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,620
They just show a lot of lipstick and rouge and mascara.

930
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,980
But in the context of the Netherlandish history,

931
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,640
there's apparently nobody gets terribly upset about Black Peter.

932
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:13,600
But he's about as PC as our Clevelandian brave smiling head,

933
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,520
Chief Wahoo or.

934
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,380
You know, that's an interesting thing that you brought up,

935
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:24,840
Chief Wahoo, because I just heard recently on the Racial Epithet Network.

936
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,660
Yeah.

937
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,600
It was a right wing talk show guy.

938
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,740
He said Indians love me and I love Indians.

939
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,200
And then he went on to explain why it was so good that we won.

940
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
Meaning, I guess his uncle, Jerry.

941
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,640
I don't know the actual guy, you know,

942
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,440
like if he was related to custard or any of those famous snakes in the garments.

943
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,500
He was saying that it was icons, you know, back in the day.

944
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Anyway, well, you know, I suppose the Native Americans probably could have kept the invaders out.

945
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,360
Had they quit fighting amongst themselves?

946
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,780
Or if they had automatic weapons, it would have been better.

947
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,340
And that is the lesson for all people who are being invaded.

948
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,040
Quit fighting with your neighbor and fight the big enemy.

949
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,840
Subgeniuses, quit fighting each other and fight against poverty.

950
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,840
Yeah, that's it.

951
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:22,200
Fight against poverty so that you can get rich and have lots of money and buy donations to this station.

952
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,380
That's it.

953
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,620
Yes, but subgeniuses.

954
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,760
I almost said the wrong thing.

955
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,340
But subgeniuses cannot enjoy poverty.

956
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:29,340


957
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:36,000
Because their lifestyle requires a high configuration when you go through a relapse or something.

958
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,180
Or if you keep having different parts removed.

959
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:39,920
Right.

960
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,900
What if you have like the whole bottom part of your torso is like exchanged, as we like to say,

961
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,260
you know, with some sort of celestial being.

962
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,440
What do you mean, what if?

963
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,320
Well, I mean, you know, once it's done.

964
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,380
Last time, you mean.

965
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,140
And then you're like, you know, a T-bird drinking bum, you know, looking around in dumpsters for something.

966
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,140
Right, right.

967
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,800
And so what does it all avail you?

968
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,220
I mean, what does avail mean?

969
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,160
Oh, what is it?

970
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,580
Okay.

971
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,840
But that's just, that's the way I saw it.

972
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,480
I was cross-eyed at the time and I was also pinching different nerves.

973
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,360
The karma, the Burma and the Dharma nerve, which makes things go backwards too.

974
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,820
But not like Dobbs does it.

975
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,120
Nah, he's.

976
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,380
I don't know.

977
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,240
He fat, spelled P-H-A-T.

978
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,820
That's old school, but it still stands true.

979
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,280
Uh huh.

980
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:25,980
Uh huh.

981
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,660
Ah ha!

982
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah!

983
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,180
You know what?

984
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,360
You know what?

985
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,560
Uh, Reverend Joseph Daddy of Jesus went to Fez, Morocco and bought Fez's.

986
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,480
Oh, I thought you.

987
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,480
And gave us, gave, gave, and gave me, brought back a Fez and gave me a Fez and he gave Dr.

988
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,420
Howell a Fez.

989
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,880
Oh, Howell has a fine collection of Fez's.

990
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,360
Right.

991
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:50,820
I actually had a Schreiner Fez myself, but a Fez, a Moroccan Fez is not quite the same as a Schreiner Fez.

992
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,800
They're cooler, aren't they?

993
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,900
They're shorter.

994
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,880
They're squatter.

995
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,120
Yeah, they're more squat and they don't usually have eyeballs.

996
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,520
balls

997
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,360
emblemized on them.

998
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,640
Or naked women or anything else.

999
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,160
Like mine do.

1000
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,760
You have an eyeball on yours?

1001
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,740
Hal has an eyeball on his and mine has

1002
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,860
naked women on it.

1003
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,480
Oh, you got a naked lady on your dress?

1004
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,040
Well, it was Dallas Shriner group I got from.

1005
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,740
I thought yours said hell.

1006
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:16,580
No, the Masons.

1007
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,480
They're into group sex, orgies and all that.

1008
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,520
Baby sacrifice.

1009
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,420
Haven't you been reading the internet?

1010
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,200
I didn't know you actually had to read the internet.

1011
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,360
I thought you just sat there.

1012
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,600
You don't anymore.

1013
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,440
As of this week, everything on the internet is now a movie.

1014
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,120
It's all YouTube and it's TV.

1015
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,180
That would take care of a lot of problems.

1016
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,920
You can't upload.

1017
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,140
It's back to TV.

1018
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,320
Birds, sycophants, non-readers,

1019
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,040
excremeditators.

1020
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,220
You know, all these different people who have no real

1021
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,040
reason to sit down

1022
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
and study an object.

1023
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,760
They can just clarify it in their own mind and say

1024
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,440
this is it or it isn't. It doesn't exist.

1025
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:53,860
Mm-hmm.

1026
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,320
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,180
Princess Wee, do you remember your favorite shop

1028
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,300
on Calverstrat?

1029
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:00,640
Wee.

1030
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,860
She does remember it.

1031
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,640
It was a shop called Wee.

1032
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,840
W-E.

1033
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,480
They forgot the I.

1034
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,980
We met a French lady named Marie.

1035
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,880
And when Princess Wee told her her name,

1036
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
she went, oh, so you're the opposite

1037
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,720
of Princess No.

1038
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,080
Oh, Princess Wee-Wee?

1039
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,740
She said that?

1040
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,980
She said, oh, no, no, no, Wee, Wee, Wee.

1041
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,600
Well,

1042
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,040
that Marie, what a punner.

1043
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,240
Actually, that woman would have been good on this show.

1044
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,240
Yes, she was.

1045
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,740
English was not her first language,

1046
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,340
but she was an unrepentant

1047
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,320
punster, or punstress,

1048
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,900
as I suppose you might say.

1049
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,460
A punita, sometimes they say when they tie you up

1050
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,180
and smack you.

1051
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,080
Is that the Spanish, the punita?

1052
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,140
No, that's more like when they put you in a dark room

1053
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,960
and they have to wear, like, big, long hats,

1054
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,840
red hats and feathers and stuff,

1055
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,960
and then they squeeze and twist.

1056
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,700
That's, you know, the punishment idea.

1057
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,660
I am a punero.

1058
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,740
A puniero?

1059
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,280
No, not puniero.

1060
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,220
That's come together.

1061
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,120
I'll kill you for saying that.

1062
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,560
A punero.

1063
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,820
A punero does it with...

1064
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,440
A punero is like a caballero,

1065
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,360
like a horseman, only it's a punman.

1066
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,620
Oh, it rides a pun.

1067
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,460
You know what a pun is, or a pun.

1068
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,280
It's a play on words.

1069
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:12,720
Right.

1070
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,240
Like Joe Smell.

1071
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,680
I pun.

1072
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,340
You know, like you download from I pun,

1073
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,120
you get these word plays.

1074
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,900
Well, most of them are dirty also.

1075
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,680
I mean, not physically dirty,

1076
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,600
but they're salacious in nature.

1077
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,020
Most puns are.

1078
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,440
I mean, just think of Fonda,

1079
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,520
you know, when you were in school.

1080
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,600
That's...

1081
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,640
We shouldn't go there.

1082
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,180
No.

1083
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:33,620
No.

1084
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,360
No, no, no.

1085
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,280
No.

1086
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:36,680
No.

1087
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,720
We should go instead to the Vondelpark.

1088
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,180
Not the Fondal room.

1089
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,900
Yes, let's go to the Vondelpark.

1090
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,980
Is it a real or virtual...

1091
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,500
We'll go wandering in the wonderful Vondelpark.

1092
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,700
Is it a virtual...

1093
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,820
Was it a virtual park?

1094
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,940
And we have some of the worst waffles there.

1095
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,060
Oh, bad waffles?

1096
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:52,560
Waffles.

1097
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,380
No, no, worse.

1098
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,540
Not bad.

1099
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,720
They're very good.

1100
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,600
Sausage waffles?

1101
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,440
The worst waffles are very good.

1102
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,520
Yes, that's the brand name, Dave, is worse.

1103
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,260
It's V-E-R-S-E.

1104
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,320
Worse.

1105
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,760
So it's worse waffles.

1106
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,140
Yeah, waffles.

1107
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,960
W-A-F-E-L-S.

1108
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:15,380
Death to the Dutch for confusing their W's and V's like that.

1109
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,560
Princess, we and I have the most fun reading Dutch labels

1110
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,380
because the words are funny.

1111
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,840
They all sound funny.

1112
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:23,840


1113
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,340
They all sound like American curse words.

1114
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,080
You know, we got...

1115
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,980
You pinterkass, you.

1116
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,560
Pindekass.

1117
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,320
Yeah, that's a pindekass.

1118
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,260
You pindekass, you.

1119
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,360
What's a pindekass?

1120
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,160
Peanut butter.

1121
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,340
Oh, you peanut butter.

1122
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,080
You pindekass.

1123
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,380
Actually, it's the cheese of the peanut because kass is cheese.

1124
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,720
So it's like peanut cheese, yes.

1125
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,860
Oh, my God.

1126
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,220
Pindekass.

1127
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,440
You're our pindekass.

1128
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,860
Well, not always.

1129
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,020
Sometimes it's simple.

1130
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,740
What a bizarre group of little Hitlers.

1131
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,380
They should smack them right in the desire to see.

1132
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,760
They killed Frank and they were proud.

1133
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,120
They were proud of it.

1134
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,160
Each and every one of them.

1135
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,360
Their ice skates and their foreheads and...

1136
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,540
I remember I came up with an idea for a movie last night.

1137
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,640
After Matt Greinig stole all my ideas, I came up with a new idea.

1138
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,900
Greinig is a Dutch name, Stan.

1139
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,420
Greinig is a Dutch name.

1140
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,060
Greinigsip.

1141
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,520
Greinigsip.

1142
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,380
Yeah.

1143
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,820
Oh, and oh, speaking of Dutch names, our friend Orton Nenslow, the subgenius,

1144
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,740
his real name is Ken DeVries.

1145
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,020
Okay, I know that's Dutch.

1146
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,760
Okay, well, he's therefore related.

1147
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:23,840
He's related.

1148
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:23,840


1149
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:23,840


1150
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:23,840


1151
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,900
He's related to a woman named Vera DeVries, whose house we had a big dinner at.

1152
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,720
In fact, Rocknar and Dr. Howell stayed there.

1153
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,520
But you know her as Xaviera Hollander.

1154
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:36,840
Oh.

1155
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,560
Xaviera Hollander is a subgenius.

1156
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,640
So it would be like if you decided to become a prostitute, you would call yourself Reverend

1157
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,760
Ivan American.

1158
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,400
The happy...

1159
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,980
The happy...

1160
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:48,680
Schnooker.

1161
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,240
Leg Humper.

1162
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,020
The happy Schnooker.

1163
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,840
Yeah, Xaviera Hollander, for those of you who don't know her, she's a woman who's been

1164
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:53,940
doing a lot of work in the United States, but she's also a woman who's been doing a lot of

1165
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:53,940


1166
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,820
She's a woman who, who are ignorant, wrote a book.

1167
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:05,420
She was actually the most successful madam in New York City in the late 60s and early

1168
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:05,960
70s.

1169
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:13,720
She wrote a book about her experiences servicing and providing for rich and powerful figures

1170
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,900
in world history.

1171
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,380
It's called The Happy Hooker and several sequels.

1172
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,180
It was such a big deal.

1173
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,600
Did you ever read The Happy Hooker?

1174
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,380
Stang.

1175
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,340
You should have.

1176
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,040
I would bring up the fact that you know that back in those days I was a very wealthy young

1177
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,920
man and I traveled in those circles.

1178
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,260
Oh, so you already knew Vera.

1179
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,360
And the nose piercing and also the bladder enslavement and the...

1180
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,600
You know that a lot of the quotes in that book...

1181
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,700
You probably helped Xaviera write her book.

1182
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,700
I was the research dodo.

1183
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,300
I was the dummy box.

1184
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,080
That explains a lot.

1185
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,740
I was the surface area of a cube.

1186
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,680
That explains everything.

1187
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,040
Yep.

1188
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,320
Lonesome Cowboy.

1189
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,460
Lonesome Cowboy.

1190
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,340
Dave and Xavier Hollander together again.

1191
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,600
Well, I wasn't there.

1192
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,000
Mysteries unfurled before us.

1193
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,140
Starring...

1194
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,780
Let's see who...

1195
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,620
Now, who played...

1196
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,560
Xavier was played in three different movies.

1197
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:14,380
She was played by Joey Heatherton, Lynn Redgrave, and Martine Beswick.

1198
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,420
I don't remember the Martine Beswick one.

1199
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,340
I think that was after the short-sighted.

1200
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,240
But who played you?

1201
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,060
What was that guy who played you in those movies?

1202
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,720
It was that bald-headed guy that's in those Die Hard...

1203
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,260
What's his name?

1204
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,400
Dr. Phil.

1205
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,740
No, no, no, no.

1206
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,000
The Die Hard movie guy.

1207
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,760
What's his name?

1208
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:32,700
That bald-headed guy?

1209
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,140
Oh, Die Hard.

1210
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,280
Die Hard Smith or something.

1211
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,860
Yeah, Mr. Knuckles.

1212
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:38,980
Clint Eastwood?

1213
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,040
No, no.

1214
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,560
You know, Mr. Knuckles.

1215
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,500
He's like a real right-wing type of guy.

1216
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,540
Actually, Clint Eastwood could play Dave now.

1217
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,460
Clint looks...

1218
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,660
Clint and Dave look...

1219
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,140
Clint's about 70 years older than Dave, but they look about the same.

1220
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:53,320
Clint Eastwood?

1221
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1222
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,760
It's not tall enough to play Dave.

1223
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,060
He's an Easterner, too, by the way, Sting.

1224
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:57,800
I'd like to...

1225
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,140
Clint Eastwood is?

1226
00:48:59,320 --> 00:48:59,460
Yeah.

1227
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,140
Oh, no wonder he's got that name.

1228
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,000
Ivy League.

1229
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,060
Cornwell.

1230
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,560
Prince of Poopo.

1231
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,320
Really?

1232
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:07,780
Yeah.

1233
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,460
Is that so?

1234
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,220
I don't think it's so, but that's true.

1235
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:11,880
It's true.

1236
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,160
Okay.

1237
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,500
Prince of Poopo?

1238
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,680
We were talking about bees before.

1239
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,900
Who wouldn't play Dave in a movie?

1240
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,060
Oh, man, I keep on forgetting that bald-headed guy's face again.

1241
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,300
Every time I hear his name in my mind...

1242
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,980
Bruce Willis.

1243
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,620
Bruce Willis.

1244
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:28,880
That's right.

1245
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,560
That's the guy, Bruce Willis.

1246
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,400
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1247
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,800
I won.

1248
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,700
But he was funny in the one where Alexander Graham Bell came back to life.

1249
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,900
Now, Mel Gibson did a pretty good job of playing you in Conspiracy Theory.

1250
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,780
He did a better job in Apocalyptic.

1251
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:46,900
Apocalyptic.

1252
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,280
He didn't act in that.

1253
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,300
He directed that.

1254
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,900
He was the invisible...

1255
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,640
Oh, I gotcha.

1256
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,520
No, seriously.

1257
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,660
Did you ever see Conspiracy Theory?

1258
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,640
I saw it.

1259
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,820
Didn't you, like, want to sue Mel Gibson for playing you?

1260
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,060
Well, he wasn't bald.

1261
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,340
He just had the same manners.

1262
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,260
He had the same hat.

1263
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:11,920
And he had this sort of way of talking in this excited way that was hard for his people to, you know, his fares to understand.

1264
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,280
And then he would say...

1265
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:13,560
I'm sorry.

1266
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,380
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,260
I remember he was feral.

1268
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,320
He was wild.

1269
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:16,980
Yeah.

1270
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,400
Yeah, he had to actually smell different.

1271
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,220
It was as if he'd been listening.

1272
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,800
He'd been doing research.

1273
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,740
He'd been doing research for the part by listening to Brain Rot Radio Theater.

1274
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,000
This was in the 90s.

1275
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:26,680
Well, don't...

1276
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,720
Didn't you just get done saying that the Radio Industry Association of America has a lot more power than you think it does?

1277
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,020
Well, yeah.

1278
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:40,860
And, you know, there's a CD of the surveillance that's on the web now.

1279
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,240
You can...

1280
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,860
They owe explanations to so many, but you'll never, ever, ever get them.

1281
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,080
They owe explanations to the many.

1282
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,880
And gravy to the few.

1283
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,020
The kind that you cook and liver and enjoy with a hot snack.

1284
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,360
Like that light going off in your head.

1285
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,000
That little light just went off in my head.

1286
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,880
That's a caramel-flavored light in your head.

1287
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,360
That means something sinister is coming.

1288
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,420
A lime light and a strawberry light.

1289
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,740
I'm sorry.

1290
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,220
Something sinister is coming?

1291
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,200
Yes, something sinister is coming.

1292
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,020
Soon.

1293
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,320
I thought that was the smell of new shoes.

1294
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,700
Do you remember the new shoe smell?

1295
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,380
I remember the new shoe smell.

1296
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,980
You know, when we were little girls.

1297
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,900
We'd go out with Mom and Dad and Uncle Fritz.

1298
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,560
He was really mean.

1299
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:34,080
But we'd go to the lounge afterwards and we'd just drink water or like Tinky Punch, they called it.

1300
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,960
And there'd be like a little Tinky bottle or glass.

1301
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,920
The smell of new shoes always reminds me of those punches.

1302
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,200
I know.

1303
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,980
Every time I...

1304
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,260
And my dad beating me.

1305
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,580
Punching and hitting me.

1306
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,820
He wasn't really beating you.

1307
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,240
He was just trying to execute you.

1308
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,660
He didn't know how to do it right, so he had to, you know, use his fists.

1309
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,560
If he had any brain, he would have just shot you, but...

1310
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,800
A little bit at a time, you know.

1311
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,960
Now, there's something like seven minutes to show end.

1312
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Is there anything important we needed to remember or do?

1313
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:13,800
We owe thanks to the listeners that paid their pledges and death to the ones who pledged but didn't ever pay.

1314
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,260
Unless they're planning to pay.

1315
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,100
Yeah, they're in the future.

1316
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,380
In which case, they can't die.

1317
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,860
And let's see.

1318
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,160
I'm going to...

1319
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:30,420
Oh, I'm going to be in San Francisco next week on Castro Street.

1320
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,960
Wearing a wig.

1321
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:40,940
I will be sleeping on Castro Street, but in Martinez, not in San Francisco, which is different.

1322
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:50,720
And, you know, because there's some sort of a devotional thing about Devo, but yet they're doing subgeniously things, too.

1323
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,320
And I...

1324
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,220
Does it have a name that you can't mention?

1325
00:52:53,220 --> 00:53:01,800
It's on December 8th on subgenius.com, if you really wanted to know, at the 12 Galaxies Club, I think.

1326
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,960
But like I say, that's an African brain virus, and we've got to be careful about the airport when that happens.

1327
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,040
Because it's over $1,000.

1328
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,680
Remember saying that's not the right...

1329
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,820
Which we got compensated because they overbooked the lobotomy lab.

1330
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,980
And we had to wait an hour and a half to get our lobotomies, and they paid us...

1331
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,760
Uh...

1332
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,700
$300.

1333
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,780
$300 each.

1334
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,700
For each...

1335
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,580
To compensate us for having to wait an hour and a half for our lobotomy.

1336
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,240
Can you believe it?

1337
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,880
This is a pretty good deal.

1338
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,720
$300 is like $500.

1339
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,780
Well, that's all...

1340
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,540
Well, by now, it's probably like about...

1341
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,600
Each suture costs...

1342
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,020
Or $700.

1343
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,160
There's another $700.

1344
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,700
That's how they do it, by the suture.

1345
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,120
Yeah, it goes...

1346
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,820
That's more bucks per euro per minute.

1347
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,740
That's the way it's working now.

1348
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,420
A homo sapien insecurity is what I call it.

1349
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,840
But then that's when they keep you at the airport so long that your body starts to decompose.

1350
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,500
And before they find out if you have any contraband...

1351
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,180
Are you kidding anywhere?

1352
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,500
It just pops out naturally with its own free will.

1353
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,500
You know what?

1354
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,840
I accidentally smuggled...

1355
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:04,100
Once again, I accidentally smuggled contraband into the United States without knowing I was doing it.

1356
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:04,960
Completely accidentally.

1357
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,480
I've done it going both ways.

1358
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,500
I've smuggled contraband into Holland and then discovered it.

1359
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,080
An orange.

1360
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:19,420
And I've smuggled contraband into the Americas without knowing it until I got home and unpacked and went,

1361
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,700
Good Lord!

1362
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:20,700


1363
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,660
If I'd known this, I could have carried 5,000 pounds of hashback and made a million bucks selling it to school kids.

1364
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,540
See, it just shows how much more laid back they are than the Californians.

1365
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,540
But I wouldn't do that.

1366
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,040
You know why?

1367
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,980
Because it would be wrong.

1368
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,500
Ah.

1369
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,840
When you go to California, they ask you if you have any fruits or vegetables and they mean,

1370
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,100
Are there any little children in your back seat?

1371
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:43,720
Right.

1372
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,320
Or under the back seat is what I meant to say.

1373
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,400
So why...

1374
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,540
What is the point of smuggling vegetables in California?

1375
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,140
It's not as if they have the lock on the deal.

1376
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,880
We all make our own vegetables.

1377
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,740
Yeah, but an orange in California costs like $7.50 now.

1378
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,180
For a single orange.

1379
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,100
For one orange, yeah.

1380
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,520
Well, you know...

1381
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,100
Well, here they're only like five bucks.

1382
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:05,520
Yeah.

1383
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,360
Well, I think once we get parity, economic parity with the Californians,

1384
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,200
then that will mean that somehow we're happier.

1385
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,360
And I think Dobbs couldn't have put it better.

1386
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,160
As long as you have economic parity with a parrot,

1387
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,900
adultery with an adult tree,

1388
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,180
you know, you can perform all kinds of functions in the new world.

1389
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,980
That's coming soon, I hope.

1390
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,400
Yes.

1391
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,060
Well said, Dave.

1392
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,440
I didn't think so.

1393
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,220
Or pedophilia with a foot.

1394
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,520
Well, there you go.

1395
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
I mean, why would you want to have pedophilia with anything?

1396
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,540
Oh, pedophilia.

1397
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,560
Yeah, pedophilia.

1398
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,020
With anything but a ped.

1399
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,820
Is that like a foot fetish?

1400
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,000
A fetish.

1401
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,120
Spelled F-O-E-T.

1402
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,480
No, foot fetish was...

1403
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:45,840
Footish.

1404
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,420
I think the greenhouse was selling that.

1405
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,260
Oh, okay.

1406
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,460
Or was it the grasshopper?

1407
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:50,900
I can't remember.

1408
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,400
Yeah, they were selling foot fetish hash.

1409
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,240
In Amsterdam.

1410
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,840
Which smelled just like old socks.

1411
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,380
So you knew it was going to be really good.

1412
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,940
Well, it was called skunk sock or something was where it was derived from.

1413
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:05,820
Well, I think that...

1414
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,620
Gym sock skunk hybrid, where they mix skunks.

1415
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,360
They managed to genetically engineer skunks that are crossed with gym socks.

1416
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:15,920
Yeah.

1417
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,340
And you smoke their jenkum.

1418
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,100
Yeah, after you don't...

1419
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,300
Do you know what jenkum is?

1420
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,700
It's the straining of the underwear of certain...

1421
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,460
You make it like a tea, right?

1422
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,320
Yeah, and you leave it in a jar for a long, long time, and then you whiff it.

1423
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,540
Oh, I thought you made it into a tea.

1424
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,400
And you see your ancestors.

1425
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,260
Oh, jeez, man.

1426
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,040
I didn't know that.

1427
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,260
See, I never...

1428
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:35,620
You have to...

1429
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,840
On the way home, we'll have to explain to Dave what jenkum is.

1430
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,880
And friends...

1431
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm going to have my fingers in my ears and be going la, la, la the whole time.

1432
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,600
Friends, you're listening...

1433
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,260
But the frog makes you forget, so I could never...

1434
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,940
Maybe I did know what jenkum is.

1435
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:49,240
You're right.

1436
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:49,740
Maybe I'm wrong.

1437
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,560
Jenkums...

1438
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,500
Ladies and jenkums, we're listening to Hour of Slack number 1,128.

1439
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:02,020
And if you would like to know more information about the Church of the Subgenius and the

1440
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,640
Frop Cup Devivals, you can go to subgenius.com.

1441
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:14,460
Or you can write for free information about the Church of the Subgenius from Bob, or our

1442
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,300
Slack, or Reverend Stang, or anything, at P.O. Box.

1443
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,860
1-814-17 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1444
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,140
That's Ohio.

1445
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,620
44118.

1446
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:39,140
And, oh, the collages we played at the beginning of the show were by Fernanda Nandy-Lemur, and

1447
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:45,380
the Bob on a Totally Dark Night was by Nora Elpreff, as is this one that I should be playing

1448
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,760
right now.

1449
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,040
Oh.

1450
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,140
Oh.

1451
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,280
Oh.

1452
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1453
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,280


1454
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,460
Oh.

1455
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,800
Jane, look.

1456
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,420
Oh.

1457
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,560
Oh.

1458
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:54,600
Oh.

1459
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,640
Radiation.

1460
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,480
Oh.

1461
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,640
Oh.

1462
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:00,540
Oh.

1463
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,340
Oh.

1464
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:03,480
Oh.

1465
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,720


1466
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,720


1467
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:03,920
Oh.

1468
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,780
Oh.

1469
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,680
I don't know.

1470
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,180
It's...

1471
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,160
Secondary domain, or pneumonia.

1472
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,400
And we decay with every minute.

1473
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,960
Fleshless things glide around here, and with your efficient ministrations, turn my father

1474
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,100
and my mother into jelly!

1475
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,440
But these people had no life.

1476
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,060
You're a genius.

1477
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,520
Oh my God.

1478
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,100
What?

1479
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,520
Oh my God.

1480
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,100
What?

1481
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,640
Fuck.

1482
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:27,960
Fuck.

1483
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,320
Fuck.

1484
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:28,600
Fuck.

1485
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:28,840
Fuck.

1486
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,400
It all happened so fast.

1487
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,320
Free.

1488
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:31,820
Help.

1489
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,080
Help.

1490
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,580
No matter.

1491
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,020
No matter.

1492
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,620
Call now.

1493
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,080
Nine.

1494
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:34,360
Nine.

1495
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:34,900
I don't know.

1496
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,180
You've turned me into a freak.

1497
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,860
Survival as a vegetable survives.

1498
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,020
A vegetable!

1499
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,460
Oh.

1500
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,940
Now, madam.

1501
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,620
Oh.

1502
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,900
Oh.

1503
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:44,920
Oh.

1504
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,840
Will that be all, ma'am?

1505
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,340
Life.

1506
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,300
Life!

1507
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,120
Normal.

1508
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,240
And then die.

1509
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,960
I want my freedom!

1510
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:52,900
You're geniuses.

1511
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,420
Every.

1512
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,660
Every day.

1513
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,120
Hi.

1514
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,680
Brainwash.

1515
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,120
Brainwash.

1516
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,880
We're going to live like normal people, do you understand?

1517
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,260
Normal people.

1518
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,620
We'll take trips and parties and...

1519
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,740
Something's not right.

1520
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:05,700
Something's not right.

1521
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,740
Something's not right.

1522
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,740
What is it?

1523
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,200
What is it?

1524
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:08,860
Robots.

1525
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,580
Why?

1526
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,360
Why?

1527
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,140
Oh.

1528
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:11,400
Oh.

1529
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,440
I'm a thing.

1530
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,540
I'm a machine.

1531
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,240
A machine.

1532
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,140
Noises and neuroses.

1533
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,260
Noises and neuroses.

1534
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:19,240
What is your power?

1535
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,340
I just sort of shake my butt.

1536
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,580
Get those ass waves kicking.

1537
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:22,900
Madness.

1538
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,020
You can say that again.

1539
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,740
Thank you.

1540
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,360
Madness.

1541
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,240
Madly, passionately, illogically, miserably, all-consuming.

1542
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,580
Furiously, fiercely.

1543
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,520
I love you.

1544
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,520
Thank you.

1545
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,120
Thank you.

1546
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,320
Toxins.

1547
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,080
Antitoxins.

1548
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,260
Oh.

1549
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:37,940
Nothing.

1550
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,680
Nothing.

1551
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,060
Nothing.

1552
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,300
You disappoint me.

1553
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:41,300
The eradicate.

1554
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1555
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1556
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1557
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:41,380


1558
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:43,820
I don't think you're making any sense at all.

1559
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,160
It won't hurt her.

1560
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,660
Well, let's get this over with.

1561
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,600
Oh.

1562
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,360
Come here, baby.
