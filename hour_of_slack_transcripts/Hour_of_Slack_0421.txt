Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.
Oh, sorry, I forgot all about the tape.
Before all our blood was tainted with all this human virus,
making us the mutants that we are today,
can you just remember how it was back when the first Bob,
when the first subgenius was, way back,
and how much simpler life was then?
But those times just might be coming back.
I said, they just might.
There is hope.
Of course, we're going to have to kill all the normals.
But then...
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!

Yeah!
I don't have a problem with that.
Does anyone else?
No!
Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happening, man.
This can't be happening, man.
This ain't happening.
How long till it blows?
Four hours.
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
equal to about 40 megatons.
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.
Maybe they just heard that we were having a subgenius survival tonight
and thought it'd be a great party.
Who knows?
But since they are...
They are here, or on their way, and can whiff-free the psychic stench,
it's time to get started and show them that we're not human,
that we are subgeniuses, and that we can fornicate with the best of them,
or die trying.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Now let's...
Now let's get started on some kinky sex yeti lust rituals.
Are you ready to take off all your clothes and try Connie's
Dobbs-approved, whipped cream-covered, flip-and-slide?
Yeah!
Are you ready?
Where's it at?
Yes!
Where's it at?
Woo!
Couldn't get any.
Why not?
Connie has it all!
Connie always gets the whip-and-slide.
It was supposed to be our turn.
Yeah.
Does anybody have any, like, party games we can play?
We do have a replacement sexual device, okay?
Oh!
Praise the replacement device!
Oh!
Praise River and Stang!
Yeah, the Stang-o-device!
Oh, the Stang-o-device!





Oh!
Praise sexual device!
The new sexual device, dear friends!
The crudely rendered, hideously ugly, but officially B-pipe...
The genius!
Our old swatch!
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stang.
We don't do it because we said to.
It's a game.











If you want to do that, then go and join the Roman Catholics, or Scientologists or
something.
We ain't gonna...
If you do what we tell you, we're gonna...
If you let us even live, we'll have to kill you!
I don't think you understand the seriousness of what's going on here.
This thing could be a thousand...
I'm warning you right now, before the crowd gets here, this religion could make Christianity
look like Christianity!
It's supposed to look.
You know, it could make the Mormons...
The Mormons have only been around for a hundred years.
They already run a state.
The FBI and most of the...

No, they can't.


They have to go to the Indian Reservation, at least.
They mean to cancel the world you civilized people made.
We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons threatened more
than they offered.
It is mind-boggling.
The possibilities are infinite.
A revolution in transportation, space exploration, colonizing the planets.
The man who owns the secret of this device could control the whole world.


The world, Simp?
The universe?
Oh, my.
That's right. Just plug him!
Simp's solo's right down in that hangar.
And he'll love it in there.
Okay, slam the door and quit!
Turn on the gas.
Get on the beach with your shoes.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
The new sexual device, dear friends,
the crudely rendered, hideously ugly,
but officially beep-piped head
of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,
Pi√±ata style.
Now, we're gonna have to
The sexual act we're talking about
in this particular case is, uh,
is banging the cat out of his face
because we love him so much
and the only way
The only way to know it's really Bob is to kill him!
Whack off on Bob!
And if he comes back, then it was the real Bob.
And if he doesn't, then it serves him right.
So we know whoever laughed was a guest at Stang's party,
and that's about all we know.
Now, the question that arises as this foul and crude representation
of our high epoch, our own...
I mean, this is our savior,
or at least our short-duration personal savior, number one.
Okay, I think that's a good height.
That's about where he'd be if he was standing there alive.
That's where his head would be.
Okay, now, the question is,
who will be lucky enough to strike the first blow?
I'm going to open the bidding right now.
This young lady has the right idea.
She said we should pay her because that's true slack.
However, that would be true slack for Reverend Anita Spanking,
but we need true slack for the church.
So far, $8?
Let me show you.
I need the $8 in my hand, and where's the sacred nine iron?
The nine iron?
Yeah.
Wasn't there a sacred nine iron that was going to be used
to break the god's head into pieces?
I mean, I can't believe.
Here I am just trying to raise money to hurt,
to dreadfully injure J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.
My God, if you can imagine how much this man hates you.
He's getting the nine iron.
I was just telling that he depended on your knowledge.
That's true.
I mean, yes.
I'm going to hit that head.
Wait a minute.
I just figured it out.
I'm going to hit that head.
No, pardon my language.
I've spent more money on this damn church
than everybody in this room put together.
That may have been the way it happened, Mr. Stang,
but I suppose it wasn't.
All right.
Who's going to get a good close-up here?
I love you both.
I love you both.
We're going to have fun.
Partake of the gifts inside Bob's brain.
All right.
Now, these are truly gifts in keeping.
Inside Bob's brain.
Plastic pipes.
These are the kind of pipes.
You don't even need anything in these pipes.
Light them up and smoke them and inhale the little furry black things that fly on.
Here is a penis, a toy penis.
They're candy nerds.
Gee, I wonder what that's supposed to mean.
And lighters, especially premier design by Dr. Toast Wilder, I'm sure.
Money.
Oh, I'll keep these.
The contents of Bob's head.
Candy bars.
Love gel.
Ever hard candy.
Man.
All right.
We're going to empty out the cranium of our savior and high E-pop.
Further.
And glitter.
Tiny.
More pipes.
There's the bloody remnants of J.R. Bob Dobbs' head laying on the floor of the church.
Unbelievable.
Some of the sights and sounds I've seen at these subgenius revivals.
Notice there was no blood, no brain.
You know, as you know, following the autopsy after Bob's first killing,
first assassination,
Bob's brain was found to be filled with a clear fluid, no tissue at all,
and a spongy network of fibers running, which appeared to be running down to the pipe itself.
Perhaps, Mr. Stang, but suppose he obscured his operation by mixing such reproductions with a legitimate inventory.
But you did call it.
Simply to explain.
Today, Stang, the jury has already heard the testimony about the phone call.
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.
A witness who can prove you are lying, Mr. Stang.
Now there's our third witness.
Um, I, uh, am very, I'm sorry and, and, uh, deeply apologetic to have to present to you, uh, the disgusting Dr. Katahdin, or Katayden, Legume,
who, uh, forced his attentions upon, uh, the Sweet Church, this wonderful, lovely religion, but, uh, he paid us so much that I will get out of the way and let this, this minister of God's name, uh,

Bob, speak. Thank you.
Yeah!
Yeah!
You'll have to excuse me for a minute. There's something I have to take care of.
Yes, ma'am.
Police frog!
The psychic frog!
Thanks for packing that for me, pal.
Yeah!
Well, brothers and sisters, I'd like to start off.
Uh-huh.
With something that has been probably affecting all of you at some point or another.
Something that just, just nags at you. Something that, something that, that crawls up your back and makes all the hairs stand up.
And what it is?
Know you're a real enemy!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!
Oh, my.
That's it.


Brothers and sisters.
That's it.
You need me tomorrow!
Brothers and sisters, I stand here before you tonight, the conduit of Bob's word, the bearer of Bob's word, but it was not always so.
Right, Bob.
It was not always so.
No?
No, it is not always so.
There was a time when I toiled.
I toiled my clothes gray up there on that garbage heap.
Yeah?
And I had no pulpit. I had a shovel.
Then one day I was out there on the garbage heap digging.
I looked down at my feet and I seen this little glint of light off something that was in my feet.
And I bent down and picked it up.
And it was a gold coin.
It was a gold coin.
And I picked it up.
And I could feel its beveled edges in my hand.
There was a face on the coin.
I knew instinctively it was of great value.
It was of great value.
And there was a face on the coin.
It kind of filled me with a feeling of comfort.
I didn't know who it was.
But it just filled me with great comfort.
Well, I saw it there.
And I took my shovel and I kept digging.
And I found another one.
And then another.
And then another.
And I looked at them.
And I looked at my hand and I said,
Well, I got four gold coins.
So tonight I'm going to party like it's 1999.
Brother, I'm right there.
Yeah.
Yeah!
And I looked at my shovel.
And I cast aside my shovel.
I cast aside my shovel.
And I went down into town.
And I stopped by the local coin shop.
And I walked in.
Rang a little bell.
Up on the counter.
And a man come out of the back.
And he bellied up to the bulletproof glass.
And with a smile on my face, I handed him them four gold coins.
And he looked back at me and he said,
These are fool's gold, my friend.
And I thought to myself,
Fool's gold?
I quit my job for fool's gold?
What can I buy with fool's gold?
And the man behind the counter smiled at me.
And he took out a pipe.
And he put it in his teeth.
Then he sat there.
He took a couple of puffs off of it.
And pungent smoke kind of swirled around him.
And I realized, hey, I didn't see him late this pipe.
Well, I said, well, what do you mean?
I can get everything for these four fool's gold coins.
And he said, well, you were a fool to quit your job for fool's gold.
But I'm willing to sell you four visions of the future.
Four visions of the future, my friends.
And I said, well, it ain't worth anything else.
Why the hell not?
So I gave him my four gold coins.
And suddenly the whole shop began shaking like it had been ripped free of the ground.
And I ran over to the window and looked out and found that it had indeed been ripped out of the ground.
And it was traveling at an amazing speed through the sky.
And then we landed.
It just crashed to the ground.
And the coin dealer came out of the back.
And he put his arm around my shoulders.
And he said, come with me, boy.
And I walked out the door.
And I could see nothing but a grassy plain.
Nothing for a million miles but a grassy plain.
And one building, a movie theater.
And I walked up to the front window of the movie theater.
And the ticket taker was there.
And the coin dealer handed the four gold coins to the ticket taker.
He handed him back a ticket.
And I said, well, aren't you coming in with me?
He said, no.
Sorry, my friend.
I've already seen this movie.
And I've got to be on my way.
And he turned around and he walked back into the store.
And the store lifted off of the ground and soared away very quickly.
And as it was soaring away, the last thing I could see was the neon sign as it blinked out of my line of sight.
Bob's Coin Shop.
Yeah.
Well, I went into that theater.
And I sat down in the lone chair that the theater offered.
And the screen lit up as the lights went down.
And on the screen was projected an image.
It was an image of four doors.
And the first door opened.
And a beast emerged.
A beast with seven heads.
And on those seven heads were the seven faces of Tipper Gore.
Yeah.
And in her claws, and in her claws were rock and roll albums.
And she was ripping them to shreds.
And she had on her back a hundred leeches.
And each of these leeches had the face of a TV evangelist.
Ernest Angley.
Jimmy Swagger.
Jerry Falwell.
And they all screamed at me.
And they screamed, unclean, unclean.
And then the second door opened.
And out rode a dark horse.
And on the back of that dark horse was a cowboy.
And in that cowboy's hand was an atomic bomb.
And on the side of that atomic bomb was written a single word.
Peace.
And then I realized that Jehovah One, the cosmic space alien responsible for the creation of this world, had to have a pretty thick sense of humor that could create a race that's smart enough to build nuclear weapons but not smart enough not to.
And the third door opened.
And out strode a giant, its left hand filled with gold, its right hand filled with dead brains.
It left a trail of slime wherever it went.
And the stench was horrible.
He had a huge square head.
And a blue glow came from his face.
And on that face was the number of the beast.
90210.
And then I saw the wisdom of nuclear weapons.
And the fourth door opened.
And from that door came a golden light.
And that golden light surrounded me.
And it lifted me from my seat.
And it drew me through the fourth door.
And that's when I realized that that fourth door was not a door from someplace.
It was an entryway to the pleasure craft of the sex goddesses.
Its crew was not comprised of slimy, tentacled aliens.
But it was filled with hot-naked sex kittens.
All of them fighting for the right to my...
I tried to resist them for oh, maybe two or three seconds.
But hey, I'm only a man.
What could I do?
Well, finally, exhausted, they took me to see their captain.
He was a large man with a large golden helmet with huge golden wings on the side of the head.
And brothers, it was the most impressive man I'd ever seen.
And sisters, although I've never had the slightest tendency toward homosexuality,
I must admit I felt a certain electric tingle in my groin in his presence.
And he turned to me.
And he took off that golden helmet.
And I said,
It's Bob!
It's Bob the Coin Dealer!
And he said,
Yes, I am Bob the Coin Dealer.
But I am also Bob the Traveling Salesman.
Bob the Prophet.
Bob the Final Hope for Mutant Kind.
And he said,
This is your reward, my brother.
This is your reward.
This silver disk filled with hot naked space babes is yours.
And the reason that it was mine was because I refused to accept my normalcy.
My normalcy.
And I rejoiced in my abnormality.
And I realized that, yes, this is my normality.


This is what awaits those who rejoice in their abnormality.
Is everybody here rejoicing in their abnormality today?
Oh, yeah.
That's right, brothers.
That's right, sisters.
Exploit your abnormality for potential.
Repent.
Quit your job and slack off.
Join my mighty church.
This subgenius membership card that a lot of you brothers and sisters have in your possession tonight
is your ticket to an eternity of rampant sin.
Sex, slack, and salvation.
Oh, yeah.
So I gave Bob my $20.
And I got me a ticket on X Day, the day of the great judgment and a license to sin.
Oh, yeah.
And Bob said to me,
You are who you are.
And don't be ashamed of it.
Don't let those born-again uptight stop you from rocking and rolling in the land of milk and honey
and kick ass good times.
You are who you are.
Oh, yeah.
Praise Bob.
Can I get a praise Bob?
Can I get a praise Bob?
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Oh!
Yeah, I am who I am in the words of Saint Papa.
I am who I am in the words of Yahweh.
I am who I am.
Yes, sir.
Every time I say that,
I get filled up with boldness.
I am Dr. Le Guillaume.
I am a ass-whipping, spirit-filled, king-talking, prophesying, laying on a hand's healing preacher.
I am who I am.
Praise Bob.
Come on, brother, say it.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
Praise Bob.
I am who I am.
Praise Bob.
I am who I am.
I am who I am.
And now, once again, it's time to read from the unpublished volume, The Great Opus.
Revelation, the Babacar-pacraphon.
I wanted to show this off to the radio listeners.
Wow, look.
Shiny.
And Reverend Cole, this, yes, this is the new Bible.
Well, it looks good.
It's a new Bible, and see how the spruits and the blood drips out of it when you squeeze it.
That's amazing.
May I touch it?
Oh, can I touch it too?
I want to touch it too.
Bless me with it.
Bless me with it.
You may touch it.
Oh, I can't.
It oozed on me.
I won't wash his hands all week.
Five hundred pages of hell itself.
Hell and damnation that no one will ever be able to see until next year sometime when they get around and finally stop screwing around and publishing.
Well, actually, I took two years just to put it.
But.
You know, there's so many that Bob must speak through.
You know, we had to channel this book through.
Yeah, but if you just let some of that ooze out.
We ask each the there's even a little section on the slack chapters like this down here on Chapter 12.
It says verse make the spot.
Wait two hours.
Then read.
Here, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Okay.
Well, the damage.
You know, I have to wait.
Hours.
Yeah.
Oh, why did I do that?
Yes, it's it's something.
It is something.
The New Testament.
It is.
It is the New Testament.
The Book of the Subgenius available at better bookstores everywhere.
So is there any on Connie?
There's an entire chapter on Connie Dobbs.
She has her own disgusting chapter.
And of course, within that evil chapter are will be pictures of time.
Men.
I found.
Oh, I.
Yes.
I'm sure.
Where is.
I think that for two hours.
I'm sorry.
Speaking of pictures, look at this nifty catalog from this great place called Dream Dresser Boat.
See.
The.

The.
The.










Mike, like.
Yeah, I knew Michael.
I'll have to review that.
Check that out.
This is an interesting catalog.
Folks were looking at a catalog of what looks like bondage.
And well, let's see.
Why.

It's a.
Oh, it's fashion, fetish fantasy.
We quickly.
That's not politically correct.
No.
That makes that.
That's very Catholic.
That woman's probably a demure, intelligent girl next door.
And they've made her look like some.
Some.
submissive
They don't look very submissive to me.
A craven strumpet.
Holy mother of Pearl Bailey!
How do they attach
those chains to those little red spots
on those hemispheres?
Those are not the actual nipple chains.
The actual nipple chains are suspended
from a zirconium piece of wiring.
This place is in Washington, D.C.
You can go shop here.
It not only hangs, but it actually suspends.
It reminds me of my favorite candy, S&M's.
Wait, I'll show you the one Michelle has.
They would be kind of hot in the summertime.
And there's a cow.
They might be hot in the wintertime.
I like the chain mail.
Have you guys noticed that this catalog reminds me
some of these humans have these
hemispheric globes
attached to them.
They call them women, pal.
The ones that have globes attached to them
they call them girls.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
They have two in the front
and two in the back.
That's interesting.
I wonder why it's set up that way.
I bet that's so that the human can know what to do.
The human males, no matter what direction they come from
I wonder why they weren't given just an owner's manual.
When they bump into them, they always know what to do.
A boner's manual?
That is an owner's manual.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That reminds me of my favorite Onan canopies.
Do I have a pen?
Yeah, it's somewhere here.
Yeah, there's one.
Onan.
Yeah, Dream Dresser.
Who took things in hand?

We basically had sex in the dressing room.
Delivered it to the shelf.
It was a really poor place to go shop.
Abortion is, you're killing a soul.
It's quick and easy.
Yeah, you gotta go there in person.
When thousands, when millions of potential human lives
meet a cold death on a tile bathroom floor.
Well, in my case, it sticks to the ceiling.
Yeah, they charge like ten bucks.
Or maybe somewhere in some dank basement.
What is this stuff that's dripping on my head in the studio?
Disgusting!
It's a very low count.
You heard, remember the old band, Ten Sheet?
I think it was a .2 ten shee-shee.
Take the order form out of it.
Well, I've got 12 kids.
I must have hit the mark 12 times anyway.
Let's not talk about sperm counts.
Now, let's move this up.
You have to eat the cookie.
I heard about that game.
My brother said, when I was a little kid, 12 years old,
my brother said that people played that game.
Eat the cookie.
What do you mean people played that game?
That's what you have to do to get into the trilateral.
You have to play eat the cookie to get into the trilateral.
Hey, hey, hey, we can't let that out.
We can't let that out.
Oh, we say it here to ensure disbelief.
That's true.
Let me keep up my front.
You can't say that.
How's that?
That's good.
Concerted misinformation.
Stop it.
You know, it's gotten to the point now where you have to,
I mean, there's so much disinformation around that the truth itself becomes disinformation.
That's true, and the truth itself is disinformation.
I don't see any double entendre there.
I think that truth is disinformation.
I bet if you do it good enough, the conspiracy will pay you good money.
Yes, if you're infiel, you'll get paid buckets, but I don't see the point of it.
After all, where does it get you in the long run?
The same shallow grave and the same, you know, police homes.
Oh, you know, we make silly jokes about the crashed UFO saucers underneath the air bases
and the Kennedy assassination and things like that.
That makes up for it.
I love them jokes.
Yeah, they cry us for that.
You know, we trivialize these serious issues.
It's a living.
What can I say?
Doug, I hate to broach the subject, but we don't get paid for it.
You see, we haven't been contacted yet.
We've been threatened two times, but we haven't really been contacted,
and we don't get any checks in the mail yet.
And what you've been listening to, dear friends, on this side of show,
the general media barrage, little clips and things all came from puzzling evidence
of the KPFA-Merkley show.
Wonderful.
Little bits and pieces interspersed with live recordings from preaching from the Akron
D. Bible last couple of weeks ago in Kavanaugh's.
You heard Reverend Janina Grinder and a long rant by the disgusting Dr. Lake Hume.
And then, of course, some clips from a recent brain rot theater radio broadcast from WCSB
in Cleveland.
In this case, with Reverend Mike Cole, a lonesome cowboy day, the good psychopath finder,
the bad scampi days, with, oh, who else?
What other guests, perhaps?
Princess Viardo and Jimi Hendrix here until we get the tapes open.
Thank you.
Thank you, indeed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Hey, Captain!
Hey!
Hey there, you better wake up!
There's a train coming!
Wake up!
Hey!
Hey, wake up!
Come on!
Come on, now, wake up, will you?
What goes on inside the head of a crazy man?
Are there explosions?
Color flashes?
Or is it just a slow, paralyzing blackness?
It creeps over your mind like an eclipse of the sun.
What goes on inside the head of a crazy man?
It creeps...
It creeps over your mind like an eclipse of the sun.
I think when you get into this deep psychological thinking,
it's an activity that can cause a lot of trouble.
It's like walking on a platform.
You make one last step and you've had it.
But if you succeed,
so you've defied the very law of gravity,
I'm going to succeed.
I'm going to beat it,
because I'm going to plead guilty and imply insanity.
Oh, yeah!
Brothers,
Bob is reported to be the power to cast out false prophets.
The power to cast out demons.
The power to lay my hands on you and heal you.
Amen.
Is there anybody here that needs to be healed?
Come up to me, brother.
Come up to me, brother, and be healed.
Come up here, brother.
Come on up, brother.
Oh, yeah.
What is your problem, my brother?
From what do you need to be healed?
I need no job.
You need no job.
Well, I'm going to suck that demon out of you
that makes you go to work every day.
Yeah!
I'm going to draw him out,
and I'm going to take him into my own body,
and later I will excremeditate him and flush him.
Go back to the nether regions from whence he came.
Brother, let me put my hands on you and heal you.
Brother, let me put my hands on you and heal you.
Come on up here.
Oh, yeah, brothers and sisters.
He's drunk in the spirit, my brothers and sisters.
Oh, yeah.
Praise Bob.
Come on, brother.
Come on back to your feet, brother.
Yeah, brother!
Can I get an amen?
Praise Bob!
Can I get an amen?
Amen!
Can I get an amen, Bob?
Amen!
Can I get an amen, Bob?
Amen!
Praise Bob.
Thank you, brother.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We're not here to save the world,
but it just might work out that way.
Whoo, brothers.
You have seen the miracles.
You have seen the power.
Now, what's stopping anyone out here
from getting that $20 membership card
in the Church of the Subgenius?
Oh, yeah.
Well, you've seen the miracles,
but if you've seen the light,
you'll go over and talk to Reverend Stang over here
and get that Subgenius membership card.
You'll get that ticket on the pleasure craft
to the sex goddesses.
You'll get to ride that train, brothers,
because you either got to ride the train
or get tied to the tracks.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Yeah!
So you get that train ticket.
Oh, yeah, brothers.
You get that train ticket.
Oh, yeah, sisters.
You get that train ticket.
And if you do, I'll see you on the train.
But if not, I'll see you on the tracks.
So get that ticket.
Oh, yeah, and keep it with you.
And don't leave home without it.
Don't be caught dead without it.
Thank you, brothers and sisters,
and praise God.
Praise God!
Praise God!

Praise God!
Praise God!
Praise God!
Praise God!
Please!

around, or in most cases, even thinking they're pushing us around. We don't want to give them
the satisfaction of assuming they might ever push us around. Just because we're outnumbered
10 billion to one, just because they have 100,000 nuclear weapons and we only have three,
we will fight them anyway. We will fight them in the streets. We will fight them on the
airwaves. We will fight them in our bedrooms, in our rumpus rooms, in our bathrooms. We
shall persevere. Because as long as slack is free, if not a membership in the church,
as long as slack is free, they cannot win. They cannot win. As long as slack cannot be
bottled and sold, as long as the fat spirit of Dr. Legume cannot be bottled nor sold,
the church cannot be co-opted. As long as we can keep killing Bob and he can keep bouncing
back, they cannot kill us. Well, they can kill us, but we've got two different paradises.
They've got two. Holy water. Holy water. It says holy water right on it. Did you get
this from Pastor Tilton? Straight from Pastor Robert Tilton. This is water that God blessed.
It is holy water.
God touched this water. It's like God.
It's like making water on you, friends. God can wreck the microphones. God can wreck the
video cameras. You'll all be pregnant with the new Jesus when this is over with.
Just stick to the straight and narrow and you're a winner.
Let me lose this neck.
Now, look, are you sure you can? Maybe you imagine.
Oh, yeah, a lot of tension. Your imagination.
I know, but it's not the case.
People can imagine things that aren't necessarily true.
They're not real, you know. They think I think they're real.
But I like them anyway. They're nice. I like nice things.
They're still looking at the globes.
Yeah, they're still looking at those.
That reminds me of my favorite candy, S&M.
It's got a hurt that tastes good.
Why can't we have mammalian glands like that?
I wonder if that has to do with the Yeti thing.
It's because you're old then now.
When you get a little older, you'll have glands just like that, Dave.
Plus, you have children. Don't all three of you have children?
Someday you'll have deep feelings like I do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mike does, too.
I'm still nursing.
You have three children?
He's got three, but not all yours, right?
Some of them are mine.
I can only ask.
Some of them were just lost and hanging around.
He brought them in, didn't you, Michael?
Sure.
But that's not a subgenius thing to do.
I think the Reverend would probably say that if a lonely wave appeared on his doorstep,
he'd probably kick it in the groin edge and send it on its way.
No, not at all.
We take them to Malaysia for the homes of cyclist children.
Malaysia. That's where I found that catalog.
All those kids on those milk cartons, those kids aren't missing.
They're being trained to be good subgeniuses.
They'll be working in low Earth orbit on our space station.
They're not real desconocedos.
You're putting them to work?
They're perfectly useful like human worker bees.
What do you think?
We farm them out to NASA when we're through with them.
You'd think you'd get praise for this.
There are so many humans who lead perfectly useless lives.
No, I can't hear you, Mike.
You're too far from the microphone.
You'd think the subgenius church would be praised for this action, but typical or not.
We could let some human raise them and just turn them into little factory workers.

But these children are finally living perfectly useful lives in the church.
The church be praised.
Will the church believe in work they're not taking?
Slack work, yes.
Sometimes they must be worked out in the fields in order to learn how much slack they once had.
In order then to find out what slack was.
And this leads to the true spirituality of it, I imagine.
Opening that triangle.
That's how you know there's wool.
Well, it doesn't matter what it does as long as the fields are planted and they do what we say.
They keep little tape nets hanging around their necks as they work.
Listening to the...
The tapes.
The tapes.
The tapes.
Well, tapes.
You know, with this music playing, Reverend, I wonder if maybe you could give our very diminutive audience a brief taste of what it's like to work in the fields of Malaysia and how you help in the home for slack, Malik Women's.
Perhaps you could describe...
Well, that's the home for wayward girls.
The Dr. Drummond runs that...
In Malaysia, providing them with work.
Yes, and his friend...
Do they work in the rice paddies?
Yeah.
Oh, they work everywhere.
They have to work.
But you see, it's not so much where they are or what they're doing.
Some of them are just staying inside chambers hooked up to little tubes feeding them the experience of working 20 hours a day in the rice paddies.
That's so much more efficient.
Yes, yes.
And they get...
They learn the same lessons attached to those tubes.
And their lessons are...
Their heads are filled with these lessons of simple toil.
Do they reach out to you as...
In a ministerial way, do they send you cards and letters saying that they...
They appreciate what you've done?
Oh, they'll reach out to anyone who is...
When we program that person into their pleasure center, you see.
That's the whole idea is we have a direct input to the pleasure...
The desire gland can be rewired and expanded.
We pump it up way, way, way too big so it can never be filled up and satisfied.
So they'll always be looking for something more meaning than there is in, say, just an average squirt or ooze or whatever.
And that keeps them...
That keeps their anguish level up.
We're able to bottle up quite a bit of...
Of anguish and soul that goes into the...
The soul will rather well these days, too, that bottle.
Bottled anguish is the only thing the Elder Gods will take in trade for this planet.
What do you think Bob's trying to sell?
What do you think this whole X-Day scam is about?
Yeah, really, what is he trying to sell, though?
We need to have...
Okay, the Elder Gods live...
They get high, basically, off of human anguish.
That's why we have wars and traffic lights and things like, you know, bad drivers and so forth.
To build up a certain...
A certain savory anguish for these space creatures.
A savory anguish?
Who... Who will...
A flavorful pain, as it were.
It's like, when they get here in 1998, if they find a planet full of low-level kink, human anguish, they'll just...
They'll... They'll, uh...
Call it a loss.
They'll sell it off.
They'll just scrape, scour the planet clean.
And, uh...
That'll be it.
That'll be the end of it.
What Bob's trying to do is sell them on the proposition that this...
The silence fazes me.
They will consider any excuse unacceptable.
It's kind of hard.
You have to constantly give pep...
People pep talks.
You know, it's like they know better, but they're being bombarded with false slack so much more than they're being bombarded with our particular brand of...
Well, real slack.
Yeah.
You know, it's detailed theological discussions and so forth.
There'll be a lot of yelling and screaming and, uh, cussing.
Cussing, probably.
You know, we cuss more than most preachers.
Mm.
Will there be a lot of bull there, too?
A lot of what?
Bull.
Or...
Well, we'll be expelling...
We'll...
We'll probably do the ritual whereby people expel their bull.
Oh, no.
The bull that is pent up in them all week or all month.
We try to encourage him to, uh, scream it out.
Uh, uh, squeeze it out.
We try to squeeze...
Squeeze?
Squeeze the bull out of them.
Ring them real good.
And we collect the bull in these little metal canisters and then sell that to the Bob's.

And, uh, they, uh, drink it and smoke it and breathe it and stuff like that.
That's the best words you've ever heard?
The aliens have, uh, use for certain parts of what we squeeze out of our audiences.
Yeah.

Wait a minute.
What?
There's all these people around here.
How come they're on my...
But I know they're people.
I don't know, but they're on my side and not on yours.
I don't...
You ever see Terminator 2?
No.
You know, it's funny how the whole world's starting to look like those rough mechs and
thick mechs that appeared human but weren't really.
Oh, yeah.

That's true.
Put on those glasses.
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
I have to...
No fake.
Sorry.
You have to brush your teeth and...
You guys are really insecure.
Well, you know, I forgot to do it before I came over here.
No.
And when you're in the presence of holiness, you, uh...
It's We Are Doe.
Oh, that...
Oh, Princess We Are Doe is here.
Bow down before the princess, boy.
Yes.
Yes.
Hi, Princess.
Hi, John.
Thank you.









Can I get my pictures taken with you tonight?
Yes.
Lisa...
I mean, Weesa...
I mean, Princess We Are Doe's cheesy wedding shots will be available.
And sold.
Oh, is there a honeymoon afterwards?
Pardon?
Is there a honeymoon afterwards?
Most of the show is the honeymoon.
Oh, okay.
In this particular revival, we're gonna perform the marriage ceremony first, so the whole
rest of the party will be the honeymoon.
Oh, okay.
Cool.
And since we're marrying everybody to everybody else and their pets, their car keys, whatever,
we're gonna...

Oh, it ought to be...
One big mass...
Something.
...melding of fun.
Yes.
And Princess We has brought her special magic Polaroids so she can snap wedding photos and
sell them.
Oh, cool.
At a very reasonable rate.
We can't do that all...
Oh, no.
No, no.
But she just left me...
Gave me this note to remember that there will be a Dobbs Head pinata.
Oh.
So that those who have become religious figures...



Yes.
...and are fanatics for Bob can take a stick and can whack Bob on the head as hard as they
want.
They can beat the face of their savior.
I've been really one of the whacking ahead of... for a long time.
For a price.
Yeah.
Well...
Modest.
Everything comes with one hand in hand.
That's right.
But of course.
Hey, I think someone's already started.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, just...
It hasn't been consummated yet and they're already started.
Hey, half...
With the subgeniuses, all they need is the concept.
Yeah, that's right.
It's almost better to just to know that they could...




Could do it than to actually do it.
That sometimes that's just a let down after the...
Oh.
You know, the conceptualization.
It's virtual fun.
Cheaper for us.
Oh.
I want to...
I want to take Howard Cern's place and make Princess Wee the Robin Quivers because her
laugh is even more infectious.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
It's like no matter what I say, everybody will think it's funny because she's...
Because her laugh is so funny.
It's got to be true.
Oh.
Sigh.
Oh.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Give me a towel.
Give me a towel.
I'll help somebody.
So, yeah.
They'll be...
They'll be preaching and...
And of course, they're screeching, selling and...









And killing Bob.
You know, it's like we praise him and then we hurt him and then we praise him some more
and hurt him some more.
It's a lot more freedom.
Maybe more repetition too, I don't know, than in most religions.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
What the hell is going on?
It's the operator for three, unit three.
Emergency.
Unit three.
Emergency.
Unit three.
Emergency.
I need a trace incoming.
We are not willing to kill in the name of good.
We have the choice of remaining and killing or leaving.
No, I don't laugh, weep or get drunk and I only serve.
I can't believe the Archons are literally shooting our souls up as a form of drug
extraordinary.
static. They don't shoot.
Of course they don't shoot it up. They don't have bodies.
They just kind of huff it.
Huff it? Yeah, they dump
them into a bag. They dump a bunch of soul into
a bag and kind of...
Like that. Metaphysically, of course.
We're talking about on a metaphysical level.
Horrifying.
It's one of those metaphysical glands.
It's kind of like the same process when you hack up a really
good spitball loogie.
Do we feel it? I mean, will we
feel it when we're kind of like huffed
up, so to speak? Oh, it'll feel good
to you, but it'll be the last thing you feel.
You'll be dead. I mean, this is...
Oh, I don't have to worry about that. I'm dead already.
No, no. It'll be different.
You'll be dead, and
the soul will be somewhere else.
It won't exactly be you, Dave.
Don't worry. And it won't hurt
for long.
It'll...
Even though your otherwise
immortal soul will have been consumed,
and this is the only way, besides a nuclear explosion,
that the soul can be consumed.
Despite that...
Bob will think of you more
fondly than he would have
otherwise, and there'll be a special
plaque in your name
in the Book of Humans.
Well, I have plaque and stuff,
but I can't believe that Blue would try
and fondle me after doing something like that
if I'm discarnate to begin with.
Don't I have to have a body?
I mean, you know, metaphor... I mean, not metaphor.
Yeah, well, you have one, but
it's inhabited by an eternal soul,
don't you see? Actually, there's two different...
There's the lower soul and the higher soul.
I don't know if the listeners...
The vegetable kingdom soul,
and the animus kingdom soul.
That's right. Yes, one of them
is very badly behaved, and the other one
is an idiot.
So there's
two great souls...
No, no, no, go ahead.
I dreamed of being an animated vegetable,
and a lot of times I dreamed of being a candy bar
and stuff, but I never thought that there would be an illusion
that would allow me to be all these things
and still stop...
Well, now, keep in mind...
It's still stuck to the roof of your mouth.
The souls are...
are devoured.
Only those souls of those who never
bought their $30 membership
in the Church of the Subgenius.
Oh, it's $30 now?
Well, it will be $30 when the new book comes out.
It's still $20 for the next year.
For one more year, it's still $20.
Or eternal salvation or triple your money back,
and we get...
You get not one paradise, but two.
One while you're still alive, if you can live
up to X day.
And one to hang on the window, on the rearview mirror.
That's right.
God, two paradises.
One as long as you live, which is as long as you want.
And then one whenever you choose to die.
Then you go to Christian heaven or Christian hell.
At the same time.
And if you can make it through those,
then you graduate to subgenius hell or Asgard.
And after Asgard, you graduate to the subgenius heaven,
which is called hell.
And after that, the heaven of the subgenius heaven.
And so if it just goes on, it gets better and better from there on.
You weren't talking...
I'm kidding about getting in on a ground floor while you...
It's the ground...
Yes, this is...
We are in hell now.
This is the actual hell that they talk about.
The plane of eternal damnation and torture.
If you ever wondered why life didn't seem fair,
why there's pain and so forth,
you're in hell now.
And yes, and when we try to tell people they're in hell,
they think the demons are just satirists
and it's all just a stupid comedy thing.
It's in hell.
It's like you have to work.
It's like you have to work.

It's endless toil for no more reason
than to earn just a few minutes of slack on the weekend or something.
You age, for instance, in hell.
You, you know, people aren't as attracted to you.
You have to wear a lot of makeup or...
Put a sock on yourself.
Yes, it's, it's, uh...
And that's the easy.
Of course, this is the ground floor of hell.
After this, you'll graduate to the one with the flames and pitchforks.
That's actually quite a bit more interesting.
Like I say, it gets better from here on.
The sheep help you sleep.
Talking about the...
Here, listen to this.
They didn't realize the stages of hell they had to go through.
But when, uh...
Listen to the words here for a second.
When you must snooze, it's wonderful to use.
Sleep.
Sheep.
Sheep to help you sleep.
Now listen here.
Number one help plays accordion.
That worked.
That worked.
This is the music they play in heaven.
Yeah.
Eternal.
Number three says we.
Oh, I want number three.
Oh, blast.
I'm still conformed as ever.
I try to grasp metaphysics and apologetics,
and I just don't seem to get the gist of it.
Number six is doing tricks, Dave.
Number six.
That means we have six incandescent, individual, highly evolved souls.
And each one is lower than the next one.
No?
No.
That's just our shedding our shells.
Get the best deal on all of those souls.
And number ten says do it again.
That's being reincarnated into hell.
Yeah, okay.
Now number two.
Number two?
Being reincarnated back into hell.
Okay, number three?
Not carnated, but being cremated in halcyon.
Okay, number four?
And that's when you escape.
Okay, but rhyme with the number now.
Number five?
That's when you're still alive.
Okay, number six?
Number six.
Uh, we crossed the river Styx.
Oh, there we are.
On the other side, there's Charon, or Charon, or whatever his name is,
with his giant beezerball black belly and his huge, rancid nose.
He, uh, pronouncing epithets to the wind and guiding the little Saracens off over there.
Where were we?
Here's number five.
Okay, and then we got into number six.
Cross the river Styx.
Okay, now number seven?
Number seven.
Seven times seven.
Seven times seven.
Seven, seven, seven.
Number eight?
Uh, oh, oh, Bob hates.
No, he hates.
Number eight?
Bob says he hates.
Number nine?
Hate, hate, hate, hate.
Number nine?
He turns a man to swine like sure she did.
And water into wine.
And ten?
And water into wine.
No, that's a whole.
A big fat hen.
And number eleven?
Bob is a slave to Mercury.
Bob burned down heaven.
This is getting a little bit tough.
Okay, number twelve?
Uh, let's not dwell.
Let's stop.
Let's stop.





Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
This is a stupid religion.
Cut it.
But that's okay.
Since when was it ever a sin in the Church of the Sub-Gene to have a stupid religion?
Let's have a stupid religion.
That's nine-tenths its appeal.
That is, that is, it's the only real, it's, it's entertainment is what it is, and we happen
to offer more gods and devils to pick from than most other religions.
Speaking of entertainment.
I know, I, I was, you know, fond of your Roman Catholic and Orthodox tradition because
there were so many fine saints and little things.
Then I was attracted to the vast majority of the Catholic Church.



I was attracted to the Ladois because, you know, there were so many Loas and stuff,
but there's nothing like the Church of the Sub-Genius for lots and lots of deities.
That's right, dear friends.
We've got deities galore here in the Church of the Sub-Genius, including Lonesome Cowboy
Dave.
Heard just that on his beautiful show with, uh, the Reverend Chaz, Reverend Dan, and,
uh, WCSB, and, and in this case, uh, with, uh, your, uh, friend, uh, Reverend David.

Good friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang as a guest.
A guest.
And, uh, before that, a little bit of, uh, uh, Akron Radio, uh, John, uh, Reverend John
Devine's show.
And before that, Brain Rot and KPFA, uh, uh, Puzzling Evidence and its end, uh, revival,
blah, blah, blah.
And, uh, yeah, I know you need to know, uh, the sacred post office box.
And because you need to know.

You do have your pen or pencil ready.
And you can get the free information from, uh, uh, uh, Bob.
Yeah, just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306.
That's, once again, that's box, P.O.
Box, 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.
And, uh, that zip code is P.O.

Box, of course, 75214.
Right.
P.O.
Box, 14306, Dallas, Texas, 75214 for all you need to know and a lot that you won't
really want to know.
You'll be sorry having known it.
You must know even if the knowing must get you.
Praise Bob.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

You sure got some trouble setting up in your home.










Bye-bye.
Come with me.
Uh.
Praise Bob.

Praise Bob.

Say something.
But there's nothing like the church of the sub-genius for a lot and lot of deities.
Alvin and the chipmunk?
I heard Alvin and the chipmunk.
I think this is a Barney record.
Let's hear it for America.
It's Barney in the red, white, and blue, you know.
God, these are the end times.
I would like to see Barney ripped asunder and his bowels sprayed all over the desert.
It's Barney and laughing and now crying children because I don't like him.
But you're wearing a purple shirt.
It suggested that there's an unholy connection between...
Barney!
Barney and Rush Limbaugh.
No, who's the little blonde kid?
That Rush Limbaugh is in fact Barney in a Rush Limbaugh suit.
Oh yeah, I've heard that before already.
Now I've heard it.
Identical soma types?
I heard Barney...
Identical soma types.
Barney is a Rush Limbaugh impersonator.
Barney is Rush Limbaugh.
Rush Limbaugh.
Is Rush Limbaugh.
In a Barney...
In a Barney...
Rush Limbaugh suit.
Oh, I heard it was in a Barney suit.
A fake brother.
And you can see the zippers and stuff too.
I mean, it's kind of...
It seemed like they...
I mean, it's top show.
It's a big hit.
That's a last...
The last thing I'd want to see is Rush Limbaugh's zipper.
I'm sorry.
You have seen it, I know.
No, no.
That's...
I just...
That's why he wants everybody to go back in the closet, you know?
So he can go hang out at the Y down by the Capitol and...
That's right.
And you can sit in a steam bath and wait for a hot trick to come by.
Yeah, guys with triple rings in the head of their...
And don't be alone with them.
And after they kill the head choppers,
then we kill them.
And now we're going to talk about a really exciting show this time.
You're called.
Very well.
Well, I do.
The question now...
How do you spend your gleaming hour?
Dreaming of the show.
Oh, come on.
She's reading that answer.
Yeah, you can...
That's too pat and perfect.
Too plumped up and pretty.
It's right off of that card.
Well, it's the answer to what I was talking about.
Forget the cue cards, my dear, and go with the flow.
The National Show.
The guest and music...
Dreaming of the show.
And then learning about the show.
All participants...
Reading the little show biography...
Yes.
We're learning about life from our friends on the show.
Nobody on the show is awake.
But we're not learning too much.
Simultaneously.
Well, if you listened carefully,
you would have heard my earlier lecture about the Electoral College.
And how about in the year 1800...
You really see people.
No, I don't go to the Electoral College.
I go to the other...
Well, that's because we're all connected by the electroencephalogram,
which registers our thoughts on the dream.
It feels like you're on the water when you're on the tree.
One can see the undisturbed waves of sleep.
Well, if you plug that thing in there and plug that other thing in there...
The music goes round and round and it comes back here.
You don't want to know what you end up with.
Well, you might end up with the bottoms up below the belt review.
Something resembling the show, I suppose.
Something resembling an eel, but it might also be a stonefish,
that primitive, poisonous creature.
You can't be fat, thanks.
That thing?
Yes, natives refer to it as a one-, two-, or three-foot stonefish,
which puzzled archaeologists for many years.
Stung by a seal.
You can't be a stonefish and you can't eat the shell.
You're supposed to...
