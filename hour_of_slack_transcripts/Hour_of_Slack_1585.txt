Rise now, you white whale.
Show us your crooked jaw.
Show us your wrinkled brow.
Rise.
The birds.
The birds!
He rises!
He rises!
The
So genius
Power of
Swarming!
Mob?
He'll not escape!
Thunder and hell, what's wrong with you?
Oh, you
Mob?
You damn it!
Mob?
Mob?
Hey, we, uh, we didn't do the, uh,
the, the, your, I know the costume ball was like an anything ball, but it was originally going to be your, your favorite dead rock star.
And, uh, I forgot my pants, cause I was going to be, uh, no, everybody was going to do like Elvis or that sort of thing, but, uh, how many people in here know who Screamin' Lord Such is?
Okay, there's one.
Two.
See, I would've walked around, you guys got a, oh, who are you supposed to be?
I'm Screamin' Lord Such.
I just thought of Blowfly.
Yeah.
You tend to forget the good ones.
I was going to, my first thought was Gigi Allen, which would be easy cause you'd just be in your underwear covered with chocolate syrup.
You'd have to shave your head.
Right.
And I thought, okay, who do I, who, what dead rock star would I really look like?
Pete Seeger.
Pete Seeger?
Well, he's not really rock, but yeah.
No, what I decided was Jim Morrison didn't really die.
He moved to Africa and just died the other day.
And that's...
That would have been my costume.
I wouldn't have to wear anything.
Instead, I came as walkers for Trump.
Did you see my zombie mask and sign?
And walker?
Oh, yes, dear friends.
X Day, such a beautiful, uh, time just before the end of the world.
It's so, uh, somehow freeing to know that it's all going to be over with and you don't have to pay any more bills.
You don't have to worry about any of that crap.
Because it's X Day.
It's X Day.
And you've got Bob on the brain.
Yep, you've got Bob on the brain.
B-O-B.
Big old brother.
You've gone crazy on X Day.
Because that's what you do on X Day.
You just go crazy.
Because the world's about to end.
The world's about to end.
You've got Bob on the brain.
And Bob's your big brother.
And everything's okay.
Because all the subgeniuses are around and they're jamming.
And, you know, you've got some beer and some frappy.
And you've got...
You're Woody and you're Surfboard.
And you go have a subgenius beach party.
You can just go right down to that pond and have a subgenius beach party.
Go surfing with the brain-eating amoebas.
You can go scuba diving with old Seaclaw.
Oh, you can just have the funnest time running around X Day.
Not X Day in this particular case.
But this will be the last one, I'm pretty sure.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
It's going to be great.
But Bob promised me.
And I know...
I love Bob.
I love Bob.
He talked to me one time in my dream.
And so that's why I know that he's for real.
And one time I went to sleep in the alley and I woke up with a haircut.
And I know that was Bob that did that.
That was fun.
So anyway, friends, it's X Day.
It's X Day.
It's crazy.
Everybody's crazy.
Because it's X Day.
And everybody loves Bob.
And Bob loves everybody.
And I love everybody.
And I love everybody.
Because everything's crazy at X Day.
It's crazy, I tell you.
Because it's slack.
It's slack.
Some people got some slack.
I know they did.
Some people got lucky.
They got some damn slack.
They got more of them kind pills, Bob.
It's great.
It's X Day.
It's crazy.
Oh, yeah.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

It just about makes me out of breath talking about how crazy it is.
I love X Day.
It's just so fun.
You can just go crazy at X Day.
Or as we might call it, you can go sane at X Day.
That's right.
You can go 8-shit-sane at X Day.
You can go 8-shit-sane.
That's Dr. Legale.
put it. Say, speaking of Dr. Leguim, we should call him up and put him on FaceTime. We get
Dr. Leguim up on FaceTime. He'd write to us. It's a beautiful thing. It's X Day. It's a
beautiful thing. One man's bummer. It's another man's beautiful thing. Praise Bob.
Ah!
Ah!
To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous.
Speak not to me, a blasphemy man.
And I'd say,
Strike the sun if it insulted me.
Look here, Starbuck.
All visible objects are but as pasteboard masks.
Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing puts forth the molding of their features.
The white whale tasks me.
He heaps me.
Yet he is but a mask.
Just the thing that I'm not.
The thing behind the mask I chiefly hate.
The malignant thing that has plagued and frightened man since time began.
The thing that mauls and mutilates our race.
Not killing us outright, but letting us live on with half a heart and half a lung.
God keep us, keep us all.
Mm-hmm.
Amy, mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Challenged me to another song once, many months later.
We were talking about flow charts.
And she said,
Hey, how about you write a song that's based on a flow chart?
And I tried, and ten minutes later, I'm like, fuck this.
No, I can't, no.
No, this is wrong.
Forty-five minutes later, I had this.
Hey, kids, you want to be a star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Star?
Why?


Barnes.
No.
But you won't be a star like you're predecessor for a long while, bro.
You won't be a star like mean wimpy altri.
A new teen star.



No.
I'm sorry, baby.
Balck b点k Resource Mission.
I don't know why I didn't write this song myself.



Theen.


That's some stuff from Bruno Ronaldo.

Yeah, every song made me exhausted like, in my daily life, not too bad.
Save me the time.
That's fine, yeah.
Did the band show up? Yes. Did anyone else? Yes. Did anyone buy your songs? Well, no.
Do you have songs for sale? No. Did your band quit? Yes. Then get a band, practice,
book a gig. Did the band show up? Yes. Did anyone else? Yes. Did anyone buy your songs?
Well, no. Do you have songs for sale? No. Did your band quit? No. Then go record some songs.

Can we get a second microphone hooked up?
Can we get a second microphone hooked up here? Can we get some more musicians to the stage, please?
Hey, there's an amp and there's a synthesizer. Those are there.
And there's microphones and cables and projectors.
There's a lot of music coming from the stage.

It's not ex-day until you can't see the stage anymore.

good afternoon doctor
sit down Mr. Talbot
what have you got to tell me
in your case my boy
diagnosis is extremely difficult
but
but the examination you made this morning
the x-rays
examination discloses one condition
pressure upon certain parts of the brain
this condition
coupled with your belief
that the moon can bring about a change
accomplishes exactly that
during the period
in which your reasoning processes
give way to self-hypnosis
the glands which govern your metabolism
get out of control
like Steve mentioned without a balance wheel
when this happens the gland is going to be
able to generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones
in your case those which bring about the physical transformation
which you experience
by explaining it doesn't help
what can you do about it
operate
a surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one
then there's nothing you can do to help me
there might be
come here my boy
under tropical conditions
which we've tried to duplicate here
this hybrid plant
the very formosa
produces a mold
from which we've been able to distill
a substance which possesses the property of softening
any hard structure composed of calcium salts
bone for instance
with this medium
it might be possible without surgery
to reshape the cranial cavity
and thus eliminate the pressure
you can do that now
can you
unfortunately it'll take
some time to get to the point where you can't do it
some time to produce
insufficient quantity
tonight the moon will be full again

The end of this world
When I first moved out to Pittsburgh, I worked at a TGI Fridays, and I had to wear the suspenders.
Yeah. It was cool for a little bit.
I did. I got a lot of really cool buttons out of that, that I threw out.
But I ran an open mic at TGI Fridays, and I wrote this song, and I got to sing it at Fridays,
where, you know, this song was out of a lot of angst.
It's called 283.
Hi, my name is Amy, and I'll be serving you tonight.
I've got coffee, beer, and smiles, as long as you treat me right.
I don't ask for much in my simple life.
You don't have to dress up or any of the like.
I got bills, I was a student, you see.
And all they give me is 283.
283 is all they give me.
Dollars and cents, ladies and gentlemen.
283.
283 is all they give me.
You can ask me dumb questions, and I'll be honest with a smile.
I will tell you what's good and what's not, as long as you tip me in style.
You see, my life isn't free like you think.
I've got bills to pay, man, they ain't rinky-dink.
All I'm asking is compassion.
You see, all they give me is 283.
283 is all they give me.
Yes, before taxes.
283 is all they give me.
It's been a pleasure to have you.
I hope to see you again.
Sign your name by the X on the line.
Make sure you sign it.
Make sure to add and be kind.
I'm not a second-class citizen.
I pay all my taxes.
I've got discipline.
I'd like to think you appreciate me.
So add 20%.
And that's where you take the first number and you times it by two, and then you add
it all up together, and you sign the right receipt, and you give me my fucking pen back
to 283.
283 is all they give me.
That's 16 cents less than a dollar.
That's less than a soda, people.
283 is all they give me.
Reverend Amy Mhmmm.
Everyone, welcome her to your fold.
Gooble gobble, one of us, one of us.
What's more for Amy Mhmmm, everyone?
Come on.
40 years and a thousand lowerings ago, why this madness of the chase, this boiling blood
and smoking brow?
Why palsy of the arm and the oar, the iron and the lance?
I feel old, starbuck and bowed.
as though I were Adam,
staggering under the vile centuries since paradise.
What is it?
What nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing
commands me against all human lovings and longings
to keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time,
making me do what in my own natural heart I dare not dream of doing?
Is Ahab Ahab?
Is it I, God, or who that lifts this arm?
But if the great sun cannot move except by God's invisible power,
how can my small...
My small heartbeat, my brain think thoughts
unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living,
and not I?
By heavens, man,
we are turned round and round in this world
like yonder windlass,
and fate is the handspring.
All the time, that smiling sky,
and this unsounded sea.
Look ye into its deeps,
and see the everlasting slaughter that goes on.
Who put it into its creatures to chase and fang one another?
Where do murderers go, man?
Who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged before the bar?
By these fairies of the Barrier Reef,
I march in the

that was

doing Melville in the

the guitar music there was our buddy
Reverend Jimmy Ryan
that one was called
Ladyland
full
well
Reverend Amy
was credited on there
by St. Andrew the Impaled
who did that song Get a Band
and that cover
of Gates of Steel
the Devo song was done by
a band called Night of

which we suspect
has something to do with
Reverend Bleepo
Abernathy

and we heard Reverend Fox
ranting at 19X Day
with rock gods in the background
or rock God
Reverend Rock God specifically
on guitar and somebody was on drums
it might have been
Fid,
Chuli
or possibly Pease
and on bass there might have been
Reverend Angry Larry or Reverend
Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis or Reverend Pease
I didn't look at the videos I just
that came off of my recordings
and Reverend Angry Larry of course
of course
is
the angry
angry guitar player
of the church of the subgenius
it's a good thing he has that outlet
man he's such a nice guy
yes
because he's able to release the anger
the broiling
hatred
and anger
hatred of the pink box
the boys
the humans
and mediocritans
and the
and
there's
not the mask
but the thing itself
behind the mask
that I hate
that's the hate
so we're hate haters
it's the hate
hate squared we call it
the hate of hate itself
that's the
well that's one of the subgenius ways
there's lots of those ways
and it is a big mean vicious hate though
the hate of hate
oh it's a hateist
yes
I'm not gonna do
I'm not gonna imitate him
I'm not gonna do it
I'm not gonna do it
I'm not gonna do it
gonna try to avoid it this time
we have some rare recordings
that have we've unearthed
starring our old buddy
Lonesome Cowboy
Dave
he was in a band
called the Chronics
over 100 million years ago
and we dug up copies of that stuff
and I'm expecting him to help narrate them
I think it's him singing on them
it sounds like a little tiny baby Dave
aww
just like you hear on some of the really old subgenius tapes
you hear baby me
yeah
and little tiny baby Dave
and baby Philo
yes
and baby Dr. Hal
and baby
baby Puzzling Adolescence
and baby Bear
but she always sounded like that
yes she always sounds like a baby
yeah and Dr. Leguimin
he always sounded like a baby Dave
he looks kinda like a Gerber's baby
he'd probably bust me
knock my teeth out for saying that
what happened to our man?
I don't know
he should be calling
or he should have already called
yeah I gave him lots of things
you know like if this
how long can this go on?
how long can this go on?
I've been editing the devotional footage
that the two of us shot
just kind of for practice with
what's for me a new editing program
Final Cut Pro X
cause I am a video and film editor
only I haven't
just like I'm a smoker
but I haven't had a cigarette in 20 years
and I've
I haven't really done high-end
editing in a long time, but thanks to our friend Zaphod, I can now, and we're doing that. I've
been practicing on the devotional stuff, and so I've had cause to hear versions of dozens of
Devo songs, and now every time somebody says a word, if that word was in a Devo song, that Devo
song starts running through my head. We still praise Zaphod. Well, he didn't have anything to
do with that. The sad thing is that I've had so much joy out of syncing. Like, when I was a young
editor, it was so long ago that the picture and the sound were on different strips of sprocketed
film, and that's why that little clapboard is at the beginning of shots, where they go, action,
you know, scene three, blap. The editor has to put the plop of the sound with the closing board
in the picture. Well, we didn't have that with the devotional videos, and we also didn't
have a soundtrack on one of our cameras, but it synced up with the one that did have the soundtrack
if you studied the background projection videos, which had a lot of fast cuts, and you could match
cut on the cuts, and that's why lonesome cowboy Dave finally made the cut. The cut of what?
The cut of your jib, my friend. We were just admiring your jib, and it's the old scar from
cut there. You should put your jib in your pants. I have a jib scar that stretches all the way from my penile
orifice all the way to my frozen backside. I was going to say, zip your jib back up there,
chub. Well, in that case, it makes sense, doesn't it? Finally. Nip your jib.
Well, I promised, I already told the beloved listeners that we unearthed the fossilized 45
records.
Les chroniques.
Yeah, the chroniques, not spelled with a K or an X, but with two sets of CHs, right?
Yes, we also tried to chronicle what was going on around us. We were kind of like a news band.
It was punk, but it was intelligent punk.
That's no way to make money, as I'm sure you guys know. No, you said that it was
like number one something in Deutschland.
In Deutschland, yes.
Both Netherlands and Germany.
In Deutschland and Deutschland.
Wow. That's impressive.
Yeah.
And also got some airplane in Great Britain and Ireland, too.
But what century was this we're talking about?
This was the 20th century. Late 20th century.
Not that late, though, was it? Are you talking about like the 70s?
We're talking about the late 70s, yes, and early 80s.
That's when that old punk stuff was punking around.
Yeah.
First starting up.
We used to warm up for the pagans, who later became a famous relic.
Yes.
Of artifacts.
Yes.
Cleveland-oriented artifacts.
Most of the bands that opened up for me later became really, really famous, and now I have
to open up for them.
Yeah. Well, that's the...
Well, spoken word doesn't rock.
I'm starting laughing, but it makes me cry.
Well, hey, at least you could...
Yeah.
At least you...
You learned how to play a guitar and can play a guitar and sing at the same time.
But we should play some of that.
We should play one of those for these listeners, shouldn't we?
Yes. Please.
Okay. This is from...
Oh, this is Test Tube Baby. Now, what was the news that was going on then?
That some doctor and his girlfriend, or not his girlfriend, but a woman met him at a party
and wanted to know if it was possible to do a Test Tube Baby, to create a Test Tube Baby,
and they went ahead and created...
They created one.
And it celebrated its universal anus, the first of never more, whenever that was, 30,
25 years ago or something like that.
Okay. Well, I'm going to play it, man. Here it goes.
Okay, man.
Here it goes.
Test Tube Baby. Test Tube Baby.
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe.
Test Tube Baby. Test Tube Baby.
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe.
Iceberg robots havin' nothing else to do.
They gotta have their babies.
But they don't wanna have children.

We'll make a fortune and he'll do all the work
Half a million dollars for a test tube job
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Test tube baby, mama said
Test tube baby, mama said
Looking in the laboratory, safe on sterile shelf
A million possibilities for 14-footer cells
They don't count around the pony, they just don't have the space
But if you've got the money, you can start your own race
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Test tube baby, test tube baby
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe
Whoa.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Man, I was pogoing so hard, my false teeth and hearing aids flew across the room.
That's what will happen to you when you listen to 35-year-old music.
Me-he, me-heek.
That was great, Dave.
I could hear your voice.
Yeah, I was singing on it, and Dan, psychopath, and Finder, Dean,
I don't know if he was in the band, but he wasn't the original drummer on that take.
He did play percussion on it.
And little tinny doorknob or tiny doorknob Tim Dorman became the bass player.
Wow.
And Bill Chronic Elliott was the other guitar player and played the lead
while I played the cluster vomit that is so regional and well-known to those who live around here.
And I played with myself.
Yep.
I didn't have a band.
And we wanted to write a song about it.
And you wouldn't.
You wouldn't let us.
You wouldn't let us.
Oh.
I didn't want everyone to know my dirty laundry.
You didn't mind showing it off on YouTube.
You certainly didn't.
I took it off of there.
Actually, they took it off.
After titillating the crowd with the noise of your elements,
then you reduced yourself to being a squandering sidekicker.
Man in the bushes looking on.
An Arnold.
Lurker.
Lurker.
Lurker.
Lurker.
Lurker.
Yeah, man.
An on-lurker.
Yeah, man.
Well, that was on a 45 record, what we just heard, right?
Mm-hmm.
A little plastic disc with grooves on it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what's weird is now that there are these bands that weren't, the kids weren't even alive,
and they're into archival stuff and everything,
they just weren't even able to get out and play.









And they collect vinyl, and they listen to this stuff.
And I said, how do you find this interesting?
And I realized that 30s and, you know, 40s and 50s music or 60s music even was interesting to me.
Yeah.
I used to dig up old 1920s and 30s blues records.
Yeah.
Because I just thought that stuff sounded great.
I used to listen to old, really old cowboy records and things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And—
Well, I guess it does make sense.
You can be 28 and like this stuff even though, you know, it's over 28 years old.
Sure.
Sure.
Why not?
Right.
Nobody else is going to like it, but at least somebody does.
At least—
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, actually, I found the copies on YouTube.
It was real easy.
Somebody had, I guess, wanted to share it.
And they took pictures of the cover and the back cover
and the record.
And the record itself, so all those graphics were on there.
And Princess, well, you didn't see them, but they were—the back cover had a picture in
3D, a drawing in 3D.
And it was Dave and the—some former female that you had captured briefly.
I think I did see.
I think it was because I looked this up on the internets.
Oh, you did too?
Yeah.
Well, the 3D cover was of a test tube baby and some woman that was kind of like a Bob
Dobvish piece of graphic art at the time.
And then on the back, there was me as Lee Harvey Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby.
Yeah.
Oh, that was supposed to be you.
I thought one of the other people was supposed to be you.
Yeah, I colored in some hair because I was even balding then.
And so I, you know, just hid it a little bit.
Yeah, I know that I recognize the Lee Harvey Oswald, but that's all I read.
I didn't—and I thought the—like I said, I thought the other guy in there was you.
But the listeners can't see that.
But they can hear the flip side called Calling All Cardinals, right?
Right, which was created because some guy named Turkmani Alsassin or whatever his name
was tried to kill the pope.
Ah.
And then—so I think the pope actually died and somebody else became a pope and Lilith
became the popet, but that was a long time ago back in the pasture.
The popet.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Back when they had popets.
Yeah.
Those special bras they—
And Eric Siren—I remember when the Germans were attacking, but they don't always attack.
Sometimes they recant what they've said.
Well, let's play Calling All Cardinals and see how that works.
I think that's this big button that says—with the P on it.
Ooh, it's wet.
Calling All Cardinals.
Better wear your knee protectors.
Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals.
You're a terrorist objective.
Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals.
You gotta be a vote selector.
Calling All Cardinals.
Turn this plane around because there's something going down in Rome.
I gotta be there.
Turn this plane around.
They got a hostage on the ground in St. Peter's Square, so you better not be there.
Calling All Cardinals.
Make Rome your destination.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.
We can't stand investigation.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.
You know we plan all revelations.
Calling All Cardinals.
Get an actress, pay these dues, call the sequel, John Paul II will shoot and roam.
So you better be there.
We'll stage a big parade and invite the Red Brigades and their ski masks.
You won't see them laughing.
Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

That was cool!
You could tell that was a baby Dave.
Oh, you could definitely tell that was a baby Dave.
It just hatched.
Part of it was the other guitar player singing there
who was saying the setups,
and I would get an actor to play these dudes,
and the other refrain chorus was mine,
and we all would sing together in harmony.
It was a B!
B!
Because that's the way it was done in those days.
Ronald Reagan and the Foresight Footballers
and the Jaco Mamey Orchestra,
all those people, that's where they got their starts.
It sounded great.
Among other things.
Yeah, I thought it had religious purpose.
The guy who used to be,
Don Novello used to be the father of Guido Sarducci.
Yeah!
I pitched him, and he sounded interested in that
Calling All Cardinals part,
but one of the crazed underground cartoonists
out there in Fairfax, California
throttled him and I both at the same time,
and I couldn't find his address or phone number anymore.
What sad throttling.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean...
So, what's excruciating in your painful news area?
Oh, everything's...
I'm going to get an MRI scan next week.
We're all getting all kinds of surgeries and stuff.
I'm going to have...
I'm getting a hip replacement, a spine replacement,
a foot replacement, and both arms replaced.
And a Botox for teeth.
Treatment?
And, uh, yeah.
No, that's...
I would, but that's cosmetic,
and the insurance won't pay for it, so...
And if you think that's a lot,
I'm having twice as many body parts replaced as he is.
Yeah, that's...
I didn't want to...
I know, but...
Women have twice as many body parts as men do anyway,
just to start off with.
Right.
Thank goodness for that.
Just in our feet alone.
Well, I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...


Well, Dave, after that band, what band were you in?
Was it the Strawberry Alarm Clocks, or the...
Yeah, there was the Clark...
The Clocks.
The Clocks.
Which, somehow, because another band in Chicago was named The Clocks,
rather than fighting, duking it out with us,
saying, we have proprietary interest in this name
because we were before you,
we thought we'd change it to Radio Alarm Clocks,
which is too big of a mouthful to chew on
if you've got the wrong kind of...
gums.
Well, you know, we knew a great solo performer called Man.
Yeah.
But it turned out there had been a British rock band called Man Forever,
and he had to change to Man, Incorporated.
So...
And then, you know, back in the old days,
there was poor old Reverend Buck Naked.
He was a very early subgenius.
Yeah.
He had a band called Buck Naked,
and the Jaybirds.
But the problem was,
there was another one in California
that was a lot better known,
and there was another one somewhere else,
and another one somewhere else yet.
Another Buck Naked and the Jaybirds?
It's a pretty obvious name,
especially if your name is Buck Naked.
Of course, your band's going to be the Jaybirds,
and there were at least four bands with that name
until, I think, a homeless crazy guy
killed the famous Buck Naked,
and...
And the infamous Reverend Buck Naked that I knew,
the less said, the better.
Yeah.
Although he did do some wonderful subgenius hymns
back in the ancient, ancient days.
But thanks for the paltry governor,
he was not a gobstink,
and he was a real person.
He was not one of those falsified articles de rue,
as they call them in France, you know?
Yeah, we're all real here.
Real.
Yeah.
Not made of steel.
Man.
Too bad it's real, you know?
It's so real, I'm not playing background music tonight.
Did you notice that?
No, I didn't notice that.
No, it's just so real and just grindingly,
grindingly real.
I had a great thing to read from this
Ian Banks sci-fi book,
The Hydrogen Sonata.
He wasn't the oldest man,
but he imagined what the oldest man in the world
would say about life, the universe, and everything,
and it's really great.
I might read it next week before the conference.
It sounds beautiful.
It will.
But we have to get off the show fairly soon,
although we started late.
Yes.
So I guess we could,
I doubt if incoming show hosts in our time zone,
which in here has to be Dr. Sinister,
he's like the honey badger.
He don't, you know.
Yes, he don't give.
So, yeah.
Well, I was going to ask you if you might publish my book,
but now if you're going to go in October,
you probably won't be able to.
No, I'll be more able to.
In October?
Yeah, just as able as I am now.
Dave's talking,
Dave wrote a science fiction novel,
you might say,
it's certainly not the standard kind.
It's more of a Clockwork Orange-y kind of,
not that it's anything like Clockwork Orange,
but it's too science fiction what Clockwork Orange is.
In other words, it's literature.
And it's,
our agent tried to get it printed,
but they don't read books anymore.
They will read e-books,
and e-books are cheap to publish,
because they don't actually exist.
They don't exist on anything but a phone.
And I just haven't learned how to do that.
I'm still reading Moby Dick on my phone.
It's the only book I have on there.
Although apparently you can get books of the subgenius,
but that's, we don't get, that's different.
I have a plan to become an e-book publisher,
and publish not just your novel,
but one by a subgenius in Australia,
and also our old stuff.
150 old books.




And I have old subgenius books that are out of print.
And so, I just need to get to that.
However, I have this weekly radio show
that keeps infringing on my spare time.
Have you ever known what that was like?
To infringe upon your time?
Yeah.
Sure.
And the summer festivals
where we record the 100,000 hours of cool stuff
that I then have to edit.
So, we got a full plate.
Yes.
Praise Bob, though.
We've got a full plate.
We've got all those minions to help and do stuff for us.
Yeah.
Because we just love minions.
We love followers and minions.
Legions.
And idiots.
Useful idiots, we call them.
Who'll, you know, do anything incompetently.
I'm kidding, actually.
We have no minions.
We prefer to go without minions.
We do have legions, though.
We have legions of collaborators.
We have legions of equals.
He said we have legions.
We do.
And we have legions
particularly of perfect mediation by the Legion.
Yes.
And maybe,和備 Circle
Yeah.
And especially legions of nawad 되지
Yeah, well, that big organ, the dirtiest organ in my body, the right side of my brain,
that was once there, now occupied by a very, very fat, belching, brain-eating amoeba.
I'm glad she's not Belgian.
Well, Princess We lost her left brain a long time ago, but between the two of us, we have one working.
Right, a little duct tape, a little electrical tape, and you guys are on the, yep.
Yep, held together with boogers, snot, and scotch tape, I'm sorry to say.
It's Quote Mad Magazine.
Oh, by the way, that rant I did at the very beginning of the show that the listeners heard,
where I was going about, I got Bob on the brain.
That was actually stolen from a song rant by the great Reverend Kenneth Huey,
who did the cover, painted the cover of Book of the Subgenius, by the way.
He was actually a woman for a while, wasn't he?
No, no.
No, you're.
You're thinking of another Huey.
No, this was St. Ken Huey anyway.
I ripped him off.
But now we have to go.
It's time for the news, and I have to say that it's.
This is the Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius, or one of them, actually.
And you can find more at subgenius.com.
And now, thanks to Fernanda Nandy-Lemur, we're going to go to the news.
Bye, Dave.
Praise Dave.
I want to hear the news.
Okay.
Okay, I'll leave you on.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, where's the news?
I don't know.
See, there you go.
There you go.
I just think I'm so slick.
Right when you think you're right at the slickest moment, that's when you.
From PR News in Washington, I'm the disaster.
Growing evidence suggests that union separatists destroyed PR News days after the Dutch Civil Safety Aviation Organization supplied nearly 300 people.
Growing evidence suggests that the Dutch Civil Safety Aviation Organization supplied nearly 300 people.
Growing evidence suggests that the Netherlands were Dutch.
Diplomats attacked a hospital today after firing rockets from a compound.
John Kerry is fighting and trying heavy firing.
Acclaimed PR News officials denied.
The nation's just turned out to the neck of the year.
First in the East, Growth Economic Directive cast forecast manuals.
It's being cut as group rate tilt reflected.
Today, the National Federation said it expects 3.6% rather than the PR News that initially forecast in Washington.
