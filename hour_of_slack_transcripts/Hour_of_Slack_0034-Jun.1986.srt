1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
You have reached the correct number.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,620
However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,380
This matter is out of our hands.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,580
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,900
and gain control of the situation,

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,560
we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,600
If this had been an actual phone call,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,260
you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time, and message when you hear the tone.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Thank you.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,360
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,620
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,800
We want power! We want power! We want power!

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,660
We'll be alright!

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,460
No, no, no.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,520
No, no, no.

16
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,760
No, no, no, no.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:00,760


18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,500

estilo into being aoneself

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
Who knew that I'd make such a smart decision?

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,180
It's the same thing as fooling around with your mouth guys!

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,700
There's nothing 68 000000000

Recording. Everything's going fine. No trouble.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,740
I have Bob's Nugget!

38
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,360

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Praise Bob!

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Praise Bob!

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Praise Bob!

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,180


45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,280
Praise Bob!

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,880

Praise Bob!

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Praise Bob!

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,000
Praise Bob!

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,320
Praise Bob!

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Praise Bob!

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,320

Bob?

61
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,140
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind every time you say,

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,500
see, hear, or think.

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,360
Bob?

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,600
Bob?

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,400
That's your key phrase.

66
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,460
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,860
We are controlling transmission.

68
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,020
We will control the horizontal.

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,600
We will control the vertical.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,540
Bob!

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,540

00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,280
Hello music is singing.

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,500
Think briefly

We subjected it to careful editing to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste for late night viewing.

it will be shown in the following.

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,860
It is well within the restrictions of the television code,

105
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,000
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas than the industry code.

132

old Procter & Berger movie then they would show the strange films to the

161
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,300
18 earlier morning open-stage

162
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
come in should we the

163

fab benefit player

164
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:31,780
we should put our

165
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
antics

166
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,820
only. This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

167
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,840
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture. Hoping your time is all time, and all your

168
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:57,160
unpermissible truths are happy truths. Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang and Pastor

169
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:06,660
Buck Naked. Yes, dear friends, I think I'm over my jet lag now, but Buck, you notice

170
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:14,280
my new head operation? Yeah, yeah, we had to send you back to Asia for a little bit

171
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:21,280
and send you to Dobstown to get your skull opened and readjusted. That's right, and they're

172
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,500
going to take the sutures out on Wednesday. Our listeners probably think I'm kidding,

173
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:34,320
you know, but oh nay, friends, they think the church is some kind of a joke. They think,

174
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
well, friends, if this...

175
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,500
This church is a joke. If you thought this church was a joke, you're never going to get

176
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:51,440
the punchline. Now, what happened to cassette number one up there? There we go. Some nice

177
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:59,820
churchly music here. Buck, that other mic probably works here. Ah, yes, feel the killing

178
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,060
power. The Harvest. My friends, you know, they...

179
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,160
I know a lot of you still don't understand what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

180
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:19,540
It's sort of like the big conflict between Stevie Steverino and Mickey Miccarano, the

181
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:28,260
secret friends of the baby subgeniuses. Huh? It's the themopods and the usopods, folks,

182
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,320
and this is a cult, you see. If you're pink and you need to be healed, you can call us

183
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,640
here at 823-749-7000.

184
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,180
823-8883. Actually, Buck, don't give them all those numbers, because I don't even want

185
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,440
to talk to half the listeners tonight. We're going to get back to the... a bit of taped

186
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,860
dogma because, I mean, we'll be able to take some here and there.

187
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,140
They've had their fill lately.

188
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, yeah. It's been a call-in show for a month and a half, I guess.

189
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,060
No, not really. We gave them a heck of a course in dogma.

190
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,360
Oh, heck of a course in dogma.

191
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,640
I think we're going to have to do a little bit of a...

192
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,640


193
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,640


194
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:06,640


195
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,040
Well, they are coming right now.

196
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,040


197
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,040


198
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,220
Definitely.

199
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,020
And we're swinging around, and right now, we're playing a wonderful piece of the

200
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,880
feud between uÄuiocafiba and the rowing boys of Bull's Betecia.

201
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,400
Hey, here's his bass guitar, Bill.

202
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,400


203
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,860
And he's playing in the background, And he's finished a very,

204
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,500
quite a nice score there, and the request for that was ourÑÐµcret, and I said,

205
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,500


206
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,360
Scott, if we don't hear his voice now, ì schemati.

207
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,200
All right.

208
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,080
You know, I want him to keep the hay.

209
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:46,920
But nay, nay, we wouldn't want to get this wonderful station, KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas, in any deeper trouble than it's already in.

210
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,020
Ah, yes, because, you know, some people just don't believe in Bob.

211
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,840
They can't believe in Bob.

212
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:01,760
Those are the kind we're trying to reach out to, trying to reach down their throats and grab a hold to that Bob gland and yank it out.

213
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:10,180
Polish it up so they can see it, hold it in front of their face and say, look, you dumb pink, even you have a Bob gland.

214
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh, yeah, it's atrophied, it's gray instead of bright green like it's supposed to be.

215
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,180
But, friends, you can cure yourself.

216
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,260
You're scared, aren't you?

217
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,700
You are.

218
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,580
You're scared.

219
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,640
Yeah, you're scared.

220
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,840
And I don't blame them, really.

221
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,340
You can't stand to hear the truth at this time of night.

222
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Man is always.

223
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,080
Man is always afraid of the unknown.

224
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,720
You think the truth begins at 8.05 AM, don't you?

225
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,480
That's right.

226
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,560
Oh, yeah, the truth begins when you clock in, right?

227
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,900
And, I mean, and then after that.

228
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,660
You stupid bovine pink.

229
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,900
After that, you get paid, because at the end of the day, what else is there, pink boy?

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,740
But, friends, if you want to be saved, there is a book called The Book of the Stars.

231
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:01,920
It's a great book.

232
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,080
It's called The Book of the Subgenius, which we can't really, you know, legally give plugs

233
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,320
for where to find this book.

234
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,100
But you could look at it at the bookstore named after the author of Romeo and Juliet

235
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,800
on the lowest Greenville Avenue.

236
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,120
The Book of the Subgenius.

237
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,720
And, Buck, Buck, I just found out it's official.

238
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,720
Simon and Schuster is going to do the second printing of The Book of the Subgenius, having

239
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,840
successfully bought it from McGraw Hill for only $35.

240
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

241
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:31,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

242
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,500
Praise.

243
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes, Bob's been in New York lately, I think.

244
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,320
More evidence that you can't kill him.

245
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,720
You can't.

246
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,560
That's one of the best things, because we got buried by the conspiracy publisher McGraw

247
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,740
Hill.

248
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,780
Just totally buried.

249
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,200
Well, not, no, that's not true, because all over college campuses everywhere, Buck, Bob's

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,540
face is spray painted in that the word slack scrawled in blood on bridge abutments where

251
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,740
innocent drivers would be.

252
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,480
We wanted to keep it in National Historic Area agency Law muchÃ­simo.

253
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,280
And in a fresh day ofimizng on Swan Lake,

254
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:13,520
Aapo Venizio was burnt to the ground foruki il ughar is contrary to common belief,

255
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,460
three, it was breathing fire.

256
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,100
Once again, enters College was closed down plastic waste depopulation byå¨Sheoh James

257
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,100


258
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,100


259
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,100

by the end is rare.

264
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,320
The mediocrities, the pit boys, the hippies, the trickies in the admin.

265
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,520
I wonder.

266
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,640
What?

267
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,080
If God were to come to earth, would they find him so strange?

268
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
That they would be afraid?

269
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,500
And would they shoot him?

270
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,260
Did not his son come once, Pedro?

271
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,020
And they kneeled him to a cross.

272
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,420
And then spent two thousand years learning to believe in him?

273
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,500
All things take time, Pedro.

274
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,520
We will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.

275
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,680
You talk like a madman.

276
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,700
But I live like a sane one.

277
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,480
I was a fascist when Mussolini was on top.

278
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,020
Now that he has been deposed, I am anti-fascist.

279
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
When the Germans were on top,

280
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,380
I was fanatically pro-German.

281
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,960
Now I am fanatically pro-American.

282
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,440
You will find no more loyal partisans in all of Italy than myself.

283
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,480
You are a shameful opportunist.

284
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,940
What you do not understand is that it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.

285
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
You have it backwards.

286
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,060
It is better to live on your feet than to die on your knees.

287
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,800
Enjoy life like Bach.

288
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,780
Get thee hence, Satan!

289
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,740
Do not be afraid.

290
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,300
I am not here to harm you.

291
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,120
He is the first of your kind to attain immortality.

292
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,580
Immortality?

293
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,480
We are not interested in that kind of immortality.

294
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,260
I know you want to destroy me.

295
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,580
But listen.

296
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,180
Please listen.

297
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,900
I only want to help you.

298
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,760
I have chosen you.

299
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,880
I am sure that is very flattering.

300
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
But I must get on with my work now.

301
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,400
When you are confronted with a serious subject like the Kennedy assassination,

302
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,640
with as much information as is available on it,

303
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,680
and instead, what you want to talk about is that what interests you is the Church of the subgenius,

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,320
well, do not complain when you see what goes on.

305
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,080
Because frankly, the Church of the subgenius is nonsense.

306
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,980
It is trivial.

307
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,360
It has no significance

308
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,180
for anything that anybody is going to care about for any length of time.

309
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,540
You know, it may be lots of fun, and I do not mean to belittle it as such,

310
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,320
but when you are faced with a serious situation,

311
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,560
you have got a world that is on the verge of nuclear holocaust,

312
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,740
and all democratic institutions in this country that have not already vanished are under severe attack,

313
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,440
and when all that comes to mind is the Church of the subgenius,

314
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,860
I have got to think that is one of the reasons we are in the trouble we are in.

315
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,000
Well, just to try and put the Church of the subgenius to rest,

316
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,220
those of you who are not familiar,

317
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,940
the Church of the subgenius is essentially a group that,

318
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
and I am sure that people will argue with me with this,

319
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,140
but it is essentially a sort of a comedy routine.

320
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
I mean, they may have a philosophical point,

321
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,700
but it is based on humor.

322
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,500
There are articles about it in John Rubenstein's,

323
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,180
John Carroll's column in the Chronicle,

324
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,020
and things of that nature.

325
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,780
It is more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.

326
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,180
It is about as politically weighty, or less politically weighty,

327
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,760
than, you know, Saturday morning kids' TV.

328
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,780
So there is nothing to it.

329
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,040
Okay.

330
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,880
So what is left, children?

331
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,720
You look around at this youth culture,

332
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
this political universe,

333
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,680
you ask yourself,

334
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,900
well, what the hell is left?

335
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,560
Elvis Presley is a fat monster?

336
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,280
The Ramones are covering the Jokers brothers?

337
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,620
What the hell is left?

338
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,960
The Church of the subgenius, children.

339
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,740
That is what is left.

340
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,260
Say it with me, brother Doug.

341
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,600
We may just be a joke,

342
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,600
but it is a joke you can believe in!

343
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,540
Children! Children!

344
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,280
Children! If a joke is a lie,

345
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,660
it is left to believe in!

346
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,680
Don't blame Bob!

347
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,360
He doesn't make history!

348
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,580
He just exploits it!

349
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,500
Hi, Bob!

350
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,740
Right, Bob?

351
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,220
Bob?

352
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,600
Bob?

353
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,200
Hi, sir.

354
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm a major mystery.

355
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,840
You're a convincing talker about very unconvincing things.

356
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,620
Whatever men do not understand,

357
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,340
they find unconvincing.

358
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,100
But please don't suppose I'm dangerous

359
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,460
because I'm unfamiliar.

360
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,560
I ask that you believe in me.

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,360
I have an adamant human character.

362
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,540
And would you believe some people,

363
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,720
some people think this is funny?

364
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,060
They think it's funny.

365
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,420
They think we're joking.

366
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,560
Yeah, they think,

367
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,040
they think, oh, Bob's a prophet, maybe,

368
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,220
or Bob's a, Bob's a good man,

369
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,120
but they don't believe he's the son of Jehovah One,

370
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,220
alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy

371
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,600
who's a...

372
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
who's been manipulating the subgeniuses

373
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,400
versus the conspiracies.

374
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,080
Oh, but he is!

375
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,020
Yeah.

376
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,380
Oh, but he is, children.

377
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,460
Yes.

378
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,000


379
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:37,540


380
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,440


381
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,260
Yes.

382
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,260


383
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,440
Yes.

384
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,460
Yes.

385
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,500


386
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,060
Yes.

387
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,060


388
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,060


389
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,060


390
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,700
Yes.

391
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:42,720


392
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,020
Yes.

393
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,320
Yes.

394
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:43,980
Yes.

395
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Yes.

396
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,300
Yes.

397
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,820
Yes.

398
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:54,600
Yes.

399
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah.

400
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,060
No conspiracy,

401
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,740
as much as it hates me.

402
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,760
But me and Bob will get them.

403
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,820
Just you wait and see.

404
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,840
For as long as they have run things,

405
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,140
they have turned them into plastic.

406
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,520
The time has come to get them back,

407
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,580
here's how I look at it.

408
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,180
That conspiracy is nasty,

409
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,960
and they take us for their patsies,

410
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,220
but we know that they are just a bunch of...

411
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,420
And when we defeat them, we will kill them and we'll eat them.

412
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,200
And then we'll go and get ourselves some beers.

413
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Now Bob has come to fight them.

414
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,700
That's how we know we'll win.

415
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,800
And we know to serve them is our only sin.

416
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,760
We won't have long to wait now.

417
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,160
The end is coming soon.

418
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,460
We'll march happy toward the future because we did what we must do.

419
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,820
Underwater vacations, Bob will rule in all the nations.

420
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,940
We'll be farming vegetation out on Mars.

421
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,940
Because we killed them and we ate them.

422
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,500
Said, boy, we sure did hate them.

423
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,320
And then we made the rounds of all the bars.

424
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,540
Oh.

425
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:19,760
Oh.

426
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:19,980
Oh.

427
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,140
Oh.

428
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,140


429
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,140


430
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,840
Oh.

431
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:21,840


432
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:21,840


433
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:21,840


434
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:21,840


435
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,220
This is the night man calling from K-N-O-N.

436
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,280
I'm telling you, it's getting tough down here.

437
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,340
I mean, times are rough.

438
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm telling you, the other day the phone lines were jumping up and down.

439
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm doing the James Brown.

440
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,500
I pushed down on line number three.

441
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,960
And then I tell you what, there's a telephone company.

442
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,160
And all they were saying to me was, where the hell's my money?

443
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,200
Where the hell's my money?

444
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,900
I said, listen, man, I really don't know.

445
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,660
He says, I don't care if I put you on hold.

446
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,920
Then I pushed down on line.

447
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,840
number four and there was that lawyer calling me up man he was saying just as before

448

465
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,220
drink too much and suddenly i was seized by this force that i couldn't really completely understand

jr bob dobbs who will live forever it's very similar very similar and all of a sudden i just

470
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,500
france

471
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,060
how often have you lay asleep and had strange and fantastical visions messages from beyond

472
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,800
or wonderful fantastic dreams of yourself and a squad of nubile cheerleaders and a vat of warm

473
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,140
pudding and just as you reach for that cute young thing starred in all your one-handed

474
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:45,120
silent movies she's transformed before your horrified eyes her flesh peels away it dissolves

475
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,100
to reveal not a sex kitten but a hideous slathering hellcat

476
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,440
ectoplasmic eye core oozing from every pore and razor keen fangs which oh god it's too late they're

477
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,400
closing on your staff of life too late you scream no no no this can't be happening it's all just a

478
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,300
horrible nightmare wake up wake up wake up and you snap awake writhing spasmodically and covered in

479
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:17,460
a cold sweat which which is strangely like that hellcat's eye core and was it a dream can't happen

480
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,060
you say really

481
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,780
because how often do you look at the world and see hunger and hatred in the finger of a doddering

482
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,860
cancer-ridden old man poised on the trigger of nuclear armageddon and slackless conspiracy pink

483
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:37,100
boys cheering wildly from the sidelines waving billion dollar defense contracts and saying it

484
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:43,180
can't happen here and suddenly you find yourself screaming no no is this just some horrible dream

485
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,620
wake up wake up yes friends the world is a dream and bob is here to help you wake up wake up wake up

486
00:27:49,640 --> 00:28:19,520
bob's here to douse us with buckets of cold beer and wake us up bob wants us to return to that state of perfect slack which the older gods enjoy sleeping in the dimensionless cold waste for in the beginning all were asleep in a state of perfect slack until one rebel god yay friends the dreaded negi himself dared dared to dream and nerka was displeased and caused us all to wake from slack into this horrible walking nightmare

487
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:25,980
All of man's history since that rude awakening has been a constant struggle to stay asleep.

488
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,620
Bob has come to show us the way.

489
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,740
Awaken us from this nightmare of sleep.

490
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,660
Quit your job.

491
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,460
Flack off.

492
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,260
Drink till you pleat through your nose.

493
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,840
Laugh till your guts bleed.

494
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,020
Copulate till your hooter blisters.

495
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,900
Then collapse into that state of perfect flack.

496
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,360
Yes, friend.

497
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Your bed is a temple and your pillow the altar.

498
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,480
Worship Narco.

499
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,480
Praise Bob.

500
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,260
And then I was okay.

501
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,480
Oh my good praise, Bob.

502
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,760
Help me somebody.

503
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,740
That's one of the most beautiful, lovely testimonials to the power of Bob's love and hate.

504
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,220
Absolutely.

505
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,280
This caller wins a souvenir Dobbs winding sheet.

506
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,520
Victory Dobbs winding sheet.

507
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,320
And he also wins a bucket of pills.

508
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,320
Dying away.

509
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,620
Praise Bob.

510
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,200
Oh.

511
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,240
Somebody.

513
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,440
You guys have a great night.

514
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,620
Good night.

515
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,420
Oh, caller.

516
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
He went to the moon.

517
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,200
He's gone.

518
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,420
Ride the rocket, caller.

519
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,520
Everybody.

520
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,780
Well, okay, thanks.

521
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
Okabalaponga rocket to the moon.

522
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,540
Okabalaponga rocket to the moon.

523
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,920
I don't understand this Okabalaponga stuff.

524
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,540
What is the Olokabalawonga?

525
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,260
Why are they here?

526
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,720
This was a river in the darkest part of the steaming jungle.

527
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,660
Somebody broke the station.

528
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,140
Hi.

529
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,880
It is appointed that no man wants to die.

530
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,800
But after this, the judgment.

531
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,540
We must call Melvin of the East.

532
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,320
We are as all an unclean thing.

533
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,040
Hello, my friend.

534
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,360
How are you?

535
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,660
And all our consciousness is as our filthy rags.

536
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,160
I'd like to say I'm glad that you read my tape.

537
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,380
And I hope you play it because you're going to love it.

538
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,720
And all the listeners will be looking forward to listening to it next week, won't they?

539
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,400
Oh, is that so?

540
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,400
Would they?

541
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm sure that they would, Mr.

542
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:18,760


543
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,260
Dr. Reverend Custer.

544
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,640
We've got fans of yours coming.

545
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:21,860
We've got fans of yours.

546
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,080
King of all the universe, PP.

547
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,540
I can't get any peace on the street, Mr. PP.

548
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,360
Well, I forgot to tell you about the Mr. PP fan club that I am forming.

549
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,140
Apparently, it's already ruined.

550
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,680
My membership is only 27 inches.

551
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,380
Oh, $27.

552
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,620
Excuse me very much.

553
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,860
Well, that was not really a real commercial offer.

554
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,160
I mean, some of the people who audit this station are thick, you know.

555
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,120
But I guarantee if they give to the pledged ticket, they will give to the person who

556
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


557
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


558
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


559
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


560
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


561
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


562
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


563
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,120


564
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,560
has the pledge drive that I heard the announcer saying in about two weeks.

565
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,120
Ah, the pledge drive.

566
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,420
The harvest.

567
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,880
I can't wait because our slack needs to stay on the air.

568
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,840
We need Bob.

569
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,760
And I hope everybody contributes when it's time next week.

570
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,020
Well, that was really touching.

571
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,060
Thanks for sharing that with us.

572
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,420
Because this show has really inspired me to go on and do a lot bigger and better things,

573
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,500
if you know what I mean.

574
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,280
I think we do.

575
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,200
Oh, yes.

576
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,740
Speaking of blistered Hooters.

577
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,660
Speaking of blistered Hooters, how do you make that noise?

578
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,100
You go, I'm going to make a noise.

579
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,100


580
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,100


581
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,100


582
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,100


583
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,100


584
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,780
You go, ah, I can't do it.

585
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,460
Okay, a short course on the sleuth.

586
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:22,680
Okay.

587
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,700
How do you do it?

588
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,100
Okay.

589
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,020
Take your index finger.

590
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,380
My index finger.

591
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:28,700
All right.

592
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,900
Now find your throat gland.

593
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,320
All right, throat gland.

594
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,420
Now strum it vigorously on your throat gland.

595
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,780
Why don't you say E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I.

596
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:43,820
E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I, E-I.

597
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,080
You need this to put you on a vibrational plane that you can't get to.

598
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,080


599
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,600
That will invite Bob's attention upon you, friends, and because of that, why...

600
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:54,960
Judgment.

601
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,580
We must call Melvin of the Apes.

602
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,460
We are, as all, an unclean thing and all our righteousness is as our filthy rags, and we

603
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,880
all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities...

604
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,520
There they go, they're fading like a leaf.

605
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,040
...have been taken away.

606
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,260
I just wanted to ride the rocket.

607
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,060
Hi, caller.

608
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,500
Hi, caller.

609
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,280
Hi there, you all.

610
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,840
Caller, caller, what happened, caller?

611
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,560
As it is written, there is none righteous.

612
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,500
No, not one.

613
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:15,600
There you are.

614
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,020
Who are we called?

615
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,960
We're some lonely stupid people on the radio and we need you.

616
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,660
Yeah, we talk like this all the time because it's so stupid.

617
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,260
Oh no!

618
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,880
I thought I was calling him a lonely stupid person.

619
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,320
Was that you who dropped the collar?

620
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,980
Somebody dropped the collar.

621
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,760
I'm a caller.

622
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,640
Oh, you're a caller.

623
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm a caller.

624
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,780
Oh, okay, well what do we do now?

625
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,320
Let's talk.

626
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,320
Well, we're supposed to ride the rocket.

627
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,700
Let's goob on it, baby.

628
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,280
He wants to have a powwow. He wants to have a palaver.

629
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,820
I wish this person would use his own dialect.

630
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,160
I know.

631
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,660
That's all I can say.

632
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,340
Can we talk like that person from Kansas?

633
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,300
Does anybody speak this guy's lingo?

634
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,800
Can we ride the rocket now?

635
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:55,020
He wants to have a palaver or a powwow, but I don't know if anyone understands the way this guy talks.

636
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,420
I've got a grip on the nose cone here. I just want to ride the rocket.

637
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,940
Keep your hand to yourself there.

638
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,240
Oh!

639
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,880
Don't stick your finger in that rock.

640
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,540
Rock.

641
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,540
Just five minutes. You're a listener.

642
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,700
Behind us like a giant balloon.

643
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,100
I'm a listener.

644
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,760
Speak for yourself, doctor.

645
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,600
By any given name.

646
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,360
Sit up and talk, you listener, you.

647
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,520
Kapoofah!

648
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Kapoofah! Yay!

649
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,640
Sit up and talk, you listener, you.

650
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:29,080
This is Kano and 90.9 FM in Dallas, Fort Worth.

651
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,820
Buck, have we got any souls that are waiting to be saved?

652
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,840
Pathetic so-called listeners?

653
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,900
No? Good.

654
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,680
Yeah, I think so.

655
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,380
Oh. All right.

656
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,200
We'll let one more...

657
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,640
What do you got to say?

658
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,120
Save me. I need to be saved.

659
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,120
Ah, are you pink?

660
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,160
I am a white guy. I'm a pink guy.

661
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,260
That has nothing to do with pinkness as the church defines it.

662
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,500
Right, right. You could be any color in the rainbow.

663
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,320
It's not a racial thing, I know. It's a spiritual aptitude that belongs to my soul.

664
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,500
So, how long have you been staying off your feet, buddy?

665
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,360
Approximately 12 years.

666
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,300
Uh-huh.

667
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,120
So, in other words, your foot gland is like totally atrophied. Is that right?

668
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,100
That's correct. I need the Savior and the power of Bob.

669
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,340
Everybody needs it.

670
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:31,920
Has Bob seen your money, dear friend, your love offering, your tithe, that which is most important to you?

671
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,180
Yay. And Bob comes and begs in the night.

672
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,740
Yes, he's coming and begging right now. It feels good, but it's embarrassing to have to beg.

673
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,480
You know what I mean?

674
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:42,800
Yes.

675
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,020
That's P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

676
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,340
Friends, remember that number. It's ingrained in your memory now because as soon as you hear that trigger word, Bob.

677
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,480
140306, Dallas, Texas.

678
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,600
No, 75214.

679
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,580
And just, yes.

680
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,240
Yeah, 140306, 75214.

681
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:10,920
And friends, all you have to do is ask for information and you'll find out just what it takes to get into subgenius heaven.

682
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,060
Well, tell me, sir.

683
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,160
Or subgenius hell.

684
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:13,480
Right.

685
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:24,420
I'll tell you what, by the time you get to those other heavens, my friend, you'll be wishing, wishing to dogs, wishing to God that you'd made it to subgenius hell.

686
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,960
Have you tried a short duration personal Savior?

687
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,300
Yes.

688
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,540
What?

689
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:37,360
I tried the Ronco Mail Order Live by Bob Light kit from Boys Life Incorporated.

690
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm afraid it did not work very well.

691
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,340
I resulted in having half my face melted off.

692
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,520
How about Stevie Steverino or Mickey Macaroni?

693
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,600
No, I have not.

694
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,120
Neither one?

695
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
Buck, I think this is a hopeless case.

696
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,300
Please, I must have.

697
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,060
I know, I'm sorry.

698
00:35:53,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I just, I can whiff your psychic stench with my third nostril and third other gland.

699
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,420
Let's give this caller a little assignment and have him call us back in a few weeks.

700
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,180
Say 10,000 hail bobs and, yeah, drink 50 beers and come back.

701
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,040
Come back in two weeks.

702
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,500
Well, no, no, how about this?

703
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm going to give you an assignment.

704
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,920
Yes, please.

705
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,980
All right, we're going to change your diet.

706
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,620
Yes.

707
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,600
I want you to eat lunch and dinner at Taco Bell every day for the next three weeks.

708
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,660
And I want you to get kitchen matches.

709
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,480
And I want you to start practicing pyroflatulation.

710
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,520
That's a, actually that is a very good idea.

711
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,980
I was, I was starting to treat this person harshly.

712
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,160
But there is, you know, that practice.

713
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,480
I mean, the practice of pyroflatulation is probably the one thing that could save you.

714
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,740
Just be very careful, you know.

715
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,820
You don't want to cause a backfire or anything like that.

716
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,100
That's true.

717
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:57,120
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, little risks like that to me are nothing.

718
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,640
That's fine.

719
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,380
That is, you're right.

720
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,720
It's nothing compared to the possible benefits.

721
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,540
And, you know, a holy man can read.

722
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,480
It's like your aura when he sees that blueish or whatever color flame comes with the pyroflatulation.

723
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,560
He can read your, he can tell what kind of health you're in, you know, what your astrological sign is,

724
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,520
and all sorts of, every manner of other diagnostic things.

725
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,000
So this is a three-week spiritual journey, caller.

726
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:31,920
And we want you to eat at Taco Bell lunch and dinner every day for the next three weeks and practice pyroflatulation.

727
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:32,740
Pyroflatulation.

728
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,960
And wear your underwear on your head.

729
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,920
I know that sounds ridiculous.

730
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,400
No, no.

731
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,060
Hey, listen.

732
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,620
It worked for Dr. Drummond.

733
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,060
He did it for three years.

734
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,060
Just practice pyroflatulation, caller, and call us back, okay?

735
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,740
Yes, certainly.

736
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,920
Praise Bob.

737
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,000
Praise Bob.

738
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,660
Well, in the meantime, let's face it, friends.

739
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,280
It ain't easy.

740
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,660
I mean, some of you, some of you just ain't gonna make it into subgenius, even into subgenius hell,

741
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,180
much less Asgard or Doctors for Bob concert.

742
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,120
And, you know, it's just bad luck.

743
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,680
It's sad.

744
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,480
Asgard, are we allowed to say that on the air?

745
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,860
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

746
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,040
Oh, yeah, that's a play for you.

747
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,040


748
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,560
The place name, right?

749
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah.

750
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,080
Okay.

751
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,300
So, friends.

752
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,660
Valhalla?

753
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,640
Let's delve deep down back inâ¦

754
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:14,680
It's a pretty classy littleâ¦

755
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,440
Oh, Valhalla?

756
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,700
Yeah, pretty classy littleâ¦

757
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,760
That's where heroes slain for Bob, those who are slain in the service of Bob go to Valhalla,

758
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,880
but anyone who paid $20 goes to Asgard.

759
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,980
There's good hunting in Valhalla.

760
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,600
Yeah.

761
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:28,940
Good hunting.

762
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,360
Yeah.

763
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,780
And good sales jobs in Asgard.

764
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,980
But there's other steps beyond.

765
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,720
Those are mereâ¦

766
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
those are just the ones you can sort of comprehend.

767
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,660
Those are the ones that we living beings can get a vague glimpse of

768
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,840
in our myths and legends and that which Bob hath bespake unto ye.

769
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:59,120
By the way, Ivan, I'd like to say to our callers that 823-7490 and 823-8801

770
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,060
are the only lines available tonight because the other one has been appropriated

771
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,940
by someone else for private use.

772
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,580
Well, I want to dive back into the media barrage world.

773
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,500
Let's just listen to a little media barrage.

774
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,140
Well, let's just do that.

775
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,480
Let's do that.

776
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:31,380
Let's do that.

777
00:40:41,920 --> 00:41:02,100
Let's do that.

778
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,920
Let's do that.

779
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,920
Let's do that.

780
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,520
Let's do that.

781
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,760
Let's do that.

782
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,240
Let's do that.

783
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,900
Let's do that.

784
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,120
Let's do that.

785
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,640
Caller, scream.

786
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,040
Well, that's coming out of a speaker up there.

787
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,060
Coming out of a speaker.

788
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,560
She's on cue.

789
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,220
Is there something here that needs to be on?

790
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,100
She's on cue.

791
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,720
Hello, calling.

792
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:19,620
Oh!

793
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,360
Hello?

794
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,260
No, it didn't change anything, did it?

795
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,140
Oh, there we go, caller.

796
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,560
Is it working now?

797
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,740
Yes, it is.

798
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,560
It's working great.

799
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,260
Good.

800
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,680
Well, you say hi, girl.

801
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,860
It was normal.

802
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,700
Warren Ward who came in and saved us.

803
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
Oh, you want to hear Bucks?

804
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,120
Yes, it's so sexy.

805
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,480
Hi, girls.

806
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,180
Oh, my gosh, it's so sexy.

807
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,780
And I just wanted to say

808
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,000
ka-vomit to everybody out there.

809
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,680
Ka-vomit.

810
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,460
All right.

811
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,540
What a wonderful statement

812
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,840
of faith in the called

813
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,520
ministers of Bob.

814
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,620
Particularly Buck.

815
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,000
That Buck naked, that great

816
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,020
sexy guru here.

817
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,300
And if you could only see him, gals, boy.

818
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,260
I won't complete that.

819
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,460
There was actually a trans-vomit

820
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:18,700
experience.

821
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,820
We do know everybody's crazy about him.

822
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,880
Oh, absolutely. I know Buck's got so many fans.

823
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,540
It was Stang's turn last week.

824
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,820
More and more.

825
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,100
Well, listen,

826
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,640
young lady, you know...

827
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,160
Leave her on.

828
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,080
Oh, yeah.

829
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,180
We're going to put you in subgenius land now.

830
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,820
What's your name?

831
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,800
My name's Laurel.

832
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:41,720
Laurel.

833
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,180
Yes.

834
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,600
And you're about to go into subgenius land with us.

835
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,360
Oh, good.

836
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,040
We got a deck controversy here, right, Stang?

837
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,580
Here I am.

838
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,080
Here he is.

839
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,140
What there's left of me after all that's happened.

840
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,860
They're going to take me to subgenius land.

841
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,300
Right here?

842
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,560
Here I am inside the bub.

843
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,000
Where?

844
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,640
Inside the bub.

845
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,760
That's what they call the bubble.

846
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,420
The bub.

847
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:04,980
Oh.

848
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,260
You're with us.

849
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:06,920
Strange.

850
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,040
Strange place.

851
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,720
Here we go.

852
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,240
It is weird.

853
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,020
Come on, Laurel.

854
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,400
Being what it is where it is.

855
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,320
How do you like it?

856
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,260
I love it.

857
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,680
It's quicker than you thought, huh?

858
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,300
Yeah.

859
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,360
Bouncing about from one now to another.

860
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,700
Good place to be, though, if you want to get away to it all.

861
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:25,720
Go ahead.

862
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,000
Come on in with us.

863
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,640
Because here we are.

864
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,180
Well, how do we go?

865
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,860
See, I'm imagining the trip with me.

866
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,840
Right through those same airwaves and up that little telephone wire.

867
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,580
Here we are floating.

868
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,500
Let's go.

869
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


870
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


871
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


872
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


873
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


874
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


875
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:34,500


876
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,280
Let's go down this side.

877
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,560
Inside its curving walls.

878
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,200
Wow.

879
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,320
Is that eye, eye, eye?

880
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,020
Gee, not a corner in sight.

881
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,100
Slip around on those curving walls.

882
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,500
Whoa.

883
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,820
Sparkling radiance from some outside imagination.

884
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,500
Slippery, ain't they?

885
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,080
Yeah.

886
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,720
Ah, that was a nice guy.

887
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,660
Peaky rainbows of fractured light from every curving interior.

888
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,960
How about that fractured light?

889
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,700
Oh, it's like photons.

890
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,840
And only you and I.

891
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,040
It's the bub, man.

892
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,940
You got to get into the bub, listeners.

893
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,600
Only you and I paying such inexpensive close attention.

894
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,300
Listen to that.

895
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:03,940
It's wet.

896
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,280
It's wet.

897
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,500
It's wet.

898
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


899
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


900
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


901
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,500


902
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,900
It's dripping in the bub.

903
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,540
You can hear him.

904
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,340
Out there somewhere.

905
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,480
Where's the bub?

906
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,780
The muted ritual of their horns and noisemakers.

907
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,220
Hold my hand.

908
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,800
I'll lead you down.

909
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,000
Look at those mutes holding their rituals.

910
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,640
I can see them.

911
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,680
See them?

912
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:18,580
Yeah.

913
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,700
And you're imagining that.

914
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,520
Weird looking, aren't they?

915
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,240
Yeah.

916
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,160
Old kisses and hugs.

917
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,540
It's a kick, man.

918
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,680
But that's out there.

919
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,360
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

920
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,180
How can you call a lady like this a man?

921
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,420
That's like burned out hippie stuff.

922
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,480
All that we have is the deep.

923
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,340
Deep in our wide awake dream.

924
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:37,820
Oh.

925
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,620
You can see a strange and wonderful angel slow motion wrestle.

926
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,640
Here we go.

927
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,180
Wow.

928
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,600
On a levitating map of gray.

929
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,060
Gray matter.

930
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,320
That's cool.

931
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:48,560
And what?

932
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,360
An awesome, awesome, awesome demon.

933
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,200
Appropriate thought.

934
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,480
All tangled in slipping grips with the inappropriate.

935
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,820
That's what I suffer from.

936
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,240
I suffer from inappropriate thoughts.

937
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,900
Are you having inappropriate thoughts, sister?

938
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,020
I don't know.

939
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:12,940
A little bit too inappropriate.

940
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,500
We can wrestle.

941
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,420
That's the best time.

942
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,440
With what to do with ourselves.

943
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,600
When you're in the bug.

944
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,620
You know what to do with yourself.

945
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,240
We can make some resolutions, team.

946
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,100
Isn't that the time that we're in?

947
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,180
Oh, yes.

948
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,620
Resolution time.

949
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,260
I resolve.

950
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,100
I'd like to resolve to do the movie.

951
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,260
What movie?

952
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,640
Yes.

953
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,460
The movie.

954
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,460


955
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,460


956
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,460


957
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,460


958
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,460


959
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:34,480
The movie.

960
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:34,480


961
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,840
The Devout Catalyst.

962
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:37,640
What?

963
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,300
That'd be a good name for it.

964
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,700
I don't know about that.

965
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,360
The Devout Catalyst.

966
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,500
Affected by nothing that's happening around.

967
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,220
What would your movie be, my daughter?

968
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,760
Causing a kind of strange reaction.

969
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,180
Chemistry.

970
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,400
It's your movie.

971
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,800
And you're the director.

972
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,720
Example that.

973
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,380
And the scar.

974
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,400
And the sensor.

975
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,000
I haven't done.

976
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,880
Like the chemist.

977
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,020
How about the mica slug?

978
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,400
That I got started on that ink.

979
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,400
The mica slug?

980
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,560
The mica slug?

981
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:03,800
Yeah.

982
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,460
The slug.

983
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:04,460


984
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:04,460


985
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,180
Wait a minute.

986
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,380
Let's take Ken Nordeen out here for just a second.

987
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,360
The mica slug?

988
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:10,720
Yeah.

989
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,880
Let's hear about that.

990
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,320
Is that like a prairie squid?

991
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,580
I mean, they don't.

992
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,460
Like what?

993
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,360
Prairie squid.

994
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,880
I didn't know that girls even knew about prairie squids.

995
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,500
But, I mean, what is, tell us about the mica slug.

996
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,600
Mica slugs are slugs made out of mica.

997
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,500
Well, they're hard.

998
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,460
You know, like the stuff they have on countertops.

999
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,460
And they're real easy to crack.

1000
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1001
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1002
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1003
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1004
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1005
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1006
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1007
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1008
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1009
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,460


1010
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,700
They're crunchy.

1011
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,680
You don't eat them though.

1012
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,980
You're not supposed to eat them.

1013
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,360
Well, I don't eat prairie squids until I'm through with them, if you know what I mean.

1014
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,920
Is this the same thing?

1015
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,120
I mean, are we talking, I don't think we're talking about this.

1016
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,860
I don't think so.

1017
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,840
Mica slugs are hard, right?

1018
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,320
Right.

1019
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,760
When they're crispy?

1020
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,100
Yeah.

1021
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,260
Well, what do you do with them?

1022
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,520
You just kind of crunch them under your feet.

1023
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,080
Yeah.

1024
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,940
You stomp on them.

1025
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,780
They give you a little stick while, you know, when you're in that slimy universe.

1026
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,160
Uh-huh.

1027
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:03,820
They give you a little stick.

1028
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,340
We take them sometimes to the start club, if we can find them.

1029
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:12,220
Oh, that place, I've heard that place is crawling with mica slugs, but they don't have any kind

1030
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,280
of decent, they have that new modern prairie squid.

1031
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,040
You know, it's great if you're looking for mica slugs, but for Amazonian mollusks or prairie

1032
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,820
squid or anything like that, they always have the shaved cellophane wrapped variety, you

1033
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,020
know.

1034
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:26,780
Uh-huh.

1035
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,080
They're de-scented.

1036
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,420
They don't have the scent gland on them anymore.

1037
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:30,820
Yeah.

1038
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,080
It's disgusting.

1039
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,600
It's a new plastic world, I guess.

1040
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,620
I guess so.

1041
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,020
The apartments back there, they all got rat shrimps in the walls, they'll clatter around,

1042
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,260
rattling in the walls, rat shrimps.

1043
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,520
They have what?

1044
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,820
You've seen a rat shrimp, haven't you?

1045
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,060
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:47,720
Yeah.

1047
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:48,800
Yeah.

1048
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,780
They make that clicking sound on the wall.

1049
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,540
Daughter, we love you.

1050
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,200
Really?

1051
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,140
We love you.

1052
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1053
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1054
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1055
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1056
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1057
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1058
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1059
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1060
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1061
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1062
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,140


1063
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,840
Bob loves you.

1064
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,760
I felt that before, you know.

1065
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,120
Don't you love Bob?

1066
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,580
I've always had this feeling that Bob loves me.

1067
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,500
Bob doesn't love everyone, my daughter.

1068
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:22,460
Bob is most selective in who he chooses as his vessel.

1069
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,800
Who doesn't he like?

1070
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:26,560
Adolf Hitler.

1071
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,700
He doesn't like Nazis.

1072
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,200
Oh, I don't blame him.

1073
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,120
And there's a bully named Max Wade who beat him up.

1074
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,600
He beat him up one time in elementary school, and Bob hates Max Wade.

1075
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,940
And I hope Max Wade is listening.

1076
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:46,300
Well, I know this guy named David, and he thinks that it may be neo-Nazi-like, and Jeff,

1077
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,480
they both think so.

1078
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,140
Well, that's a good, you know.

1079
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,940
We would be no kind of church at all if there wasn't any controversy, right?

1080
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,020
Do you think it's not neo-Nazi, though, is it?

1081
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,380
Well, it's everything.

1082
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,040
What?

1083
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,060
We wouldn't hide that?

1084
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,740
The Church of the Subgenius?

1085
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,240
Yeah.

1086
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,100
Neo-Nazi?

1087
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,420
Oh, this is the master race, my daughter, because it comes in every color.

1088
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,220
That's neat.

1089
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,180
Yeah, that's a good slogan.

1090
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,460
It sells a lot of church publications.

1091
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,020
I like that.

1092
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:22,900
Siamese twins.

1093
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,520
Siamese twins.

1094
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,740
The lips.

1095
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,560
All sorts of things we never do.

1096
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,060
Crumple.

1097
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,860
I was going to write a book called Crumple.

1098
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,380
I'm going to write a book called Crumple.

1099
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,380


1100
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,380


1101
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,380


1102
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:37,260
Well, daughter, we must go away now.

1103
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:46,780
We must leave this plane, because soon, Monday morning with Norm Ward and John Horton will

1104
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,900
take over, and it won't be Bob's universe anymore.

1105
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,440
Well, we enjoyed bringing you to the land of Bub with us.

1106
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,120
But it'll be nice next Sunday night.

1107
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:02,780
There will be one hour of slack available per week by Airways, but you can make your own.

1108
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,000
We're a best seller.

1109
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660
And you will make your own slack.

1110
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,320
Well, tell me where I send it.

1111
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:08,460
Huh?

1112
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,960
Tell me where to send it.

1113
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,920
Oh, where to send?

1114
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,400
Well, yeah, all you have to do is send your love to Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas,

1115
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:21,920
75214.

1116
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,100
Okay.

1117
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,860
And if you want me to read your letter, you have to write Buck on it, or I'll never see

1118
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,900
it, because all of our mail now is handled by zombies.

1119
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,760
Okay.

1120
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:32,760


1121
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:32,760


1122
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:32,760


1123
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:32,760


1124
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,920
Then I'll write back.

1125
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,660
Okay.

1126
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,200
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

1127
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,480
Thanks for saying hi, girls.

1128
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,680
Bye, girls.

1129
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,820
Bye.

1130
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,680
See you.

1131
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,160
Okay.

1132
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,160


1133
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,160


1134
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,160


1135
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,440
Gave lessons in levitating.

1136
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,300
Let's do it!

1137
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,140
Tried to teach me, but I never got through without them.

1138
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,460
Why did men fear the unknown?

1139
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,820
Like children, afraid of the dark.

1140
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,760
The only reason they're afraid of the dark is because they're afraid of the dark.

1141
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:02,760


1142
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,260
person I've met

1143
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,440
who isn't afraid of the dark

1144
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,180
is a child.

1145
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,960
Ha, ha, ha.

1146
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,580
Ha, ha, ha.

1147
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,900
I cast you out.

1148
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,320
Unclean spirit.

1149
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,260
Shut up, you're out.

1150
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,360
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

1151
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,740
It is he who commands you.

1152
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,700
He who flung you from the heights of heaven

1153
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,640
to the depths of hell.

1154
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,020
All right.

1155
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,920
All right.

1156
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,320
It's all over.

1157
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,160
We're all happy now.

1158
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,420
We're so happy.

1159
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,540
We all love each other, don't we?

1160
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,480
He threw.

1161
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,680
He threw.

1162
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,960
Yes.

1163
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,800
Speaky is taking over the body of Paul.

1164
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,580
Here comes the show.

1165
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:47,940
Quiet.

1166
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,420
I think I got it.

1167
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,220
Right between the brows.

1168
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,520
Okay, drag the show over here.

1169
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,320
Come on, guys.

1170
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:01,700
Come on.

1171
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:01,900
Come on.

1172
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:01,900


1173
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,120
Come on, guys.

1174
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,680
We gotta get the show up the stairs.

1175
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,420
Check it.

1176
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,560
See if it's got its wallet.

1177
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,320
Let's take it down to the old abandoned warehouse.

1178
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,080
Hey, this show's got $500 in its wallet.

1179
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,260
This show's got a motor drawn.

1180
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,040
Tie it up.

1181
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,580
Look, get its car keys.

1182
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,820
I always wanted to get even to the show.

1183
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,680
Now it's our chance.

1184
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,940
What about this cult, eh?

1185
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,660
Forget that crowd.

1186
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,820
You'll never forget, even when I say,

1187
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,360
and you damn show.

1188
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,540
What a dumb show.

1189
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,200
And he was hopeless.

1190
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,760
His legs drew up tight and tense and withered away to just skin and bones.

1191
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,660
Probably would have had to limp for a few days because of sore shin.

1192
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,880
Don't you see my point?

1193
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,140
Oh, yes, we all love each other.

1194
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,900
Ah, yes, dear friend.

1195
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,900
That's what I want to tell you tonight.

1196
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,640
I want to know.

1197
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,760
When and where I can expect your love offering.

1198
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,080
Because the bigger your love offering is,

1199
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,040
the bigger my love gets for you, dear friends.

1200
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,440
And the more love I spew out there for you.

1201
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,680
And Bob spewing his love.

1202
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,140
And we're both spewing together.

1203
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,480
Because we got more love inside us than we can hardly hold on to.

1204
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,620
It's more than enough for one man to get a girl.

1205
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,260
And I don't need a grip on.

1206
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,100
A big old grip on himself.

1207
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,100
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1208
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:37,820
Ha ha.

1209
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,000
I want to tell you tonight that it just really touches my heart.

1210
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
Ah, yes.

1211
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:45,900
It touched.

1212
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,200
That was Dr. Philo Drummond.

1213
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,000
And I believe we did.

1214
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,480
Oh, have a little calmer there.

1215
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,220


1216
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,760
Let's see what this poor creature.

1217
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,740
Hello?

1218
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,280
Hello.

1219
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:56,620
Mark.

1220
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,240
I have seen an apparition.

1221
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,460
You've got a vision for us.

1222
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,400
Yes, I have a vision.

1223
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,600
I've seen Mr. Drummond.

1224
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,600


1225
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,600


1226
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,600


1227
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:01,720
I have seen Mr. PP.

1228
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,360
I saw him during the last caller.

1229
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,320
Wow.

1230
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:10,740
And he was wearing a t-shirt with a very strange letter configuration on it.

1231
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,560
It said B.C.W.

1232
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,460
Let's hear it.

1233
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:16,700
It was quite scary.

1234
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,880
Run that by us once more.

1235
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,120
Once more.

1236
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:19,540
What?

1237
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,740
He had a...

1238
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:24,020
Mr. PP, he was humanoid and he was wearing a jersey.

1239
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:31,380
And on the jersey the letters B, C, W were written across the front.

1240
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,580
Okay.

1241
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1242
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1243
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1244
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1245
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1246
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1247
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1248
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:31,580


1249
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,800
Now, you say he was humanoid. What does that look like to you?

1250
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,960
Oh, he was very large, a lot like Boxcar Willie, humanoid-like.

1251
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:39,980
Okay.

1252
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,880
Called the great Boxcar Willie.

1253
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,740
Yes, exactly, and he had the letters Buck over on his halo on his head,

1254
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,920
and there was some Boxcar Willie music in the background.

1255
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,320
It was very psychedelic.

1256
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,400
I think next week when we talk to Mr. Pepe,

1257
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,380
we're going to have to ask him if he looks like Boxcar Willie.

1258
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,140
He does, and that's exactly who Boxcar Willie is.

1259
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,800
He is Mr. Pepe, who is actually the guy, the Boxcar Willie.

1260
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,780
I get the impression that you perhaps know Mr. Pepe very well.

1261
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,840
Yes, I do. I know him very personally.

1262
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,980

00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,340
with a little bit of tape.

1275
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,000
Through subversive measures,

1276
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,320
Devo passes on the word of Bob by...

1277
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,680
You're hearing the actual voice of Mark Mothersbaugh?

1278
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,780
His name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines

1279
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,880
of each of the band members,

1280
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,740
right next to the word sex.

1281
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,920
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

1282
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,640
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

1283
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,980
