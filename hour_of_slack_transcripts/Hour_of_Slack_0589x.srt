1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
You gotta tell the truth, the truth, yeah.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,220
We don't need a whole lot of lies.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,120
Communication, yeah.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,700
It's coming on strong.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,360
Woo.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,580
Don't give it down, baby.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,420
If your hair is short or long.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,680
I said, get out of your grave.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,640
Oh, everybody is dancing in the street.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,920
Why?

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,860
Do what you know.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,160
Don't be slow.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,160
You gotta practice what they preach.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,020
Yeah.

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,640
Cause it's time for you and me.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,980
Come to fake reality.

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,400
Forget about the past, baby.

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,440
Things ain't what they used to be.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,000
Gosh.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,500
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slag.

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,860
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

22
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,880
Whose primary characteristics are that they're congenital liars and murderers.

23
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,100
And they would if they could kill every one of us.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,180
Don't want my brother's head.

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,360
Don't want my sister's head.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,120
Oh, I don't know about that.

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,980
Not all of us would.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,440
Not all of us would necessarily go that far.

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,160
Dear friends.

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,980
I mean, some of us are evangelical subgeniuses.

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,940
We don't really believe in killing all the pinks on X day.

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:58,340
But friends, I have saved for this particular show all the rants from the X day drill from our greatest preachers who do advocate the mass destruction of the human race.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,460
As opposed to my own.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,960
My own.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,300
My approach, my personal approach, which would be slavery.

37
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,400
You know, it's like the, as Jayner has said, there is a use for the pinks.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,060
But I'm not going to get involved in trying to argue that right now.

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:24,540
We will go back into those recordings of more hate, more hair curdling hate than you can shake a brick at.

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,600
And we will play every little hook and winker.

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,680
Of these types.

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
Money Bob here, friend.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:49,220
Sex money Bob will be using this new type from Cthulhu at Radar Labs as a background or transitional material.

44
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,140
Had to go from one thing to another.

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,480
But friends, first, I did actually want to read something straight here.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,480
That was in the Dallas Morning News this morning.

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,220
Doesn't have a dang thing to do with the X day drill.

48
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,700
But it is about the Disney, the boycott of Disney by the Southern Baptist Convention.

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,940
Which you can well imagine since that was decided in Dallas.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,900
And this is, of course, the buckle on the so-called Bible Belt.

51
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,540
And since we are the avowed unbucklers of said Bible Belt.

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,060
Anyway, I was amused by this letter from a total stranger as far as I'm concerned.

53
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:38,000
Laura Ainsworth in Waxahachie, Texas wrote in to the Dallas Morning News.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm extremely disappointed with the Southern Baptist resolution to boycott Disney.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,500
In all of the discussion of this issue that's taken place recently, I have yet to hear the following points made.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,920
First.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,500
Christians who condemn homosexuality often like to say they don't hate gays.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,520
And judging from the direct mail letters I've received from some organized Christian groups, I'd have to say that some of them do.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:20,020
And then she goes on to say, oh, I doubt if these Baptists realize the contribution of gay writers, artists, directors, and blah, blah, blah.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,140
To all the family entertainment they've enjoyed over the years.

61
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,900
The wholesome and enduring community.

62
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,880
And Broadway shows, the classic songs, and clever lyrics.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,360
Apologist.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,040
This because of the artistic talents of many people, both gay and straight.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,160
Last.

66
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:54,360
The Baptists believe that unrepentant gays will spend eternity in a lake of fiery torment separated forever from God because of their inability to overcome a trait that God seems to have put inside them in the first place.

67
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,920
If this is the case, is hell not enough punishment for them?

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,280
Must we forbid them from having health insurance too?

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Call me soft, but if gays face eternal damnation anyway, I think it would be nice of the Baptists to let them go to Disneyland first.

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,620
And that was from Laura Ainsworth of Waxahachie.

71
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
How about that, friends?

72
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,400
I must say.

73
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,360
I must.

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
Must say.

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,080
The demon voice of Ivan Stange.

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,400
Repent!

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,240
Quit your job!

78
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,460
Slack off!

79
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,700
You have been turned into the freak of insanity by the conspiracy!

80
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,220
Heaven.

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,960
Oh, and speaking of hell, here's a Jehovah Hates Fred.

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Oh, maybe you might know from, uh, that old band, Doctors for Bob.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
It's a little thing.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,140
It's gospel hell music.

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,260
It's music for people who know they're going to hell anyway.

86
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,580
It's a little thing called Legs of Fire.

87
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,180
If you know it, sing it like you mean it.

88
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,140
If you know it, sing along.

89
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,580
That was nice.

90
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,480
Well, uh, you're hitting my hair.

91
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,860
Something has happened to me.

92
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,880
Mama can't feel me.

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,100
Well, I thought I could get away with slaughter on our wedding day.

94
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,160
Preacher's Manson, boy, better put away your saw.

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,440
I said I don't cotton to know God's county law.

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,800
But that saw was stolen, at least it's what they said.

97
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,140
So I wrapped up in asbestos from my lice up to my head.

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,660
I wrapped up in asbestos that I got from Gregg's.

99
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,720
I only wish I had enough to cover up my legs.

100
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,140
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning, but I ain't no liar.

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

102
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,260
My head is dry and cool.

103
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,040
So are my arms and tool.

104
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,840
My torso, even more so.

105
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,980
But I ain't no liar.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

107
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,600
Well, I was selling heroin at the elementary school.

108
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,940
Preacher's Manson, boy, you know that isn't cool.

109
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,980
Good Lord, come to me.

110
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,480
Said my time was up.

111
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,860
When I asked why God, he said because that horse was cut.

112
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,660
Uh-oh, they were shooting up in the bathroom.

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,260
Yes, you know it's true.

114
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,240
But they were not getting off.

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,620
That's why my soul is through.

116
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,100
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning, but I ain't no liar.

117
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,560
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

118
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,260
My brain ain't in a flame and my shoulder ain't in pain.

119
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,000
But my toes need a hose.

120
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,840
But I ain't no liar.

121
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,300
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,680
I was stealing cars for God to try and get them well.

123
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,120
But when my judgment came, he said you'll have to go to hell.

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,040
It's true.

125
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,040


126
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,260
It's true.

127
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,580
I gave my son, he said, to pay for all your sins.

128
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,040
But when you brought me that limo, Jader, the door was dented in.

129
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,580
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning, but I ain't no liar.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,060
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

131
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,420
Oh, my arm is doing fine and my head ain't on the line.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,420
But my knees are crying, please.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,520
But I ain't no liar.

134
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,000
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,020
Well, I was brown and I was black.

136
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,020


137
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,160
I was a trash in grandma's head with a railroad tie.

138
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,060
Good Lord, come to me.

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,580
He said, why did you lie?

140
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,980
When I asked what lie God, he said, you must confess.

141
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
That ain't your grandma's head at all.

142
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,540
It's just a bloody mess.

143
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,060
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning, but I ain't no liar.

144
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,880
Now I'm burning, burning, burning, got legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

145
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,340
Amen.

146
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,860
Now I ask you, I ask you, sir or lady, what's the plan, what's the plan?

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh.

148
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
Hey, you didn't know that one, did you?

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,360
I think you're a creature now.

150
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,600
Oh.

151
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,760
Hey, you didn't know that one, did you?

152
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:19,760


153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

154
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,120
I think you're a creature now.

155
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,860
I think you're a creature now.

156
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,500
I think you're a creature now.

157
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:40,820
God, I wish I was doing this live on a real radio station instead of in this little room.

158
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,420
Because I can't remember whether I mentioned two or three takes back,

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,580
whether that weird sounding trance mix stuff is called,

160
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,560
called Hate for a Pink Planet by Cthulhu at Radar Labs.

161
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,120
Or actually that's Cthulhu at ourlabs.com.

162
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,800
And I promised we are gonna play some pretty blood curling,

163
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,300
hate filled subgenius ranting,

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
but first there's just the cutest little song.

165
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,640
I just have to play a little bit more

166
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,840
of that Jehovah H. Fred.

167
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,280
They're such a cute couple of boys.

168
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,300
On that ship there was a bob a rare bob.

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs was a bob on the ship

170
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,760
and the ship in the air,

171
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,840
and the air through the smoke,

172
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,880
and the smoke from the frop,

173
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,000
and the frop from the pipe,

174
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,940
and the pipe from the grid,

175
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,060
and the grid from the bob.

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,380
Bob down in the saucer row.

177
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,620
Round round the slack full bob,

178
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,800
bob down in the saucer row.

179
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,060
Round round the slack full bob,

180
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,940
the bob down in the saucer row.

181
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,180
And this next thing coming up is a great song about bobbies.

182
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,180
You bobbies will love this song coming up.

183
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:11,240
He was a good boy from Arkansas, love Gina and Sturno too.

184
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,860
Lodged the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer like frog smoke and sniffing glue.

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,120
He had a bob shirt for $12.95.

186
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,060
Watched her eyes about five times a day.

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,220
He sent his paychecks.

188
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,400
To Dallas, Texas.

189
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,580
He's a bobby who's willing to pay.

190
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,380
Cause he's a skull.

191
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,980
Skull farming.

192
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,340
Thank you.

193
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,620
Jehovah hates Fred, dear friends.

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,220
And now I'm going to play a tape of a rant by Reverend Groovy G from the X Day Drill.

195
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,480
I've been holding off on this one because it's...

196
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,660
a little bit controversial.

197
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,800
Let me set the scene.

198
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,080
To begin with, this is being preached in rural New York.

199
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,720
It's an audience of mostly Yankees.

200
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:34,580
And after other folks had finished their rants, up walked Reverend G, Groovy G and his buddy,

201
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,660
in full War Between the States Confederate soldier uniforms.

202
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,640
Okay?

203
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,420
Waving Confederate flags.

204
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,720
And I think they had some subgenius, you know, time control emblems and stuff maybe stuck over part of the emblem on their hat.

205
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,980
It was kind of a combination Confederate and subgenius look.

206
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,080
And you can imagine some of those Yankees in the audience were kind of going,

207
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,500
well, I'm going to reserve judgment on this one.

208
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Okay?

209
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,620
.

210
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,900
.

211
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:06,900


212
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,100
.

213
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,280
.

214
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,780
.

215
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,100
.

216
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,660
You produce this on a small scale.

217
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,360
You might know these guys very well, pick them up from college, youzos!

218
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,380
You just mess with me, you lot!

219
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,380


220
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,920
While we know a little bit about these저

221
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,960
comentaries you might have had a hard time having a good pun.

222
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,500
They're welcome.

223
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,500


224
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,180
The residents that you're Đây

225
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,160
by classic record,

226
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,540
but maybe of those out there,

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,380
are W"?

228
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,760
Anyway,

229
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,020


230
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,120


231
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,700
of the Confederate subgenius axis?

232
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,060
Jehovah One, how ignorant our people are of their own history.

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,340
But not all thoughts should be heaped upon your worthless heads.

234
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,360
Because as always, our dreaded enemy, the conspiracy,

235
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,400
has worked doubly hard to twist and obscure the truth about the CSA.

236
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,540
And as is always the case with any effort by our enemies,

237
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,240
agents of the conspiracy right here in our very own church

238
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,280
have worked the hardest to stamp out this sacred knowledge.

239
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,380
So what is the CSA, Colonel Beauregard, you ask?

240
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,500
Before answering that question, let me first ask you a question

241
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,680
about subgenius history in general.

242
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,520
When was the last time that the subgenius really had the upper hand?

243
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,600
When was the last time that we were really in control?

244
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,940
When did we last have all the slack that we truly desired?

245
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,200
Well, according to the official church histories,

246
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,320
you have to go all the way back to Atlantis

247
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,740
to find the last really great subgenius-controlled society.

248
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,720
For reasons that are all too obvious,

249
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,540
the con wants you, the true-bred subgenius,

250
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,160
to think that it was thousands of years ago

251
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,360
since you were last able to crack a whip at a human any old time you pleased.

252
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,800
The con wants you to think that mutants are completely rusty

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,660
when it comes to practicing the fine art of human subjugation.

254
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,680
Well, I'm here to tell you, brothers and sisters,

255
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,680
that that plum just ain't the case.

256
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,480
Just a mere 135 years ago, there existed here on this mud ball

257
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,940
a near-utopian subgenius paradise

258
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,940
that puts to shame meager modern outposts of mutanity

259
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,860
such as Dobstown, Malaysia, or Brushwood Folklore Center.

260
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,300
Yeah!

261
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,080
Woo!

262
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,540
Woo!

263
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:28,680
Woo!

264
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,680


265
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:28,840
Woo!

266
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:28,860
Woo!

267
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,140
Woo!

268
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:29,520
Woo!

269
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,520


270
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,520


271
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:29,520


272
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,700
The miracle of subgenius civilization

273
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,100
is now fondly remembered as the Old South or the Confederacy.

274
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,000
Even dumb pink boys, too dumb to realize who they honor,

275
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,580
remain enamored of this period of history

276
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,860
and proudly display its symbols on hats, T-shirts,

277
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,240
and the bumpers of their four-wheel drive vehicles.

278
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,480
Yes, friends, what I am saying tonight

279
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,620
is that the Confederate States of America,

280
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,020
the South, the graycoats,

281
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,880
the guys who caused the war between the states

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,140
and were responsible for the wholesale slaughter

283
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,240
of tens of thousands of humans,

284
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,800
were in fact subgeniuses just like you and me.

285
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,260
Yes!

286
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,980
Yes!

287
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,460
Well, with one small exception, of course,

288
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,780
being that as a Southern subgenius,

289
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,860
I am a direct descendant of these proud mutants.

290
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,880
Today, CSA is a small band that has carried the torch

291
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,800
down through the ages of this knowledge.

292
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,080
And I am here tonight to share it with you

293
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,820
as soon as I get my pages straight.

294
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,480
Uh-huh.

295
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,320
Damn that old granddad whiskey I just had to drink

296
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
before I got up here.

297
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,180
I come before you tonight with the story of a time

298
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,260
different from this pink-infested one

299
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,840
that we've been forced by the conspiracy

300
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,240
to become accustomed to,

301
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,340
a world where superior mutants

302
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,300
dwelled on a plane of perfect slack.

303
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,000
Conjure up, if you will, in your mind

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,740
a mental image of the typical member

305
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,220
of the old South ruling class,

306
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,700
dressed in their white cotton suits,

307
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,860
just like Reverend D.

308
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,220
Reverend Stang.

309
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,900
Outrageous hairstyles, just like Reverend Stang.

310
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,080
Sitting on the porches of their grand mansion,

311
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,420
sipping mint juleps and breathing in the aromatic scent

312
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,480
of their plantation-grown frock.

313
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,840
These were subgeniuses who had achieved perfect slack.

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
And what was the foundation upon which

315
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,760
this great society was built?

316
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,300
Well, everyone knows that.

317
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,260
That's right, because that is the one great truth

318
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,020
about the Confederacy that the conspiracy has never

319
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,660
been able to cover up.

320
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,900
The reason for our ancestral subgeniuses' life of luxury

321
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,500
was simple.

322
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
They enslaved humans.

323
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,080
Yes, the original forefathers of the CSA realized

324
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,100
their own superior mutanthood and took what was theirs

325
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,320
by birthright and forced humans to do their bidding.

326
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,680
It's undeniable that this was a perfect subgenius society.

327
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,240
Not one finger needed to be lifted by a mutant

328
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,400
to accomplish anything.

329
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,860
Lifting of fingers and huge bands.

330
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,080
The tails of cotton were work for humans.

331
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,780
Upon this concept, a great culture flourished.

332
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,880
And for one all too brief moment in history,

333
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,820
and one all too small region of this pitiful country,

334
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,200
there existed a subgenius heaven.

335
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,980
Oh, how we mourn for those days.

336
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,960
And mourn for them we do, because as we are forced

337
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,440
to acknowledge, the original Confederacy was brought down

338
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,540
and destroyed by the forces of the conspiracy.

339
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,860
For as great was the slackness, the lack of a sense of belonging,

340
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,600
the lack of our southern mutant ancestors,

341
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,520
equally great was their egos and the pride

342
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,440
that did surely go before their fall.

343
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,660
Yes, my friends, as has been proven time and again,

344
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,560
the CSA made the fatal mistake of becoming too complacent

345
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,460
and satisfied.

346
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,460
Truly did they learn the great and bitter truth

347
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,880
of the lesson that was revealed here last year

348
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,900
at the drill at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

349
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,560
Do you know that truth that Reverend Stang

350
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,820
revealed to us last year at the drill?

351
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,580
I do, because I was here, and my ancestors know it,

352
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,780
because it caused them to let their guard down,

353
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,200
and in that one weak moment, the conspiracy struck.

354
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,360
But taken by surprise, the old south subgenius ruling class

355
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,300
was still able to muster up battalions of human dupes

356
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,620
all too willing to lay down their lives for their overlords.

357
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,020
And thus was born the great Civil War.

358
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,660
Our ancestors, realizing how enamored humans are

359
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,920
of brightly colored pieces of material waving in the air,

360
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,840
designed a battle flag to lead their poor troops to the slaughter.

361
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,160
And that battle flag had as part of its design

362
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,380
a huge, undeniable X.

363
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,560
For even then did true mutants know about the prophecies

364
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,060
concerning excess and how on one fateful day

365
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,820
the mutants of this world would rise up and gain complete

366
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,840
and total mastery over the humans.

367
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,640
The stars on the flag represent the people of the world.

368
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,980
And so they presented not only the subgenius-controlled states,

369
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,940
but also from whence our salvation would come.

370
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,020
Alas, without Dobbs, they did not realize that X-Day

371
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,020
was not to come for more than a century.

372
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,060
And so they battled the federal forces of the conspiracy for years

373
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,460
until finally, exhausted and drained, they skipped town late at night

374
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,640
and left their remaining human slaves to deal with the consequences.

375
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,700
But certain members of the ruling class of the old south

376
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,600
did not forget the glory of these days,

377
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,620
and they have passed down this knowledge to true sons and daughters of the Confederacy,

378
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,660
and today we are known as the Confederate Subgenius Axis.

379
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,520
We are true, Ubermen!

380
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,860
We embrace and revel in our superiority over the humans.

381
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,500
But with this knowledge and this glorious epic tonight

382
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,480
comes a warning to be ever on guard against the wiles

383
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,560
and duplicities of the conspiracy.

384
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,580
Forget not that there are agents of the real men in black

385
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,820
right here in this very audience tonight,

386
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,660
and if my friend and I were not heavily armed,

387
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,560
there would no doubt have already been attempts on our lives

388
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,080
for what I am revealing tonight.

389
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,120
Especially now, in this final year before X-Day,

390
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,920
must we be our most wary.

391
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,620
Don't take your eyes off the humans for an instant.

392
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
You know who they are.

393
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,200
They're easy enough to spot, even in this crowd.

394
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,960
They're everywhere you go, on every street corner.

395
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,440
Shiftless, human.

396
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,840
Dragging down a society that should be free of such scum.

397
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,080
Look at the way they openly eye our mutant women

398
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,720
with their lustful, animal, pink-drenched brains.

399
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,800
These humans think that they are our equals.

400
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,960
Exactly!

401
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,560
They think that they deserve the same rights as us.

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,760
Well, the Confederate Subgenius Axis is here tonight

403
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,200
to say that the only, and I repeat,

404
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,500
the only right that a human has,

405
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,400
is to a quick and merciful death.

406
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,320
And we're taking even that one away from them!

407
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,380
The CSA has a zero tolerance policy for humans.

408
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,840
And over the course of the next 365 days,

409
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,220
we plan on proving it by killing one human a day,

410
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,060
every day, until X-Day.

411
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,840
And we want you true-born mutants here in the audience tonight,

412
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,180
especially those of you from the South,

413
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,600
to take this pledge along with us.

414
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,120
One human a day, every day, until X-Day.

415
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,600
Come on, brothers and sisters, repeat it with me tonight.

416
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,040
One human a day, every day, until X-Day.

417
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,000
Say it again.

418
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,200
One human a day, every day, until X-Day.

419
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,000
And once we've got that human,

420
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,060
what are we gonna do, Lieutenant Renis?

421
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,880
And once we've got that rope, what are we gonna do?

422
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,360
That rope!

423
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,100
That's right, we're gonna string them up.

424
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,580
We're gonna take every goddamn human on this planet,

425
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,320
and we are gonna kill.

426
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,640
Kill!

427
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,500
Kill!

428
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Kill!

429
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,500
Kill!

430
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,440
Kill!

431
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:08,980


432
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,540
I'm Colonel Buford G. Thaddeus Beauregard

433
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,180
of the Confederate Subgenius Axis,

434
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,380
and I just want to leave you tonight by saying,

435
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,760
Praise Bob!

436
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,080
Praise Bob!

437
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,760
Praise Bob!

438
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:31,580
Praise Bob!

439
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,800
Praise Bob!

440
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:35,960
Praise Bob!

441
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,520
I didn't hear what was...

442
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,140
That's pretty harsh.

443
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,320
Groovy G.

444
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,540
That was...

445
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,140
You actually just, really loud, on a loud speaker,

446
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,800
said that these people were gonna kill

447
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,180
one human a day,

448
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,860
from now till X day,

449
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,680
and they all agreed and shouted,

450
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
Kill! Kill! Kill!

451
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,320
Teresa, I think we probably should call the sheriff at this point.

452
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm a little worried because I am greatly embarrassed

453
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,660
and deeply humiliated that due to unforeseen circumstances

454
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,180
beyond my control of the inner workings and hidden mechanisms

455
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,480
within my chronometer and such,

456
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
in accord with the Great Side Rule movement

457
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,180
in which time is generally reckoned,

458
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,780
but without being too far from the truth,

459
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,500
I would guess that there's not very much time left

460
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,000
until daylight ends.

461
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,180
We need our first volunteer for that execution.

462
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,460
Me!

463
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,760
All right! We have the volunteer!

464
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,400
Reverend Groovy, we have your first volunteer.

465
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,080
We just hope that when you do the ceremonies

466
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,300
that you make sure it's up here

467
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,120
and we actually have the videotape running.

468
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,840
You go ahead and get your last supper and everything.

469
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,220
And, uh...

470
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,260
You did that?

471
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,940
Yes, we did.

472
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,800
This is now a recording of the festivities

473
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,700
when we did actually cook and eat the volunteers.

474
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,820
It was a beautiful moment with a lot of...

475
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,880
Praise Bob!

476
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,140
People loved it.

477
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,240
Listen to this crowd.

478
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,920
This is a lovely moment of Dobbsian worship.

479
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,700
Eat Bob! Eat Bob! Eat Bob!

480
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,380
Praise Bob! Eat Bob! Praise Bob!

481
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,840
Eat Bob! Praise Bob! Eat Bob!

482
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,560
Praise Bob! Eat Bob!

483
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,680
I guess the idea was the, uh, the sacrificial, uh,

484
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,880
human, uh, represents Bob or something like that.

485
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,220
Can't get any better.

486
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,820
The sun is out. It'll be sunny tomorrow.

487
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,300
But after a display like that,

488
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,520
I think we need to inject this campground with some real hate.

489
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,080
Yeah!

490
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,260
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

491
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,940
And I know the presence!

492
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,300
And I know the presence!

493
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,780
And I know the presence!

494
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,820
And I know the presence!

495
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,480
And I know the presence!

496
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,520


497
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,100
And I know the presence!

498
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,640
Hey Bob!

499
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,580
Mr. Bowie!

500
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,580


501
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:15,580


502
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:15,980
We've been hit!

503
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:15,980


504
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:15,980


505
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:15,980


506
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,880
Oh, MOO japanese, was this the fall hour?

507
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


508
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


509
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


510
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


511
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


512
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


513
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


514
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


515
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:16,880


516
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,220
Leave theaps out,

517
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,300


518
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:17,680
but if you got a thing,

519
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,460
you'd volunteer it to something are cream,

520
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,840
in a month or two.

521
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,120
podcast conversation

522
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,120


523
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,200
about?

524
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,800
Thenahmen is about to start the s-

525
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,660
analyses,

526
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,380
what you hear, what you say, and what you think.

527
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,580
Now, how much money do you think you're going to make out of this?

528
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,540
Neil doesn't give a...

529
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,760
I had to kill this vermin for Bob!

530
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,060
Praise Bob!

531
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,900
Kill the vermin!

532
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,780
Kill the human!

533
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,100
Kill the pigs!

534
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
Kill!

535
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,760
Kill!

536
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,080
Kill!

537
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,080
Kill!

538
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,080
Kill!

539
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,100
Kill!

540
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,960
Kill!

541
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,840
Kill!

542
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,480
Kill!

543
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,240
Kill!

544
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,780
Kill!

545
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,040
Kill!

546
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,460
Kill!

547
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:04,920
Kill!

548
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,280
Or kill me.

549
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,200
Sometimes I wonder, you know, uh...

550
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,080
Just...

551
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,560
No.

552
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,020
No, no, no.

553
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:31,780
But, you know, sometimes I think, but, you know, do the pinks really have to die?

554
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,780
But it's not really their fault.

555
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,920
But can't we just understand each other?

556
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,440
No!

557
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,380
Can't we just all get along?

558
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:07,160
If we want to stomp out their beliefs by stomping out their lives, doesn't that make us just as bad as them?

559
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,500
No! Because we are better than them!

560
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,700
We're not smarter! We're not richer! We're not more cool!

561
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,160
We're just simply...

562
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,860
Better!

563
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,360
Because we have that man here, Bob Dobbs, and they don't!

564
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,800
And that's all we need to hate them!

565
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,360
Now...

566
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,720
Kill, kill, kill, they say.

567
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,220
Well, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I preach to, as Bob said.

568
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,640
And I hope you aren't either!

569
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,200
Which means you get to live and they get to die.

570
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,660
Somebody has to decide. The sad thing is somebody has to decide who's really a subgenius and who's just a pink.

571
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,480
And, you know, I'm sure everybody here has got somebody there thinking,

572
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,060
God, I can't believe that one guy over there is such a pink.

573
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,860
But who shall decide? Who shall judge?

574
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
Who shall judge?

575
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,420
Bob has judged.

576
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Bob has judged by virtue of who has sent in their fucking $30!

577
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,480
Yeah!

578
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,800
Yeah!

579
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,120
Justice may change at any time!

580
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,660
So, you guys can all talk about how we're gonna kill this human or kill that human.

581
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,300
Have you paid?

582
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,260
Or are you just as pink to Bob Dobbs...

583
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,400
...as that pinky over there going down that snake's gullet.

584
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,800
See you on show side two.

585
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,220
If you're not registered, registration is tomorrow from 11 to 4.

586
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,280
You must be registered or we will kill you.

587
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,160
Here's what...

588
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,900
We do have some events tomorrow.

589
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,600
Tomorrow, by the way, is July 5th, 1998.

590
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,740
However, however, we do not celebrate X Day until Sunday.

591
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,020
Now you're saying, well, why?

592
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,880
Well, because the real X Day...

593
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,380
Oh, there you go.

594
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
The real X Day will be on Sunday.

595
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,480
So, 7 AM Mass is not tomorrow.

596
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,700
It is Sunday.

597
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,900
So...

598
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,760
Which will be the real X Day next year.

599
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,480
It's a little bit tricky, but anyway.

600
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,000
But tomorrow, here's what's going on.

601
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,140
You can join me and Dr. Legume tomorrow at 1 o'clock, around 1 o'clock,

602
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,820
for the naked Bob-tismal baptisms by me and Legume at the pool.

603
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,760
At 2 o'clock, we've had to postpone the oil wrestling for today,

604
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,600
so we're gonna do it tomorrow.

605
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,540
Probably here, Main Pavilion, 2 o'clock.

606
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,580
Um...

607
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
As far as I know, it's the, uh...

608
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,780
The two Jesuses versus Pastor Craig and Pea Kitty,

609
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and Reverend Stang versus Friday Jones and Susie the Floozy.

610
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,060
Those are the...

611
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,960
Those are the two grudge matches.

612
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,980
There might be some other matches.

613
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,820
If you want to oil wrestle someone, just let me know.

614
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,100
You're right.

615
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,640
You're right.

616
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,580
You're right.

617
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,240


618
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,300
You're right.

619
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,900
You're right.

620
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,720
Reverend Nikki...

621
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,220
That's right.

622
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,660
Reverend Nikki is the referee for the event.

623
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,480
No holds barred cage match.

624
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,520
Well, maybe not.

625
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,920
I'm trying to find some cages, for instance, if I can.

626
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,940
Then, you should prepare for the ugly parade.

627
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,600
Get your best clothes on and get ready for the ugly parade.

628
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,120
And the king has already been picked.

629
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,080
The king of the ugly parade is the man.

630
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,520
Pastor Craig will be carried on the chair in the front for the ugly parade.

631
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,720
Following the ugly parade, which is just a parade of weirdness, will be the Last Supper.

632
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,900
Um, there will only be 12 people invited to the Last Supper.

633
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,840
And you only get invited to the Last Supper by buying a raffle ticket.

634
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
We will be raffling a...

635
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,480
The raffle tickets are $1.

636
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,380
You buy them from, uh, Dr. Dinosaur, even though he probably doesn't know it until just now.

637
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,220
I just made him the holder of the money.

638
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,320
And we will draw at random the 12 people to join me for the Last Supper.

639
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,300
And I believe it will be holy sacraments of fish sticks and Yoo-hoo.

640
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,380
So your $1 will go to a good, uh, you know, good thing.

641
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,380
It's like you will be fed.

642
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,020
Um...

643
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,500
What? What?

644
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,860
I think we should let him know.

645
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,220
The Yoo-hoo has been provided...

646
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,420
The Yoo-hoo has been provided by me.

647
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,200
Yeah.

648
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,000
The people who drink it will immediately notice that on the bottom of the box it says,

649
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,780
Expires July 5th, 1997.

650
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,680
So this will be the last day for the Yoo-hoo on Earth of the Last Supper for Jesus.

651
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,100
Yeah!

652
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,540
Woo!

653
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,500
Alright!

654
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,860
Now, following the Last Supper is, of course, the crucifixion,

655
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,460
where we decide whether or not we crucify me or Bob.

656
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,400
Last year they picked Bob.

657
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,840
This year...

658
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,100
Jesus!

659
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,240
You'll pick Bob.

660
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,360
Right?

661
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,040
Right?

662
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,800
Okay.

663
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,060
Okay.

664
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,960
We're not sure where that's going to take place, but you'll know.

665
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,820
You'll know.

666
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,680
You'll be gambling for my clothes and you get to, you know, kick me and spit on me.

667
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,940
It's a lot of fun for everyone.

668
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,280
Woo!

669
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:32,960
Alright!

670
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,400
Following that...

671
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,380
Following that, at about 8 o'clock after the crucifixion,

672
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,160
over at the pavilion over there, not in here, but over there...

673
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,720
Friends, you know it may be my last day on Earth.

674
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,420
No, I certainly hope so.

675
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,520
But, even though it may be my last day, there's still time to make a little money.

676
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,480
If anyone has not yet bought a wrap, we'll take it to the Last Supper and would like to be part of...

677
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,580
No, as you can hear, friends, we actually did all that stuff that the Lord was telling you about.

678
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,140
We've got a lovely photograph of the Last Supper posed.

679
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,440
Exactly like the famous painting.

680
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,360
I still want to serve them, but Dr. Dinosaur suggested against it.

681
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,300
Oh, the fish...

682
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,960
We need some paper to put your names on.

683
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,820
What about the Yoo-hoo?

684
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,020
The miracle of the Yoo-hoo worked, but the miracle of the fish sticks got rotten, friends.

685
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,500
Yeah, there really was...

686
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,200
That Jesus was nailed up.

687
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,960
It was the real fighting Jesus, too, not the stunt Jesus.

688
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,900
Real blood, real...

689
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,120
Oh, my God.

690
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,740
...horror.

691
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:48,740
It's incredible how much threatened violence and real violence there seems to be at these subgenius events,

692
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,760
along with all the naked mud wrestling and baptizing and so forth.

693
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:00,520
They seem to go hand in hand, sex and... like sex and violins, you might say.

694
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,100
...so easily impressed.

695
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,900
Monster man.

696
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,540
It will be in his story picture and it will be on the front page of the website.

697
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,140


698
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,900
I can't believe this.

699
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,840
Changing money in the temple.

700
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,360
Yeah, I thought you were supposed to be pissed off about that sort of thing, Jesus.

701
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,180
Well, I'm a different kind of Jesus this time.

702
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,760
Uh-huh.

703
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,400
Learned a few things this time, eh?

704
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,320
A beer waitress, Buffy.

705
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,440
OK, OK.

706
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,920
Still talking, still talking.

707
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,960
I got one fuck up against a PMS.

708
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,680
I can't wait to get off the planet and ain't taking no go.

709
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,640
We're in Italy.

710
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,780
Take this, all of you and your family.

711
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


712
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


713
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


714
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


715
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


716
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


717
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,120
Take this, all of you and your family.

718
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,900
eat it. Okay. For this is my body. But just don't eat it.

719
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,120
Job is sacrifice and others may have slack.

720
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,100
Lord, one fish stick has fed the multitude.

721
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:08,860
Papa Joe, isn't there something you must go do? Pay the bill or something or maybe go talk to the

722
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,740
police or something? Wait, where is he going?

723
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,780
Uh-oh.

724
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,660
Reverend Nikki, before this night is over, you will betray me three times.

725
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,840
As if she didn't do that three times an hour.

726
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,220
Yes, if I didn't call you a dumbass every opportunity I got.

727
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,120
That's why it's a miracle.

728
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,560
Only three times.

729
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,400
That's why it's a miracle. It won't be the normal 300 times.

730
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,960
At this point, I think Susie served up the bleeding head of John Bonnet.

731
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,480
Little John Bonnet head.

732
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,420
No, no, no, I don't. Actually, I'll tell you a legume story.

733
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,320
When we were in Atlanta and had visited the grave of John Bonnet, Dr. Legume said,

734
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:08,720
why don't we dig her up? All we need is some turtle wax and a curling.

735
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,960
And I said, Legume, I don't get it. I kind of want the turtle wax, right?

736
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,980
We'll shine her up. He's like, yeah, we'll use the turtle wax to shine her up.

737
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,300
Okay, okay, that makes sense. Well, what about the curling iron?

738
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,000
To warm up the parts we'll need.

739
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,440
That's a true story.

740
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,700
Jesus, what's the point of this parable?

741
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,380
Yeah, that was a parable.

742
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,200
No, no, that's for you to figure out.

743
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,600
The truth.

744
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,200
The truth is for you to arrive at. Only the chosen shall understand.

745
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,080
I better write this down.

746
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,000
Write that down.

747
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,000
I've got the Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord down in my heart.

748
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,280
Where?

749
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,800
Down in my heart.

750
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,080
Where?

751
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,520
Down in my heart.

752
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:53,900
Where?

753
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,920
I've got the Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord down in my heart.

754
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,200
Where?

755
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,640
Down in my heart.

756
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:58,900
Where?

757
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,640
That's it.

758
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,300
That's it.

759
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,240
That's it.

760
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:08,860


761
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,940
That is the truth.

762
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,960
Anyone else?

763
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,600
Anybody else?

764
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:34,760
Who in the room what we're talking about?

765
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,440
Anyone else?

766
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,440


767
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Let's talk about atonement for囉 рас

768
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,440


769
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:36,440


770
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,480
How about us?

771
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,020
The guilty of crimes against humanity!

772
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,940
Oh, he's got the check, huh?

773
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,780
The guilty of starting the most expensive fake government...

774
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,060
All right, well, a couple of cops who looked horribly like Dr. Legume and Reverend Strange

775
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:59,460
dragged Jesus away into a car and took him down to the base of the hill where,

776
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,220
when everybody got down there, man, they nailed the Lord up.

777
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,280
My business manager.

778
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,900
You know, I mean, our main guy.

779
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah, when they raised the cross, for some reason they sang Star Spangled Banner.

780
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:31,360
Imagine a young man, Jesus, wrapped in a diaper made of an American flag,

781
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,520
nailed bloodily to this cross, being lifted up.

782
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,340
The rain!

783
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,780
What are we doing?

784
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,580
All right, now.

785
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,440
Power's around your head, huh?

786
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,600
I don't care who your father is, you dropped the cross one more time, you're out of the parade.

787
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,620
Throw him with him and him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.

788
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,060
I can see Liberia from here.

789
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,420
All glory and honor to the mighty Father.

790
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,200
Go ahead, Larry.

791
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:19,520
I gotta admit, friends, this was one of the weirdest events I've ever watched at a subgenius event.

792
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:31,060
It was obviously really cathartic for some of these folks who must have had pretty weird religious upbringings.

793
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,460
I forgot to bring the spear.

794
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,040
So I guess I'll just have to...

795
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,600
You got it.

796
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,020
You got it.

797
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,060
You got it.

798
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,180
You got it.

799
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,180


800
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,720
You got it.

801
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,420
You got it.

802
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:37,640


803
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:37,640


804
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:37,900
We got his robe!

805
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,840
We've got your robe!

806
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,880
Time to gamble for your robes, Jesus!

807
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,960
All right, give me a chance.

808
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh.

809
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,760
Go ahead, put the dice in his hand.

810
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,520
You'll get no chance this time.

811
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:55,660
Come on.

812
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,140
And I know that come tomorrow, there'll be people who'll swear they saw you walking around.

813
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,400
We're gonna break those legs up, don't you care?

814
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,180
Well, we're not gonna let him get carried away this time.

815
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
except on stretchers.

816
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,620
Yeah!

817
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,020
Now, Reverend Stang and I, we're the ones

818
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,640
that have spent the most time locked in stinky little vans

819
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,760
driving all over the country.

820
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,660
And me and Reverend Stang, we're gonna roll for your robes.

821
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,640
Oh, yes!

822
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,040
Whoever gets the high number wins.

823
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,340
Roll those things.

824
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,280
Well, Dr. LeGueum won the close, I think.

825
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,660
Man, what a blasphemous thing to do.

826
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,540
But, I mean, it was Jesus, partly Jesus' idea.

827
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,380
Well, I think he's really Jewish!

828
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,360
Make him Jewish if he's God!

829
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,640
By the end of it, the poor guy was covered with...

830
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,980
He was really bleeding.

831
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,740
There was real blood all over the place.

832
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,120
Dr. LeGueum cut him.

833
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,920
My wife came out dressed as a devil and sold pies

834
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,440
so that people could throw them at the mounted Lord.

835
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,140
Water, water, weed.

836
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,200
Crap!

837
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,780
A drink of your water, Jesus!

838
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,480
Why don't your dad give you some water?

839
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,520
A drink of your water, please.

840
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,320
Why don't your dad give you some water?

841
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
I mean, they were just...

842
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,420
Touch yourself loose, Jesus.

843
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,760
They were letting it...

844
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,960
They were just letting out so much hate.

845
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,800
Your dad controls all the water.

846
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,980
You're gonna have to nail yourself up on that cross someday

847
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,480
and how you gonna get that left hand in after the right hand?

848
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,000
Well, David, that's what you actually need.

849
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,460
You're gonna have to pay somebody.

850
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,140
Oh, my!

851
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I love you for saving me.

852
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,460
Dave, let's get laid.

853
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,660
Boy, now there's gonna be no rain for you now.

854
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,100
Oh, forgive them, Bob.

855
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,240
I think your dad might wanna talk to you.

856
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:38,900
Huh?

857
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,640
Give me a cup. Let me go up behind the stage.

858
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,620
I'll come back with some water.

859
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,420
Forgive them, Bob, for they know not what they do.

860
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Give me a cup. Let me go up behind the stage.

861
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,320
I'll come back with some water.

862
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,760
And for his next trick, Jesus will...

863
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,940
Bleed to death.

864
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:54,580
Yeah!

865
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,460
Hey!

866
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,840
Christo the Magnificent!

867
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,560
Oh, they look way too loose to me.

868
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,620
If you can get out of there that easy.

869
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,080
Yeah, just tighten that tourniquet up.

870
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,340
And if I was just turning it away, I might be able to see the band.

871
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:06,940
Hey, wait a minute. That's not Jesus. That's Houdini.

872
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,100
Please, God, have mercy on my soul. Let me see the band.

873
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,160
Where's my megaphone?

874
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,960
I'm glad you brought my long-dots with me.

875
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,640
How are you gonna hold it?

876
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,480
You're gonna be a long time dying up there, Jesus.

877
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,560
Hey, God, you're...

878
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,380
Well, I'm bored. Let's go. Let's just wait a minute.

879
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:25,800
All right.

880
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,640
That's all right.

881
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,940
I'm good.

882
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm good.

883
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,100
All right.

884
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,620
I'm gonna find you.

885
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:29,660
I'm gonna find you.

886
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,100
Who cares?

887
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,020
The band starts at 8.

888
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,820
Been there. Done that.

889
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,880
Uh, heck.

890
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,580
Yeah, we got a little crucifixion.

891
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,980
Truly, this band was the son of God.

892
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,640
Why'd you put him in a diaper? The, like, extra humiliation factor kind of a thing?

893
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,520
I don't know.

894
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,380
One shot in front of another.

895
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:47,900
Really?

896
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,800
I'm still looking for that spear.

897
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,620
Give him a hot foot.

898
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,240
Hell yeah.

899
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,160
Come on. Get the lighter out. Let's see a hot foot.

900
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,520
Fire up the band.

901
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,020
Jesus had a weak bladder.

902
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:57,820
Jesus!

903
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,320
Jesus!

904
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,320


905
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,320


906
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,320


907
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,320


908
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,140
Now, is this really, uh, I mean, we don't want to overstep the bounds of good taste

909
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,460
here.

910
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,540
We wouldn't want to offend anybody.

911
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:20,560
One pipe makes you larger, and one pipe makes you small.

912
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:28,320
And the ones that the con gives you don't do the same.

913
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:38,560
So, uh, if you're gonna do anything at all, go ask Ivan how to get your slack.

914
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:55,800
And when you go chasing saucers and you know you're yet a sin, tell him a prop smoking

915
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,320
salesman has a back.

916
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,320


917
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:01,860
And he says, excuse all your sins.

918
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:09,440
Call Ivan and get the slack you lack.

919
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:21,760
When droids on the TV get up and tell you what to think.

920
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,040
And you've just had some kind of transplant.

921
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,320
And you're just a little bit sick.

922
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,320


923
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,780
ook.

924
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,480
So, when you start to be a little sick, something wherever goes wrong.

925
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


926
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


927
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


928
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


929
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


930
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,480


931
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,460
And the reality is that your world is turning pink.

932
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,360
Go ask Ivan.

933
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,420
I know he'll think.

934
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:51,260
That you can't find salvation anywhere you want looking.

935
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:58,320
Pull the wool over your own eyes, and you'll find you Земly.

936
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,320


937
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,320


938
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,320


939
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:08,520
get it from his book remember to justify your sins

940
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,500
and sin cash in

941
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,580
just send cash in

942
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,900
oh dear friends that was uh dr dinosaur and uh selena

943
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,260
oh yeah ladies and gentlemen papa joe mama

944
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:52,260
howdy friends i'm here to talk to you tonight about a disturbing development in the church

945
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,280
which one well it's one i entitled

946
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,920
dictating to dogs because let's face it there are people within our humble church

947
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,880
perhaps even here tonight who seek to change the church

948
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:21,940
they want to make it more hip they want to make it more popular they want to make it more lucrative

949
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:27,820
they come to me and they say things like

950
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:37,120
gee it would really be nice if we could just add this or golly if we could just remove that

951
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:44,720
we would attract some more so many more followers sure their motives sound pure

952
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,740
but they go on to say things like this more followers mean more bucks for bob

953
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:58,180
which means a greater ministry which means more souls to save and who could be against that not me

954
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:08,300
but the devils in the details tell me more well they say take for instance old jane or hypercleans

955
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:14,500
oh please please take him he's funny take him away but he's also offensive

956
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:23,640
he talks too much about killing normals and exploiting women it turns off a lot of would-be

957
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,320
sub genies on this now we're not saying excommunicate him or anything but i'm telling you

958
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:28,320


959
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,420
he's a good guy but couldn't you just fade him out a little bit over time

960
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,960
you know invite him to less events

961
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,940
edit his tapes a little here and there

962
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,900
or skip them all together

963
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,860
no one would know the difference

964
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:56,200
no three two church to that i say this someone would know you would know because it was your idea

965
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,980
i would know because i was a collaborator on your little scheme

966
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,140
jayner would probably know although he's not all that bright but he is the target of your little plot

967
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,920
and last but not least a certain deity named dobbs would know because he's bob

968
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:26,180
remember bob jr bob dobbs yeah bob the man who took a bullet so that you were not to kill him

969
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,900
take a job

970
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:37,420
yeah him our uh suppose it's a genius savior whose words and wisdom we try to live by every day of

971
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,020
our lives

972
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,040
bob dogs doesn't call jane or hyper cleats jane or hyper cleats my friends

973
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,520
he calls him sake jane or hyper cleats and don't you goddamn forget it

974
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:08,160
okay three two saint saint means sacred it means beyond reproach above suspicion above criticism

975
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:17,300
by non-saints like you and me one cannot modify what a saint says just to conform to popular

976
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:24,860
notions of the day no saint jayner's words were directly inspired by bob

977
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,180
yes yes yes

978
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:26,180


979
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,580
And they were placed in both of his holy testaments.

980
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,980
The collective teachings of J.R. Bob Dobbs and Revelation X.

981
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,800
With Maywell and Simon and Schuster.

982
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:41,720
Two books that you better have on your porcelain altar if you wish to survive X day.

983
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,980
You need both documents my friends along with your current sub-genius membership.

984
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,020
To get aboard those pleasure saucers come X day.

985
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,540
There will be chaos.

986
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,420
There will be murder and mayhem.

987
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,280
There will be bodies flying and bodies frying and all sorts of mischief and mayhem.

988
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:07,020
But don't think for a moment that it will prevent the gate master from checking each

989
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,060
and every passport for errors.

990
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,700
That membership better have your name on it.

991
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,040
And those books better be dog-eared and well read.

992
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,780
With every sentence underlined and every page present and or accounted for.

993
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,400
If you're in the middle of a war.

994
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,400


995
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,400


996
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,680
If you're missing so much as a single word of scripture.

997
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,920
You better run like hell and go out and buy another copy my friends.

998
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:29,820
And fast.

999
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,380
Because Bob doesn't like bobbies who edit his holy word.

1000
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,740
For whatever reason.

1001
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,620
Bob is the master of excuses and he's already heard them all my friends.

1002
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,880
He doesn't care if you lost it.

1003
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:41,940
Forgot it.

1004
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,840
The dog ate it or the cat ripped it apart.

1005
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,040
No sir.

1006
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:50,000
He doesn't care if you tore out a page by accident or on purpose because he found it

1007
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,320
offensive.

1008
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,020
Or you thought maybe it was politically incorrect.

1009
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:53,380
You're missing so much as a single word of scripture.

1010
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,120
You thought you would win more converts if you just removed it from public view.

1011
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,260
No sir.

1012
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:05,460
Now maybe after you sacrifice your life by dying for Bob.

1013
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,200
After you get resurrected and abducted by aliens.

1014
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,120
Negotiate salvation for an entire planet or at least the parts that matter.

1015
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,900
And create your own world class religion.

1016
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,380
Maybe then and only then will Bob care what you think he needs to do to improve his life.

1017
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,040
And serve his own religion.

1018
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,140
Amen.

1019
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,880
Tell him shut the fuck up.

1020
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,180
Bob's not arrogant my friends.

1021
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,740
He's just being realistic.

1022
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,660
You have literally no idea what you are complaining about.

1023
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:46,000
You've never even seen heaven more or less felt the flames of hell burning your little

1024
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,300
ass.

1025
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,980
What gives you the right to criticize Bob, his church, or his apostles?

1026
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,720
Nothing.

1027
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,720
You're lucky we replaced the old days of stoning with the pharmaceutical methods of today.

1028
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,580
Why back in the old days?

1029
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,300
Well I won't get into that.

1030
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,820
Statute of limitations hasn't run in.

1031
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:09,160
The amazing thing is that despite the incredible blasphemy of even thinking about changing

1032
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,940
the church or so much as one little dot on Bob's forehead.

1033
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,680
Despite the heresy of these thoughts some genies still vocalize their negative opinions

1034
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,700
about Bob in his own omnipresence.

1035
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,980
Isn't that remarkable?

1036
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:34,100
I mean what it proves is that these religious retards in their infinite lack of wisdom still

1037
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:41,240
realize like instinct that Bob's love is so encompassing that he'll still put up with

1038
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,780
their crap.

1039
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,900
Now I call that true love.

1040
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,600
It reminds me of an interesting couple I observed for some time now.

1041
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680


1042
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680


1043
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680


1044
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680


1045
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680


1046
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,160
He's a nice guy with his pathetic partner.

1047
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,020
He puts up with the most horrible complaining all the time.

1048
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,320
How he tolerates it I don't know.

1049
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,760
All she ever does is bitch and moan and bitch and moan.

1050
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,580
Always dissatisfied and yet he still loves her.

1051
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,120
He sacrifices everything for her.

1052
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,560
Oh sure.

1053
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,460
Oh sure he gets sex.

1054
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,680
But he could have gotten that out of her.

1055
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,260
He could have gotten that same sex from anyone else without having to put up with all the

1056
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,940
chronic complaining.

1057
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,220
How good is she?

1058
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,260
You'd think he'd either dish the bitch or kill her.

1059
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,620
I bet she's damn good.

1060
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,360
I hope he does both because she deserves it.

1061
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:41,860
Unless of course she wises up and starts showing a little bit of appreciation for the man who

1062
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,340
protects her, dedicates his life to her and struggles every day to provide her with a

1063
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:46,980
better future.

1064
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,200
Bob?

1065
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:50,420
Yeah incidentally.

1066
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:50,920
Is he here?

1067
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,240
I think you know this couple.

1068
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,560
His name is J.R. Bob Doll.

1069
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,240
Yeah.

1070
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,640
And I'll just let your imaginations roam for a little bit to see if you can figure out who the

1071
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,080
allegorical partner is.

1072
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:03,740
Yeah.

1073
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,300
Howdy.

1074
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,100
Howdy.

1075
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:11,880
And while you're considering all the numerous possibilities you might ask yourself this.

1076
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:19,400
If you were the most handsome traveling salesman in the entire known galaxy and the person you

1077
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,700
love didn't pay you much attention.

1078
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,120
Wasn't as good looking as you were.

1079
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,520
Was stingy with their love offerings.

1080
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,540
And complained all the god damn time.

1081
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,480
Would you put up with their shit?

1082
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:40,040
Or might you just jettison them into space to the nearest airlock and grab yourself a

1083
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,360
younger, cuter, more appreciative subgenius in her stead.

1084
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,680
Just you think about that the next time you even get the urge to open your mouth and say

1085
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,640
stop and start dictating to thobs.

1086
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,420
Here to the word of our peace Bob.

1087
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:54,760
Amen.

1088
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,280
King of hate.

1089
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Papa Joe Mama.

1090
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,120
Woo.

1091
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,560
Woo.

1092
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,320
I gotta say it touched my heart to receive all that money.

1093
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,880
Sometimes it gets tough.

1094
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:13,520
I think man.

1095
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:13,780


1096
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,320
You're the sort of man to slack out there.

1097
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,980
Is there any slack out there?

1098
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,700
Is there any slack out there?

1099
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,000
Is there any slack out there?

1100
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:34,100
Is there any slack out there?

1101
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:34,160
Is there any slack out there?

1102
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:39,720
And of course dear friends the answer is yes there is slack and it is out here at, you've

1103
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,580
got that pencil ready?

1104
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,560
I'm gonna give you a post office box you can write to for free information.

1105
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,300
It's pretty good free information.

1106
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,260
For the, the price?

1107
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,920
Free.

1108
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,460
Oh there went the power I guess I can't give you the uh.

1109
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,400
God damn man we, the electrical power just went out again.

1110
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:05,300
Well it gives, it gives us a chance for you to go get that pencil and actually do that

1111
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:05,960
this time.

1112
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,120
Um for what you could just email us.

1113
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,680
Just email.

1114
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:18,660
What shall we do until the excess come in our hands?

1115
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:18,900
What shall we do until the excess come in our hands?

1116
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,900
Nineteen ninety eight.

1117
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:31,300
How should I spend the time till next day?

1118
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,900
How should I praise Bob?

1119
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,780
By sending.

1120
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,080
Yeah.

1121
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,620
Yeah.

1122
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,200
Just.

1123
00:57:46,820 --> 00:58:03,900
And you can do that by writing Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1124
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:12,620
Once again, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1125
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,020
Or email Slack at met...

1126
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:18,720
Let me say that again.

1127
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,980
Email Slack at subgenius.com.

1128
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,820
Almost gave our old email address.

1129
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,700
Old, old.

1130
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,880
Or just check out www.subgenius.com.

1131
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,520
Should I quit my conspiracy job?

1132
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,420
There went the power again.

1133
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,940
There's just no answers in the quest for knowledge from Bob.

1134
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,600
You get plenty of answers.

1135
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,840
Real great, great ones.

1136
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:51,840
Really funny ones.

1137
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,400
Sometimes even useful ones.

1138
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:59,600
There they are, hating the lack of power.

1139
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,540
All right, fuck that shit.

1140
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,320
We're going on.

1141
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,660
All right, next song.

1142
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,640
Next song.

1143
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,800
Rant for Bob.

1144
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,060
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1145
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,240
Okay, so we want to move them to here.

1146
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,020
Okay, we do not be alarmed.

1147
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:31,780
Do not be afraid.

1148
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,440
Everything will continue with me.

1149
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,340
We have some things coming up, okay?

1150
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:40,300
Let's try to all love each other.

1151
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,800
In fact, let's try to all love each other right now.

1152
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,320
Go ahead, take your clothes off.

1153
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,500
It's all right.

1154
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,260
It's all right.

1155
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,480
We're all among friends here.

1156
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,340
Well...

1157
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,660
There we go.

1158
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,240
I can't be here.

1159
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,300
I can't be here.

1160
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,060
I can suck my really white...

1161
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
This is it.

1162
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:01,480
This is it.

1163
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:01,980
This is it.

1164
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,140
This is it.

1165
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,140


1166
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:03,320
This is it.

1167
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,120
This is it.

1168
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,680
This is it.

1169
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,880
Praise Bob.

1170
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,100
This is it.

1171
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1172
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1173
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1174
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1175
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1176
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1177
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1178
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1179
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1180
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1181
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1182
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1183
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1184
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1185
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1186
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1187
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1188
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1189
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1190
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1191
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1192
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100


1193
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,100
