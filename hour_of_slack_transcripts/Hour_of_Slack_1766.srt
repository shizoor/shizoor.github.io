00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Nobody feels really bad around Bob unless you get bit by a

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,440
subgenius

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,900
power of

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,780
swag.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,500
You'll finally get to see why they call me Bob.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,520
What, you got something against a warm welcome?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,340
No, no, just...

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,080
just has been a long time, that's all, and...

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,380
well, people change.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,920
Have I changed?

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,640
Maybe.

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,640
What are you getting at, man? Are you...

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,080
Maybe.

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,160
The bobbing boy nearly floats away.

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,080
But bounces back like a man.

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,700
Mostly.

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,260
Keep it running!

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,160
Okay, Bob, we're ready for rollout.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,660
Bobbing to the surface.

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,240
That's what I like to see!

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,800
You're saying that the reason that

22
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,280
you're not doing the job that I'm

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,460
paying you to do is...

24
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,560
Bobbing to the surface.

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
That you don't have a job to do?

26
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,440
No.

27
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,160
Is that what you're saying?

28
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,040
What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?

29
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,440
That you're as useless as an old snake right here?

30
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,540
Well, guess what, buddy.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,660
I think...

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,780
you just convinced me.

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,460
Are we all...

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,680
in a continual cycle of birth and rebirth,

35
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,640
simply interchanging bodies as we go?

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,140
And if so,

37
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,820
this raises yet another question.

38
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,240
Do we get to choose?

39
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,840
I mean, who was I before I was who I am now,

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,680
and who will I be next?

41
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,840
Could I be you?

42
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,920
Now that is definitely weird.

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
Weird? For what?

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,880
Uh, not that weird.

45
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,740
Um...

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,180
Later, friends, there'll be new stuff,

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,720
but first, as promised last week,

48
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,060
we're about to hear part two of Reverend Exister's

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,340
collage extravaganza, Ship of State.

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,700
What a way to finish.

51
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,640
We're not finished.

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,180
Speak for yourself.

53
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,860
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,980
Are you afraid of me?

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,440
I'm afraid of the future.

56
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,240
I believe that was a general idea that I was trying to convey.

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,740
I don't mean this future.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,980
What is this? Multiple choice?

59
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,640
Some people are afraid...

60
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,780
of what might happen.

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,120
I was terrified.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,020
Try not to be too hard on yourself.

63
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,220
We all felt exactly the same.

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,500
I want some fantasy.

65
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,400
I want to see in society's black underbelly

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,860
he can never pretend, like you do,

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,480
that it doesn't exist,

68
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,160
no matter who orders him to look the other way.

69
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,000
We don't do this...

70
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,740
thing,

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,580
because it's permitted.

72
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,760
We do it because we have to.

73
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,080
We do it because we're compelled.

74
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,700
The End

75
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,700


76
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:52,880
The End

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,420
The End

78
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,980
This is not just a fiction.

79
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:02,980


80
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,260
chemistry,

81
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,500
it's the Значит,

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,480
I think of you.

83
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,320
Nick said there were no hospitals.

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
You said it means there was nothing for you.

85
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Please

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I don't regret it much.

87
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,580
Know this,

88
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:19,800
people,

89
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,100
when you are afraid of reality,

90
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,880
we're scared to give you back

91
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,080
what that shows,

92
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,120
Man wants chaos. In fact, he's gotta have it.

93
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,680
Depression, strife, riots, murder, all this dread.

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,500
We're irresistibly drawn to that almost orgiastic state created out of death and destruction.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,320
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

96
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,640
Sure, the media tries to put a sad face on these things, painting them up as great human tragedies.

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,700
But we all know the function of the media has never been to eliminate the evils of the world. No.

98
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,800
Their job is to persuade us to accept those evils and get used to living with them.

99
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,540
The powers that be want us to be passive observers.

100
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,940
You got a match?

101
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,940
And they haven't given us any other options outside the occasional, purely symbolic, participatory act of voting.

102
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,620
You want the puppet on the right or the puppet on the left?

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:33,380
I feel that the time has come to project my own inadequacies and dissatisfactions into the socio-political and scientific schemes.

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,660
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,400
It wasn't really worth it.

106
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,420
The instinct of my purity worth the lifetime of your lies?

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,400
Please explain to me, where's the purity? You couldn't live without it.

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,140
You see, there is only one constant. One universal. It is the only real.

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,920
Cause. Causality. Action. Reaction. Cause. And effect.

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,240
Everything begins with choice.

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,720
No. Wrong.

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,940
Choice is an illusion.

113
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,820
Created between those with power and those without.

114
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,240
Look there. At that woman.

115
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,020
My God, just look at her.

116
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,540
Affecting everyone around her so obvious, so bourgeois, so normal.

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,200
What you see, I have sent you a dessert.

118
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,180
A very special dessert.

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,120
I wrote it myself.

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,840
It starts so simply.

121
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,020
Each line of the poem creating a new effect.

122
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,500
Just like...

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,500
Poetry.

124
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,280
First, a rush.

125
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:09,740
Heat.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,900
A heart flutter.

127
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,720
She does not understand why.

128
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,220
Is it the why? No.

129
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,240
What is it then? What is the reason?

130
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,580
Soon it does not matter.

131
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,420
Soon the why and the reason are gone.

132
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,100
And all that matters is the feeling itself.

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,020
And this is the nature of human person.

134
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,460
We struggle against it. We fight to deny it.

135
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,560
But it is of course pretend. It is a lie.

136
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,040
Beneath our poised appearance.

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
The truth is we are complete.

138
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:50,960
We are complete.

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,540
Out of control.

140
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Our politics is too delayed.

141
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


143
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,080


145
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,720
Out of control.

146
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,700
Things change.

147
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,020
Thank you.

148
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,740
Thank you.

149
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,220
It's worth a thousand prayers.

150
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,100
Don't cry, she might.

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,720
I don't think I'm any crazier than you are.

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,020
That's your shadow on the wall.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,560
Can't get rid of your shadow, can you?

154
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,300
Any regrets.

155
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,340
I don't spend a lot of time with regret.

156
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,080
That's a waste of emotion.

157
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,880
Well, I wish that Indian hadn't got killed.

158
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,080
Man had a rattlesnake sitting in a corner.

159
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,400
Rattlesnake?

160
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,140
Could pick it up and pet it.

161
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
He saw it.

162
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,840
He saw what?

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,520
The demon. He saw the demon.

164
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,680
The demon?

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,620
What demon?

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,300
Everybody got the demon in here, okay?

167
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,820
The demon lives in here.

168
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,460
It feeds on your hate.

169
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
Cuts, kills, rapes.

170
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,880
It uses your weakness, your fear.

171
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,380
Only the vicious survive.

172
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,640
We all told we're no good piece of shit

173
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,680
from the time we could breathe.

174
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,860
God damn right.

175
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,360
After a while, you kind of become bad.

176
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,980
So tell me, how can you look at an ordinary person,

177
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
an innocent guy with kids,

178
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,940
and then shoot him to death?

179
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,000
I mean, how can you bring yourself to do that?

180
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,280
Innocent?

181
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,840
Who's innocent? You innocent?

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm innocent. Yes, I am.

183
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,060
I've met it.

184
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:14,420
Definitely.

185
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,540
All God's creatures do it in some form or another.

186
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,920
I mean, you look in the forest.

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,040
We got species killing other species.

188
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,280
Our species killing all species, including the forest.

189
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,020
And we just call it industry, not murder.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,640
But I know a lot of people who deserve to die.

191
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,140
Why do they deserve to die?

192
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,400
A lot of people walking around out there already dead.

193
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,340
Just need to be put out of their misery.

194
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,020
I don't know.

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,400
I don't know.

196
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,900
I don't know.

197
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:49,900


198
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:49,900


199
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:49,900


200
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:49,900


201
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,420
For the result, there is no escape from it.

202
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,380
We are forever slaves to it.

203
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,660
Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it.

204
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,120
To understand the why.

205
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,360
Why is what separates us from them.

206
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,460
You from me.

207
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,060
Why is the only real source of power.

208
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,180
Without it, you are powerless.

209
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,600
You know, the only thing that kills a demon...

210
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,720
Love.

211
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
It's just like...

212
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,040
Being in the garden of age.

213
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,580
Our only love could kill a demon.

214
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,000
How that thought.

215
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
We are the heart of death rattled on the world.

216
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,920
Do you think he'll live up to his name?

217
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,000
Or will it just be a death hairball?

218
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Prepare to evacuate soul.

219
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,600
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,260
Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,840
Goodbye cruel world.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm leaving you today.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,120
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

224
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,500
Goodbye all you people.

225
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,720
There's nothing you can say.

226
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,860
To make me change my mind.

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,080
Goodbye.

228
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,260
Painful living fear, isn't it?

229
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,800
Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

230
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,680
Oh, I agree.

231
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
Wake up.

232
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,980
Time to die.

233
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,460
Die.

234
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,280
Why won't you die?

235
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,400
Why won't you die?

236
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Why won't you die?

237
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,700
Beneath this mask there is more than flesh.

238
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,580
Beneath this mask there is an idea.

239
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,020
And ideas are bulletproof.

240
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,040
I shall die here.

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,000
Every inch of me shall perish.

242
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,440
Every inch.

243
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,480
But one. An inch.

244
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,060
It is small and it is fragile.

245
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,400
And it is the only thing in the world worth having.

246
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,580
We must never lose it or give it away.

247
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,320
We must never let them take it from us.

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,720
I hope that whoever you are

249
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,860
you escaped this place.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,640
I hope that the world turns

251
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,860
and that things get better.

252
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,600
But what I hope most of all

253
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,880
is that you understand what I mean

254
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,580
when I tell you that even though I do not know you

255
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,380
and even though I may never meet you

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,060
laugh with you

257
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,780
cry with you

258
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,360
or kiss you

259
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,660
I love you.

260
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,320
With all my heart.

261
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
I love you.

262
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,940
I love you.

263
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,680
oh, wait a minute

264
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,880
you fucking hypocrite

265
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
you said the love beats the demons

266
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,440
you said that love beats the demons

267
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,380
and it will

268
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,600
it's just that you're the last one

269
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,420
I don't remember if I can kill me

270
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,980
this is not about you, you egomaniac

271
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,120
I kind of like you

272
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,300
but if we let you go

273
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,080
we would be just like everybody else

274
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,320
killing you

275
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,460
and what you represent is

276
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
a statement. You and me

277
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,520
You're not even the same species.

278
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,480
I used to be you, then I evolved.

279
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,180
From where you're standing, you're a man.

280
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,460
From where I'm standing, you're an ape.

281
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,880
You're not even an ape, you're a media person.

282
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,600
Media's like the weather, only it's man-made.

283
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,320
You're the one who made it impure.

284
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,040
You're buying and selling the fear.

285
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,920
You say, why?

286
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,180
I say, why bother?

287
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,680
I have some dignity.

288
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,280
All right, so I'm a parasite, so what?

289
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,100
Right, life is cruel, no one said it was gonna be easy.

290
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,940
The day you two killed your ass belonged to us!

291
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,660
To the public, to the media!

292
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,200
That's how it is, and we are married, eh?

293
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,820
Let's make a little music, Colorado.

294
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,680
In other news tonight, a bride and groom's

295
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,840
wedding reception turned into

296
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,500
a nightmare.

297
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,980
In chapter six, he begins to get into

298
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,760
the actual message of Revelation 6.

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,040
Now, I saw in the lamp opening,

300
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,440
He can sit in the sun, that's all I tell you.

301
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,280
Chapter five, now only the Lamb of Christ

302
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,760
is worthy to unseat a lamb.

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,960
He slapped me again, he...

304
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,860
I just wanted to say this, like this,

305
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,220
before I say it to the brides and grooms,

306
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,800
can we...

307
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,820
The people is all trying to lie to you,

308
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:40,820


309
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,180
and the Lord is gonna get wine for us.

310
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,140
What does this wine horse mean?

311
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,200
And he was set on it at a foe,

312
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,560
and a crown was given him,

313
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,940
and he went forth conquering and to conquer.

314
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,240
A wine horse?

315
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,540
Now let the Bible interpret the Bible.

316
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,860
.

317
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:57,860


318
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:04,960
.

319
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,120
Give me a nightmare broken,

320
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,340
and I'm never broke.

321
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:09,900
.

322
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,560
Life is lonely here,

323
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,340
there's no one left to torture.

324
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:15,800
.

325
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,900
Give me absolute control,

326
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,500
over every living soul.

327
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,020
.

328
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,640
That's an order.

329
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
.

330
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,580
Give me a crack, anal sex,

331
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,200
take the only tree that's left,

332
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,600
and stomp it up the hole.

333
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,520
.

334
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,340
In your culture.

335
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,140
.

336
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,340
Give me a back door burning wall.

337
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:48,960
.

338
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,160
Give me a start, and say,

339
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,120
Paul, I've seen the future, brother.

340
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,780
.

341
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,280
It is my turn.

342
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:56,760


343
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:56,960
.

344
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,040
Things gonna slide.

345
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,140
.

346
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,540
Slide in all directions.

347
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,120
.

348
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,180
Won't pay nothing.

349
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:06,720
.

350
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,620
Won't be nothing you can't measure.

351
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,620
.

352
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,340


353
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,080
The blizzard.

354
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,440
.

355
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,140
The blizzard of the world's crossed the threshold,

356
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,020
and it's overturned the order of the soul.

357
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:23,980
.

358
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,340
When they say.

359
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:26,760
.

360
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,180
Repent.

361
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,080
.

362
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:29,760
Repent.

363
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,060
.

364
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,840
I wonder what they meant.

365
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,760
.

366
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,400
When they say.

367
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:36,900
.

368
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,620
Repent.

369
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,560
.

370
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,060
Repent.

371
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,400
.

372
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Repent.

373
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,160
.

374
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,980
I wonder what they meant.

375
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,560
.

376
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,480
When they say.

377
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,080
.

378
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,560
Repent.

379
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,660
.

380
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,240
Repent.

381
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,500
.

382
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,100
Repent.

383
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,340
.

384
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,160
I wonder what they meant.

385
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,560
.

386
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,260
.

387
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,980
.

388
00:18:59,980 --> 00:18:59,980


389
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,040
.

390
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,520
.

391
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,520


392
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,900
.

393
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:01,960
.

394
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,440
.

395
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,480
.

396
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,480


397
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,560
.

398
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,520
.

399
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:17,160
And, he said,

400
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:29,940
this shouldn't have happened but zusel Wiebeler said he wanted to go and please not be obstructed.

401
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,220
.

402
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,220


403
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,280
.

404
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,300
.

405
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,320
.

406
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,340
.

407
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,340


408
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,340


409
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,340


410
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:30,360
.

411
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,360


412
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,440
.

413
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,560
.

414
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:30,580
.

415
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,660
.

416
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:30,680
.

417
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:30,700
.

418
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:30,720
.

419
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,480
To say it clear, to say it cool, it's over, it ain't going any further.

420
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:51,080
And now the wheels of heaven stop, you feel the devil's riding crop, get ready for the future, it is murder.

421
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:05,920
And things are gonna slide, in all directions, won't be nothing, nothing you can measure anymore.

422
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:18,120
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold and it's overturned the order of the soul.

423
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,060
Wind it up.

424
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:29,040
When they said, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

425
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:39,080
When they said, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

426
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:49,220
When they said, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.

427
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,060
When they said, repent, repent, repent.

428
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:59,240
There'll be the breaking of the ancient western code

429
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,080
Your private life will suddenly explode

430
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:12,020
There'll be phantoms, there'll be fires on the road

431
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,820
And a white man dancing

432
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,440
You'll see a woman hanging upside down

433
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,000
Her features covered by her fallen gown

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,620
And all the lousy little poets come around

435
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,700
Trying to sound like Charlie Manson

436
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,800
Yeah, the white man dancing

437
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,320
Give me back the burning wall

438
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,800
Give me Stalin and St. Paul

439
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,840
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima

440
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,840
Destroy another fetus now

441
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,320
We don't let children in our house

442
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,800
I've seen the future, baby

443
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,660
It is murder

444
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,900
Things are gonna slide

445
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,100
In all directions

446
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,860
Won't be nothing

447
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,560
Nothing you can measure anymore

448
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,740
The blizzard

449
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,820
The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold

450
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,580
And it's overturned the order of the soul

451
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,680
The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold

452
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:45,680


453
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,000
When I say

454
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,580
They say

455
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:48,820
Repent

456
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,560
Repent

457
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,260
Repent

458
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:51,620
Repent

459
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,420
Repent

460
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,500
I wonder what they meant

461
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,200
When I say

462
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,840
They say

463
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,940
Repent

464
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,660
Repent

465
00:22:59,660 --> 00:22:59,820
Repent

466
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,520
Repent

467
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,020
Repent

468
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,720
I wonder what they meant

469
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,360
When I say

470
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,100
They say

471
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,080
Repent

472
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,900
Repent

473
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,700
Repent

474
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,840
No wonder what they meant

475
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,640
I wonder what they meant

476
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,200
When that's said, repent, repent, repent.

477
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Time, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

478
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,300
That's a fucking joke, right?

479
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm not going to ask that the recording devices be turned off.

480
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,440
And I'm not going to ask that all of you cover your ears for what I'm about to say.

481
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,980
But I'll ask your discretion in this tale of the decisions made by subgenius.

482
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,780
Cautionary tales of real subgeniuses.

483
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,500
I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee.

484
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,700
And in 1992, I moved to Portland, Oregon.

485
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,040
And on the way, I stopped.

486
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,540
I stopped at the houses of some people I'd been corresponding with.

487
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Even emailing in a few cases.

488
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,520
One of them was Reverend Tom Dickinherry.

489
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,040
Who lived in a city that I will not disclose.

490
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,940
He and I had a good correspondence and he was a right funny guy.

491
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,980
And he said, yeah, you can stay at my place when you come through town.

492
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,100
Come on by anytime.

493
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,380
So I did.

494
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
And that's when I learned.

495
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,480
That he was a teenager in high school living with his parents.

496
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,480
So it was kind of staying at his parents' place.

497
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
Instead of staying at his place.

498
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:01,500
And that evening, Reverend Tom Dickinherry and his mom and I were sitting in their backyard.

499
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,480
And she said, you know, I'm kind of worried about this church of the subgenius.

500
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,860
Yes.

501
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,100
And I said, well, I'm not sure if it's a good place to stay.

502
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,100


503
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,100


504
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,640
It seems like there's a lot of drug use in it.

505
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,160
You don't say.

506
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,900
And I said, well, ma'am, that's just kind of part of the humor.

507
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
That is talked about.

508
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,200
And of course, some people do it.

509
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,600
Some find it cutting edge.

510
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,040
Not so much anymore.

511
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't.

512
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,760
And it's certainly not required of anybody.

513
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,660
So I wouldn't worry about it.

514
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,680
And I think she felt a little better after that.

515
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,300
Well, some time passed.

516
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,040
And I hadn't heard from Reverend Tom Dickinherry in quite a while.

517
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,740
And I got a letter.

518
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,740
Because it was still the time when you wrote letters to people.

519
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,720
And here's what he'd been up to.

520
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,040
He was a straight-A student in that high school.

521
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,860
And the editor of the school newspaper.

522
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,540
So he had a key to the school.

523
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,080
And he could go in any time he wanted.

524
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,380
So he could finish up that late-breaking story before it went to press.

525
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,620
Well, because he had the...

526
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,120
Key to the school.

527
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,540
One morning he went in.

528
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,340
And stole all of the computer lab.

529
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,520
This was in the mid-90s when a computer lab was still kind of a big deal.

530
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,920
That's a lot of gear.

531
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,860
He stole all of it.

532
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,360
Took it home.

533
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Every last scrap.

534
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,560
Took it home and hid it.

535
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,280
It made the local news.

536
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,620
Big cyber crime.

537
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,980
All these computers stolen.

538
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,820
And nobody had any idea.

539
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,700
But they knew computers were the future.

540
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,760
So they retooled the computer lab.

541
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,980
And he stole that too.

542
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,080
He stole all the computers twice.

543
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,480
Well, it wasn't hard to figure out at that point.

544
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,540
And he was called into the office and said...

545
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,380
The principal said,

546
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,000
Reverend Tom, Dick, and Harry,

547
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,180
we are, of course, not sure at all who's taken the computer lab twice.

548
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
Not sure.

549
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,840
But we think it's time you chose a new editor.

550
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,760
Not sure.

551
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,220
For the paper.

552
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
Give somebody else a chance.

553
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,900
And why don't you give us your key?

554
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,740
You understand?

555
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,140
Not sure.

556
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Reverend Tom, Dick, and Harry.

557
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,080
Well, I do understand.

558
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,940
He did understand.

559
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,040
He returned that key.

560
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,720
And then went home.

561
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,460
Disassembled all the computers.

562
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,920
And scattered the parts all over the place.

563
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,900
Through some of the river.

564
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,740
Except one.

565
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,760
He kept one of them.

566
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,440
Because in the mid-90s, computers and laser printers were still kind of a magical thing.

567
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,280
And he had basic layout skills and a little bit of pirated software.

568
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,660
So he took that computer.

569
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,140
And he took a prescription pad that he had finangled from a doctor's office.

570
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,560
And he made out scripts for prescription pills.

571
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,000
More demkind pills than you've ever seen.

572
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,440
More demkind pills.

573
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
And he took it to one pharmacy.

574
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,020
And they gave it to him.

575
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,060
All he had to do was give him some money and this piece of paper that he generated.

576
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,260
Then he did it at another pharmacy.

577
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,940
And another and another.

578
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,440
And then he was doing the rounds every day.

579
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,760
One day, there was a knock on the door.

580
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,860
Knock, knock, knock.

581
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,940
Mrs. Tom, Dick, and Harry, is your son, Reverend Tom, Dick, and Harry at home?

582
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,640
Well, he sure is.

583
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,320
Son, could you come with us?

584
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,620
And so he did.

585
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,760
And Reverend Tom, Dick, and Harry was taken to the police station.

586
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,600
And shown the videotape of him entering.

587
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,260
And they told him that he had been to eight pharmacies the day before.

588
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,100
Eight.

589
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,420
Eight pharmacies.

590
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,760
And passing a forged prescription at each one.

591
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,480
And they told him, you're looking about 10, 20, 30 years each time you did that on just this day.

592
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,660
Plus all the other times you did that.

593
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,920
So we've got a choice for you to make, sir.

594
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,820
You can either go to trial and maybe not see the light of day again.

595
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,840
Or, because this is the first time you've been in trial.

596
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:07,840


597
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,900
And because you're a straight A student and the editor of the school newspaper.

598
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,600
You can just go to a mental hospital for six months.

599
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,120
I don't know where I'd be sitting.

600
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,620
He chose the latter.

601
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,040
Indeed.

602
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,320
So he went to the psychiatric hospital.

603
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,220
And it had been a while since I heard from him.

604
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,260
But I got a letter.

605
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,560
Hey man, guess where I am.

606
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,380
And he told me his tale that he had gone through.

607
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,300
He did his six months.

608
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,820
No alliteration.

609
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,380
No electric shock.

610
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,760
But forced drugging and counseling.

611
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,580
And then a little bit of after counseling after he got out.

612
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,980
He did his six months.

613
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,320
Got out.

614
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,160
And because he'd been a straight A student.

615
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,420
And editor of the school newspaper.

616
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,920
And a young guy.

617
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,240
The record was expunged.

618
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,620
Because he had just gone to a hospital and not to prison or trial.

619
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,460
Lucky.

620
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:05,040
So he got a full scholarship to Reed College in Portland, Oregon.

621
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,120
And that's a pretty prestigious school.

622
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,700
He had the full ride.

623
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,400
He went to Reed for a couple months.

624
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,900
And then decided that it was more important that he went to rave parties.

625
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,700
And distribute pills there.

626
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,940
So he dropped out of Reed.

627
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,780
And became a pill distributor.

628
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,280
And that was the last I heard of him for about 20 years.

629
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,940
I didn't even know he was still in Portland.

630
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,260
But.

631
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,440
I looked him up one day on the internet.

632
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,900
And sure enough there he was.

633
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,540
I found him.

634
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,020
Hey man.

635
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,820
Remember me?

636
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,380
Yeah I remember you.

637
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,680
I asked where are you?

638
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm in Portland, Oregon.

639
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,280
Really?

640
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,340
You've been here for 20 years and haven't said hey?

641
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:50,860
Yep.

642
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
Well let me buy you dinner.

643
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,740
Okay.

644
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,340
So we go and have dinner.

645
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,760
He's looking about the same.

646
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,920
Life has been good to him.

647
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,560
He's looking fit.

648
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,860
Just a little taller than he was.

649
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,460
Otherwise same smile.

650
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,340
Same sparkle in his eye.

651
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,780
But he's receiving transmissions the whole time that we're talking.

652
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,300
He's having a dialogue with me.

653
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,760
And who knows what other unseen agencies are also delivering his ordinances.

654
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,000
And we talk and he's fine.

655
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,660
He says he's got a wife.

656
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,540
And the wife takes care of him.

657
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Kind of like a house pet.

658
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,120
He can't hold a job.

659
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,460
Can't hold a thought.

660
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
But he's got the means to get by.

661
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,540
And towards the end of us having dinner he says,

662
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,060
Well I just want you to know that if we don't hang out again and if I never talk to you again,

663
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,400
it's nothing personal.

664
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,120
I just can't relate anymore.

665
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,020
Well okay then.

666
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,900
So he went off and did his thing.

667
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,200
And I've done my thing.

668
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,160
And I'm here now.

669
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,780
And he's wherever he is now.

670
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:02,900
And that is the first of an endless series of cautionary tales of the subgenius.

671
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,460
There you go.

672
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,040
My word.

673
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:17,520
A lesson learned perhaps by somebody apparently not necessarily Reverend Tom, Dick and Harry.

674
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,500
Seemed rather thick.

675
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,060
And yet he has his slack.

676
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,480
He's having his ex day tomorrow.

677
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,500
And who's to say.

678
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,380
Just like everybody else 7 a.m. we will sort you out.

679
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,360
Who's to say.

680
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,340
Who's to say.

681
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,400
Well you said he was getting transmissions.

682
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,300
And he's getting transmissions.

683
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,940
I've been waiting quite some time to even have one.

684
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,260
And he's got them nonstop night and day.

685
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:43,880
All day long.

686
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,240
I had to hold that goofy machine like he had.

687
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,200
Get a heart attack again to have a transmission.

688
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,700
And it was vague and muddy.

689
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,580
Would you say it was worth it?

690
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:53,780
Contradictory.

691
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Yeah sure.

692
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,060
Oh.

693
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,540
Yeah.

694
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,180
Was there much wisdom implied?

695
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,640
I'm fine.

696
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,600
I bounced back.

697
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,520
Sure is worth it.

698
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,580
I wouldn't change anything.

699
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,700
Wouldn't change a thing.

700
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,460
No.

701
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,520
Cautionary tales of the subgenius.

702
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,200
Wouldn't go back in time and change anything.

703
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,960
If I did go back in time I would be deposited somewhere in outer space.

704
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,200
Wherever the earth had left from.

705
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:19,960
Yes.

706
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,700
You would ruin the time stream.

707
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,060
The world is in motion at all times.

708
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,500
That was a real good hamburger I just ate while listening to that.

709
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,120
I mean your tale.

710
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,260
It was the first hamburger I've had since January I think.

711
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,440
And did you eat the heck out of it?

712
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,700
Or the darn out of it?

713
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,680
You know to tell the truth I didn't really eat the hell out of it because I was listening

714
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,340
to your story.

715
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,360
But I had about half of my bites were.

716
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,680
The darn.

717
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,440
At least a good heck of a bite.

718
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,840
I wasn't doing it with full absolute concentration.

719
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,120
I was multitasking.

720
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,500
Listening and eating.

721
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,140
Oh.

722
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,080
That's grand.

723
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,780
Yeah.

724
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,420
Why not both?

725
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,220
Why not both?

726
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,120
That's my motto.

727
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,820
Why not?

728
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,880
And I don't know if everyone knows that.

729
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,760
Do it every chance you get.

730
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,640
K-N-O-T.

731
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,640
That's how the not is spelled in why not both.

732
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,520
Wait a minute.

733
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,480
I didn't know that.

734
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,240
There you go.

735
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,480
It kind of adjudicates.

736
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,140
It doesn't have to be K-N-O-T.

737
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,860
It can be just N-O-T.

738
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,640
Why not both?

739
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,940
Why not both?

740
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,500
Mm-hmm.

741
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:20,860
Yep.

742
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,220
G-N-O-T.

743
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,920
G-N-O-T.

744
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,080


745
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,260
G-N-O-T.

746
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,860
G-N-O-T.

747
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,600
G-N-O-T.

748
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,400
G-N-O-T.

749
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,520
G-N-O-T.

750
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:29,820
Both.

751
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,220
That doesn't make any sense.

752
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,600
No.

753
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,760
Now here's another cautionary tale of the subgenus that has a difference ending.

754
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,860
The only thing I have to say right now is bring me a fork.

755
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,180
Please.

756
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,920
Will anyone step forward to bring this man such a simple request?

757
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,720
Just a fork.

758
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,280
Just a fork.

759
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,800
Please be kind.

760
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,240
A fork.

761
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,040
Bring me a fork.

762
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,860
I have this plate of food in front of me that I'm staring at.

763
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,380
A fork has been given upon me.

764
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,380


765
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,220
That's fantastic.

766
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,640
I have the most blessed.

767
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:01,980
Unbelievable.

768
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,940
I have forked now.

769
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,780
He asked for a fork and there's a mad rush to the stage.

770
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,420
Now you have double forked.

771
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,160
Double forked.

772
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,040
I've been double forked.

773
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,700
He's been forked and double forked.

774
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,800
And forked again.

775
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Grand outcomes.

776
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,380
Forked and forked and forked again.

777
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:24,380
There was a subgenus I knew and still know named Reverend Multivac Kleenex.

778
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,160
Multivac Kleenex you say?

779
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,200
Reverend Multivac Kleenex.

780
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,680
And I went to high school together.

781
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,280
And he's a good egg.

782
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:43,360
He hooked up with somebody who was not necessarily appreciative of his skill set and personality.

783
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,940
And he had a job that was not necessarily fulfilling in every possible way to him.

784
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,940
One day in 1998 he told his wife and he told his job, I'm going to X day.

785
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm going to X day.

786
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,900
That's what he said.

787
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,260
And his wife said, oh no you're not.

788
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,540
And his job said, oh no you're not.

789
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,060
Oh no you're not.

790
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,240
But he's there.

791
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:20,740
In fact, if you watch the documentaries made by the filmmaker Reverend Evan Stang, you'll see Reverend Dr. Multivac Kleenex, Hodge, in those documentaries.

792
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,980
Because he did go to X day.

793
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,960
And he had a fine time.

794
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,800
And I was glad to see my friend there.

795
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,500
Well he got back.

796
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,040
He was in the office.

797
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,900
And his job said, heck no you don't have a job here anymore.

798
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,520
And his wife said, heck no you don't live here anymore.

799
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,860
He lost his job and he lost his wife because he went to X day.

800
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,740
It's not the only case of that happening.

801
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,520
But he got a double whammy.

802
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,340
But it didn't slow him down at all.

803
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,420
He found, instantly found a far, far better job.

804
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,140
What?

805
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,640
And instantly found a far, far better wife.

806
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,080
What?

807
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,580
And now he's a happy man living at a weather station in Alaska.

808
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,140
What, what, what?

809
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,000
That's right.

810
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,900
He loves the nature there.

811
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,360
He loves his job.

812
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,400
He's paid well.

813
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,760
Takes pictures of moose outside his window.

814
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,140
And by that I mean he's inside taking a photo of a moose outside his window.

815
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Outside his window.

816
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,040
So not all cautionary tales of the subgenius have an unhappy ending.

817
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,980
Waking up one morning and suddenly a moose is staring you in the face.

818
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,360
Hi Mr. Moose.

819
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:35,760
Some cautionary tales of the subgenius have a, can I even say it, a happy ending.

820
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,440
Now I hope that each of your cautionary tales has the ending that you deserve most.

821
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,100
It might not be the one that you're envisioning at the moment.

822
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,100
But it'll be the one that looks best on paper.

823
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,540
Looks best on your arrest record.

824
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,680
Looks best in your FBI file.

825
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,940
It looks best in the Stark Fist of Removal Issue Number 39.

826
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,140
Ask a silly question, you just might get the truth.

827
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,460
It's there between the ditches in the rough.

828
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,460
It's real hieroglyphics, I'm callous to the touch

829
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,200
You ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

830
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,020
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

831
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,820
God is like the French, he understands English

832
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,140
But he doesn't like to speak it, lest he must

833
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,020
You ask him to repeat himself, he'll grind you into dust

834
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,100
Do you need to hear more? No, I think I've heard enough

835
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,980
You ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

836
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:56,100
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

837
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,540
The objects in the mirror are closer than they seem

838
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,920
But they're backwards like Leonardo's hand

839
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,780
He wrote all of the answers down in disappearing ink

840
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,840
And I'm happy, yes I'm happy as a goddamn clam

841
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm happy, oh I'm happy enough

842
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,800
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

843
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,780
There's music at the minimum

844
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,300
There's rhythm in the rails

845
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,580
I gotta think for sixteenth notes

846
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,060
Rat-a-tat, I was just about to crack it

847
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,500
But the code got tough

848
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,340
You ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

849
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,820
Dot, dot, dot, dash, dash, dash, dot, dot, dot

850
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

851
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,020
We were doodlin' in the margins of the Domestique book

852
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,400
You could draw a dick but not a crowd

853
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,260
So we turned it up loud and we sang it real rough

854
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,080
Did it make you happy, made me happy enough

855
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,280
Oh, I guess it made me happy, made me happy enough

856
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,680
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

857
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,780
I was diggin' through my bottom drawer of uncut gems

858
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,140
Lookin' for a ruby in the rough

859
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,140
Hold my beer while I wrestle with the clown and get penned

860
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,840
Ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

861
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,000
I guess, guess, guess, guess I'm happy enough

862
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,320
Hey, love is all around you if you know where to look

863
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,820
My life is overflowing with the stuff

864
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,740
You'll know it when you see it, it'll hit you like a book

865
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,540
Guess it made me happy, made me happy enough

866
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,660
Uh-uh, ask me if I'm happy, guess I'm happy enough

867
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,760
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy, happy enough

868
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm hap-hap-hap-hap-hap-hap-hap-hap-happy enough

869
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,440
Ooh-ooh-oohkoo-ka-cha, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

870
00:40:50,900 --> 00:41:03,040
Ka-cha-cha-cha, ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

871
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,120
B sesh cookie biscuits are the best

872
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,620
Thanks for the food

873
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,320
P Eagle Kitty

874
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,820
Flying même

875
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,080
groß

876
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:13,080


877
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,580
Boom!

878
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,060
Da!

879
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,240
Boom!

880
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,860
A clan way home.

881
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,580
The great Bob Walkenhorst did that with a bunch of friends,

882
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:26,240
and I got that from his new Patreon project at bobwalkenhorst.com.

883
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,200
I don't want to take any money from his project,

884
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:35,140
so I won't be playing these new songs that I'll get every month for my small contribution.

885
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:44,280
But I played that one so that my fellow Rainmakers fans will know that there's now new Bob songs every month

886
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,680
at Walkenhorst, not Dobbs, although why not both?

887
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,280
And a person can subscribe to them.

888
00:41:52,700 --> 00:42:00,360
Before that, we heard cautionary tales of the subgenius told at 21X Day Drill a couple of years ago

889
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:08,280
by Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite, with side commentary by Reverend Eggplant.

890
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,120
But now, the Crystal Methodists, all of them, disguised as Melba,

891
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,220
call into the popular Christian radio talk show of Bob Larson.

892
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,300
My son's family and I went to Disney World in Orlando two years ago.

893
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:23,780
Yeah?

894
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:32,260
And we didn't realize it, but the day that we went down there, I found out later they call it Gay Day.

895
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,900
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

896
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,320
Encouraged the homosexuals.

897
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,280
You were there, Melba?

898
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,820
I was there on that day, and it was the worst experience of my life.

899
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,980
Can you tell me what you saw?

900
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,460
I mean, some of this you probably can't describe on a family show.

901
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,940
Well, that's true.

902
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,160
We saw several things that just were shocking.

903
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:04,940
But the worst part of it was, besides just, you know, it was like these people would kiss openly, you know, and embrace.

904
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,260
But if we gave them a funny look, they would say rude things to us.

905
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,820
So when they were kissing...

906
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,100
Yeah.

907
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,080
They're the ones doing the weird things.

908
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,540
Right.

909
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,600
But if you look at them funny, then they get mad at you.

910
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,080
Oh, yes. They were very hateful.

911
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,220
And the worst part of it was, I have a nephew who is a teenager.

912
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:31,900
He went off and rode the rides and things by himself all day long.

913
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:41,900
When we met him back there at the pavilion and we all got back together, he had a little friend with him, a boy a year or two older.

914
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:42,960
Yeah.

915
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,560
And this young boy that...

916
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:52,780
He said, I met a new friend here and this boy was very, you know, effeminate.

917
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,500
And he had like a pastel colored triangle button on his...

918
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,400
Well, that's the gay rights symbol.

919
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,280
Well...

920
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,200
How old was this child?

921
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,040
18.

922
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,640
So this other boy was gay.

923
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,700
At 18, he was already homosexual and proud of it.

924
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,460
We found that out later, Bob, see.

925
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,660
And the horrible thing was that we...

926
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,780
Apparently, his daddy works for the Disney company.

927
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,100
Oh, my goodness.

928
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:30,380
We felt like Disney people were sending their kids to try to recruit.

929
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,460
And Stephan has not been the same since.

930
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,260
We think...

931
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,420
Because they were on...

932
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,140
They kept riding the same ride over and over.

933
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,640
Is that...

934
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,140
Uh-oh.

935
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,880
It's a small world ride.

936
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

937
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,660
So that kid was after your son.

938
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,280
I mean, that gay boy was after your son.

939
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,480
I think so.

940
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,900
And ever since...

941
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,800
Now, Stephan doesn't see him, but I understand that they ride back and forth.

942
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,020
Uh-oh.

943
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,980
Because this boy lives in California.

944
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,780
And...

945
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,340
Melba, you got to put a stop to that somehow.

946
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,760
Oh, Stephan uses...

947
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,400
And I won't say anything nasty, you know.

948
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,760
But he keeps saying...

949
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,180
Referring to weird expressions like bonus eggs and felching.

950
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,160
And we don't know what he means.

951
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,640
Well, you don't want to know, and I don't want to tell you.

952
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,480
But I'll tell you what...

953
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,320
And that boy that he was with, I'm telling you, his voice was higher than yours is, Bob.

954
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
He was such a sissy.

955
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,460
Oh, it was horrible.

956
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,860
Yeah, and he had the little pink triangle on.

957
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,140
Yeah.

958
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,100
Okay, I'll tell you what, Melba, I want to do right now.

959
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:33,980
All right.

960
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:42,440
Your child has come under the influence of the evil spirits of seducing you.

961
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,900
And the seducing homosexuality that were surrounding this other young lad.

962
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,420
Yeah.

963
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
And I want to pray with you right now...

964
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,700
Oh, please do, Bob.

965
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,660
In the name of Jesus to break that hold.

966
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,560
Okay, Melba?

967
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,020
In the name of Jesus.

968
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,300
All right, now, Melba...

969
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,720
I believe it.

970
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,980
I want you to say...

971
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,880
I, Melba...

972
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,380
I, Melba...

973
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,500
As the mother...

974
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,940
As the mother...

975
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,440
Of my child...

976
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,860
Of my child...

977
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,260
Child...

978
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,440
Have the authority...

979
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,920
Of my child...

980
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,080
Have the authority...

981
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,200
According to the word of God...

982
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,380
According to the word of God...

983
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,180
Over my child.

984
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,860
Over my child.

985
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,280
God gives me authority.

986
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,240
God gives me authority.

987
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,600
Over my child.

988
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,140
Over my child.

989
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,780
And I also...

990
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,280
And I also...

991
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,420
Have authority...

992
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,720
Have authority...

993
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,460
Over any demon in hell...

994
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,920
Over any demon in hell...

995
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,520
That tries to steal my child...

996
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,900
That tries to steal my child...

997
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,180
Lord!

998
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,400
Jesus. Lord Jesus. I raised my son right. I raised my son right. I raised him to be a man. I raised

999
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:56,720
him to be a man. Not a homosexual. Not a homosexual. And I'm not going to allow. I'm not going to allow.

1000
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:04,720
The devil. The devil. To steal my son. To steal my son. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus.

1001
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:12,520
Spirits of perversion. Spirits of perversion. Take your hands. Take your hands. Off my son. Off my son.

1002
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:22,820
Now. Go. You go. Go. You go. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Set my son free. Set him free.

1003
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,440
In Jesus' name. Oh, thank you, Jesus. In Jesus' name.

1004
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,800
In Jesus' name.

1005
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,440
In Jesus' name.

1006
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,420
In Jesus' name.

1007
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,660
You're getting a little blessed and happy there, Melba.

1008
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,360
Melba?

1009
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:42,740
Melba?

1010
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:42,800
Melba?

1011
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,580
Melba?

1012
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,000
Melba?

1013
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,180
Melba.

1014
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,180


1015
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,180


1016
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,180


1017
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,400
Melba.

1018
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,540
Melba.

1019
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,560
Melba.

1020
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,480
Melba.

1021
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,500
Melba.

1022
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,940
Thank you.

1023
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,540
Thank you.

1024
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,580
Thank you.

1025
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,300
Thank you.

1026
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,420
Thank you.

1027
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,300
Thank you.

1028
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,360
Thank you, Waldo, and all the rest of the gang in the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1029
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,440
And now, forward into the recent past with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1030
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,560
I thought, you know, after that argument with the policeman,

1031
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,560
there was something else she had in her hair.

1032
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,380
Hey, Dave, I've got a phone app that would make you so paranoid.

1033
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,800
It should have been in Neighbor World,

1034
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,940
your great science fiction book that's available from Subgenius Foundation

1035
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,220
or Amazon.com, but it's better if it comes from Subgenius Foundation.

1036
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,800
Yeah, there are some things that, although everything was predicted,

1037
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,120
there are some things that are way in advance right now,

1038
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,200
never mind 20, 30 years from now.

1039
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,820
Well, I have this.

1040
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:48,140
You know, I have these trails I've carved around the wilderness where I live.

1041
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,860
And I'm serious.

1042
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,320
And you have your drone.

1043
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,860
Well, I pretty much droned it out.

1044
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:02,080
But I made a map of my trails,

1045
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,180
but it was using a GPS program that I could just set points

1046
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,060
and then trace lines between the points.

1047
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,420
And so.

1048
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,300
So it wasn't really accurate map because it made it look like a series of straight lines.

1049
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,880
But I thought, I wonder if there's got to be some kind of an app

1050
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,660
that shows a satellite picture of where you are right at that moment.

1051
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,580
And as you walk, it draws a line across the map as you walk.

1052
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,420
And I was right.

1053
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,360
There were at least two of them for iPhones that were free.

1054
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,960
And I got one.

1055
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,780
I got both.

1056
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,440
I decided the colorful one was better.

1057
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,780
And I've been mapping my trails with that thing.

1058
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,980
But, of course, every time I do that,

1059
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,260
it shows the conspiracy where all my secret escape routes are.

1060
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,500
Because, you know, anytime you do anything online

1061
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,540
or with data of any kind,

1062
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,480
everybody knows about it if they want to.

1063
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,300
And nobody wants to accept those Phoenix computers.

1064
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,620
But, you know, they have the record.

1065
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,420
If they ever want to.

1066
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,400
Want to.

1067
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,940
Prove that you walked down to that murder well at the bottom of the creek

1068
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,640
to check on your stash of bodies down in there,

1069
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,060
they can find that murder well themselves.

1070
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,960
But, you know, most people nowadays, the youth of today,

1071
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,060
they go, oh, that app doesn't go far enough.

1072
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:34,600
It should be connected to your glasses so it takes a photograph every half second or so

1073
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,620
so that the conspiracy can see what you're seeing

1074
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,680
when you take your hike through the woods

1075
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,860
and go visit your murder well

1076
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:47,540
and fish out parts of waterlogged...

1077
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,820
Human bodies, yeah.

1078
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,720
Yeah, things.

1079
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:54,300
But just to make art with, you know, not for any sick sexual purposes,

1080
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,380
just to make art supplies.

1081
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,640
That's why they're in there in the first place.

1082
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,800
Yeah, to make people buggy.

1083
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah, make art.

1084
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,620
Well, you know, art...

1085
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,660
You're bugging.

1086
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,060
Bugging.

1087
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,560
Yeah.

1088
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,880
You and a bad cat, you got to bug out.

1089
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,980
Said Fritz the cat.

1090
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,680
Yep, 300 times.

1091
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,860
It was drawn by Robert Crumb, not from the unfortunate movie they'd made of it.

1092
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,020
I saw the unfortunate movie, too.

1093
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:27,820
You did?

1094
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,420
Yeah, it wasn't as sad as I thought it was going to be, but it was sad.

1095
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,500
Right.

1096
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:38,760
The saddest thing about it was Crumb didn't get paid hardly anything for that.

1097
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,080
He wasn't going to let him make the movie.

1098
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,400
He was going, no, no, you Hollywood guys will screw it up.

1099
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,460
He was right about that.

1100
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,340
But his wife at that time, it was his first wife, said,

1101
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,780
okay, Robert, we're finished with the meeting now.

1102
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,300
You can go away.

1103
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,460
Say, Mr. Bakshi, she says to the animation producer guy,

1104
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,480
my husband's an idiot.

1105
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,560
Why don't you let...

1106
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,700
I have power of attorney.

1107
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,720
Let me sign that contract and give us that $200.

1108
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,400
We need it.

1109
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,500
So...

1110
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:12,560
Yep.

1111
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,700
That's how...

1112
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,680
Famous in the underground for a while, but she done did.

1113
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,920
She was, after a while, officially confirmed that she was not a nice person at all.

1114
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,140
Oh, actually, I'm sure she was a real nice person.

1115
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:30,940
It was just, you know, she was desperate and he was, you know, an impractical art bum.

1116
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,760
I never met her.

1117
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,340
I met his current wife, Aileen Kaminsky.

1118
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,140
Their daughter, Sophie, was pestering...

1119
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,020
Crumb.

1120
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,320
She was like, come on, let's go.

1121
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,400
This is so boring.

1122
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,740
We're at a sci-fi convention.

1123
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,660
Comics con.

1124
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,580
Crumb was signing comics for a billion nerds.

1125
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,600
And then Crumb finally got finished with all his autographing.

1126
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,280
He looked up and he goes, you've got long hair.

1127
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,640
I said, yeah.

1128
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,300
I said, last time he saw me, I looked like him.

1129
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,820
Nerdy with big black glasses and short hair.

1130
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,460
Now I had long hair.

1131
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,540
I was trying to get laid.

1132
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,640
And he was like, why do you do that?

1133
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,920
And I said, well, the girls...

1134
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,000
Well, 30 years ago, you can ask Dr. Howell about this and verify my lack of intelligence.

1135
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:27,460
But about 30 years ago, there were a breed of Crumb devotees that kind of wore those weird shoes and everything

1136
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,660
and 40s looking floppy hats and lapels and stuff like that.

1137
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,640
And they were artists.

1138
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:37,560
And you can start your own little world.

1139
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,180
There were also these guys that were like...

1140
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:49,240
Argentine science fiction writers that had places, had houses that had nothing but old-fashioned ice boxes and stuff like, you know.

1141
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,480
Well, the ironic thing is it worked for them.

1142
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,440
They all got laid.

1143
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,920
Crumb got laid more than anybody.

1144
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,140
My long hair never got me laid.

1145
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,320
Well, you were warned about...

1146
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,980
I was warned.

1147
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,040
I didn't, you know, I was, I thought...

1148
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,880
That must be the explanation.

1149
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,840
It's just a haircut.

1150
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,540
That, that, I don't see what else.

1151
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,060
It could be.

1152
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,040
Princess Weasley's keeping her mouth shut.

1153
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,220
Oh, well.

1154
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,620
Each day I'll do

1155
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,180
Each day I'll do

1156
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,660
A golden deed

1157
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,040
A golden deed

1158
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,760
By helping those

1159
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,940
By helping those

1160
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,740
Who are in need

1161
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,040
Who are in need

1162
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,840
My life on earth

1163
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,220
My life on earth

1164
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,660
Is but a spade

1165
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,200
Is but a spade

1166
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,660
And so I'll do

1167
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,040
And so I'll do

1168
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,740
The best I can

1169
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,140
The best I can

1170
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,400
A life's evening sun

1171
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,960
Life's evening sun

1172
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,380
Is sinking low

1173
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,940
Is sinking low

1174
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,520
A few more days

1175
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,940
A few more days

1176
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,440
And I must go

1177
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,940
And I must go

1178
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,440
To meet the deed

1179
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,800
To meet the deed

1180
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,500
That I have done

1181
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,720
That I have done

1182
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,520
Where there will be

1183
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,500
Where there will be

1184
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,520
No setting sun

1185
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,000
No setting sun

1186
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,240
Where there will be

1187
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,240


1188
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,740
To be a child

1189
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,900
To be a child

1190
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,640
Of God each day

1191
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,040
Of God each day

1192
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,760
My light must shine

1193
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,880
My light must shine

1194
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,500
Along the way

1195
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,680
Along the way

1196
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,700
I'll sing his praise

1197
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,020
I'll sing his praise

1198
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,560
While ages roll

1199
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,800
While ages roll

1200
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,500
And strive to hear

1201
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:38,820
And strive to hear

1202
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,500
And strive to hear

1203
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,600
Some troubled soul

1204
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,560
Life's evening sun

1205
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,560
Is sinking low

1206
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,620
A few more days

1207
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,580
And I must go

1208
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,620
To meet the deed

1209
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,780
That I have done

1210
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,660
Where there will be

1211
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,940
No setting sun

The Hee Haw Band once again.

1214
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,120
Ah, yes.

1215
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,040
Want to know where all this stuff comes from?

1216
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:24,980
No?

1217
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,440
Well, it's subgenius.com

1218
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,520
And old lonesome cowboy Dave,

1219
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,380
he was in a car wreck last week.

1220
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,440
He's not injured.

1221
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,000
Badly.

1222
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,420
It turns out.

1223
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,360
But it totaled his car.

1224
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,260
And he's destitute.

1225
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,240
You know what to do.

1226
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,460
This is a church.
