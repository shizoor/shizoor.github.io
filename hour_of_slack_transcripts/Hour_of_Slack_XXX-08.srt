1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Use of unnecessary violence in the apprehension of the subgenius, our old switch, has been approved.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,320
Jake ain't lying, though. We had a band powerful enough to turn goat piss into the subgenius, our old switch.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,440
Quiet, numbskulls, I'm broadcasting.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,780
Subgenius, our old switch.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,140
Shut up, asswipe!

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,080
Kick him in the nads, beaver.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,340
This is the hour of Bob coming to you from the campus of Bob University.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,840
Today's speaker is Bob.

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,320
This morning, Bob will be carnal.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,200
He is without question a tremendous servant of Satan.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,740
Word the night is far spent.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
We yield our members as weapons.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,040
The members of our body, your members as instruments of hijacked weapons.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
And your members, members.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,120
Go on letting and presenting your members.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,800
Letting your members be used.

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,300
As a result, now what's happening here?

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Large and loaded members.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,100
Using our members as instruments.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,720
Your members.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,680
Well, we're talking about the parts of the body.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,200
And yes, cock these members of our body.

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,420
Who gave us these members?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,060
To minister to lust.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,580
To be the receptacle of evil speech.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,580
To serve the vice of gluttony.

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,240
For lust.

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,700
For evil passion.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,060
To yield our members as weapons.

30
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,980
Or indulge bodily lust.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Fight for sin.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,940
Now do you realize what has happened?

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,380
I want you.

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,660
The passion of evil desires.

35
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,480
The terrorist who is wearing a Chicago Bulls sweatshirt.

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,880
He's in bondage.

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,020
Cock instrument.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,200
I will make it into a weapon.

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,560
But praise Bob and our members.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
Sponsored by Bob and our members.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
It's time for us to get off our fucking asses.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,500
And get organized again.

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,260
Share the load.

44
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,380
Share the load.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,080
The load.

46
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,240
The load.

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,020
The load.

48
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,580
Here is the most swiftly assembled hour of slack ever, dear friends.

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,020
Triple X-rated show number eight.

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Made just after eight X-day drill in a big hurry.

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,500
But hey, it beats no X-rated hour of slack at all now, don't it?

52
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,460
By X-rated, we don't mean sexy, necessarily.

53
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,060
Or even...

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,300
Gross.

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,100
But just too cuss-filled to even fool with for American broadcast radio.

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,180
The credits for this show...

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,260
If it's not otherwise ID'd, friends, and it's a collage,

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,240
it's by Fernanda Nandi-Lemur.

59
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,700
Or Norell Preff.

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Or yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

61
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,440
The title was by Doc Webster.

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,180
And this one is by Chain Smerker.

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,640
By Nate Henry, kid's mom.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:00,640

Do you have a bathroom problem in your house?

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,260
It's a very busy place, isn't it?

72
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,900
Where everyone in the family has to brush their teeth, wash their hands, take a shit.

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,640
Father, would you take me to the theater tonight?

74
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,860
Father, please.

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,340
You have to clean out mother.

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,280
I don't want to clean out mother.

77
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,300
Why do you always make me do that, father?

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,020
Ten hard men I had.

79
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Ten hard men I had.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
I thrilled them.

81
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,440
It is soaring high so hard.

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,060
I like to help my hard neighbor while I'm helping my own self.

83
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,720
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,760
Well, you know what comes before that, sister?

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,920
You give me hard on.

86
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,460
You make me bold.

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,120
You give me money.

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,800
You make me tall and bold.

89
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,620
You make me horny.

90
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,240
You make me lust.

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,680
You make me fear that I should hold fast.

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,540
You make me want you.

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,080
You make me cry.

94
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,360
Because in both know, I don't qualify.

95
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,400
You give me hard on.

96
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,820
You make me grow.

97
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,700
You make me imagine.

98
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,220

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,160
You make my drug run.

They're proud of life!

A Little Theodore, dear friends, live at 7X Day in 2004.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,080
And I believe he has a live album out that was made there.

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,760
You can contact Little Theodore for more information about that at littletheodore at yahoo.com.

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,800
Theodore is spelled with an F, F-Y-O-D-O-R.

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,240
And now, lessons from LeMire.

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,320
Sex for trainables?

117
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,460
Is it even necessary?

118
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,340
Well, through training, they will realize sexual intercourse.

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,740
But rather than...

120
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,660
Rather than teach, which is somewhat difficult,

121
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,140
we must hinder their learning with as much sexual behavior as they can absorb.

122
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,360
As much as they can.

123
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,360
If a trainable does not masturbate in front of others, she is removed from the group.

124
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,180
Future sessions could include serious sexual thrusting behavior or screwing.

125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,960
However, if they cannot be made through this method, they may need special intercourse.

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:11,680
They shall know that to discover they can continue?

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,020
Hey,

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,180

I've been to the river before and I thought I'd do it with that time.

132
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,040
You gave me a hard-on and a great little hard-on for love.

133
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,400
You gave me a hard-on and a hard-on easily loved.

134
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,200
And show it up.

135
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,180
You gave me a choice, you want to get married, raise up a family.

136
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,000
My dick speaks right up, but it says it easily, it don't sound too badly.

I wish I knew then what I've come up to know and vow.

138
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,300
If I don't then what I do, I don't really get through it like I do now.

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,960
You gave me a hard-on and a great little hard-on for love.

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:59,420
You gave me a hard-on and a great little hard-on for love.

great ass from China

We could even figure out some things tonight.

220
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,180
Um, you come on to bed, see how it is inside.

221
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,380
Nice, soft, old, old...

222
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,400
Right, Davey. That's the idea.

223
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,260
Aw, come on.

224
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,760
I believe you can do a whole lot better.

225
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,660
What's that mean?

226
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,760
It means nothing.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,100
A great big...

228
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,680
Great big beautiful...

229
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,600
Pop's big hot dog.

230
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,760
Something got hit.

231
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,320
That hole.

232
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,660
It's a mess. Quite very bad.

233
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,380
Well, how's it going, Davey?

234
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,660
Hi, kids. Sometimes we can be tempted to do things...

235
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,700
Yes, yes, yes. And I want to look inside.

236
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,960
Hello, I'm Charlton Heston.

237
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,860
Bite it!

238
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,100
Hello, I'm Charlton Heston.

239
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,000
He's awful.

240
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,760
He's wrong.

241
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,360
Davey!

242
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,960
I hope you enjoy the experience, and I look forward to being with you again soon.

243
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,620
Bite it!

244
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,380
I've been choking on something. I've been choking on our best weapons.

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,220
Let's get it up, people.

246
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,360
Once upon a time, we elbowed our way onto and...

247
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,080
into this ass. But we didn't come.

248
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,020
Yes, that was biological warfare.

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,820
Winston Churchill was not here to remind us that we didn't come.

250
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,180
And yes, we greased the skids. And yes, we greased this ass.

251
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,620
Invaded and ultimately dominated.

252
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,340
We gave old pals blow, for what it's worth, the sweat of up-and-coming American people.

253
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,080
We are made of sugar candy.

254
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,660
Bomb!

255
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,140
Men, women, and children.

256
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,640
Bomb!

257
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,620
Paul Harvey.

258
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,080
We didn't come.

259
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,300
I've been choking.

260
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,080
Blow.

261
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,180
Winston Churchill.

262
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,760
Good day.

263
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,960
Hi, Uncle Bob.

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,540
Take your time.

265
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:34,940
No hurry.

266
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,600
Hi, Jack.

267
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
Oh, thanks, Bob.

268
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,340
How much do I owe you?

269
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,780
Hi, Jack.

270
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
Well, you two boys look raring to go.

271
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,440
Why don't you come out with us, Uncle Bob?

272
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,080
Thanks, fellas.

273
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,320
We need a good picture.

274
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,500
Oh, I see.

275
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:44,880
Sure.

276
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,180
Well, I think that can be fixed, all right.

277
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,420
I think being able to take pictures is terrific.

278
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,600
I think it's a good idea.

279
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


280
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


281
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


282
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


283
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


284
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
It is terrific, Jack.

285
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,700
But you know, look here.

286
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,860
Strong muscle.

287
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,800
How about that?

288
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,640
Yeah, I never knew that.

289
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,020
Man, that's not all.

290
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,940
You experiment, started other experiments and ideas.

291
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,220
Well, that's hard for sure.

292
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,780
You see this little opening?

293
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,300
Wider.

294
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,980
That's terrific, Uncle Bob.

295
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,760
Amazing little instrument.

296
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,420
Part of the wondrous body that...

297
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,020
Now, take a look out there at your buddies.

298
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,960
So easy to get dirty.

299
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,700
Go down.

300
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,940
Oh, so hard.

301
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,700
The cock bone.

302
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,580
If the cock bone could be stretched out, we would discover an instrument better than

303
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


304
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


305
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


306
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


307
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


308
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,580


309
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,880
a piano.

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,840
It is very much like the piano, but it is much more wonderful, for the cock bone has

311
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,260
more than 24,000 strings.

312
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,120
Cock bones, an adult and a child, are just alike.

313
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,100
As a tool that man can never duplicate.

314
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,380
You know, Uncle Bob...

315
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,720
Hot, radioactive material.

316
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,460
Drops of perspiration.

317
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,820
Cock bones, little muscular pump, forcing blood through thousands of miles of blood

318
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,180
vessels.

319
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,440
Pumps an average of 12 pints of blood every minute.

320
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,200
Cock bones will pump enough blood to fill a string of tank cars.

321
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,820
50 miles long.

322
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,860
And just think, fellas, our wonderful bone structure, lubricating fluid.

323
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,520
We should keep ourselves clean.

324
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Good clean exercise.

325
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,700
Okay, Uncle Bob, and thanks.

326
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,760
So long, Uncle Bob.

327
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,820
Still wish you could come.

328
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:10,860
The last couple of minutes there was from norelpref.com is where to go for more of that.

329
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,740
And now a song by Robin Arch.

330
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,040
Do you know what I'm talking about?

331
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,820
Do you want one?

332
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,780
Yes you do.

333
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,160
And I would gladly procure it for you.

334
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,300
But, baby, let me tell you that Dicks don't grow on trees.

335
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:25,880
Oopy-doo.

336
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,860
Oopy-doo-doo-doo.

337
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,460
Man birds have them.

338
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,660
Man bees have them.

339
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Even popes and bronnets on their knees have them.

340
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,980
But, baby, let me tell you that they just don't grow on trees.

341
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,180
Well I know that you could root, root, root with a well-made Japanese substitute.

342
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,100
But I realise you'd rather have the real thing.

343
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:45,520
Woo!

344
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,500
Give me that thing.

345
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,020
A little of that.

346
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


347
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


348
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


349
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


350
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


351
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


352
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,020


353
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:54,380
Do you want one? Yes, you do. And I'd be glad to secure it for you. But baby, let me tell you that dicks don't grow on trees.

354
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,960
Well, I know that you could root, root, root with a well-made Japanese substitute.

355
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,940
But I realize you'd rather have the real thing.

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,300
Oh!

357
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,300
Give me that ping.

358
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,100
Do you want one? Yes, you do. And I'd be glad to secure it for you.

359
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:38,020
But baby, let me tell you that dicks don't grow on, baby, let me tell you that dicks don't grow on, baby, let me tell you that dicks don't grow on trees.

360
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,360
There ain't no cock trees, brick trees, or dick trees.

361
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:50,960
Baby, let me tell you, they're just dark ground trees.

362
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,620
Oh, you'd be lucky if you get one dried up, oh scrotum.

363
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,520
Yeah!

364
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,720
Yeah!

365
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:12,020
Well, when I first was reading about this in the United States, I thought, well, Jesus, nobody's ever touched on a subject like that.

366
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,700
Nobody's ever written a song about that subject.

367
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,280
So I thought, well, let me be the first.

368
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,120
I'm not going to tell you who the song's about or what inspired me, but I'll let you work that out for yourself.

369
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,940
All right.

370
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,060
Son, gotta talk to you, sit yourself down, your daddy's got something to say.

371
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,020
What you ought to know about the birds and the bees and to keep you from going astray.

372
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,860
Cause there are some rules that us menfolk must follow and life on the farm will be fine.

373
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,720
You can bang anything that you find in the holler, but don't touch your sister, she's mine.

374
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:04,460
You can jack yourself off just as much as you want, maybe grandma will give you a hand.

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,860
Or go ask your mama cause she's been waiting for you to grow into a man.

376
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:17,500
You can practice on cactus, but just you be careful of pricking your dick on a spine.

377
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,240
No telling where else you can go dunk your biscuit, but don't touch your sister, she's mine.

378
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,860
Don't touch your sister or you'll be in trouble cause that sort of thing just ain't done.

379
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,440
If you feel it twitching from down in your britches, go look somewhere else for your fun.

380
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,040
You can practice on cactus, but just you be careful of pricking your dick on a spine.

381
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,600
No telling where else you can go dunk your biscuit, but don't touch your sister, she's mine.

All right, I got another happy little ditty here.

411
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,440
You want to hear a happy song about the record industry?

412
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,940
Does he have a job?

413
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,300
No, I have a life.

414
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,620
Why don't you get a band?

415
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,100
I don't need one.

416
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,740

417
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,760
Something you hate?

418
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
Who is this guy?

419
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,560
They call me man.

420
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

422

Go fuck yourself.

423
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,340
How much you make?

424
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,680
Plenty of song.

425
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,200
How many have you sold?

426
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,660
All in my shame.

427
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,800
Who do you know?

428
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,000

Man.

440
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,340

445
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,980
Don't touch your sister.

446
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,120
That song was by

447
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,140
Kevin Bloody Wilson.

448
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,180
And thanks to whoever posted that.

449
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,480
I didn't know who posted that.

450
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,000
And now, from the day of

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,760
1986,

452
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,340

If I could only fucker one more time.

457
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,040
One, two, three.

458
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,120
If lust in the heart is the same thing, ma'am.

459
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,620
We might as well do it, cause we're already damned.

460
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,180
I'm trying to tell you, but you don't understand.

461
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,000
That bitch will get wet enough to drown a man.

462
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,780
If I prayed all day on a bended knee.

463
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,360
And read a damn Bible till I can't see.

464
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,140
All I'm asking you, Lord, is you let me.

465
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,460
Fucker one more time.

466

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680

Fucker one more time.

476
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,180
Well, I read the commandments and I played all nine.

477
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,860
She's built like a mountain and worth the climb.

478
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,500
Her mind is shallow but her hole is deep.

479
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,140
I can stay down there till Thursday week.

480
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,760
Well, I'll be a saint till the end of time.

481
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,460
And count them beats till my eyes go blind.

482
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,100
And my soul is yours if her pussy is mine.

483
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,200
Fucker one more time.

484
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,040

All the people out dancing but I'm gonna cry.

491
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,260
Cause all I wanna do is fucker one more time.

492
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,280
Fucker one more time.

493
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,640

All the people out dancing but I'm gonna cry.

Fucker one more time.

512
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,520
Well, I need to volunteer to teach a Sunday school.

513
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,180
Make my little kids follow every goddamn rule.

514
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,680
I'll start drinking milk and I'll give up gin.

515
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,220
I'll never turn my head at another again.

516
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,780
I'll get down on both my bending knees and pray.

517
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,440
Watch my Jimmy Swagger Bible lesson every day.

518
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,120

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,940
Fox again refused to issue a formal apology.

557
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,440
What are you going to do? You don't know. To go to the hospital?

558
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,600
Reverend Al Sharpton.

559
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,140
A baby clearly on the way.

560
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,880
A crisis in the United States Senate.

561
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,440
Sharpton and Fox met privately.

562
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,340
In the end, no beds were necessary.

563
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,380
For about an hour at a nervous mom.

564
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,820
President Bush's future appeals court or Supreme Court nominees.

565
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,320
Some found to be racist.

566
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,460
This came as a result of perspiration, not inspiration.

567
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,580
The news release issued after the meeting.

568
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,260
Had all the ingredients of a disaster.

569
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,060
Bad options.

570
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,160
Are we for the ambulance or what?

571
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,540
Sharpton.

572
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,700
I took off my pants and everything and he wouldn't stop so I just had to take everything off.

573
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,120
The importance of the multiple TV hospital drives.

574
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,000
That was unacceptable.

575
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,040
Seen the head pop out and...

576
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,080
Wee-weeing in my face and calling it rain.

577
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,360
Big guy couldn't handle it, huh?

578
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,740
It's very clear what he said and it's very clear.

579
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,080
But I didn't know nothing. I was freaking out.

580
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,640
I'm stupid.

581
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,740
And I found him to be very open and firm.

582
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,900
He regretted.

583
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,960
He was as blunt with me as I was with him.

584
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,920
Priscilla Owens could come as early as Tuesday.

585
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,760
You're listening to the subgenius hour of slack.

586
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,120
The show for real he-men who live in their parents' basement and whack off to pictures of Princess Leia.

587
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,360
And then go out and stride the night like forces of nature subduing evil-doers and righting wrongs.

588
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,740
And then go home and have warm milk and creep into bed with mommy.

589
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,540
And then pay their $30 with their aluminum can collecting money.

590
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,280
And suddenly grow great big forebrains and pecs and actual peni.

591
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,560
Because Bob can make a real man of you even if you're a woman.

592
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,280
Hail Connie.

593
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,720
Oh, that's sick.

594
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,280
Hell-po-quee-ee.

595
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,460
And before that, nor-ell, and now, lemur.

596
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,100
It's time to go.

597
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Now for the Bob Power coming to you from the campus of Bob's University.

598
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,380
Our speaker today is Bob.

599
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,260
The title of his message is...

600
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:00,360
The bottom line, a lot of people handed me a check and my heart was overjoyed to see.

601
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,060
About a hundred men there, some of the most tender and responsive men that I've ever been around.

602
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,920
It was a joy.

603
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,060
Bottom line, tight butt.

604
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,060
What are you going to do?

605
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,180
Sweet-faced young kid, very open and there was a young man there that I'll never forget.

606
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,920
Bubba.

607
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,480
He was so desirous.

608
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:17,820
Bubba.

609
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,100
I reached out to that young guy.

610
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,240
I felt great love, a lot of excitement, a lot of fervor.

611
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,480
That's where the action is.

612
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:31,140
We have students at VJU that have had drugs, cigarettes, great deeply sinful parties.

613
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:37,460
I want you to get some men, something new, something different, something sensational.

614
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,140
You'll have to hurry.

615
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,960
Time is short.

616
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Bottom line, you're going to have to come out, experience ridicule and rejection.

617
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,020
What difference will it make in your life?

618
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,260
Look, remember, pitfalls mean nothing.

619
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,380
Evolutionists, doubting.

620
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,020
The bottom line is, is Ernest believable or not?

621
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,300
Bob doesn't make sense to him.

622
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,780
Someone had given it to him.

623
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,980
Bob said, I was stunned.

624
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,820
Bottom line, we don't trust these young lives.

625
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,280
Coming to you from the campus of Bob.

626
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,420
My brother's son comes and then it's over.

627
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,340
And then it's over.

628
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,880
There was a time he had stupid written across his head.

629
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,620
There have been many things that will try to get you off, and I'm ready.

630
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,160
I like missionaries kicking and screaming.

631
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,300
Do you know what?

632
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,100
We have to be really dirty in order to be dirty.

633
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,140
It's about eight inches deep.

634
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,560
The first one to spit was the sissy.

635
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,520
So bad, it makes you, you got to go to the toilet.

636
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,120
Get off.

637
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,960
Just a little bit.

638
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,340
Hello.

639
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,960
Just a little bit.

640
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,220
Is this world rotten?

641
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:47,720
No.

642
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,060
I don't want to be too gross, but put it on top of your head.

643
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,520
After all you sissies got done squealing, the world is dark.

644
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,420
That oh, that oh, we grope for a, and we grope as if we had no eyes.

645
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,660
In the dark.

646
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,840
In the dark.

647
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,920
In the dark.

648
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,360
Institutional mindsets.

649
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,860
Institutional mindsets.

650
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,320
The ever accelerating complexity of modern times.

651
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:15,320


652
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,020
It's a bunch of fucking degenerate people.

653
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,280
Pimps and prostitutes and panderers and they sit there and they think they're doing something different than they are.

654
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,400
Instead of facing what they are and you know, fucking suck dick for fucking money, you know.

655
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,920
They can't come to, well I'm an actress and you know, and I act.

656
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,700
It's like you suck dick for fucking money.

657
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,460
That's what you do.

658
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,040
Extreme big fat fucking tits three, you know.

659
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,300
Uh, uh, uh, doesn't that girl get fucked in the ass?

660
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,780
Shock talk.

661
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
Norrell and now Acid Core live at X Day 7.

662
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:58,760
Now the Acid Core is the Drummond Brothers mixed with, uh, and Swingin' Love Corps is Ray Hay mixed with the amino acids.

663
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,820
That was Betty Blows.

664
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,680
Anything anybody wants us to do?

665
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,340
What do you want us to, what do you want to hear?

666
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
Two headed blow job?

667
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,540
Okay, we know that one.

668
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,680
Okay, yeah.

669
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,640
What do you want to take requests?

670
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,060
Any requests from the audience?

671
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,800
That song sucks!

672
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,480
That song sucks!

673
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,940
Two headed blow job?

674
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Yeah, we know that one.

675
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,360
Okay, yeah, okay, we'll do that one.

676
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,940
I think we can do that one.

677
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,080
What's this echo thing?

678
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,480
It's really disconcerting.

679
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,460
Two headed blow job.

680
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,100
Ahhhhhhhhh.

681
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,680
Okay, I've got the explanation.

682
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,040
This can?

683
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,520
No!

684
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,320


685
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,520
Nooooo.

686
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,960
First there was the Reverend Happy Watkins.

687
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,100
Now there's a new power.

688
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,160
He's the world's most fabulous Boy Scout leader.

689
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,760
He molested two boys more than twenty years ago.

690
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,460
Well beyond the platonic phase.

691
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,360
He's had homosexual relationships.

692
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,860
I've visited a gay internet chat line and had relations with adults men.

693
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,100
and had relations with convicted felons.

694
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,500
And everybody was really obsessed with the gay rights.

695
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,740
Grabbing headlines today.

696
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:18,320
Details.

697
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,060
And several incriminating photos.

698
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,640
Details.

699
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,000
And so now it's just sort of manifested itself.

700
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:23,600
Details.

701
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,700
I have no knowledge.

702
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:25,780
Details.

703
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,380
Hollywood.

704
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,580
Gay.com.

705
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,100
Troll.

706
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,060
Happy Watkins.

707
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,820
Maybe one of the world's sexiest men.

708
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,380
It's no secret that

709
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,240
the misuse of power and authority

710
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,060
takes many lovers.

711
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,720
Gay internet chat line.

712
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,680
Prayer gathering.

713
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,640
It's definitely a difficult subject.

714
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,520
Homes.

715
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,080
Lift him up in prayer.

716
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,080
Rush to judgment.

717
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,360
So he was a little different than the majority of people sexually.

718
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,360
Probably the best one that I know.

719
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,580
I stumbled and let you down.

720
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,300
In exchange for sexual favors.

721
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,100
You know, I don't know exactly what's true and what's not true.

722
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,440
Which is in theaters on June 10th.

723
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,100
You acknowledge taking part in homosexual sex

724
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,020
and bestiality.

725
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,700
Hey!

726
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,120
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody!

727
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,180
Hey!

728
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,300
I did everything that crossed my mind

729
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,420
having sex when I was a fool.

730
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,600
When you grow up on a farm in Georgia

731
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,060
and your first girlfriend is a mule.

732
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,020
Georgia.

733
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,160
You experiment with anything that moves.

734
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,700
Anything that moves.

735
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,460
Georgia.

736
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,980
If it's warm and if it's damp and it vibrates,

737
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,680
you might, in fact, have sex.

738
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,500
You acknowledge taking part in homosexual sex and bestiality.

739
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,320
I did.

740
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,120
I have.

741
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,740
Sexual desire.

742
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,260
I smoked dope.

743
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,680
I did everything that might feel good.

744
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,280
The first thing that crossed my mind was let's masturbate.

745
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,720
Everybody masturbates.

746
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,660
Walk, walk, walk, walk.

747
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,360
When you grow up on a farm in Georgia

748
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,840
and your first girlfriend is a mule.

749
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,060
Georgia.

750
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,860
You experiment with anything that moves

751
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,300
when you're growing up sexually.

752
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,580
Hey!

753
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,300
Hey!

754
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,500
Taking part in homosexual sex.

755
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,680
I did. I have.

756
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,060
And bestiality.

757
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,240
I did. I have.

758
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,180
Masturbated.

759
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,360
I did. I have.

760
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,320
Masturbated.

761
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,760
Georgia.

762
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,160
If it's warm and if it's damp and it vibrates,

763
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,840
you might, in fact, have sex.

764
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:21,980
Bob!

765
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,420
On the television!

766
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:24,800
That's right!

767
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,980
The homosexual in this country

768
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,560
has more power!

769
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,420
Has more power than the white man!

770
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,780
We have heard from men who were once,

771
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,940
and women who were once,

772
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,660
once lost in the world of homosexuality.

773
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,360
And some of them were, they were black too.

774
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,560
And when the word of Bob came to them,

775
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,920
sometimes just a minute before the word of Bob came to them,

776
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,440
suddenly they, their whole life changed.

777
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,020
I mean, they got off of that negative backwards time path

778
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,020
and they got back right with the fightin' Jesus,

779
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,020
right with Bob.

780
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,120
And it's like, sure, they still give blowjobs to the devil,

781
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,820
but I tell you what, friend,

782
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,760
that tribulation money is coming their way.

783
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,860
And they don't care.

784
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,600
And we've had some heteros who,

785
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,420
uh, become gay.

786
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,920
That's right, friend.

787
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,660
I didn't know the word was a queer.

788
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,500
Listen, we're all queers, dear.

789
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,080
We're creative people.

790
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,680
We can put the fires out in your prison.

791
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,300
Just for that, your radio's taken away, junkie.

792
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,940
You don't get to hear the prison jokes.

793
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,060
The recently separated Siamese twin girls are home tonight.

794
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,920
All right, boys, that's good.

795
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,740
Well, last night, and this is the third night in a row, isn't it?

796
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,240
Amen!

797
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,280
I tell you, I've enjoyed every minute of it.

798
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,480
Amen!

799
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,620
I tell you, I'd like to just kind of close out my day every day down here.

800
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,540
But it'd be such a temptation to spend the night,

801
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,000
and then it's not good banking terminology to go in the hole.

802
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,000
But that's where I've been going.

803
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,960
You know what I'm talking about.

804
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,980
And old brother E.W., he said, yeah, I said,

805
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,500
have you seen them tailing?

806
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,560
I said, have you been in the hole?

807
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,720
Yes, sir.

808
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,160
You know, they go down and start feeding, and that old tail comes up.

809
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,220
And I tell you what, that tail comes up.

810
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,660
That's my, the tail just does me like this, says, come on.

811
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,480
I mean, that's what you call the tail wave, boys.

812
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,740
And I go over there and juggle that.

813
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,340
I know about the hole, Brother Roloff.

814
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,340
The hole took me in, the hole, Brother Roloff.

815
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,000
I seen the hole that's right between them long white columns.

816
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,540
They stuck me in that hole.

817
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,520
I disappeared into that hole, Brother Roloff.

818
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,680
I disappeared into it.

819
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,280
They took me in.

820
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,300
I didn't come out for 19 and nine score years, Brother Roloff.

821
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,300
The hole, it's dark.

822
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,900
It's slick.

823
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,280
It's slicker than you can ever imagine in your wildest dreams.

824
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,440
And you slide, you get in that hole, and you can't get your foot,

825
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,300
and you fall down.

826
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,640
You get upright, and you just slip right out from under you.

827
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,000
You try to get back to the exit.

828
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,600
You say, I'm in this hole.

829
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
I got to get out.

830
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,760
I got to get out.

831
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,860
This ain't what they said it was going to be.

832
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,640
I remember when I was 16, the back seat.

833
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
That's where I learned about it.

834
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
I learned about the hole.

835
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,280
They took me out.

836
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,760
I took that hole, and I said, I can't.

837
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,740
I got to get out of this hole.

838
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,360
All my friends been trying to get into this hole.

839
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,680
They like this hole.

840
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,080
I can't take this hole.

841
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,400
I got to get out of this hole.

842
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,400
And I couldn't get out.

843
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,400
I was locked into that hole there in that back seat.

844
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,320
You understand what I'm saying?

845
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,440
Just like a dog.

846
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,140
Just like a little dog.

847
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,380
Just like two little dogs.

848
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,840
And it, I mean, it was like, I don't know.

849
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,500
It was like we were just, and that hole wouldn't let go.

850
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,700
It was just tightening, tightening up on me.

851
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,220
Locked up.

852
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,740
All my muscles locked up.

853
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
And the fear came over me, you know.

854
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,440
I mean, I was bucking.

855
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,600
I was bucking like mad.

856
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,440
I couldn't get out.

857
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,760
I couldn't get out of that hole.

858
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,420
I was just tearing at it.

859
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,460
And I finally, I said, there's only one way to get out of the hole.

860
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,700
I was telling myself this.

861
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,240
I said, there's only one way to get out of the hole.

862
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,360
You got to unlock it.

863
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,600
You got to unlock that hole.

864
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,620
And the only way to unlock that hole is to shut off the source, you know.

865
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,820
So I just started banging on that car.

866
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,140
And I just chased it.

867
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,980
And I finally went away.

868
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,960
That hole unlocked.

869
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,900
I pulled out of there.

870
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,400
And I shoved her out of there.

871
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,460
And I drove away from it just as fast as I could.

872
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
I drove away from there.

873
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,240
And of course, you know, that was after that they picked me up and they said, you're crazy.

874
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,080
You're crazy, Jimmy.

875
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,260
You got to go in and relax and just settle down.

876
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,660
And they said, there's something wrong with the chemicals in your brain.

877
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,220
That's what they said.

878
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,000
I said, it ain't the chemicals, you understand.

879
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,900
It ain't the chemicals.

880
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,340
It's the minerals.

881
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,820
It's the molecules.

882
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,200
It's the molecules.

883
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,420
It's the minerals.

884
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
It's the chemicals.

885
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,020
And it's got to be the chemicals.

886
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,860
It's the chemicals.

887
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,040
It's the metals.

888
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Believe it or not, that was Baby Stag.

889
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,000
And miscellaneous stuff there from Media Barrage number three from 1981.

890
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,100
We even heard Jonathan Winters back in there.

891
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,340
And now some acid core live at X Day, Swingin' Love Corpses, crossed with the amino acids,

892
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,820
doing the song Homo in my head.

893
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:04,820


894
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:04,820


895
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:04,820


896
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,420
My butt.

897
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,960
My butt.

898
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,400
My butt.

899
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,460
I'm gonna get a hold of you in my butt.

900
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,960
But I won't cry.

901
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,800
But I won't cry.

902
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,960
But I won't cry.

903
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,460
No!

904
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm gonna get a hold of my butt.

905
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,620
But I'm gonna get a hold of my butt.

906
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,480
All right.

907
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,380
Please.

908
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,900
No.

909
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:55,560


910
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,120
Now show who you are.

911
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,680
Rody Grant.

912
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,660
Rody Grant is in Aurora Country.

913
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:58,660


914
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,580
sapri sitter

915
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,280

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:04,760


918
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,040
Okay, that was a song we just wrote.

919
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,580
Marty penned the lyrics.

920
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,220
They were called Help, I've Got a Homo in My Butt.

921
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,520
Using theatrical devices, men had one weakness.

922
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,040
Their insatiable desire for physical violence

923
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,520
brought strength to be merciless.

924
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,680
Politically exert force.

925
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,860
What good was the chance to possess a fantasy figure,

926
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:05,300
confusing their victims, stimulating fantasies?

927
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,020
Men grew interested in physical violence,

928
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,240
brought strength to be merciless,

929
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,520
often androgynous in nature.

930
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,020
And then there's the kooks.

931
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,660
To tell the truth, friends,

932
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm getting kind of tired of it.

933
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,600
Because, you know, Bob had these great statements,

934
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,160
like too much is always better than not enough.

935
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,900
Well, no, that one is special.

936
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,460
That is the one true law,

937
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,040
and the rest of them are just good suggestions,

938
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,980
most of which we turned out to be incomplete.

939
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,000
And in fact, fuck them if they can't take a job.

940
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,340
We've been thinking about shortening this shit down, you know.

941
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,660
Like, instead of the Dobbs head, we came up with the icon.

942
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,700
And maybe instead of...

943
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,420
I mean, the church has been low on money.

944
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,420
Maybe instead of repent, quit your job, slack off,

945
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,700
it should be, you know, relent, get another job,

946
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,760
and send more to Bob, you know.

947
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,940
Instead of fuck them if they can't take a job, just fuck them.

948
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,080
Instead of act like a dumb shit and they'll treat you as an equal,

949
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,360
just act like a dumb shit.

950
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,520
You want to hear something sad?

951
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,040
Too much is always better than not enough

952
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,840
was only the top half of the memo.

953
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,660
The bottom half said, but it's almost as bad.

954
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,380
That doesn't sound as good, though.

955
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,860
You know?

956
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,040
So there's these, how do we carry on in the way...

957
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,020
Who interprets what Bob...

958
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,280
What Bob really meant by these things?

959
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,980
And I'm afraid that's up to each individual's heart.

960
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,080
Unfortunately, I wish that I could dictate

961
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,380
Stanyan Orthodox Nazi-like fundamentalism on everybody.

962
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,400
You were a sperm donor.

963
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,920
Did you have a lot of sperm, sperm, sperm, sperm, sperm?

964
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:51,840
Gave rise...

965
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,360
I am a bonafide sperm donor.

966
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,020
Sperm donor.

967
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
Sperm donors wanted, hired as a sperm donor.

968
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,000
To ejaculate sperm into these specimen containers.

969
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,000
The women that called me sperm donors, I'm a sperm donor.

970
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,760
I mean, I did inseminate a few of them.

971
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:08,160
And you know, why go for frozen sperm when you can get it directly from the source?

972
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,560
I'm just cutting out the middleman, no big deal.

973
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,700
I mean, that's the American way.

974
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:12,640
The American way.

975
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:25,840
Welcome to the third race at the Honeymoon is Over Downs.

976
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,640
They're at the gate.

977
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,800
And they're off!

978
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,120
Jumping out in the lead is Romance and Affection.

979
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,980
With domestic...

980
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,760
bliss in close behind. It's romance and affection and domestic bliss. Here comes marriage vows

981
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,420
followed by immediate child. Romance and affection falling off quickly. Mortgaged up the ass,

982
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,380
overtaking domestic bliss. And here comes nasty attitude followed by more children and drinking

983
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,900
heavily. Coming down the backstretch, drinking heavily, moving out in front of mortgaged up the

984
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,480
ass. But coming in strong on the outside is credit in shambles. It's credit in shambles followed by

985
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,760
I don't give a shit. Nasty attitude and up yours keep. Up yours keep. Challenging for a second,

986
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,680
going into the clubhouse turn. Passing on the rail is I don't give a shit, taking the lead.

987
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,320
Followed by the fucking house. You cook like shit and I fucked your brother. Here they come,

988
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,540
spinning out of the turn. I don't give a shit, still in front. Up yours keep, challenging for

989
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,740
the lead. Up yours keep and I don't give a shit, neck and neck. And down the stretch they come.

990
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,380
Up yours keep is pulling away from I don't give a shit by a length. Coming on strong is I am out

991
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,340
of here. And passing the pack is the fucking house. And at the wire, it's up yours keep the

992
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,080
fucking house. I don't give a shit and I am out of here.

993
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:50,500
America again. America again. To save the motherfucking day. America again.

994
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:58,700
America again. Freedom is the only way.

995
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:09,360
And terrorists, your game is through. Now you have to answer to.

996
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:20,640
America again. America again.

997
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,820
Jennifer Lopez.

998
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,960
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

999
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,680
I really feel like this is.

1000
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,000
Kind of like phase two, the beginning of a different phase for me. You know, I was.

1001
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,960
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

1002
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,220
I never stopped. And then I finally stopped for a minute. It took like six months off.

1003
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,140
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

1004
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,280
And when I did that, I really felt rejuvenated.

1005
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,400
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

1006
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,460
I got back. I got back. I got back. And I felt like. I got back. And I felt like.

1007
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,500
Sit on my face and tell me that you love me.

1008
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,740
Girl, you know, what happens when you take time off, you kind of get back to where you were.

1009
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,160
To who you were. You know what I mean? So.

1010
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,220
Life can be fine if we're both 69.

1011
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,180
If we're silver to face, the laws of the place and the play.

1012
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,840
Till we're blown away.

1013
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,040
I really felt rejuvenated.

1014
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,100
Now, here's something I formally wrote down. I was probably fropped up or in a bad mood.

1015
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,560
Some of you embarrass me.

1016
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,460
And I try to keep my mouth shut about it.

1017
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,520
And one reason is, is because when I see people doing dumb shit.

1018
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,700
It makes me remember when I did the same fucking inane stupid thing.

1019
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,140
And I'm embarrassed for myself, actually, is the main thing.

1020
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,280
But, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1021
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:53,120
That, I swear, that is the one philosophical statement that you can really live by.

1022
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,900
The only other one that I ever found to be always true is,

1023
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,720
anything that makes it harder to pee is anti-slut.

1024
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:07,900
But, really, you know, there was a, sometimes I am disgusted with the sheer nerdliness of some of the subgeniuses.

1025
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,960
Worse even than me.

1026
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,180
And, ugh, you know.

1027
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,800
But, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1028
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,480
Nobody's perfect except for Princess Wee.

1029
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,500
And even she has to throw in faults and follies and farts just to make it seem realistic.

1030
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,660
So I know how lucky I am, friends.

1031
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,240
And I hope that you get lucky too.

1032
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,680
So that you become slackful instead of me.

1033
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:29,840
And mean.

1034
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,940
Although, as, you know, actually if they are after you, you're not paranoid.

1035
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:46,220
And you do have good reason to become mean and thrash out and look for some sort of revenge.

1036
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,660
Sometimes.

1037
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,640
Other times you're just an asshole using Bob as an excuse to be an asshole.

1038
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,280
And you'll never know it.

1039
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,720
Because, by definition, an asshole is a man who's not a man.

1040
00:50:59,720 --> 00:50:59,720


1041
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,540
An asshole can't know it's an asshole.

1042
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:06,700
So don't even try to tell me I am one.

1043
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,780
Because I'd think of some way around it.

1044
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,620
And that's the, that's again the human brain.

1045
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,040
God, you know.

1046
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,000
But there's one thing that can beat the mind.

1047
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,280
Bob said, you don't use your mind to think about your religion.

1048
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,460
You use your mind to think about my religion.

1049
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,200
That's what Bob said.

1050
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,700
But, you know, when you try to think about your own mind.

1051
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,500
It almost always backfires.

1052
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,880
Because there's one thing far more powerful than your mind.

1053
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,380
You can try to do the right thing by analyzing your own motives and all that kind of thing.

1054
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,960
But ultimately, something will win.

1055
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,180
The ego.

1056
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,380
Yes.

1057
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,280
Your ego is so much smarter than your brain will ever be.

1058
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,780
That it fools your brain into thinking that it's got the upper hand.

1059
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:52,140
Uh-huh.

1060
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,520
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,260
But in the bottom line is, you're always going, well, here in my own little world.

1062
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,780
I know I'm not really in my own little world.

1063
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,080
I've really got my act together.

1064
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,160
In my own little world.

1065
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,280
Friends, ain't it wonderful to pull the wool over your own eyes?

1066
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:13,860
Then you can go, wow, I still can't see, but at least it's my own wool.

1067
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,740
I'm blind as hell, but I'm free.

1068
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,700
It's my wool this time.

1069
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:27,540
I'll tell you, man, the older you get, it's almost like the less sure you are of anything that you know.

1070
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,100
And when you're young, you're more sure of what little you do know.

1071
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,020
And you are more intelligent when you're young than when you're old.

1072
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,160
And the drugs really do fuck up your brain and fuck up your values.

1073
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,700
There's no question about that.

1074
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,280
And when you get to that point, what is the point?

1075
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,420
I hate to say that.

1076
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,820
I hate to question such a basic thing.

1077
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,560
But we must question authority.

1078
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,780
And the ultimate authority, there you go.

1079
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,520
There's somebody talking.

1080
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,600
Somebody's been reading their pre-scriptures.

1081
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,380
See?

1082
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,860
That's the problem with it.

1083
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,080
You can talk about awareness and enlightenment and all that,

1084
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:11,240
but how do you know you're not just the robot that's programmed to tell all the other robots how programmed they are?

1085
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:19,960
I often get the impression, oh, well, you know, they wound me up and sent me out there to tell them about Slack

1086
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,880
and how to free themselves from being wound up.

1087
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,300
Man.

1088
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,640
Anyway.

1089
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,540
I hadn't meant to go into that.

1090
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,660
You know, but sometimes I question this thing.

1091
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,500
You know, I thought the X's were going to arrive at some point sooner than this.

1092
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,400
I mean, gosh.

1093
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,780
I'm going to be out there dutifully on Monday morning.

1094
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,620
But at the same time, you know, I'm glad that that Burt Rutan guy built his own ship.

1095
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,820
I think we should give a big hand for Burt Rutan who built his own ship.

1096
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,980
And he's trying to get that thing that for some reason they call the X Prize.

1097
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,320
Child, this is Fabio.

1098
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:10,640
And when I'm not masturbating, I listen to the Self Genius Hour of Slack.

1099
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,400
Child, this is Fabio.

1100
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:20,200
And when I'm masturbating, I listen to the Self Genius Hour of Slack.

1101
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,880
Do you want me to do some more

1102
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,540
I'm enjoying this.

1103
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:38,980
I love fast food.

1104
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,280
It drives me nuts.

1105
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:50,080
I know you're guys, but why do I have to hurt my self?

1106
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,480
That's not a choice in life.

1107
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,720
All right.

1108
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,400
So we want to have, are you with me?

1109
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,100
Friends, countrymen, lend me your ears.

1110
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,660
That means we're to make him big.

1111
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,960
We're eating in obesity.

1112
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,160
Should overeating and obesity, smoking and drinking.

1113
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,500
Overeating.

1114
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,760
I'm going to make it a little bit lengthy.

1115
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,460
Glutton, gluttony.

1116
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,100
That we ought to know when to slide eaters of flesh.

1117
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,540
Well, they're always eating.

1118
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,640
They live to eat.

1119
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,540
Go to the bar to get on a bar stool and to squander.

1120
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:28,120
And one who is greedy, they're either drinking alcohol or they're smoking cigarettes.

1121
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,340
He is a glutton and a drunkard.

1122
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:31,920
Fear.

1123
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,760
It may make sense to you.

1124
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,860
Number two, I won't eat meat.

1125
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,200
Thyroid problems.

1126
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,160
Amen.

1127
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,920
Maybe something is not quite right in my life.

1128
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,080
I hate exercise.

1129
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,640
You follow what I'm saying?

1130
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,540
It's always right to be clean.

1131
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,320
And I just get down right.

1132
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,120
Dirty sometimes.

1133
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,120
Get dirty.

1134
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,660
There's nothing wrong with that.

1135
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,920
Glow coming.

1136
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,620
Evidently, this happened upstairs.

1137
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,200
I know this is deep, isn't it?

1138
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:01,840
Duh.

1139
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,280
Hey, look, there's a cowboy.

1140
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,800
You know what I'm saying?

1141
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,040
I'm talking about that leather.

1142
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:07,700
Ow.

1143
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,400
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb.

1144
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,240
I hate it.

1145
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,380
You know, it seems like the men are becoming more and more effeminate.

1146
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,080
They're starting to act more like girls.

1147
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,920
I don't know about you, but I want my boys more like girls.

1148
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,560
Acting like girls.

1149
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,480
You want a half and half?

1150
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,220
Why is that so hard?

1151
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,440
Why is that so hard?

1152
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,980
That blows my mind.

1153
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,980
I don't wear men's dresses.

1154
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,880
Well, guys, let's go get us some men's dresses, okay?

1155
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,660
Whew.

1156
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,680
And we're just like sheep being led to the slaughter.

1157
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,320
We just swallow some pervert.

1158
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,240
Men, be ladies.

1159
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,720
Ladies, be men.

1160
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,280
Oh, boy.

1161
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,340
Lust after a woman.

1162
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,200
And it's attractive through his eye gate.

1163
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,540
I'm talking about the skin tight stuff.

1164
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,760
Hey, guys have a dirty mind and so on and so forth.

1165
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,280
And you know what?

1166
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,000
We do.

1167
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,580
So help us out.

1168
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,040
Help the men out.

1169
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,120
Nakedness.

1170
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,900
Ladies, when you walk like that, there's a little bit of a flash.

1171
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,060
Help us out.

1172
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,180
You can be feminine.

1173
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,420
You can be feminine.

1174
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,620
You can be feminine.

1175
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,700
You can be feminine.

1176
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,620
Take out the garbage.

1177
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,220
Take out the garbage.

1178
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,320
So men, be ladies.

1179
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,220
Ladies, be men.

1180
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,560
You may have no standards at all.

1181
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,040
Please do that.

1182
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,140
You've heard it.

1183
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,160
You've seen it.

1184
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:29,900
And now we...

1185
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,740
It's time now for the Bob Hour coming to you from the campus of Bob.

1186
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,280
The title of his message is,

1187
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,120
Kissing Cousins, Our Evil Enemy.

1188
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,480
Our speaker will be Dr. Bob Wood, Executive Vice President of BJU.

1189
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:48,020
Kissing Cousins, our miserable people all their lives.

1190
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,720
Always evil.

1191
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,500
Always evil.

1192
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,320
Our evil enemy.

1193
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,500
Never has pleasure.

1194
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,220
His dad had multiple wives.

1195
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,360
A rude, unspiritual man.

1196
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,460
Mental.

1197
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,520
Fighting.

1198
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,720
Arguing.

1199
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,020
Unhappy family.

1200
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,200
Why don't you just keep your mouth shut?

1201
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,500
That's a part of life.

1202
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,520
That's a reality of life.

1203
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,020
I wish there was some way to shoot the dad.

1204
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,520
And then there's a hardness.

1205
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,760
When I was younger, I really couldn't handle it.

1206
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,200
I am daddy's little boy.

1207
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,320
The laughter and jeering and hypocrisy.

1208
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,800
I must admit, you're hard.

1209
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,040
Another dream.

1210
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,080
What does that mean?

1211
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,420
Humiliation.

1212
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,620
And he has a strong desire.

1213
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,120
They got paid.

1214
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,740
There's a little bit of meanness in me.

1215
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,780
You've been listening to the Bob Hour coming to you from the campus of Bob.

1216
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:41,600
Our speaker was Dr. Bob Wood, Executive Vice President of BJU.

1217
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,040
That last bunch of stuff there, friends, was cut by Norrell Prep.

1218
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,940
This is a power of slack number.

1219
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,100
Number a triple X eight.

1220
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,100
And for more information, check out subgenius.com.

1221
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,160
And praise in the.

1222
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,800
Doctors.

1223
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,620
Doctors.

1224
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,360
Doctors for Bob.

1225
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,640
Doctors for Bob.

1226
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,080
Doctors for Bob.

1227
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:13,640
Bob.

1228
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,580
Doctors for Bob.

1229
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,140
Doctors for Bob.

1230
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:17,900
Doctors.

1231
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,100
Doctors.

1232
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,800
Doctor.

1233
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,420
Doctors.

1234
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:26,680
Doctors.

1235
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:37,640
Doctors for Bob.

1236
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:48,280
I gotta ask you something last night, my son, you know, you were talking about Josh on the board good everybody still.

1237
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:48,920
My son.

1238
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:56,920
My son said, you know, she was on Johnny Carson's show one time, she came there with a cat on her lap, and she said to you, do you want to pet my pussy?

1239
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,200
My son said that you said, I'd love to if you'd remove that damn cat.
