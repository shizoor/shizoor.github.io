1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,920
Is everything working?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Regis, can you...

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,740
Regis, is that mix working right?

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,880
Jimmy, are you set up?

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,420
Jimmy, is everything groovy over there?

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,500
He seems to have everything running fine.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,620
You don't hear no sounds as you hear the dance.

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,620
We are here.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,240
Papa Joe Mama.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,380
Papa Joe Mama is here.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,900
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is here.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,140
Sister Velveteen Sly is here.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,560
Well, I guess we're all here together.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,920
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is here.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,640
Soon the sky will break open and there will be rain pouring down on everybody.

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,380
It'll be just like Doc's time.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,520
Yeah, we can bring all the mics up.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Oh, let's get this...

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,820
And we can bring all the listeners down.

20
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,340
Drop Jimmy out.

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,200
And just to make sure...

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
Okay, here comes a tape.

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:39,040
Dear friends, we're engineering this show from live here at Starwood Festival in Lumley,

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,860
Sherwood, New York, and the Brushwood Folklore Center.

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,460
Oh, and Jesus just arrived.

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,820
Jesus just left Chicago and he's right here with the paper cups, friends.

27
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,020
We're going to start.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,260
This hour of Slack Radio Ministry with a communion.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,700
Yes, and Jesus will let you drink of his blood from this jug of boost.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,540
Naturally good boost.

31
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,720
This is what you might call syrup of jolt cola.

32
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,820
It is pure caffeine and sugar.

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:21,740
Yay, Lord.

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,600
Jesus moves among the multitude, handing out the...

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,380
You are now listening to...

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,220
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,520
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,380
Yes, dear friends.

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,440
Well, you'll have to bear with us as we slowly find our way into the proper volume levels.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,700
Twist that knob, boy.

41
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,760
But in the meantime...

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
It's only that little chromium switch.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,120
It's lactobacillus now, you same old fellow.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
It's a wet wrap seller.

45
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:17,680
It will

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,520
break your arm, you baron.

47
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,660
There you go, that sounds perfect.

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:20,660


49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:20,660


50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:20,660


51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,480
Yeah.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,300
It's hot.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:24,680


55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,720
Today is great.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,600
real, really, really groovy right now.

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,700
Well, friends, welcome.

58
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,620
I am the old Frop Keeper, boys and girls,

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,340
and getting ready to burn, baby, burn,

60
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,840
because we're going to burn on, goon in, and Frop out.

61
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,560
Yes, you Frop outs.

62
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,280
We're back from Starwood, that crazed and corny,

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,160
proud and pendulous techno-paganoid festival

64
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,920
sponsored by Cleveland's ACE.

65
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,660
That's the Association for Consciousness Exploration.

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,940
You know what I mean, get it?

67
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,020
And why Starwood was attended this year

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,880
by such subgenius de-luminaries as Papa Joe Mama,

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,900
Sister Velveteen Sly, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

70
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,860
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

71
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,700
So, Frop, whatcha...

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,660
Whatcha doing, kids?

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,700
And let's join together in hate

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,440
for this live recording of the Hour of Slack at Starwood.

75
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,100
And, hey, it's too bad you can't see the pendulosities

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,620
of the many witches and druidesses in the audience.

77
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,260
Uh, yes.

78
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,540
Hey, what's up?

79
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,640
Hey, I got some...

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,740
Hey.

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,580
Yeah, okay, then.

82
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,760
Hey.

83
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,840
Hey, man.

84
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,120
Yeah, thanks for the...

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Oh, I should...

86
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,080
Mention a couple of things here.

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,680
As I switch voices,

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,480
the CDs are finally in.

89
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,640
Yes, friends, we've talked about the CD

90
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,240
of the subgenius de-vival at Madison, Wisconsin,

91
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,460
with Dr. Legume,

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,680
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

93
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,660
and Sister Velveteen Sly.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,340
That CD is finally in.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,520
And also, we have the imported Berlin, Germany,

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,300
subgenius CDs

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,960
called Time Control

98
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,640
by that fine band,

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,140
the Klingons.

100
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,440
And we may play some Klingon later.

101
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,920
And for more information, dear friends,

102
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,780
always feel free to just frop us a line.

103
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,380
Oh, but before I go any deeper into that live de-vival,

104
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,520
I want to play this little tape

105
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,800
that I attempted to play there

106
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,740
while we were still getting set up.

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,040
A bit from this tape is sent by the good dad Townsend,

108
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,560
in New York.

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,240
This particular piece,

110
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,960
the Pledge of the Subgenius.

111
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,600
Oh, thank you.

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Oh, did I say New York?

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,280
I meant Portland, Maine, dear friends.

114
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,480
Dad Townsend from Portland, Maine,

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,140
and his friends.

116
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,440
I will promote divisions and wars

117
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,100
among non-subgenius.

118
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,580
I will work to cast out the false prophets.

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,760
I will to erase the conforming

120
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,540
instant.

121
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,680
I will work for time control in my own life.

122
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,660
To become an Oprah woman,

123
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,120
for my own sake.

124
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,380
To preserve this planet from destruction

125
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,180
except for the proper reasons.

126
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,400
To unmask the conspiracy

127
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,900
and install a strict anarchy

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,400
or a formal chaos.

129
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,880
To placate the stark fist of removal.

130
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,720
To stem subgenius endurance

131
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,040
by indulging in excesses of every kind.

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,960
To prevent human beings from being able to live.

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,540
To prevent humanity from ever acting with a common will.

134
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,180
To put the radiance of evolution.

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,700
To welcome and exploit the angelic host from friend X.

136
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,020
And to meet the needs of subgeniuses everywhere

137
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,820
whenever it profits myself.

138
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,560
I pledge that I will not actually work at any of the above.

139
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,900
I pledge moreover that I will never voluntarily

140
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,580
about any shortness of slack into my home,

141
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,480

Business of place or monastery,

mind,

164
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,400
into slack of shortness any allowed.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,360
Voluntary never to belie that one day

166
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,360


167
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,360

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,360
moreover pledge I above the of any at work actually not

172
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,720
will I that pledge I myself profited whenever every verse

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,520
The subgenius national anthem.

174
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,440
Ah yes dear friends, well welcome to church.

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,300
this lovely Saturday morning.

176
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:24,780
Oh.

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,760
Oh, what a lovely, so good to hear him praise Bob

178
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,620
at 11 o'clock in the morning out in the woods here.

179
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,020
What a friend we have in Bob

180
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,240
and in Dr. Bleakville Abernathy here,

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,060
one of the oldest,

182
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,080
one of the oldest radio doctors,

183
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,620
his is the voice that introduces the hours like every week.

184
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
And over here, Father Joe Mama,

185
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,500
the most straight-looking yet hate-filled

186
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,200
of all the subgenius creatures.

187
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,060
And then, sitting on the far end all by himself,

188
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,580
lonesome cowboy Dave.

189
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Ah.

190
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,460
Also,

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,740
did not.

192
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,440
Einstein's secret orchestra on WCSB Cleveland.

194
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,260
Ah, yes.

195
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,920
And a big one for WCSB Cleveland.

196
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,360
Yeah.

197
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,560
We have so many lovely tapes here that we could play.

198
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,240
We can't think of anything else to do.

199
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,540
But you know, with that Billy Vaughn,

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,560
Christian musical background,

201
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,800
Dave can always play along.

202
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,260
I'm good with them gospel songs, really.

203
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,800
Yeah.

204
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,280
He can finger-sync real good.

205
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,760
So, so friends,

206
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,900
we have absolutely no idea where this show is going.

207
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,460
And you know, you know,

208
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,800
that's what gives us exactly the kind of slap we were looking for.

209
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Very sweet slap.

210
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,320
Involuntary slap.

211
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,660
Oh, let's have a big hand for Jesus here.

212
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,520
He's almost, it looks like almost,

213
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,760
almost,

214
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,260
almost everyone has been sucker enough to drink of his blood.

215
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,380
His caffeinated blood.

216
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,680
This is an ancient trick of Jesus,

217
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,060
the concentrated food routine.

218
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,920
2000 years ago,

219
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,260
he did it with bread and people said,

220
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,780
how did he feed the crowds with just one loaf of bread?

221
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,780
Well, he had concentrated bread.

222
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,800
And this is concentrated boost.

223
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,540
So one bottle will entirely quench the thirst of this teaming crowd.

224
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,020
It's a miracle.

225
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,280
It's a miracle.

226
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,780
Thanks.

227
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,160
And if anybody has any frock,

228
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,900
he can do the same thing with that.

229
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,080
Praise the Lord.

230
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,160
Praise the Lord.

231
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,140
So bring us your frock after the show.

232
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,380
Please.

233
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,300
Yeah.

234
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,680
Now we're not talking about just a conspiracy street drugs.

235
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,420
That's not a code for some sort of pathetic pills or whatnot.

236
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,760
We're talking about the true dobs full.

237
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,500
Have a frock.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,160
Zip your laps.

239
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,240
Mara phase of loop,

240
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,140
play Lupina.

241
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,540
That's the scientific name of this wondrous plant that grows only in Tibet on the gray,

242
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
and droppings of dead Tibetan,

243
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,300
holy man and yetis.

244
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,340
And that's what Bob smokes in his pipe.

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
And what we all wish we could afford to smoke in our pipes.

246
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,760
99.9% of all drugs are conspiracy manufactured drugs solely for the purpose.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,260
So people don't have a chance to know the real fraud.

248
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
Well, it's simply a weight.

249
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,280
They test.

250
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,300
And I tried that.

251
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,960
It was no good.

252
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,640
I know.

253
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, it wasn't fraud,

254
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,540
but it was the same thing.

255
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,140
I, you know,

256
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,820
it turns you off and you never even have a chance to try it until you try the frock.

257
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,360
You.

258
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,260
Haven't tried drugs.

259
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:47,560


260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,380
Exactly.

261
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,080
And they're not really drugs.

262
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,720
You can't even call it drugs because it's beyond drugs.

263
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,600
And if you were to go beyond beyond with that drug,

264
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,900
you just start singing like you get political yourself,

265
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,380
like with a cheeseburger in the backseat.

266
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,420
So we're saying stop abusing that substance abuse now,

267
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,040
baby.

268
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,320
I'll say it'll stop abusing that substance abuser now,

269
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,800
baby.

270
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,940
Especially if it was habits,

271
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,460
absences,

272
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,060
haps,

273
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,420
a frock.

274
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:16,800
It's a frock.

275
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,220
It's a frock.

276
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,620
I'll take mine on the side.

277
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,040
Dave, did you take your pills this morning?

278
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,800
I took all of them.

279
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,600
I was supposed to take five per day and I thought if I take them all at one time,

280
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,680
then I wouldn't have to worry later.

281
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,200
Okay.

282
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,580
The sad,

283
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,440
the sad thing about conspiracy drugs is how well they work for the normals and how,

284
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,140
you know,

285
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,220
poorly they work for the true subgeniuses because for the normals,

286
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,540
they basically keep the normals thinking and feeling,

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,700
you know,

288
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,240
forgetting how bad it really is.

289
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,640
But like,

290
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:44,860
you know,

291
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,660
the whole idea.

292
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah.

293
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,780
Sure does a trick for me.

294
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,060
Yeah.

295
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:48,980
Forgetfulness,

296
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,440
friends.

297
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
You know,

298
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,280
we,

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
most,

300
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,340
most of us don't get to work nine to five for J.R.

301
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,520
Bob Dobbs and,

302
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:57,940
and,

303
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,660
and we didn't said we have these conspiracy street jobs,

304
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,300
which probably mess you up worse than conspiracy street drugs.

305
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,260
And,

306
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:06,800
and,

307
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,400
and,

308
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,000
and friends,

309
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,360
Bob Dobbs has come along as the antidote to that job,

310
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,520
that day job.

311
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,060
In fact,

312
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,600
every bit of money you make on that job,

313
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,060
Bob can lift that burden away from you.

314
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,060
He can free you from that,

315
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,560
which has enslaved you.

316
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
What's in your wallet.

317
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,420
That's,

318
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,600
that's handcuffs,

319
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,840
man.

320
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,260
That's,

321
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,100
that's just how they keep you tied down.

322
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,000
Bob is the key.

323
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,060
In fact,

324
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,200
how many of you people have wristwatches on?

325
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,740
How many want to smash their wristwatches right now?

326
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm not going to this one.

327
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,360
Cause.

328
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,600
That wristwatch is a dog collar for most people.

329
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,140
That's right.

330
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,420
This,

331
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,720
this,

332
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,400
this thing is a dog collar.

333
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,460
From outer space,

334
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
your mind is controlled with that dog collar,

335
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,540
just like them dogs' minds is controlled.

336
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,160
It's like invisible fences.

337
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:51,940
You know,

338
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,680
you don't see them,

339
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,200
but they're there.

340
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,220
You try to cross that barrier,

341
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
you start feeling that shock.

342
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,820
It's past nine o'clock.

343
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,520
I should be at work.

344
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,180
Dog control,

345
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,500
dog control.

346
00:13:59,500 --> 00:13:59,920
And Bob,

347
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,560
Bob is the power that enables you to hone your forgetfulness into a sharp,

348
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,740
keen edged sword to very zip that dog collar from your neck.

349
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,700
We destroy the brain cells that you use.

350
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,400
You don't need.

351
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,160
Exactly.

352
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,100
And we,

353
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,220
we store them.

354
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,620
Actually,

355
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,620
we don't destroy them.

356
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,080
We actually,

357
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,340
well,

358
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,940
what we actually take is not so much.

359
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,580
It's a cluster of brain cells that science knows as the soul.

360
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,820
And we extract this material.

361
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,380
It's,

362
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,500
it actually is this kind of,

363
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,720
it's a physical part of the body,

364
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,040
uh,

365
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,420
not located in the brain actually,

366
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,760
or even in the spinal cord,

367
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,200
but at the bottom of the foot.

368
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,920
Ironically enough,

369
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,140
it sounds like a bad pun,

370
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,340
but that is where the soul,

371
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,680
uh,

372
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


373
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


374
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


375
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


376
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


377
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


378
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680


379
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,460
the spiritual soul as well as the physical soul,

380
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,560
which are spelled differently,

381
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
both reside.

382
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,680
And the,

383
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:48,980
the,

384
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,180
uh,

385
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,340
and those are what we're collecting friends.

386
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,260
That's what we,

387
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,760
speaking of which we shouldn't be passing the hat or the plate.

388
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,640
I mean,

389
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,120
here we go.

390
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,580
We got it.

391
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,580
We got a radio station full of people.

392
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,340
We might at least do what any proper religion would be doing and suck their money up.

393
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,900
Yeah.

394
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,380
Except we,

395
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,600
we,

396
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,580
we're going to admit that we're going to use it for ourselves.

397
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,840
So where's Jesus?

398
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh,

399
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,660
Jesus.

400
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


401
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


402
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


403
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


404
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


405
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


406
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:12,660


407
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,660
Jesus is good for collecting the money and baptizing.

408
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:17,860
Oh,

409
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,500
you should have been here two weeks ago at the X day drill.

410
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Uh,

411
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,260
subgenius event.

412
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,980
We had nude baptisms in the pool up there.

413
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,960
And,

414
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,320
uh,

415
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,520
I'll break the water.

416
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,340
Most of those,

417
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,480
those subgeniuses had never been to this place.

418
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,820
Never seen anything like that.

419
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,600
They got their 25 bucks worth.

420
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:34,920
Uh,

421
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,200
and let's talk about where some of that money is going to go now.

422
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,660
I mean,

423
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


424
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


425
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


426
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


427
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


428
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


429
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


430
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


431
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


432
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


433
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


434
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


435
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


436
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,660


437
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,000
I mean,

438
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000


439
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,780
unlike most churches,

440
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,860
we don't skim that 40% off the government gives and give it back to ourselves.

441
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,400
We give that 40% to the government.

442
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,120
We are the first industrial church.

443
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,240
We pay our taxes.

444
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,540
Then of course there's the home for slackless children.

445
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,860
It's very important.

446
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,280
It's a very important word.

447
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,260
He calls us home for slack with his children.

448
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,100
All Dobbs towns is very important.

449
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,940
They need children,

450
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
our future any,

451
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,040
I mean,

452
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,600
especially when they can be worked to death.

453
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,640
Sure.

454
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,340
I mean,

455
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,560
wait.

456
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,700
Sure.

457
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,120
You could give up your money to Dobbs and,

458
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,340
and,

459
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,740
and he knows that's what means the most to you.

460
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,200
But if you also want to throw in a few extras,

461
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,540
sure.

462
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,680
We'll take your kids.

463
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,640
You know,

464
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,740
all those milk cartons and those things you get in the mail that say,

465
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,780
have you seen me and this child is missing those children.

466
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,640
Some of them are,

467
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,640
it's a tragic case.

468
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,620
Some of them are missing,

469
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,480
but most of them friends are now in near earth orbit in Dobbs town three being trained to

470
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,680
work in airports for our children.

471
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,360
And I'm sure you've heard church.

472
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Have you heard the bad news?

473
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,180
Have you heard the bad news?

474
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,400
What's the bad news?

475
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,760
Dobbs is dead again.

476
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,460
My God is dead.

477
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,000
Sorry about yours.

478
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,860
And if he comes back,

479
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,860
we'll kill him again.

480
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,180
Hey,

481
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,440
Rev,

482
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,780
you know that song about that?

483
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,500
It's,

484
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,840
I mean,

485
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,660
it's about what,

486
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


487
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


488
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


489
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


490
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


491
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


492
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


493
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


494
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


495
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


496
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


497
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


498
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


499
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:11,660


500
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,920
what religion has done to me.

501
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,320
Oh,

502
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,460
wait,

503
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:16,780


504
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,760
do a pulpit.

505
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,540
I'm praying.

506
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:18,980
Oops,

507
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,280
mate,

508
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,700
to a pulpit.

509
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,440
I'm praying for some pain.

510
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,180
I ain't got religion.

511
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,020
I got a damaged brain.

512
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,580
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took,

513
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,140
I buy the pulpit and write a dirty book.

514
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,600
Oh,

515
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm praying for some pain.

516
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,960
Baby do a pulpit.

517
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,520
I am praying for.

518
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,340
Oh,

519
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,420
my God,

520
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:41,660
you're going to die.

521
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


522
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


523
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


524
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


525
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


526
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


527
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


528
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


529
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,160
Pain!

530
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
And Dave, we can provide that pain.

531
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,280
Offer available only in limited areas.

532
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,400
For every particle of slack, Bob brings you a tiny, equal-sized particle of pain.

533
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,420
That's how you know this is a realistic religion, friends.

534
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,040
But you know, pain can be a path to slack.

535
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,120
But it's just, you get off on the endorphins, man.

536
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,560
Go ahead, chop your hand off.

537
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,120
You'll see exactly what we mean.

538
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,800
Not recommended for children.

539
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,560
The bad times put the good times in perspective.

540
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,260
This felt great when I did that!

541
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,540
Right above the knuckle, too. You saved that ring.

542
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,320
Listen to that lovely music. This sort of goes with the way we specially selected some Starwood music.

543
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,660
Now, of course, you could have cut off below that ring, but you didn't want to feel real pain.

544
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,620
Somewhere over the rainbow, friends, is that pot of gold.

545
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,980
And we're gonna smoke it!

546
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,020
One of these days, as soon as we find that damn rainbow...

547
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,980
Where'd Jesus go?

548
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Uh, yes.

549
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,700
Oh, thank you.

550
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,720
Um, now, I brought a tape here. It's real short.

551
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,540
But I thought that we might try playing it. Let's see.

552
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,620
Has anyone here ever heard L. Ron Hubbard sing?

553
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,860
Oh, I'd love to hear L. Ron Hubbard sing!

554
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,740
This is a tape of L. Ron Hubbard.

555
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,020
THE L. Ron Hubbard. Not just somebody who happens to be named L. Ron Hubbard.

556
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,280
And oddly enough, the name of the song is, uh, Thank You For Listening.

557
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,180
We may not listen to the whole thing.

558
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,260
Thank you for listening.

559
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,860
I write just for you.

560
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,080
But others hearing this may find.

561
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,520
Things they would argue.

562
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,200
I do not sing what I believe.

563
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,160
I only give them fact.

564
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,760
If they believe quite otherwise, it still will have impact.

565
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,840
Thank you for listening.

566
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:32,960
You know I don't really care what you think.

567
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,940
But if you are, then I'll defeat you.

568
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,460
Thank you enough to punish the elements that have northeast left of prison.

569
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:37,980
As much to the resentment that was Sudden Disc pew.

570
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,820
divides me and the radights入 submit the history.

571
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,740
with lies

572
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,360
that's their concern

573
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,740
not mine my friend

574
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,600
they're free to

575
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,640
fantasize

576
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,880
Elvis Ron Hubbard

577
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,020

ah yes

586
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,120

in the subgenius church

592
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,600
make sure you don't

593
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,460
sacrifice live babies

594
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,340
or anyone under 18

595
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,840

speaking of action figures

616
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,180
Jesus

617
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,880
I didn't call you up here

618
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,940
to speak to the masses

619
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
I called you up here

620
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,900
to pass the hat

621
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,460
that's what Jesus

622
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,500
is usually best for

623
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,880
is not speaking

624
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,760
to the masses

625
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,160
but

626
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,340
bringing in the cash

627
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,320
bringing in the cash

628
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
bringing in the cash

629
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,020
for the

630
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,180
bringing in the cash

631
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,200
bringing in the cash

632
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,760
bringing in the cash

633
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:07,900
bringing in the cash

634
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,780
for the

635
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,780


636
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,780


637
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,780


638
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:08,800
for the

639
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,100
Thank you, all the Jesus bringing in the cash.

640
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Thank you for listening to the subgenius.

641
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,420
The sales booth is now open.

642
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,060
The church is now accepting Visa, MasterCard, and American Express.

643
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,440
Thank you for buying from the subgenius hour of Slack,

644
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,020
a non-commercial radio show.

645
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
Starwood is an expensive concert.

646
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,900
Build up the fences.

647
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, man.

648
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, you didn't see that movie, I guess.

649
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,600
Oh, Reverend Velveteen, you're a radio professional.

650
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,180
Did you have any testimonials you wanted to make?

651
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,960
We've got subgenius radio fiends all over the place here.

652
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,480
Look at that.

653
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,680
She's wearing a lovely GWAR subgenius T-shirt.

654
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,960
Velveteen is not walking.

655
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,800
The lady's GWAR T-shirt.

656
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,180
And the excellent Connie butt.

657
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,640
Connie.

658
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,120
No, there are many excellent Connie butts here.

659
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,960
Let's hear it.

660
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,560
Can I get a hail, Connie?

661
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,900
I don't want to hear anything.

662
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,460
Hail, Connie!

663
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,120
Too much Bob and not enough Connie.

664
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,840
That's the problem with this world today.

665
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,700
It's the patriarchal emphasis on men in the church.

666
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,640
It's very disturbing.

667
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,460
I mean, this is about Connie.

668
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,680
Bob is just a shield to Connie.

669
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,640
Connie is the Hillary Clinton of the church.

670
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,120
She's running the entire church.

671
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,380
People need to give her credit.

672
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,700
He has no more than Connie's pants.

673
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,280
She's a panty shield.

674
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,560
Well, hang on.

675
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,600
Bob does wear the panties in the Dobbs family.

676
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,540
But Connie puts them on and she takes them off.

677
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,660
When she feels like it.

678
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,760
And it's her choice of which panties.

679
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,860
Yeah, but she does.

680
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,260
Red ones, purple, black waves.

681
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:03,920
Oh, but the best is when she puts on the big red straps.

682
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,600
Straps.

683
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,480
And bends Bob over and gives him a taste of his own medicine.

684
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,900
Check out the, talk about the grand opening.

685
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,400
That's when he has to break out the punishment pipe.

686
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,040
We know what he smokes in that pipe.

687
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,000
Don't remind me of the punishment pipe.

688
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Please.

689
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,900
I was bad, Father Joe.

690
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,520
Please.

691
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,060
I was weak.

692
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,020
I was weak, Sir Enius.

693
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,320
And now you're going to have to pay.

694
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,460
I've earned at least 40 demerits.

695
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,080
Do I get the punishment pipe now, please?

696
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,560
Please.

697
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,540
Sister Connie.

698
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,260
That's 40 minutes nexus, son.

699
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,000
Not until you sin some more, little boy.

700
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,860
The next bigger size of punishment pipe.

701
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,100
King size.

702
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,680
If you sin enough, friends, we will use the extra large size punishment pipe.

703
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,420
Oh, it didn't tell me about that part when I first registered.

704
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,380
But, I don't know, it's kind of mostly worth it, I guess.

705
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,920
No refunds.

706
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,360
There were a number of doctrinal points that Dobbs didn't bring up.

707
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,320
I think it's a good thing that we're not going to be talking about the original First Testament, the book of the subgenius,

708
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,000
because, well, we figured some people probably wouldn't want to send in their $30 and become ministers and join for life

709
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,560
if they knew the full repercussions of membership.

710
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,900
But once we reached a certain point, then Dobbs said to release Revelation X,

711
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,740
the third and final New Testament, or oldest New Testament, whatever, I forget what we call it.

712
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,800
The in-between Testament.

713
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,540
And that's the one where if you really...

714
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,120
If you really want to know what happens backstage at a subgenius radio show,

715
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,740
you just purchase that book at the sales table back there and read it before we're off,

716
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,040
and you'll know what to do when we get off.

717
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,060
And you will, too!

718
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,280
Get off good.

719
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,220
If you can get off your butt.

720
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,300
Some people think that Slack is sitting around watching TV and reading comic books,

721
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,960
which it may well be for many, many people.

722
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,760
However, the conspiracy would like...

723
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,220
I would like that to be Slack for everybody.

724
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,580
Miller Bear, your team just won the game.

725
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,540
Conspiracy Street Chicks, pardon the expression, but that's what they are if you see them on TV.

726
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,260
And sure, that may be Slack for some, but some of us derive our Slack from more esoteric things.

727
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,400
Like Dave here occasionally likes to not take his medication.

728
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,700
I never did not take my medication.

729
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,680
He's just built up an immunity to it, that's all.

730
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,740
Yeah, Father Joe Mama is a straight edge.

731
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:55,300
He likes to use razors on other people rather than pollute his bodily temple with foreign herbs of the field.

732
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,820
I can't wait for that bad. I need the throat cavity.

733
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,160
I just lick his pores for cheap thrill.

734
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,680
Some of us get special surgery.

735
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,460
I grew this lump on my forehead just so I could get it removed.

736
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,760
I can't wait, man. I'm going to be off in about an hour and a half.

737
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,560
And you know, when you remove a lump that size, it opens up new vistas.

738
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,460
Then you can truly see.

739
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,140
And more than that, one may truly whiff with the third nostril.

740
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,980
Oh, they laugh.

741
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,800
They laugh.

742
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,220
But trepanation was used by the ancient yetis, and we can arrange for that yet again.

743
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I think Dr. Bleepo Abernathy can apply...

744
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,780
Even if you don't want to...

745
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:38,780


746
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,840
Any cuts or anything?

747
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Dr. Bleepo has a special little ball-peen hammer, and he takes little hate crystals and puts them on your head,

748
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,960
and he hits in just the right phrenological points, acubating points on the top of your skull.

749
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,680
Archaeologists have been wondering for years what all that brain surgery of the Incas and the ancient yeti was about.

750
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,880
And if they had just come to us, we could have explained.

751
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,780
Moreover, there's been a certain amount of question about what the hate crystals are all about.

752
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,460
Is this just some sort of mythos?

753
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,820
Or is it a selling technique?

754
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,540
There is a rationale to the reason.

755
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,360
The hate crystals are, in fact, legitimate crystals that have had reverse polarity.

756
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,040
And a lot of people like the healing crystals because they heal.

757
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,020
But if you have an enemy, what are you going to give an enemy?

758
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,560
You're going to give him a hate crystal.

759
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,280
But you're going to tell him it's a healing crystal.

760
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,300
And you say, use that crystal every day.

761
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,520
Another useful thing for your enemies are the subgenius boxer shorts,

762
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,700
which we really do have lovely cotton boxer shorts in large and extra large.

763
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,660
And in the daytime, why, they look like just shorts with polka dots made of large Dobbs heads.

764
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:57,260
But at night, the radially glowing, the dark Dobbs heads, anti-Bob faces show up.

765
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,160
And those are highly radioactive.

766
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,220
Yeah, yeah.

767
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,100
And those of you who are planning to be parents someday,

768
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,500
wear those shorts.

769
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,900
And you'll never have normal children.

770
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,000
That's right.

771
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,240
I wish to God I'd have those shorts around before my kids were born.

772
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,160
Praise Jesus.

773
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,920
And if you've got an enemy, give those shorts to that enemy.

774
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,980
Let them have little subgenius.

775
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,180
You can see the evidence around here.

776
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,300
My children have been running around here, and they're definitely not normally conceived.

777
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,960
Other churches perform healings.

778
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,780
This church performs sickenings.

779
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,480
There's no amount of punishment that you can give your enemy worse than to give them subgenius.

780
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,020
Children.

781
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,980
Or give them an enema with subgenius hateful children.

782
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,260
Or hateful enema.

783
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,680
I forget.

784
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,740
That's at least an 18-year sentence.

785
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,760
Oh, the 18-year enema?

786
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,240
It was a 13-year long sentence.

787
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,800
We're not supposed to talk about that.

788
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,620
That's with the $35 subgenius membership.

789
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,060
I thought you were talking about it.

790
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,580
The 18-year enema, friends.

791
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,560
If you start it now by the year 2014, I think.

792
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,660
That's the whole body trepanation.

793
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,300
That's the full body trepanation.

794
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,480
That's the whole body trepanation.

795
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,480


796
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,480


797
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,480


798
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,480


799
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,480


800
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,760
It feels so good when they stop.

801
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,380
Exactly.

802
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,280
That's the whole point.

803
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,660
That's what's behind the whole philosophy of subgenius media.

804
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,640
It feels so good when they stop.

805
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,740
And the other whole thing behind subgenius media is that hold called the P.O. Box.

806
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:34,560
Write for free information from the at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

807
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,460
Once again, that's Bob.

808
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,460


809
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

810
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,180
Now, stay tuned for side two of show.

811
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah.

812
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,140
You think it's just a joke, don't you?

813
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,260
Oh, that funny cop guy.

814
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,400
He's kind of cute.

815
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,460
And they make fun of him.

816
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,460


817
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,460


818
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,460


819
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,380
those funny jokes about religion and so forth.

820
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,280
But we all know hell is just a joke too, isn't it?

821
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,160
Sure, there's not really a Christian hell

822
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,100
where you spend the first 18 years getting the subgenius out of a...

823
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,780
Oh, no!

824
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,160
Friends, hell is life right here on Earth

825
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,460
without J.R. Bob Dobbs in your life.

826
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,400
This is hell!

827
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,860
And when the demons try to tell you that...

828
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,100
Oh, you think you're listening to a satirical religious...

829
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,380
funny comedy show?

830
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Don't listen to the demons when they try to tell you the plain truth.

831
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,900
It's right there in front of your face.

832
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,560
The flames of those people are dancing around like tonight.

833
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,200
Might as well be the flames of Satan.

834
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Hell is down!

835
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,140
Hell is safe!

836
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,340
Praise Bob!

837
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,200
Praise Jesus!

838
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,480
You can kill us.

839
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,620
You can kill us now.

840
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,620
We wouldn't be afraid.

841
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,120
What we'd be afraid of is that man Bob.

842
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,400
Someone, maybe it's you,

843
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,360
will have to go and speak to Bob and give him those fateful words.

844
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,500
Look for the man with the pipe, the smiling man,

845
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,100
and tell him,

846
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,120
Clack-to-barata-nick-to.

847
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
Clack-to-barata-nick-to.

848
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,960
Save the world!

849
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,180
Clack-to-barata-nick-to.

850
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,640
N-n-n-n-n-n-nerny-perny.

851
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,120
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-no.

852
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm sorry.

853
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,260
Nerny-perny.

854
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:30,880
No, don't say that!

855
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,260
Not that!

856
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Whatever you do,

857
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,980
kids,

858
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,380
don't lift up...

859
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,900
Don't lift up that trap door and say,

860
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,200
Yog-sa-thoth,

861
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,240
three times.

862
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,300
Don't do it now.

863
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,580
That trap door's right over there behind the wood.

864
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,740
Don't lift it up and say,

865
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,740
Yog-sa-thoth,

866
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,740
three times.

867
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,140
Talk about old one-eye.

868
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,960
We should memorize that word,

869
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,120
just to make sure you don't say those words.

870
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah, and talk about old one-eye putting a lip tackle on you.

871
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:00,820
Jeez.

872
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,700
Ouch.

873
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,960
That's for you, Yog.

874
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,420
You Yog-ides.

875
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,100
And also don't walk out in front of moving cars

876
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,180
with poke sticks in your eye, please.

877
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,580
Thank you.

878
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,160
What are they going to say next?

879
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,600
Wouldn't you like to know?

880
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,540
Wouldn't you like to know?

881
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,440
Wouldn't I like to know?

882
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,980
But you know, what would...

883
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,020
Where would a subgenius radio show be without

884
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,820
Outer Limits background music?

885
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,740
I'm sure somebody recognizes that out there.

886
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,660
Probably having flashbacks from some horrible Outer Limits show you saw as a kid.

887
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,160
The flashbacks are extra.

888
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,180
The bummers are free.

889
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,720
Those of you with an excess of bummers may also cash those in,

890
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,460
because there'll be plenty of them later on tonight.

891
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,200
The Yog-ies.

892
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,160
Bummer flashbacks are more fun than you could possibly imagine.

893
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,800
I've been living in them for the last three and a half years.

894
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:02,800


895
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,120
I've been living in them for the last three and a half years.

896
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,120


897
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,360
Now it is time to narrate.

898
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,160
Jesus Christ is...

899
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,420
God saves, but Jesus deposits.

900
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,520
Jesus Christ is preparing to take the collection plate around through the audience.

901
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:16,980
Oh, okay.

902
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,640
Oh, let's see what's over there.

903
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,200
Reverend Stang is preparing to narrate what is on the collection plate.

904
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,540
...collecting the collection plate now in his collective hands, unconsciously collected.

905
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,000
The collective unconsciousness of Reverend Stang.

906
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,480
A subgenius collection plate has been...

907
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,340
Bleepo Abernathy is...

908
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
...has been used as a jelly container...

909
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,800
Bleepo Abernathy narrated while Stang narrated his narration.

910
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:50,560
However, what we don't see on screen one is the woman with a pie pan filled with cream stealthily approaching Reverend Stang.

911
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,940
...and a $500 bill!

912
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,740
Praise God!

913
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,340
Okay, the woman with the pie pan full of cream is creeping up on Reverend Stang...

914
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,860
...let's burn that bill.

915
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,820
...and attempts to throw it into his face.

916
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Bleepo Abernathy is...

917
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,900
However, Reverend Stang ducks the pie.

918
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,140
You can try that on some other kind of preacher, young lady.

919
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,960
Subgenius preacher, he's...

920
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,960
I've seen that pie in the face trick. I saw that free-stewed joke.

921
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,080
It's a good thing you took your pie immunity pills this morning, Reverend Stang.

922
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,800
...just shaving some shaving cream.

923
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,860
That was a close shave.

924
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,520
She's gonna be anyway, folks.

925
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,340
And please, folks, use whipped cream, not shaving cream next time.

926
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,840
Next time, use...

927
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,180
...the cream.

928
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,100
Don't use whipped cream.

929
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,620
I have come again.

930
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,940
...and finds that it is very...

931
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,880
...it really doesn't taste very good.

932
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,940
...very foul tasting.

933
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,380
Although...

934
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,240
...I really hoped that it was lemon cream and I was gonna get a free treat, but instead I pulled...

935
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,920
Now the Reverend is really, truly ripped up to my slider. Ladies and gentlemen, give him a big hand.

936
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,180
...he's really been preaching today.

937
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,260
...I reached into my briefcase and pulled out a razor blade and started shaving.

938
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
...with a conspiracy. Here's your lemonade. Make lemons.

939
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,400
Let's all shave for Bob. I don't want to be the only one over here without that white stuff on my face.

940
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,760
Everybody's a shaver.

941
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,080
I'm not shaving for Bob.

942
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,700
Me next.

943
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,100
Oh, just find Bob and bend over.

944
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,360
I sat there at the stage for a while, thinking as I had many times before.

945
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:15,200
This cult wasn't just operating in South America or Europe. It was right here in the good old USA, in my country.

946
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,700
I had grown up here and never heard of the Church of the Subgenius until I worked for the ATF.

947
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,940
Does anybody have any...

948
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:28,040
Now it was all I heard about. Child abductions, mind control, drugs, armed shipments, revolutionary plots, the whole rotten mess.

949
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,920
It was all right here in my own backyard.

950
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,460
Most the world knows nothing about the Subgenius Church.

951
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Sacrify the Prince Porter.

952
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,160
Those who think they do think it's some kind of joke or religious satire. Well, the only ones laughing is the subgeniuses themselves.

953
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:51,180
While the rest of society sleeps, the Church busily goes about laying the groundwork for their bloody takeover, the so-called X-Day, where every non-cult member is eliminated in a general massacre.

954
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:57,640
The only thing between me and the Subgenius and their sick goal was me and the ATF.

955
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,680
We'll return to I was a subgenius for the ATF after this brief message from Bleep.

956
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,740
Oh.

957
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,660
And we'll be all available after the ceremony for private subgenius shavings. Thank you.

958
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,260
Thank you very much.

959
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,560
You'll have to supply your own curtain.

960
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,000
By the way, you're all married now.

961
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,340
Some of you wish you were more married than some of you others. Some of you have already been so married that you're ensconced into one body.

962
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,620
I would like those of you who have, who are experiencing that right now, who are too old to be married, to be excommunicated.

963
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,660
Two separate parts have been married into one person. Please separate yourselves immediately because I have double vision and I can't draw.

964
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,260
It hurts.

965
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,880
We'll be forming the subgenius divorces at a later time.

966
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,660
Yeah, the marriages are free. The divorces do have a small surcharge.

967
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,620
Just like in real life.

968
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,600
Right on, brother.

969
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:57,420
Extremely overweight naked men will have to marry themselves also on one separate part of Sherman, New York, I think.

970
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,620
That's what the church of the subgenius is here for. Those lonely, overweight naked men.

971
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,120
I'm gonna be one real soon.

972
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,320
But you know what I love about this church? The way the members act as a shaving mirror for us.

973
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,360
The hierarchy.

974
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,500
Thank you. I do appreciate that.

975
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,000
Could you move just a little bit? Thank you.

976
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,420
Just look into their eyes.

977
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,940
Thank you.

978
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,860
Nothing there.

979
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,320
It's time to pass out.

980
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,260
That was your nose you just took off.

981
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,020
I wish I could have been there.

982
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,420
It's time to pass out.

983
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:28,600
Hello, hello.

984
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,300
Anybody else for shaving?

985
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,240
Shaving, anyone?

986
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,580
Hello. Is this on? Can you hear me?

987
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm used to speaking to multitudes. This is a small crowd for me, actually.

988
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,260
I'm now going to pass out the free pamphlet, which is yours for a one dollar donation.

989
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
Which tells you all about the church.

990
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,340
So, just raise your hand.

991
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,900
You know what? I have to say this.

992
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,300
Frankly, I'm pissed.

993
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,340
When I came back, a lot of people are cashing in on my name.

994
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,600
There's usually bumper stickers, t-shirts, and I'm not seeing a penny of it.

995
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
Well, that's one of the many reasons I'm now with the church.

996
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,280
Because some of it can actually come back to me now.

997
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,080
Even the money itself says, in God we trust. And you don't get any of that.

998
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,020
That's sick. That's really wrong.

999
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,120
It is wrong. It's wrong.

1000
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,620
Didn't you sign a contract for a percentage of that at the beginning?

1001
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,100
Back with the annuit septus and the eye on the pyramid and everything?

1002
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,580
No.

1003
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,380
Because it said that in the contract, the secret contract.

1004
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,300
They can never pay you enough. You know, Jesus.

1005
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,840
I mean, even if they did pay you enough, then what they would pay you, they'd owe you royalties on what they paid you.

1006
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,740
Exactly. So you got royalties going back like 200 years now.

1007
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,200
Shit, man. You're sued.

1008
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,200
What I need is a good lawyer.

1009
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,740
Does anyone know a good lawyer for Jesus Christ, the Son of God?

1010
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,960
Come again, return here.

1011
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,660
So I will now pass out.

1012
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,040
J.R. Bob Dole.

1013
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,480
J.R. Bob Dole.

1014
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:55,860
J.R. Bob Dole.

1015
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,860
God, you're right.

1016
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:05,280
You know, I want, Reverend Stang, I'd like you to address the whole thing about Independence Day and how they just totally stole that from the Church of the Subgenius.

1017
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,780
Well, actually, it's true. Now, some subgeniuses went to see that movie Independence Day and thought,

1018
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,700
Oh, they ripped off the thing about the exes coming in 1998.

1019
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,060
Actually, they ripped off another, more obscure part of subgenius doctrine.

1020
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:25,920
As you know, as everyone knows, on July 5th, 1998, the world as we know it ends totally.

1021
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,260
For those who deserve it.

1022
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:40,500
For those of us with the $30 membership card in our pocket, we're ruptured up to the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X to live forever in power and glory and Paradise One and Paradise Two and so forth after that.

1023
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,900
Sexual perpetuity.

1024
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,780
Offer available in limited areas.

1025
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,040
$2 million credit limit, friends.

1026
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,440
But you have to have that $2 million on deposit in the subgenius bank before you get it, just so you know.

1027
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,720
Everything must go by 1998.

1028
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:08,640
And that movie Independence Day, as Father Joe Mama pointed out, that's a great, they did us a great service because now when the exes really do show up, the pinks are going to think they can win.

1029
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,840
And if we don't allow them some hope, what else is there for us to crush?

1030
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,780
So, you know, let them think.

1031
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:42,080
If Bill Clinton can jump in his jet airplane and find a dumb, drunk, poe-bucker abductee and Bill Clinton can go beat the aliens and, you know, the nice, multi-ethnic, diverse group of people can go up there with their Macintosh and dial in easier than you can get through to America online, upload a virus.

1032
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,760
Oh, yeah, it's going to be real easy.

1033
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,460
Actually, it is real easy.

1034
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,960
All those idiots needed to have done was spend that $30 on the Church of the Subgenius.

1035
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,500
And they'd be up inside that mothership watching better special effects.

1036
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,680
It wouldn't even be special effects.

1037
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,740
It would be the real thing.

1038
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,580
I thought the pornography scenes in Independence Day were pretty good but not quite explicit enough.

1039
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,560
Too many cars and not enough human bodies.

1040
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,760
Well, they did a nice rendition of the actual aliens.

1041
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,140
They took some of the greys and they took a little bit of the overmen.

1042
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,400
A little bit of Yaka T's.

1043
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,960
And then a big prairie squid on his back.

1044
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,360
They had prairie squids on their backs?

1045
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,820
Oh, yeah.

1046
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,340
Oh, my God.

1047
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,100
Right.

1048
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,080
All those little squiggly tentacles were looking awfully ornery.

1049
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:30,260
Well, Dave, before the conspiracy came along, we all had prairie squids on our backs.

1050
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,120
People were born with original prairie squid.

1051
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,580
And then the conspiracy came and castrated them away.

1052
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,040
They chopped that prairie squid off your back the minute you were born.

1053
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,520
You know, as a dedicated science fiction fan, I have to point out, Reverend Stang, that they didn't shave those squids on that show.

1054
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,740
And that's why I didn't like it.

1055
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,660
The rest of it was good but I thought, you know, since they didn't shave the squids, I didn't like that part.

1056
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,400
It was a black comedy.

1057
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,120
They weren't supposed to shave them because we know what happens when you don't shave that prairie squid.

1058
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,360
And plus, squid brishing is forbidden by the third convent of states and nation.

1059
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,180
I'm sorry, national.

1060
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,140
Never mind.

1061
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,560
It was like that episode of Star Trek.

1062
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,940
They didn't de-peak them prairie squids either.

1063
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,120
Now that was painful.

1064
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,780
Did they practice safe squid?

1065
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,340
It bummed me out.

1066
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,520
Sort of like that episode of Star Trek where like Spock's ears were just a little bit too large.

1067
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,120
You know, I don't like that.

1068
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,700
That's wrong.

1069
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,500
Yeah.

1070
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,420
And one time I was reading a subgenius book and I read a contradiction in it.

1071
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,180
Yeah, I noticed that.

1072
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,340
I noticed it was in one sentence that it contradicted itself.

1073
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,140
And then the next sentence I read contradicted itself.

1074
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,660
I know.

1075
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,700
That annoys me.

1076
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:25,820
I don't like that.

1077
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,740
That's why I don't like those contradictions.

1078
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,280
And they're too ambiguous in that subgenius stuff.

1079
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,940
You can't tell if they're good or evil.

1080
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,140
But they're all true.

1081
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,960
You can't tell if Bob is your friend or if he's like trying to rip you off or what.

1082
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,520
Yeah.

1083
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,940
Some of the stuff he says is smart but then other stuff he says, you know what I mean, it's like dumb.

1084
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,460
It's like first they tell you what's wrong with religion and then they turn around and do it themselves.

1085
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,180
Yeah.

1086
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,580
Why don't they have any answers?

1087
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,860
I want an answer.

1088
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,500
Yeah.

1089
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,020
I mean, they don't just tell you what to do.

1090
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,480
Yeah.

1091
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,380
I want, you know, better instructions.

1092
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,120
They tell you to get slack and then they don't tell you what it is.

1093
00:43:59,260 --> 00:43:59,400
Yeah.

1094
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,140
And when I sent away for that kit, you know, the whole squid shaving kit that I sent for,

1095
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,380
the instructions were, they're all in Japanese and then they had all the wrong pictures.

1096
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,320
But the razor looked right and everything.

1097
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:11,860
I don't know.

1098
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,460
I don't get that.

1099
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,260
Why do they do that anyway?

1100
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,920
It had a little picture of Bob on it.

1101
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,160
I'll spend any amount of money for a razor.

1102
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1103
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1104
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1105
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1106
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1107
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,160


1108
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,480
Yeah.

1109
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:17,940
But there was no picture of Bob.

1110
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,740
Yeah, that's true.

1111
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,880
I would too because, you know.

1112
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,980
At the sacred sales table.

1113
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm...

1114
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,940
I can type, so I'm going to do a Bob zine.

1115
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,660
That's it.

1116
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:26,860
Yeah.

1117
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,480
Do a fanzine.

1118
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,680
Yeah.

1119
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,960
It'll make some money.

1120
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:29,580
Yeah.

1121
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,340
You could start the Star Trek.

1122
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,940
Because I know that Church of the Subgenius makes a lot of money.

1123
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,680
Those guys are all rich.

1124
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,520
No, a friend of mine is a Star Trek fan.

1125
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,240
He also likes that Subgenius stuff too, you know.

1126
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,780
I can rent them off for free while I work at Kinko's.

1127
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,260
Yeah.

1128
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:39,940
Sure.

1129
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,340
Why not?

1130
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:40,560
Yeah.

1131
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:40,840
Okay.

1132
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,220
I'll give them to you.

1133
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
That's how all religions begin, friends.

1134
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:46,460
.

1135
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,620
Scientology got so big.

1136
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,640
4 a.m. and a deserted Kinko's.

1137
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,520
Hell, Christianity, they didn't even have Kinko's back then.

1138
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,860
Yeah, they did.

1139
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,240
Plenty of Kinko's around.

1140
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,480
He actually had a Xerox machine, which wasn't admitted.

1141
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,900
The original Kinko the Clown was back then.

1142
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,520
How do you think those loaves and fishes were done?

1143
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,800
The world's first Xerox machine.

1144
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,620
Oh, hell, when the X's come, friends, after 1998,

1145
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:17,840
we'll be emailing shopping malls to each other.

1146
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,760
Damn tootin'.

1147
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,920
Money will be a thing of the past.

1148
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:21,780
Can I just say something?

1149
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,320
Not darn tootin', pal, but damn tootin'.

1150
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,100
May I have a damn tootin'?

1151
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,640
Damn tootin'!

1152
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,020
Thank you.

1153
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,380
Money will be a thing of the past.

1154
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,920
You might as well give all of it to us now.

1155
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,280
Membership rates will be going up.

1156
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,960
Start next year, we're going to add a zero every month.

1157
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,800
Then in 1998, we'll start adding a zero every week.

1158
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,400
We figure the very last subgenius

1159
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:43,600
will be the Xerox machine.

1160
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,640
It'll probably be the Sultan of Brunei,

1161
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,740
the richest man in the world,

1162
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,040
whose phone number we have now, by the way.

1163
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,600
Wow.

1164
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,420
The very last page of Revelation X

1165
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,740
has a picture of the Sultan of Brunei and says,

1166
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,480
does anybody have this guy's phone number?

1167
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,660
And we have it.

1168
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,940
And actually, it's his son.

1169
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,640
We're going to try very hard to recruit his son.

1170
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,280
So hopefully by next year,

1171
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,920
all this you see will be owned by the church of the subgenius.

1172
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,600
We just need to get rid of the Xerox machine.

1173
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,680
We need to learn the language before we call that number.

1174
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,520
That's the only little hitch.

1175
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,560
And we're going to come out with the first subgenius movie

1176
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,260
will be Day Day and then Night Night, I think.

1177
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,680
Was that the point?

1178
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,820
Night Day and then Day Night

1179
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,240
and then Afternoon Afternoon.

1180
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,400
That was a scary one.

1181
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,600
Interdependence Day.

1182
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,440
Oh, send your mind to Bob.

1183
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,540
Send your mind to Bob.

1184
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,560
He needs a lot more than you do.

1185
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,000
Because he ain't got a job, job, job.

1186
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,500
Hey, do that song, I Love Bob or Bob Loves Me.

1187
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,140
Yeah.

1188
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,840
This is such a lovely gospel tune.

1189
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,160
I'm sorry.

1190
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,540
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1191
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,700
No, he doesn't, Dave.

1192
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,500
He hates you.

1193
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,040
He thinks you're stupid.

1194
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,440
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1195
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,800
Don't kid yourself, dumbass.

1196
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,940
He sends me stuff on the internet.

1197
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,980
And he sends me cards and sends me lots of beer.

1198
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,860
And he talks to me at two in the morning

1199
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,820
when he ain't got nothing to do.

1200
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,380
That wasn't Bob that called you, Dave.

1201
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,440
That was Jayner.

1202
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:30,600
Oh, my.

1203
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,480
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1204
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,140
Uh, yeah.

1205
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,020
I can smell this microphone.

1206
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,160
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1207
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,940
Sure.

1208
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:43,920
Right.

1209
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,480
Deeply.

1210
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,920
Keep telling yourself that, man.

1211
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,620
We're happy all the time.

1212
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,400
We're lovey-dovey guys.

1213
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,200
He knows all my secrets and he never tells a lie.

1214
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,220
He sold your secrets to the Weekly World Newsday.

1215
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,980
Oh, I don't want to say no more, man.

1216
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,000
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1217
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,040
We're happy, man.

1218
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,520
I love Bob and Bob loves me.

1219
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,900
More of them kind pills, Bob.

1220
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,020
But sometimes he don't want to hear a thing from me.

1221
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,380
And other times he doesn't even want to...

1222
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,120
He never calls or writes.

1223
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,600
He never says a word to me.

1224
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,300
I've never seen the man of my life.

1225
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,780
I don't even know if he exists.

1226
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,680
Oh, he exists all right, Dave.

1227
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,380
The question is, is he just a head?

1228
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,920
Or is there a body?

1229
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,400
Is there even a penis?

1230
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,040
Is there a Dobbs penis?

1231
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,680
Or is he just a collection of dots?

1232
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,040
This is the question that so many faithless individuals ask themselves.

1233
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,480
But no, Bob is a man, yes.

1234
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,240
A mortal man.

1235
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,460
He bleeds, he sweats, he stinks like everyone here.

1236
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,140
Stinks like any head can stink.

1237
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,700
Well, not quite as bad as everyone here.

1238
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:10,120
But Bob has a power, a superpower that would make Superman,

1239
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,800
that would make the Pope jealous.

1240
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,580
Bob has the power.

1241
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,420
He has the power to fail.

1242
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,720
To fail and to fail big time, man.

1243
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,200
He literally makes a million dollars every time he screws up,

1244
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,220
and he screws up all the time.

1245
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,280
Tell me about it.

1246
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,700
Bob is a head, but he's also behind.

1247
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,580
Except what I can't figure out is I went for the power of Bob,

1248
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,040
and he gave me that power, but all I'm doing is screwing up.

1249
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,100
Well, now you see, Bleepo, Bob, he knows more than you.

1250
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,400
And all of these things, these sad things,

1251
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,360
these things that have happened to you were preordained.

1252
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,460
It's just part of your karma, and you're working it off.

1253
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,780
And any minute now, all the things that Bob promised will come through.

1254
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,060
You mean the cash and everything?

1255
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,200
Yeah, all the money, finally the friends.

1256
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,420
And the slaves and the friends and the slaves.

1257
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,320
Yeah, slaves and armies and so forth.

1258
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,980
All the nerdy little subgeniuses and clueless losers.

1259
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,920
Do I get to control all the nuclear weapons like you said?

1260
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,780
We'll all lead armies against the normal people.

1261
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,580
Okay.

1262
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,380
Okay, because you've been promising me this for like 15 years, you know.

1263
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,760
And when you lose your job, when you lose your job,

1264
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,720
you'll get the income tax rebate.

1265
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,320
Oh, thank you.

1266
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,000
Jesus gives me a dollar.

1267
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,720
Then when you run out of unemployment, you'll get the welfare benefits.

1268
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,300
Then when you run out of welfare and go into crime,

1269
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,440
then we'll put you in jail and you'll make $35,000 a year.

1270
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,840
You'll still make money even behind bars.

1271
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,960
Yes, friends, it's completely true.

1272
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:36,800
Praise Bob.

1273
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,420
Praise Bob.

1274
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,260
And that's the American plan.

1275
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,580
He's putting everybody in prison and paying them $30,000.

1276
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,500
$35 an hour.

1277
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,140
I mean, I think so.

1278
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,840
I mean, it seems to me from what I'm waxing too political here.

1279
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,040
I'll shut up for a minute.

1280
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,680
But it seems we're all in some kind of prison right now without Bob.

1281
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,540
I'm looking out there with one air and I looking this way.

1282
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,940
In the church of the sub, them bars do not a prison make.

1283
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,580
Why, that prison can be your altar.

1284
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,700
That prison can be where you receive Bob's divine inspiration,

1285
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,300
if not perspiration, if not sexual satisfaction.

1286
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,200
Anything can be a throne.

1287
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,020
And in the church of subgenius, I heard extra meditation,

1288
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,380
and that must include some other kind of thing.

1289
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,260
It takes place on the porcelain altar, my friend.

1290
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:20,580
Yep.

1291
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,040
As Dr. Legume said a couple of weeks ago,

1292
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,900
Bob is a horny cellmate waiting for you to fall asleep.

1293
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,820
Oh, no.

1294
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,660
That is a terrible, terrible, terrible prescription indeed.

1295
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,240
Actually, I think he said time is a horny cellmate.

1296
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,240
Look, Jesus took up that collection,

1297
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,560
and we did make it look like about $25 or $30 plus this one.

1298
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,240
A little note here.

1299
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,420
I just didn't understand the significance of this one.

1300
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,940
It's just a piece of paper with the word $1 written on it,

1301
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,280
signed E. Norton.

1302
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,300
An Emperor Norton dollar, friends.

1303
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,760
Oh, it's a dollar.

1304
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:55,960
Yes, an Emperor Norton dollar.

1305
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,460
So any Discordians here would like to bring me,

1306
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,420
I'll give you this, and you can bring me a hamburger.

1307
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,620
I really love that sort of rainbow concept of money.

1308
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,040
Oh, all right.

1309
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,200
The golden apple, here it is.

1310
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,700
Oh, here's your money.

1311
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:12,540
Thanks.

1312
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:12,720
Thanks.

1313
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:12,720


1314
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:12,880
Thanks.

1315
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,580
Thanks.

1316
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1317
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1318
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1319
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1320
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1321
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1322
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1323
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1324
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1325
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1326
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1327
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1328
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1329
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1330
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1331
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:13,580


1332
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,500
Thanks.

1333
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,660
Thanks.

1334
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:16,820
Thanks.

1335
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1336
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1337
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1338
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1339
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1340
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1341
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1342
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1343
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1344
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1345
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1346
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1347
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1348
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1349
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:16,840


1350
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,800
Well, I've learned from that pie earlier not to bite into this thing.

1351
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,620
That's just what they want you to do.

1352
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,320
To err is subgenius.

1353
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,920
We're trying to avoid, see, this is the apple of knowledge.

1354
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:32,540
And that's, frankly, that's what we're trying to get away from, you know.

1355
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,660
We like the computers and the electric guitars, but we don't need the knowledge.

1356
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,960
We'll just steal the equipment.

1357
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,240
Let somebody else figure it out.

1358
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,420
We know too much.

1359
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,580
We know too much.

1360
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:43,580


1361
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,540
already, damn it!

1362
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,120
Is there anyone out there

1363
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,260
driven to testify, make a short

1364
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,240
testimonial for subgenius,

1365
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,120
preferably an attractive, topless

1366
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,660
young lady?

1367
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,280
It's not a

1368
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,200
chauvinistic thing, but frankly, we need

1369
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,880
the videotapes, that sort of thing.

1370
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,820
Propaganda, you know.

1371
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,060
But I'll tell you, people do not

1372
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,200
purchase the word Bob because they want to

1373
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,060
hear what he says. They buy

1374
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,200
t-shirts. They want people to know

1375
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,020
that they love Bob, but

1376
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,100
they don't want to listen to his message.

1377
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,200
It might go down a little bit

1378
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,980
rough on the polished

1379
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,080
ears of the modernists

1380
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,960
and the liberals these days. They don't

1381
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,200
happen to like some of the

1382
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,980
tough love that Bob's got

1383
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,520
for him.

1384
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,900
You know, Reverend Stein, someone pointed out to me the other day

1385
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,820
that these subgenius shirts are some of the

1386
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,000
most unusual t-shirts. They're actually tighter

1387
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,160
in the chest area. Yes, we do have

1388
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
a new baby doll brand,

1389
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,080
rave type. This is

1390
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,500
to cash in on the youth market.

1391
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,500
Very, very tight.

1392
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,200
They're great for little children

1393
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,420
and even better for

1394
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,460
great big

1395
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,900
women. Yeah, see if

1396
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,500
you're tough enough for a Bob shirt.

1397
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,840
I thought that was for the throbbing

1398
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,800
thoracic implant. The crumb

1399
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,080
t-shirt. Test your limits.

1400
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,840
How about some

1401
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,980
questions for Bob? Yeah, questions.

1402
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,880
We can be the conduit to which

1403
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,220
he answers. And the conduit

1404
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,880
to your question. See, they don't even question.

1405
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,440
Bob can do it.

1406
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,340
Butt magic.

1407
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,200
That kind of, well,

1408
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,620
I'll tell you, buddy.

1409
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,380
Are you

1410
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,820
seeing me sit down

1411
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,900
for the first time in about

1412
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,880
five years?

1413
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,840
I hope that answers your question what it's like

1414
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,800
working for that son of a bitch. You got Bob

1415
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,700
walking behind you is a very dangerous

1416
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,960
proposition. There's your butt magic

1417
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,000
right there, pal. Jesus is new.

1418
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:42,940
He's still standing.

1419
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,560
Up. Notice kind of

1420
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,720
purr. He is walking a little.

1421
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,800
That's good. Bob saving the best

1422
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,100
for last and butts.

1423
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,880
Yes.

1424
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,280
He's

1425
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,180
on his

1426
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,960
birth certificate. It simply says

1427
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,560
J period R period.

1428
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,900
Many people think it must have the

1429
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,780
J R and J R Bob Gobsman stands

1430
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,460
for Jesus Robert

1431
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,840
or something like that, but no such

1432
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,800
luck. It's just

1433
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,740
and the Bob in quotes

1434
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,320
is on his birth certificate.

1435
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:12,920
He's going to.

1436
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,400
Some changes are all dot J dot

1437
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,360
R dot.

1438
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:16,860
Yeah.

1439
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,640
All dot Bob dot.

1440
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,720
And some people think it's unusual.

1441
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,180
You know that he has what?

1442
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,460
Uh, two first names and one middle name.

1443
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,000
What they don't realize he's got four

1444
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,460
first names in three middle names.

1445
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,940
It's J period R period.

1446
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,000
Quote Bob unquote dubs and friends

1447
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,840
that as we all know, Bob frontwards

1448
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,940
and backwards is still Bob.

1449
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,640
And it's like that's part of the message.

1450
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,680
You see, you got the B on one end of another

1451
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,600
B balancing it on the other.

1452
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,660
But in the center there's that whole that great

1453
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,060
big hole that you could just you can go into that

1454
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,940
hole and through that hole I can see future

1455
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,660
landscapes of acres of skeletons of dead normals.

1456
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,600
Praise Bob.

1457
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,180
And for you can kind of whip it through the hole

1458
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,220
every now and then too.

1459
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,200
That's why our pamphlets smell funny.

1460
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,160
Deep slack.

1461
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,600
Black nine.

1462
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,260
Slip through a crack.

1463
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,260
Get the wormhole.

1464
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,780
Slip through a crack.

1465
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,520
Another question for Bob.

1466
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,500
Holy Bob.

1467
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,980
You, the man with no shoes.

1468
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,040
How dead is Bob?

1469
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,140
Bob is as dead as the mountains and as alive

1470
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,180
as the streams.

1471
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,200
We have, you know, well, you know, we have, we make it a policy, as Bob himself said,

1472
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,780
if you meet me on the highway, kill me.

1473
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,320
And the reason for that is there are a lot of Bob wannabes.

1474
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,140
One of them is a black nine.

1475
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,220
There's a lot of pseudo Dobbs and false prophets out there.

1476
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:53,300
And if you, if you see Bob kill him brutally, unmercifully torture him first, if he comes

1477
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,000
back to life, it was the real Bob and you got no problem.

1478
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,020
You know, it was within his slack or it wouldn't happen to him.

1479
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,240
If it was a false prophet, then good riddance.

1480
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,480
And, and he is the only copy written savior that invites you to hate him.

1481
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,320
That's right.

1482
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,520
The only one.

1483
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,100
This is the world's first industrial church friends.

1484
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,480
Dobbs face is a trademark.

1485
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,920
And those of you with tattoos of that thing on your legs are going to make some real pretty

1486
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,560
lampshades in a couple of years.

1487
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,620
Anybody here have any subgenius art tattoos?

1488
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,740
I wish Dr. Leguien was here.

1489
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,680
He's covered with them.

1490
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,900
Well, he's covered with something.

1491
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,300
He likes, I think that he may have been abducted.

1492
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,020
Um, um, or done some abducting, you know, he, we abducted rays.

1493
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,880
We abduct UFO inhabitants.

1494
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,100
This guy came up to me last night, one reference day.

1495
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,700
You gotta give me some advice.

1496
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,620
My, my girlfriend's been troubled by the graves.

1497
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,120
They, I think she's been abducted and stuff.

1498
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,800
Man, the answer is back.

1499
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,940
Don't let them push you around.

1500
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,040
They build the kind of spaceships that crash in New Mexico.

1501
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,200
You know, don't.

1502
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,280


1503
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,820
Don't be afraid of them.

1504
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,460
They're just messing with you.

1505
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,640
They're doing the same thing as us.

1506
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,160
It's just like L. Ron Hubbard.

1507
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,120
They don't, they keep a straight face while they're doing it.

1508
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,140
The only species we fear is the subgenius species.

1509
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,460
Please do not harm us.

1510
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,880
Men of Earth, men of Earth, seize all atomic testing.

1511
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,220
Alien bees.

1512
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,800
Send one dollar to P.O. Box 1403-06.

1513
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,280
Texas 7.

1514
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:38,280


1515
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,240
Five, two, one, four.

1516
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,020
Praise Bob.

1517
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,960
Phew, praise Bob.

1518
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,360
Now, but they won't do it, will they?

1519
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:51,860
Oh, they love, they like to applaud to the concept of sending a dollar to Dallas.

1520
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,820
Friends, you don't even have to remember the post office box.

1521
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,380
Just hold that, that dollar bill up against the bump on your forehead.

1522
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,640
Then sit on it for a while.

1523
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,260
Then rub it up against your groin and just think Dallas.

1524
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,560
And it'll make it.

1525
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,960
It'll make it to our P.O. Box.

1526
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,020
We are more flexible than you may believe.

1527
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
No, the, no, the, the anti...

1528
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,220
No, wait a minute, Reverend Stang.

1529
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,840
Bob Dole's never been the anti-Bob.

1530
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,640
And I just want to say Bob Dole has never been the anti-Bob.

1531
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:32,580
The, uh, oboe, the anti-Bob would be, the way you would recognize the anti-Bob, who will be coming within the next two years, uh...

1532
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,380
The anti-Bob.

1533
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,800
You know, Bob can, Bob can sell you anything.

1534
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,380
Right?

1535
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,480
The anti-Bob will buy anything from you.

1536
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,880
The scary thing is he looks, there's no way to tell him from the real Bob.

1537
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,100
Well, except that if it's, if the real Bob...

1538
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,500
That's what's...

1539
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,120
You end up...

1540
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,300
The hole in the pipe's on the other side.

1541
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,320
Buying something.

1542
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,780
You have less money after you meet Bob.

1543
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,120
But you have slack.

1544
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,000
After you meet the anti-Bob, you have more money but less slack.

1545
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:03,440
He, he bought something from you, but it's something that you'll later find out you really did need.

1546
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,880
Like your self-respect.

1547
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,600
I knew this.

1548
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,620
That's often the case.

1549
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,840
And remember, the, the anti-Bob doesn't lead the conspiracy.

1550
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,200
The conspiracy leads the anti-Bob.

1551
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,980
So, whoever is elected in the next election is the anti-Bob.

1552
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,240
Society will create him for us.

1553
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:25,040
Rest assured, you will see the answer.

1554
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:34,420
That he who has wisdom know it is the ears of a man, and the ears are gigantic, and he speaks with a Texas accent.

1555
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,200
Beware ye the...

1556
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,720
He who places his finger on the button on July 4th, 1998, will be the anti-Bob.

1557
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,700
Now, I didn't put my finger on the button.

1558
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,160
I've never put a finger on anything.

1559
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,900
I just, I can't put my finger on a problem, let alone put my finger on a button.

1560
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,260
Now, how do you expect me to...

1561
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,500
Now, the anti-Bob is good looking, I'll grant you that.

1562
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,860
But so is the whore of Babylon.

1563
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:01,060
You know, they don't, they didn't tell you, oh yeah, they tell you all about how bad the whore of Babylon is in the Bible.

1564
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,280
But they didn't tell you how good looking she was now, did they?

1565
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,520
They always leave that part out.

1566
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,640
Have you noticed that?

1567
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,260
They leave a lot out.

1568
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,460
Talk about...

1569
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,620
The chances are the anti-Bob will be someone that you love, that you think is a great person.

1570
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,500
And you will be the anti-Bob.

1571
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:24,060
He will look nice, he will talk nice, he will act nice, but he will be the anti-Bob, and you will feel it, because you love him, don't you, don't you?

1572
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,700
Give him to somebody!

1573
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:25,140
Bob.

1574
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,660
Anti-Bob.

1575
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:26,560
Bob.

1576
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:26,960
Anti-Bob.

1577
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:28,820
Bob.

1578
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,460
Anti-Bob.

1579
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,280
Bob.

1580
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:30,860
Anti-Bob.

1581
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:31,560
Bob.

1582
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:31,800
Bob.

1583
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,020
Bob.

1584
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,020


1585
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,020


1586
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,160
Anti-Bob.

1587
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,320
That's what happens.

1588
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,800
You find the balance that way.

1589
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,540
If anybody ever is worried about finding the balance between Bob and the anti-Bob, just do the chant.
