1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,740
...match your face into the snow like that one aerial skier did, you know what I mean?

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,720
And off we go into the song of Hiawatha, and I'll be back.

3
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,220
Hey, my name is Chaz, and this is...

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,220
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,020
Oh, smokes!

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,800
I mean, is there anything in this office which doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

7
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,280
And...

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,340
And silver!

9
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:08,560
The old Union Hall ballroom is packed with suffocating, sweating bodies.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:20,500
Grungeoids, hippies, nouveau punks, even suits from age 15 to 50 mingle together, linked only by non-conformism.

11
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,180
Some young ladies aren't wearing much at all.

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,760
On stage, prancing and waving his arms frantically,

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,980
a bespecified...

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,360
A tactical, wild-haired man in a white disco prom tux extols the crowd to quit their jobs.

15
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,480
Armageddon, or X-Day, is at hand.

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:55,120
To show that we're all just killing time till X-Day, he raises a hammer and begins smashing watches, clocks, sundials.

17
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,520
In approval, the crowd roars back.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,160
And...

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,820
Praise Bob!

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,240
Praise Bob.

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,020
Yes, dear friends, X-Day.

22
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:15,780
July 5th, 1998, when alien spacecraft will destroy the Earth and kill or enslave its inhabitants.

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,100
Except Church of the Subgenius followers.

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,580
They will be found safely aboard the space vessels of the sex goddesses.

25
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,580
Protected and in a constant state of...

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,680
Orgasmonicism.

27
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,500
The Church of the Subgenius has been grabbing media attention for over a decade.

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,700
Confusion about what it stands for keeps the myth of the bizarre cult alive.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,820
Refusing to discredit cult watch reports, the Church adds to the confusion,

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,080
offering a conversion pitch instead of explanations.

31
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,820
The Church's

32
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:09,820


33
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,480
The Church's own

34
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,580
Slack, likened to a retarded form of grace or Zen Satori,

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,980
is granted by the Church's martyred, traveling saint.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
Salesman messiah, Bob Adabs.

37
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,780
Subgeniuses with slack enjoy a life of condoned hedonism.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Encouraged to explore aliosexuality, xenophilia, and alter consciousness.

39
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,240
Or not.

40
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,420
They challenge the normal conspiracy of mundane existence.

41
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,680
In short, quit your day gig, cut the soles off your shoes,

42
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
and learn to play the FLUTE!

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,560
Take me with an enchanted advertisingゲーム

44
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Interact,

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,660
原唱

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,820
Oh, great cartoon music of the past.

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,720
As brought to you now for a limited time only by Frogstick Enterprises.

48
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,340
Only $9.95 for these nine CDs.

49
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,160
Great cartoon music of the past.

50
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,940
Oh, boys and girls, it's my special honor.

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,940
It's my special honor tonight to introduce to you

52
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,040
Brain Rock Radio Theater with special guests,

53
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,260
Reverend Ivan Stang and...

54
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,800
Princess We Are Dole.

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Princess We Are Dole.

56
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Queen of all the UFOs.

57
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,500
Including the hoaxes,

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
hallucinated UFOs,

59
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,580
and the authentic silvery disks,

60
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,380
the huge clouds, the ones that look like clouds,

61
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,920
the ones that look...

62
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
look like World War I biplanes,

63
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,300
the Foo Fighters,

64
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,900
and those things you see when you look at the sun too long.

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,640
Can I start?

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,300
You know them things that you see out of the corner of your eye?

67
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,600
Out in the woods?

68
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,860
Sparkling lights.

69
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,400
Them things under your bed?

70
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
They're really there, floating.

71
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,640
The lights dripping down.

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,020
They're eating into your auditory canal right now.

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,620
Drip by drip by drop.

74
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,640
Chewing away at your eardrum tympanic membrane.

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Like tiny little frap weasels with sharp muscular fangs.

76
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,340
Scratching and scratching.

77
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,520
Right on the surface of your eardrum.

78
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,000
And those tiny bones inside your ear.

79
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,640
So tiny that it requires a magnifying glass to see them.

80
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,180
Those things are getting onto those bones and gnawing them with their tiny jaws.

81
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,480
Like the contents of a little gree-gree bag filled with cat bones.

82
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
So are the bones of our ears.

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,320
Look.

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,400
Feels kinda good, don't it?

85
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,740
I can't do anything anymore.

86
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,500
I can't do it.

87
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,900
Well, for only $20 more, you can hear the alternate version of this broadcast.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,560
The one with all the cuss words and Howard Stern and all that bad stuff.

89
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,840
You can see the beauty pageant and everything.

90
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,320
Only $20.

91
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,380
Pay-per-view.

92
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,960
And if you didn't send that $20 in, you've got no business listening.

93
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,000
At all.

94
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,960
So we assume that everyone listening has indeed sent in their $20 to the radio station.

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,840
And therefore they know what sort of content is going to be in this programming.

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,300
And it's understood it's after 9 o'clock at night, isn't it?

97
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes.

98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,600
It's after 8 o'clock in the morning, too.

99
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,340
And...

100
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,940
Look at that.

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,040
And...

102
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,460
So?

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,500
Tonight's show was brought to you by the disease leprosy.

104
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,240
And I think that's it.

105
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,840
Can we go now?

106
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,140
No.

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,620
No.

108
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,240
No.

109
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,800
No.

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,120
No.

111
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,320
No.

112
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,340
No.

113
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,600
No.

114
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:08,680


115
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,560
No.

116
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


118
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


119
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


120
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


121
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


122
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


126
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


127
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:09,560


128
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:12,660
No.

129
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,300
No.

130
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,040
No.

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,680
No.

132
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:32,760
No.

133
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,240
No.

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,920
the comfort of our society only to spew hostility at the very bosom that they have relinquished.

135
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,120
There was a time when we used to look upon these scraps as rather pathetic and relatively

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,600
harmless.

137
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,520
Now they have a leader.

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,800
Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition to infect our harmony with his venom.

139
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,980
That's great.

140
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,100
You, give me a more, bro.

141
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes, of course, right away.

142
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,240


143
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
What's a mob room?

144
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,220
Just cigarette, any cigarettes.

145
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,180
Uh, smoking is not good for you, and it's been deemed that anything not good for you

146
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,880
is bad, hence illegal.

147
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,760
Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat.

148
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,760
Are you shit?

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,820
John Spartan, you are fined one credit for a violation of the verbal morality statute.

150
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:45,100
Oh yes, dear friends, and uh, oh yes, it's so, so, uh, well familiar to be back to the

151
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,300
land of the living dead again.

152
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,860
Been on the road for a couple of weeks preaching, just doing the usual preaching, just trying

153
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,340
to save a few souls and turn them over to Bob.

154
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,700
Hell, as far as I'm concerned, you can let Bob keep them.

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,160
Bye.

156
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,020
I sure don't want them.

157
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,120
Well, maybe some of them.

158
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,140
Maybe a few off the top.

159
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,140
Some of the ones we want are you, friends.

160
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,280
You, the listeners.

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,940
Because you're not ditto heads.

162
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,240
You're the exact opposite of ditto heads.

163
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,940
No matter what your politics are,

164
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,180
the last thing you're going to do is ditto somebody else.

165
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,100
Even if they're right.

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,480
You're just not going to go along with it.

167
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,700
So, because you're that kind of person,

168
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,160
I want you to do what I tell you to and go out and vote.

169
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,540
Here in Dallas, Texas, anyway,

170
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,560
we've got a little election coming up.

171
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,160
And, you know, Bob Dobbs always runs for world overlord

172
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,060
or county clerk.

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,160
So, if you see Bob there under county clerk,

174
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,900
you know what to do.

175
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,500
Actually, in the statewide final election in November,

176
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,340
there will be a subgenius running

177
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,680
for county clerk on the libertarian ticket,

178
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,660
which is the closest thing to patriopsychotic

179
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,260
and narco-materialism,

180
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,200
as preached by that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

181
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
So, that's Reverend Jeff Neely.

182
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,060
And we'll probably be bringing...

183
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,800
Reverend Neely's been dreaming up some...

184
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,220
a form of slacktivism that I think

185
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,340
many of you may be interested in.

186
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,720
Hopefully, we can share that with you next week.

187
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,040
But we're just still...

188
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,920
cooperating.

189
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,280
I had a real good time up in Ohio,

190
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,800
especially when I got to the brain rot part.

191
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,320
And, in fact, most of this show tonight

192
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,080
will be a replay of a delightful evening

193
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,740
spent at WCSB in Cleveland

194
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,600
with Brain Rot Radio Theater,

195
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,960
sponsored by ESO Radio

196
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,360
and featuring that anything-for-a-laugh duo...

197
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

198
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,320
and Psycho...

199
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,320
Psychopath Finder

200
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
and Scabby Days.

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,740
And this time,

202
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
another radio play,

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,920
but this time featuring

204
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,220
as played by Dave DeLuca,

206
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
and Connie Dobbs,

207
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,300
as played by Princess We Are Dull.

208
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,520
But first,

209
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,280
I have to...

210
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,420
I must share something with you.

211
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,200
We'll put on some more appropriate...

212
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,640
Ah, yes.

213
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
It's so lovely.

214
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,260
I saw the most wonderful sight today.

215
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,040
And, uh...

216
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,220
I'm hurting.

217
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,620
I'm hurting all over.

218
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,120
And I really more...

219
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,220
I don't want to be doing this show.

220
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,740
I want to go to sleep.

221
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,040
But it was a marvelous sight indeed.

222
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,520
My doctor and I were biking out by White Rock Lake,

223
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,620
and it was such a beautiful day.

224
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,860
And we were tooling along the spillway.

225
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,080
Well, struggling along...

226
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,760
totally exhausted, really.

227
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,600
But reading all the graffiti.

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,320
This concrete spillway is just smathered with paint.

229
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,740
And I gotta admit,

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,120
I was hoping to see some.

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,700
And sure enough,

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,340
there was the Bob graffiti.

233
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,700
And I hope whatever kids did that graffiti

234
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,800
are listening tonight.

235
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,020
They should be proud.

236
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,160
Bless their hearts.

237
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,460
And what they spray painted on the wall

238
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,680
reveals a lot about what kind of subgeniuses these are, too.

239
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,200
It read,

240
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,320
in the...

241
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,240
in Dazzling Day Glow Red,

242
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,100
it read,

243
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,620
Bob saves,

244
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,600
and praise Bob,

245
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,180
and had a little smiley face with a backward pipe,

246
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,900
and hieroglyphs and things.

247
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,560
And then it said,

248
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,440
Hemp 100%

249
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,680
and Bob normal.

250
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,940
Normoo, without the A.

251
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,260
And then the final thing sprayed in that handwriting was,

252
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,320
Jeff plus me.

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,520
Mindy equals dope.

254
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,040
And we thought that was so romantic.

255
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,620
So sweet.

256
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,140
And also along that spillway,

257
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,540
there's a long stretch of footprints

258
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,300
that Bob himself left up on the precarious railing,

259
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,080
where he walked barefoot through some green paint,

260
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,120
and then up a wall,

261
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,520
along the top of this wall,

262
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,480
death-defying wall,

263
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
and then straight down the wall,

264
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,340
like an M.C. Escher painting,

265
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,880
and then off into the...

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,240
dirt where he left his...

267
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,540
uh...

268
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,380
spore.

269
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,400
And, uh, friends,

270
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,260
that made me feel so good to be alive,

271
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,060
since I'd heard I was dead.

272
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,180
Uh, in fact,

273
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,260
most of the guests at this year's Winter Star up in Ohio

274
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,060
were dead,

275
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,940
dead people.

276
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,380
The, uh, Association for, uh,

277
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,980
Consciousness Exploration,

278
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,900
or Explanation, I'm sorry,

279
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,440
group there in Cleveland holds these events,

280
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,860
and this year they were gonna have, uh,

281
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,340
Timothy Leary,

282
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,400
and Robert Anton Wilson,

283
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,780
and me,

284
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,360
or your, your dear host and prayer partner,

285
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,280
Reverend Ivan Stang,

286
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,800
and Mourning Glory Zell

287
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,160
of the Church of All Worlds,

288
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,560
that's a, that's a sexy church, friend,

289
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,060
and, um, Isaac Bonowitz, the Druid King,

290
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,100
and a bunch of other guests,

291
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,800
and we all knew, we all knew that Timothy Leary was dead,

292
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,700
cause the Moody Blues said so,

293
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,640
but on top of that, he got pneumonia,

294
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,140
and canceled,

295
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,400
and,

296
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,560
what?

297
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,220
They're trying to get through again.

298
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,980
It's, they're,

299
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,080
they always, they always do this,

300
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,220
right in the middle of the shows.

301
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,040
I never should have had that dream

302
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,060
about being abducted by aliens.

303
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,100
That's how they do it.

304
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,700
They make you think it was a dream.

305
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,100
Well, I'm gonna ignore it.

306
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,540
Um, anyway, later on, uh, last week,

307
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
people, just about the time I was leaving town,

308
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,720
people started calling the Subgenius Foundation

309
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,060
from all over the country,

310
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,740
bemoaning how Robert Anton Wilson,

311
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,320
the author of Illuminatus,

312
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,020
one of our Bibles,

313
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,100
and, and our Pope Bob,

314
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,120
had died too.

315
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,660
Uh, and I got to Ohio,

316
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,720
and found Pope Bob Wilson

317
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,660
basking in all the attention that he'd gotten as a dead man.

318
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,400
Uh, hundreds of people had sent flowers and condolences to his wife,

319
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,300
and he swears he didn't start the rumor himself,

320
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,360
but then, wouldn't he?

321
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,840
And then there was a rumor that Sister Tonya Squared

322
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,280
had lost her mind and stabbed me dead, dead,

323
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,800
and tried to eat my brains.

324
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,340
That was all part of an actual rumor,

325
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,840
and that she was now in the rubber room.

326
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
And all of that one is true, except that I didn't die.

327
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,160
And I was one of the lucky ones, friends.

328
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,800
Many have.

329
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,280
Uh, this last month has, uh,

330
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:57,980
been a few years or so.

331
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,840
I don't know, I think the conspiracy virus implant

332
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,100
was probably most obvious with Zappa.

333
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,700
But then you had Jack Kirby.

334
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,000
Jack Kirby, man!

335
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,100
Like, the greatest of great comic book artists.

336
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,860
Uh, he died.

337
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
And Bill Hicks!

338
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,740
Bill Hicks died!

339
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,500
Finally, a comedian comes along that I can mighty like,

340
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,880
and he up and dies.

341
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,220
And, man, it just ain't fair.

342
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,540
It's like somebody killing John Lennon

343
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,560
and leaving Paul McCartney there to pimp and twitter.

344
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,500
And, uh, who else?

345
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,540
That mighty, weird filmmaker, Derek Jarman.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,360
He snuffed it.

347
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,520
And Papa John Creech at some point in there.

348
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,600
And Dinah Shore!

349
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,540
I mean, my God, we used to launch her wrists back in 76!

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,620
And Bob. Bob died.

351
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,100
And Red. Red. Red's dead.

352
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,660
And Benny. Benny died.

353
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
And they caught Lucius, man!

354
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,620
What's this world coming to?

355
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,680
Well, actually, it is coming to Portland, dear friends.

356
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,580
The universal subgenius...

357
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,380
Oh, this should be... I'll turn up the Christian music.

358
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:13,380
The universal subgenius pilgrimage to Portland, Oregon, USA.

359
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,400
July 5th, 1994 is coming up.

360
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Uh, it'll be beyond Doc Stock.

361
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,940
Now, you won't be ruptured by the aliens on that day, probably.

362
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,440
Um, but, uh, but, but you should to find out how and where and...

363
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,400
Well, you know when. It's July 5th.

364
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,740
And you know where. Portland, Oregon.

365
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:42,260
But to know anything else, you have to send one dollar to, uh, for information.

366
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
And you got that pencil ready, friends?

367
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,540
This ain't my address.

368
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,900
This is the secret address to get to the secret subgenius pilgrimage site.

369
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,700
July 5th, this year.

370
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,920
Right to Nen's Low.

371
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,560
Nen's Low.

372
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:01,480
Box 86582.

373
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,920
That's 86582.

374
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,640
Box 86582.

375
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,560
Portland, Oregon.

376
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,860
97286.

377
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,020
That zip code, once again, 97286.

378
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,280
For... and make sure, you know, not to leave out the important part of that.

379
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,680
Uh...

380
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,400
The Missile.

381
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,420
July 7th, this year, uh, Nen's Low will be having an amazing...

382
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,520
Would you please get out of here?

383
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,320
Situation in Portland, Oregon.

384
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,880
That's right. It's the subgenius event of the century.

385
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,980
We're having a sort of pre-preparatory version of X-Day.

386
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,640
The Conestoga wagons are gonna be a-rumblin' toward Portland.

387
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,160
And a million little monsters.

388
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,620
Little monsters.

389
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,240
Nemecode leading the parade of little monsters.

390
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,000
And the creatures that walk like men.

391
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
Creatures of the twilight.

392
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,100
Between Earth and the upper levels of hell.

393
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,520
It was...

394
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,260
Huge.

395
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,580
And when there was no more room in hell...

396
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,600
It was like a monster.

397
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
The subgenius of the...

398
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,380
A monster man!

399
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm having this argument. A monster. And I want you to settle it once and for all, sir.

400
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm sure you thought you saw, uh...

401
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,860
Yeah, you know...

402
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,600
What it is that you just said that you thought you saw.

403
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,260
But, you know, the human mind's a funny thing.

404
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,840
It plays strange tricks.

405
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,160
Um, what about these nightmares?

406
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,520
You were just having a nightmare.

407
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,840
Remember, little imaginations wander too far.

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Upstairs there was a dental office and you...

409
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,660
But I saw Martian down in the old station!

410
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,520
Billy was the dentist and Billy was the nurse and...

411
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,280
Try to sedate him, nurse.

412
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,500
He always slips back to remembering these events of sixty years ago.

413
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,000
If we could just bring his mind forward into the present,

414
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,520
we have some chance of reaching through that strange barrier,

415
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,860
which is keeping one of the most brilliant minds of the century

416
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,080
locked up in that wasted body.

417
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,500
Okay.

418
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,520
Okay, all right, you got that? Test Monday.

419
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh, okay, results of nightmares.

420
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,380
You got a hint here on the results of nightmares.

421
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,980
I kinda like my nightmares because I wake up from those.

422
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,060
Okay, tell us your nightmares.

423
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,080
And then it's all right. Oh, no, I'd never do that.

424
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,640
You hear her!

425
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,400
Yeah, are we having bad dreams?

426
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,820
May I ask you a question?

427
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,980
Yes, ask a question about your bad dreams.

428
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,900
Can you tell me what I was in your previous life?

429
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,680
Oh, Dr. Howell, that's for you.

430
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,860
Oh, but the equipment isn't set up.

431
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,820
Well, I could, I suppose, just throw pins into a map or something.

432
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
What you were in what previous life?

433
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:35,820
God, do you know?

434
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,580
Which life was it?

435
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,820
I mean, what are you talking about?

436
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,980
In the human era?

437
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,120
Yeah.

438
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,340
Keep having bad dreams.

439
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,440
The human era.

440
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,120
Oh, boy, even so, it's awfully hard to pin down.

441
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,360
Okay, how's it gonna be?

442
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm just reading, then we'll get the money and get out of here.

443
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,320
Yeah, right.

444
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,780
Hold on, just let me have the...

445
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,560
Oh, okay.

446
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, that thing's broken.

447
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,260
Don't worry about the sound effects.

448
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,900
That wouldn't fool anybody.

449
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,160
Okay, just a moment.

450
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,500
Here, let me get into my costume.

451
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,360
You dally it.

452
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,540
Well, I'm sorry.

453
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:13,140
I'm sorry to keep you waiting like this, but, you know, I need certain equipment that I just can't get hooked up and working in a fragment of a second.

454
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,300
Well, here you are.

455
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
All right, there you are.

456
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:16,720
Okay.

457
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,760
All right.

458
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,640
That's easy.

459
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,360
Where am I?

460
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,960
Well, you are on the South Sea Island.

461
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,340
Oh, this is the South Sea Island.

462
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,020
It has to be...

463
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,820
A teenager.

464
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,200
Then you get eaten by a shark.

465
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,900
My address is right on the...

466
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,080
But you had a good life.

467
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,960
That's okay.

468
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,360
So, what can I say?

469
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,400
This was in 1848.

470
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,240
What did you say?

471
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,720
What food is there?

472
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,880
I don't know who that might be.

473
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,240
I do.

474
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,400
Well, then, you are...

475
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,880
You know more than I about that mysterious earlier existence.

476
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,680
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

477
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:00,340
And I suppose you saw that they discovered the missing link between whales and land apples.

478
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:00,980
Yeah.

479
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:08,680
Here come the land apples now, rolling toward the whales at incredible speed, the stems whipping along, taking out whole forests.

480
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,120
Holy cow.

481
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,560
And the whales snap them up because all modern whales are...

482
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,460
Cracks, boom, and...

483
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,400
Evolved from carnivorous...

484
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,320
The apples disappear into the waves.

485
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,140
They're like little kids, but they're not as peaceful as we've all been led to believe.

486
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,580
Fifteen million years ago, a strange proto-whale splashed in the ocean.

487
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,740
And what we didn't know fifteen million years ago was the whales were making wheels for land to carry their mass across the land.

488
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:39,280
And they'd flap their little flippers like wings and they could whip down the interstate highways and start eating all the orchards and starve land out.

489
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:46,300
One interesting prehistoric whale, which may actually even exist in the present day, is the Bessarabian.

490
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:53,920
This whale was found with a headset, indicating there must have been another headset communicating with it.

491
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,740
But let us go back to the news.

492
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,780
Scientists cite hunting by humans in many extinctions during Ice Age.

493
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,720
You know, I just...

494
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,820
It's, uh, San Francisco.

495
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,160
Hunting by humans caused most of the extinctions of Ice Age creatures, such as the woolly mammoth.

496
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
University of Arizona paleontology...

497
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,480
Now what would an Arizona paleontologist know about a woolly mammoth?

498
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:31,020
Anyway, mammoth and other elephant species began going extinct in Eurasia seventy thousand years ago.

499
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,180
The last mammoth group to go...

500
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,280
Oh, this is kind of interesting.

501
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,560
The last mammoth group to go...

502
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:45,060
A species of pygmy mammoths, pipe-smoking pygmy mammoths that lived on Wrangel Island in the Siberian Arctic,

503
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,340
lasted until just four thousand years ago.

504
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,900
Well, we can suck their blood out of their frozen carcasses and clone them.

505
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,180
In America, however, Ice Age animals disappeared far more quickly.

506
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:04,960
Not only mammoths, but saber-toothed cats, giant armadillos, and camels all suddenly disappeared about eleven thousand years ago.

507
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,340
And that's when the people got here.

508
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,160
Friends, they just, you know, you give them half a chance, and they'll refuse to rename Highway 666.

509
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,900
State highway officials in Gallup, New Mexico see no reason to rename U.S. Highway 666,

510
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,520
just because of a claim that the number refers to the Antichrist in the Bible.

511
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,660
Uh, the issue arose after an Indiana man, obviously with very little else to do,

512
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:39,160
wrote one of his U.S. senators wondering why New Mexico didn't change the highway's evil name.

513
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,020
The department said in a news release that 666

514
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,140
has been a name for a long time.

515
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,220
And that's a definite issue, because the book of Revelation uses it as the number of the best, of the beast.

516
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,520
Now, the number of the pest, dear friends, is 999.

517
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,560
Multiply that by three, friend, see what you get.

518
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,920
Uh, they didn't feel that when U.S. 666 was named, that it had anything to do with Revelation.

519
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,780
And, uh, I should, this is an ad,

520
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,040
I should, I should do,

521
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,840
that I should have done a long time ago.

522
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,140
Some of, all of you listeners, I'm sure, are readers of the book,

523
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,060
High Weirdness by Mail,

524
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,780
uh, a subgenius production, uh, published by Simon & Schuster,

525
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,980
which, uh, describes all the kookiest crackpot weirdos.

526
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,640
You know, don't you just think weirdos are weird?

527
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,100
Well, uh, we, we know them all,

528
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,980
and we listed some of them.

529
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Unfortunately, that listing was five years ago,

530
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,320
and the book's really out of date.

531
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,140
Five years? That's six, seven years ago.

532
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,600
And, um, but, there is a magazine out,

533
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,640
actually, there's several magazines that come close to being a monthly version of High Weirdness by Mail,

534
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,760
but get your pencils ready, because I'm gonna give you the address of this new magazine,

535
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,360
Asylum for Shut-ins.

536
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,080
Uh, done out of, uh, Cleveland,

537
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,900
by our good friend, uh, Reverend Cole,

538
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,020
who runs the Hour of Slack,

539
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,420
is running the Hour of Slack right now in future time,

540
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,440
at, uh, about 9.30 in, uh, maybe a little, about 9.35, ain't it?

541
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,300
In, uh, on 89.3 FM.

542
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,260
Only it's in Cleveland.

543
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,040
Anyway, here's the address for Asylum for Shut-ins,

544
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,300
and, uh, the sample issue is $2.50, $2.50,

545
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,060
and the, uh, the, uh, subscription, uh,

546
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,100
the subscriptions are $9,

547
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,260
but the address to write is

548
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,820
Asylum for Shut-ins,

549
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,200
P.O. Box 46581.

550
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,640
I'm gonna do that one again.

551
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,220
But once again, this is not our address.

552
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,500
This is the address of, uh,

553
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,940
a list, a magazine, a profusely illustrated magazine,

554
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,140
which most sarcastically, uh, shows you how to,

555
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,780
to get free stuff from just, uh,

556
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,400
the craziest people.

557
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,540
And what, that's once again, Box 46581.

558
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,540
46581 in Bedford, Ohio.

559
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,920
Bedford.

560
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,060
You can spell it Bedford, Ohio.

561
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,440
Uh, 44146.

562
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,580
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

563
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,160
Well, we see here, P.O. Box 46581,

564
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,080
Bedford, Ohio, 44146.

565
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,000
And, um, of course, I have to plug this wonderful magazine.

566
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,580
They, they, uh, plug us all the time

567
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,900
and, and quote us and, and, uh, what?

568
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,740
Oh, oh, no, the record's dead.

569
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,640
The record died.

570
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,240
Can't leave silence for but even a second on this show.

571
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,160
Um, so, yeah, tune in to Asylum for Shut-ins.

572
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,060
There's a nice picture of a, of an arm cautioning,

573
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,060


574
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,400
cautiously reaching out of its door to its mailbox,

575
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
removing, uh, issue of Paranoid magazine.

576
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,420
Um, they'll tell you how to get in touch with, uh,

577
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,460
uh, crazy Christians,

578
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,600
the nuttiest, most hate-filled Christians,

579
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,880
um, weird art zines,

580
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,480
oh, Aryan nations,

581
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
uh, blah, blah, blah,

582
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,800
the Holy Temple of Mass Consumption.

583
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,360
That's a subgenius spinoff.

584
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,220
The, Joe, Joe Bob. There's Joe Bob Briggs,

585
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,140
we're interested in there.

586
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,740
All sorts of strange and, and, uh,

587
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,960
the kind of stuff that, that you mighty like.

588
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,380
Now, what next?

589
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,580
Last half of show, finally,

590
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,660
we will go to, uh, once again to Cleveland for

591
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,140
to rot our brains, for to rot

592
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,140
with brain rot, uh, radio theater.

593
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,460
Uh, we'll just, what? What, what?

594
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,980
What you say there's still a little bit more?

595
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
Well, here's what we'll do.

596
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,140
To finish out this side of show.

597
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,720
Oh, by the way, in the background,

598
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,500
you are hearing, um, uh, Stravinsky's Rites of Spring

599
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,200
compressed into two and a half minutes by John Oswald.

600
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,800
And now I would like to introduce Jim Stockdale,

601
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,660
our vice presidential candidate.

602
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,340
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?

603
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,060
I, uh, I've got to read the reason this re...

604
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,440
Uh...

605
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,300
To be any more specific, but we're...

606
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,020
We can't get this, uh, in my brain.

607
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,860
That's one thing, I'm an insider.

608
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,740
Let's get on with talking about something sub-synced.

609
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,240
And that is to do with...

610
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,720
Got it.

611
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,620
...leads and every nuance to them.

612
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,220
And we can't get this in my brain.

613
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,380
I, uh, in this record, uh, but, uh,

614
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,880
to be any more specific,

615
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,920
got it massaged by brain, massaged by brain.

616
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,980
Massaged by brain.

617
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,920
Uh, more, uh, I think.

618
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,420
Start over and, uh, you know, I love this planet,

619
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,740
and I wanted to stay here, but, but, uh,

620
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,140
you've got to have leaders, and I, they're out there.

621
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,700
You know, when I was, I, I ran a civilization for several years.

622
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,240
We had our own laws.

623
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,640
We had our own, practically our own constitution.

624
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,940
And I put up, I was the beginning of wisdom.

625
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,000
But, uh, I think, uh, that should be, uh,

626
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,240
I with great suspicion.

627
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,020
I tried to analyze human predicaments

628
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,100
in that microcosm of, uh, life in the, in the, in the world.

629
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,140
And I found out that when I really got down

630
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,540
to putting out do's and don'ts,

631
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,980
and lots of these included,

632
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,240
take torture for this and that and this and that,

633
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,860
you got some double meaning there,

634
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,540
but they all understood, and, and that's important.

635
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,420
Well, uh,

636
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,460
I'm out of ammunition, ammunition, ammunition.

637
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,540
That's from, uh, Vavum, a tape,

638
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,100
taped by Vavum,

639
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,620
which is actually Reverend Scott Orsi,

640
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,100
uh, up, uh, Chicago Way.

641
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,600
And now...

642
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,240
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

643
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,240
Uh, Leuters and, uh, Germans.

644
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,640
Uh, swineers and swineerikers.

645
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,240
It is with great pride tonight.

646
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,760
That Brainrot Radio Theater,

647
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,340
under the flaccid banner of ESO Radio,

648
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
and guided by the unseen hands

649
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
of the Church of the Subgenius,

650
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,480
presents a radio drama milestone.

651
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,480
Or perhaps a millstone around our scrawny necks.

652
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,420
At any rate, after years of relentless search,

653
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,960
found in a basement,

654
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
storeroom and radio station,

655
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,480
K-Pox, Topeka, Kansas,

656
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,460
here is the historic pilot show

657
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,620
of The Misadventures of Bob and Connie,

658
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,580
starring Bob and Connie Dobbs

659
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,480
as America's favorite

660
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,240
cosmo-misogynistic dog puppets and avatars.

661
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,280
And listen closely also for cameo performances

662
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,240
by the Reverend Ivan Stang,

663
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,280
a budding child star,

664
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,240
the Princess Wiardo,

665
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,360
also lonesome cowboy Dave,

666
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,220
the Psychopath Finder,

667
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,400
and Scabby Dave,

668
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,760
and a host of others afflicted with

669
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,040
hirsutism and deformed larynxes.

670
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,480
This pilot, although an incredible success

671
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,760
throughout the Midwest,

672
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,360
was horribly censored

673
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,120
by the McCarthy subcommittee on unusual behavior.

674
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
So without further a doodle-do,

675
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,900
the last episode,

676
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,880
the M.A. of Bob and Connie Dobbs

677
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,460
as first heard February 26, 1954.

678
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,700
But first, this message.

679
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,120
Hi, folks.

680
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,540
Hiroshima Schwartz

681
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,860
for Hiroshima Schwartz's

682
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,560
Miniature Nuclear Weapons Warehouse.

683
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,920
Home of the Mini-Meg,

684
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,640
the Pocket Thunder,

685
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,400
and many other fine, small, low-megaton nukes

686
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,220
that fit in your purse or pocketbook.

687
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,700
And what am I doing here

688
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,360
at Helsinki Station in Moscow

689
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,660
instead of our beautiful air-conditioned warehouse?

690
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,440
Well, I'm sure not waiting for V.I. Lenin.

691
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm waiting for the latest arms shipment

692
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,960
from the troubled Yarrow Mountains.

693
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,040
Yes, at Hiroshima Schwartz,

694
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,920
we know the best deals come straight off the train,

695
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,880
with no Russian mafia middlemen.

696
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,780
Lots of American arms dealers

697
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,580
go hunting in the former Soviet Union

698
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,620
and don't come back.

699
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,100
But at Hiroshima Schwartz,

700
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,180
we bribe enough officials in one month

701
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,140
to bring you year-round savings.

702
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,460
Mr. Schwartz,

703
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,640
the conductor would like a half-day word for you.

704
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,880
Your egg baskets and icons have arrived.

705
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,020
Car 54.

706
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,800
Oh, thank you, Officer Krupke,

707
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,840
you friendly Russian official.

708
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,700
Here's 5,000 rubles.

709
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,260
Buy your family a loaf of bread.

710
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,500
And yet you vote, Krupke.

711
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,140
Anyway, folks,

712
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
Hiroshima Schwartz

713
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,840
Miniature Nuclear Weapons House,

714
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,600
Weapons Warehouse,

715
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,280
where we go to the source.

716
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,120
No middlemen.

717
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,400
Hiroshima Schwartz is literally blowing up

718
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,080
the competition.

719
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,680
.

720
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:14,740
.

721
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,720
S u were going to America

722
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,620
And practice with the US

723
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,000
How'd you end it?

724
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
For premier where frickin' takes you

725
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,680
To get on you

Featuring Bob and Connie!

728
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,720
And they're live and stank as Bob's well-worn suitcase.

729
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,740
Okay!

730
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,760
It's the morning before the Senate subcommittee hearings

731
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,920
on unusual behavior.

732
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,140
Senator McCarr Trouble and Senator Foghat Legirons

733
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,520
have summoned Bob.

734
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:10,860
Bob!

735
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,020
Uh-oh!

736
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,080
La la la la.

737
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,280
Bob!

738
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,500
I still can't find your glow-in-the-dark boxer shorts

739
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,880
or hand-painted tie with the many glowing heads of knee-gee.

740
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,420
Bob!

741
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,080
Damn!

742
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,360
Drunk or frapped again.

743
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,160
What's this?

744
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,480
The pages of Bob's Betty Page photo splash all dog-eared,

745
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,580
all soggy and slimy like greasy fried chicken.

746
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,960
Roman, I mean Bob,

747
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,120
I think Little Ivan's been clicking your castanets

748
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,800
and what have you done to its eyes?

749
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,920
Connie, how many times have I told you

750
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,280
not to interrupt me while this pipe is burning?

751
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,800
Have you heard the one about the, uh,

752
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,500
the one who was asked if he stopped beating his wife?

753
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,260
Ow! Ow!

754
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,060
Bob!

755
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,060
Poop-eyes!

756
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,460
No!

757
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,640
Oh!

758
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey, hey, Dad!

759
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,780
Dad!

760
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,320
Dad!

761
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,360
Hello, Dad!

762
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,000
The price grids are growing!

763
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm glad I killed all those sea monkeys

764
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,060
and got with something with some fight in them.

765
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:31,800
Dad!

766
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,140
Dad!

767
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,480
You're drunk again!

768
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,860
Bob, you're all gagged up too!

769
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,140
He's not.

770
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,000
He's not your dad, Ivan.

771
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,240
Stop torturing me.

772
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,300
Stop torturing me.

773
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,800
Stop torturing me, Connie.

774
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,660
You like it?

775
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,000
You knew those high heels were two sizes too small.

776
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,300
Oh, gee, Mom and Dad, can't we ditch this slather

777
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,960
and get to the part where I eat the whole can of Crisco?

778
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,060
How many times must we tell you

779
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,580
we're not your parents?

780
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,380
Your fictionalized radio character,

781
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,480
the kid, the innocent, mischievous gargoyle,

782
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,200
like the voiceover says.

783
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,800
Your luggage, a suitcase, get it?

784
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,320
I hate you, Mommy!

785
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,140
I hate you, Mommy!

786
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:35,160
Am I hearing the doorknob, Connie?

787
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,920
What am I hearing?

788
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,620
Oh, no!

789
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,120
Oh, no!

790
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,940
Oh, no!

791
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,000
The hearings!

792
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,520
Who in the name of Bob Dobbs are you?

793
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,700
Dead!

794
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,420
Oh!

795
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,260
Leg on!

796
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,340
Bob Dobbs!

797
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,460
Yes, sir.

798
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,120
Yes, sir.

799
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,500
Bob Dobbs, got a subpenny for you.

800
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,160
It says you gotta be at the unusual hearing aid

801
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,420
in three minutes or other bits will preempt your show.

802
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,980
How did you know I was wearing a hearing aid?

803
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,900
This moronic is a real one.

804
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:05,900


805
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,220
My miraculous ear is so small, it actually fits into my brain.

806
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,660
Mine, too.

807
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,920
I can't hear you.

808
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,980
The voice!

809
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,220
The voice of a giant rotisserie gold chicken is telling me to blow my brains out.

810
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,640
Don't try and stop me.

811
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,600
Oh, don't worry.

812
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,400
We won't.

813
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,140
If justice were only this swift in the real world.

814
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,480
Bob,

815
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,620
little Ivan has been issuing your dirty book.

816
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,980
You rotten rat freak bitch!

817
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,920
I'll get even!

818
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,580
That's my Boyle.

819
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,600
All firm and tumescent and ready to pop.

820
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,940
I'll get even with you, too, Dad!

821
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,680
You pipe-smoking talking head!

822
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,160
Have you heard the one about the traveling salesman

823
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,640
who's really a pink, pink, pinko?

824
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,300
Oh, Sam, please.

825
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,820
Explain all those coffee mugs with Joe Stalin's mug on them.

826
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,860
I'm a fictional radio dad.

827
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,020
Ivan, you wouldn't.

828
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,440
Easy on the boy, Mother.

829
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,760
His blood's all hot now.

830
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,420
Oh, yes, I would, you abusive foster-brooks' parents.

831
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,800
I'll tell McCart Trouble and Foghat Leg Irons everything.

832
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,400
The frozen hot dog and the Vaseline orgies

833
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,960
and the saucer crash meal dance

834
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,000
and the sunshine and donuts virtual reality Florida landscape.

835
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,280
And the little chest toupee you wear

836
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,780
to conceal your little shiny sacrum.

837
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:37,960
Daddy!

838
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,220
Dammit, Pop.

839
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,900
If this little creep goes before the hearings

840
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,560
and tells what he knows, we're broke!

841
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,120
The worst kind is 5 to 20 for defrauding the clergy.

842
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,420
We'll have to kill him.

843
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,360
We can't kill him, Tony. He's not really.

844
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,140
He's a fictional radio character.

845
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,720
I'm outta here!

846
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,980
I'm telling McCart Trouble and Foghat Leg Irons everything.

847
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I'm gonna call the doctor, Winky, and any other name I can think of!

848
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,460
I'm gonna tell them all, and then I'm gonna get you!

849
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,740
No, you! No!

850
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,140
No!

851
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:19,680
Well, it looks like little Ivan is looking for serious trouble.

852
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,660
And what about the bloated diaphragm in the shower?

853
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,660
Isn't one saucer crash mutant one too many in this modern age?

854
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,440
We'll be back with little Bob and Connie and little Ivan

855
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,640
after these sucking worms from our sponsors.

856
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,140
Now that's rich, rich flavor.

857
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,680
The taste of a frappy strike.

858
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,480
Nine out of ten frozen doctors prefer the rich, harsh flavor of frappy strike.

859
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,960
One hit and Betty garbles away.

860
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,120
Those thighs are within grope.

861
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:06,460
You're a he-man, all right, so you spoke frappy strike.

862
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,040
The one-hit wonder in six-inch heels.

863
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,800
A sexual smoke for testosterone-laden rugged men.

864
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,780
Hello, everyone.

865
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,680
I'm Betty Garbles for the rich, rich, rich flavor of frappy smoke.

866
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,960
The smoke for blokes who like to poke and croak and make manly jokes

867
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
with a rich, rich, rich smoke.

868
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,920
Smoke me sometime.

869
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,160
Right you are, Betty Garbles, star of radio, stage, screen and television.

870
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,840
For horny he-men, it's rich, rich frappy streak.

871
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,060
Perforated by 999-dum-da-da-toll-trick.

872
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,820
Loved by spies and goons from Topeka to Tashkent.

873
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,200
Frappy strike.

874
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,300
Hello, capitalist, imperialist, pig-dog lackeys of bourgeois class.

875
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,580
This is Ivan Svansky, hated KGB goon.

876
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:19,260
And I know for certain fact that our beloved onion of shoelaces slavs

877
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,620
is invading America soon.

878
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,860
But first, we blow you up.

879
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,900
So how come you don't got clubhouse fallout shelter?

880
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,640
Everyone in onion of shoes and slaves got its duck clubhouse.

881
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:40,620
Thick neck military types, evil scientists, even car salesmen got its clubhouse.

882
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,440
Pope got its.

883
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,580
So when Ivan is on smoking roble ready to rape Betty Garbles,

884
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,940
how you gonna breathe without clubhouse fallout shelter?

885
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,220
That's right, Ivan.

886
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:02,800
Nine out of ten raping Russians say the clubhouse fallout shelter is Russian and fallout proof.

887
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,100
So when the holocaust comes, you won't be smoking roble.

888
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:14,520
You'll be smoking frappy strikes in your modern all-nuclear-powered clubhouse fallout shelter kitchen.

889
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,200
Betty's right about what Ivan said about what Betty said about what Ivan said.

890
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,400
Clubhouse fallout shelters, a division of Dobbs Industries, Inc.

891
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,460
and the

892
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:47,540
Well, I wonder what kind of trouble Ivan's cooked up for Bob and Connie.

893
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,400
Let's rejoin them at the knees where they belong at the unusual house hearings.

894
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:04,800
Mr. Kyle Hand, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, order! Order in the hearing room!

895
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,440
I can't seem to get started, Senator Legg-Irons.

896
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,380
I'm stuck in idle while communists put idle hands to work during the devil's dirty laundry.

897
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,640
I, Senator Joe Blow McCurtain Trouble, will put these communist fellow travelers out of work where they belong.

898
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

899
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,300
Order, order!

900
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,960
Now, Mr. Dobbs, will you please extinguish that damn pipe?

901
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,100
The only fellow I travel with, Senator, are fellow traveling salesmen.

902
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,600
And my house is no more unusual than any other red-bloody house in America.

903
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,100
He's right. It's not like we're into frozen hot dogs and saucer crash mutants.

904
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:56,200
We're exploring orgone, or energy, as a cure for flatulence.

905
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:56,200


906
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,960
Is that so? Well, I, Senator Foghorn Legg-Irons, have seen too many rocky passages.

907
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,700
I could use something to control my wind.

908
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,000
Communists do not pass gas, Senator. This is no laughing matter.

909
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:25,820
They're communists! They're communists! Reds! They're reds! I'm their bastard love child, and I know what they do!

910
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,160
Commies! I hate you, Mommy! I hate you, Mommy! Have a safe ride to Leavenworth!

911
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,520
Who is that kid?

912
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,880
Oh, God, no, Bob. Where'd he come from? We're doomed!

913
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,700
Just hold onto my arm, darling. We'll see our way through this.

914
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,600
A little lower. A little lower.

915
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:53,220
Your Honor, I have proof that these two creeps are agents of the worldwide pinko, pink boy, pink conspiracy!

916
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,800
Oh, I see.

917
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,140
And who might you be?

918
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:05,500
Talk about children of a lesser god. I'm Bob and Connie Dobbs' fake, rato stepchild!

919
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,540
Oh, my God!

920
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:13,380
Ivan Stang, the little cute monster who stirs the plot with a big greasy spoon?

921
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:25,800
That's me, Senator, and these papers I hold are contracts with a corrupt communist official, filed and signed by my pa-mom and pop-bun.

922
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:33,280
Bob and Connie Dobbs, for 2,000 rent-controlled shares of Clubhouse Call-Out Shelter!

923
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
I hate you, Mommy! I hate you, Mommy!

924
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,660
What's he doing?

925
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, I see! But is it not true that you are a fictional radio character? Ergo, you do not exist, son!

926
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,240
I don't? Then neither do you!

927
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,060
You're all figment and specters of electromagnetic illusion!

928
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,860
You can't say I'm not real! I'm real, so real, so real!

929
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,680
I hate you, Mommy! I hate you, Mommy!

930
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,860
Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Wake up! Wake up!

931
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,260
You fell asleep on the couch right during Daddy's big business meeting!

932
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:17,160
You're so rude! I'd like you to meet Daddy's new business associate, Senator McCartrouble!

933
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,360
Hello, little Ivan! Always pleased to meet a fellow time traveler!

934
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,900
You pick-nosed slut!

935
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,720
You interrupted my train of thought!

936
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:31,780
Now, when the prairie squids heat up, they're gonna flop and go flash and shoot all the gas out of the poopy sod and the...

937
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,120
Strange boy! Strange boy! Care for a frappy strike?

938
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,640
You need a spanking! A nice, hot, vigorous spanking!

939
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,200
Oh, Mommy! I knew you'd save me!

940
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:12,160
Well, that's all for the unusual house activities we have time for on the Misadventures of Bob and Connie Dobbs, brought to you by Frappy Stinks, the smoke that Betty Garble smokes with big, hairy-chested man.

941
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,180
Oh, yeah, yeah!

942
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,900
NIE

943
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:51,900


944
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,060
Well, we're here with the Reverend Ivan Shday.

945
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,600
And...

946
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,540
I had my pause button on. Can we do all that again?

948
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,440
Oh yeah, sure.

949
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,080
Hey, that background music's up too loud!

950
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,100
Pad down the background music, please.

951
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,460
No!

952
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,900
Oh, please, I'm sorry!

953
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,780
Oh, that's fine. Oh, the background music's...

954
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,920
You'll do what I say you'll do.

955
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,740
I love the background music, Chaz.

956
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,100
And whatever you say.

957
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,160
Chaz is getting kind of dominating.

958
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,800
Praise Chaz.

959
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,100
Yeah, but I missed part of it.

960
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,300
Robert Anton Wilson's dead.

961
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,100
I got the first half hour clean.

962
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:44,640
No, he's dead.

963
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,160
You got the last half hour?

964
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,140
No, Leary has no...

965
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,660
I have the first half hour clean in the last five, ten minutes.

966
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,180
Oh, I'm sorry, let me do that again for you.

967
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,700
Well...

968
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:00,980
Huh?

969
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:01,880
Huh? Huh?

970
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,720
Oh, yeah, I turned the...

971
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,100
Yeah, I turned the tape over.

972
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,260
It's just looping over and over and over and over again.

973
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,440
I have to put a new tape in there in the next millennium.

974
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,040
In five minutes.

975
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,380
In five minutes, the old one goes out and that one goes in.

976
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,920
But you have to push the red button and the triangle.

977
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,300
The triangle pointing to the right.

978
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,660
You see, nobody can read anymore.

979
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,400
It's all little pictoglyphs.

980
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,080
Five minutes old.

981
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,000
The red dot means record and the triangle means play.

982
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,180
You got most of the goodness.

983
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,280
Oh, I got all the goodness.

984
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,400
I got all of it.

985
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,180
I got the whole last hour.

986
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:38,880
Incoming.

987
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,720
I don't know what that really does for us.

988
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,760
I mean, you know...

989
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,020
It does absolutely nothing for us.

990
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,440
What are we documenting?

991
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,400
What are we documenting?

992
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,480
What are we talking about?

993
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,360
It's like, well, you...

994
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,460
Stick it in...

995
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,400
I heard a cool song on the rap show today.

996
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,580
Stick it in, pull it out.

997
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,100
Stick it in, pull it out.

998
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,640
Stick it in, pull it out.

999
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,860
That's a cool song.

1000
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,240
That's a stupid song.

1001
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:04,640
Yo!

1002
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,440
And I actually caught...

1003
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,120
The girl said...

1004
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,700
She was telling one of her friends to...

1005
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,800
Now that you plant your seed and watch the flower grow.

1006
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,620
And I thought that was very poetic.

1007
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,000
I thought that was very poetic.

1008
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,000


1009
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,000


1010
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,020
I think that's artistic, you know, because they don't want to be vulgar and low and just

1011
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,300
come out and just...

1012
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,880
Mention scratching their ovaries.

1013
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,860
Yeah, say their feelings out loud.

1014
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,880
So they use these subtle poetic, you know, put it in, pull it out.

1015
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,860
Stomp my thermal pudding.

1016
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,100
Things like that.

1017
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,640
Yeah, it's...

1018
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,560
You have to...

1019
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,360
It's sort of...

1020
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,720
They put the message between the lines, you know.

1021
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,260
It's good.

1022
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,060
It helps the kids' imaginations these days.

1023
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,700
But these little lines, these little fissures, aren't they actually the cracks in the human

1024
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,440
subconscious, in the collective consciousness?

1025
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,200
Well, yeah, but they've been pretty much...

1026
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,220
They could be.

1027
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:58,680
...soldered over by MTV, Beavis, you know, TV, school, the concept of jobs.

1028
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,680
That's, you know, so they...

1029
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,620
That is anathema to your whole being as a reverend of stink.

1030
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,860
Jobs, it just...

1031
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,560
Well, all you have to do is just smooth over the convolutions.

1032
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,800
See, it's not the size of the brain, it's how much wrinkledness there is to it.

1033
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,420
I'm wrinkled.

1034
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,160
And what we do, we just...

1035
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:21,060
It's not literally sandpaper that we use, but it's sort of a metaphorical or metaphysical...

1036
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:21,440
To smooth it.

1037
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,540
...kind of sandpaper to smooth the convolutions down, so your brain is not much smaller than

1038
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,780
it was to begin with, but it's very smooth.

1039
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,900
Hey, did you hear about the...

1040
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,040
It's a smooth brain, and it makes your life go so much smoother without those extra little

1041
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,980
crinkly, fiddly bits in it, you know.

1042
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,620
It's nice.

1043
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,960
Everything's all black and white.

1044
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,240
It's like Rush Limbaugh, you know.

1045
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,240
Everything's simple.

1046
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,020
The complex makes simple.

1047
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,560
It's easy to figure out.

1048
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,320
It's what every dumb idiot wants to hear.

1049
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,320
Hey, Cody, my cell.

1050
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,100
It'll sell.

1051
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:51,840
It'll sell.

1052
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,360
We're gonna drop this Bob stuff.

1053
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,920
It's too complicated, and then...

1054
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,800
But Sister Tonya Squared tried to kill us last time, and we just ain't gonna do it no

1055
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,000
more.

1056
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,940
We're just gonna...

1057
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,920
We're going straight...

1058
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,040
We're gonna do it like Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern combined.

1059
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,120
We're gonna do it.

1060
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:06,740
Millions.

1061
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,020
Millions.

1062
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,420
Millions.

1063
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,480
Millions.

1064
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,420
Millions.

1065
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:09,620
Millions.

1066
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:09,840
Millions.

1067
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,200
Millions.

1068
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:10,500
Millions.

1069
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,100
We've had enough of overestimating the American public's intelligence.

1070
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,640
You said it!

1071
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,320
No, sorry.

1072
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,500
And besides, they've been killing...

1073
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,860
Have you heard all the rumors of war and wars and dead people?

1074
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,360
I heard some of the Romanians were dead people, but I didn't know they were going around killing

1075
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:27,840
each other.

1076
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,700
They killed Timothy Leary.

1077
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,340
He died this weekend.

1078
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,280
Well, now, that was a hit.

1079
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:33,900
That was a hit.

1080
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,840
An Illuminati hit.

1081
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,000
And Robert Anton Wilson was an Illuminati hit too.

1082
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,280
Lou...

1083
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,540
was involved.

1084
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,500
My client, Mr. Monati, is

1085
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,540
not at liberty to discuss

1086
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,520
these particular hearings.

1087
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,580
However, he can discuss the

1088
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,760
death of Dinah Shore,

1089
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,660
Jack Kirby. Jack Kirby

1090
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,580
died a couple of weeks ago, man!

1091
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,160
And you're standing here!

1092
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,760
You're not weeping! You don't even know who Jack Kirby is!

1093
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,660
What about Gloria Ramirez?

1094
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,980
Jack Kirby was your...

1095
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,740
Jack Kirby was Stan Lee's buddy in the original one!

1096
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,840
I don't even know who she is!

1097
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,520
She's the one that...

1098
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,180
They drew blood out of her, and her blood had

1099
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,500
crystals in it, and it made the doctors

1100
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,380
and the nurses pass out. You didn't hear that

1101
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,060
story? No.

1102
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,480
She went in the hospital, and she had cancer of some

1103
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,120
sort. And they

1104
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,620
took blood out, and they noticed she had crystallized

1105
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,640
blood. The crystals in her blood.

1106
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,020
The Andromeda strain.

1107
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,740
Yeah, that's what I was figuring.

1108
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,460
And we'll continue with that story next

1109
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,500
week. Actually, we will. And it's

1110
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,040
a follow-up story. There have been people

1111
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,440
passing out in operating rooms

1112
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,720
at

1113
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,600
that ammonia-like smells

1114
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,080
everywhere.

1115
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,520
Probably here pretty soon.

1116
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,980
And, well,

1117
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,340
we'll try to come back next week.

1118
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,060
If you will write for free information

1119
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,000
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1120
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,560
I should explain that tonight, you've been

1121
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,440
listening to, well, in this case,

1122
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,060
KNON Dallas,

1123
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,540
allowing us to do this show.

1124
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,460
Allowing the Church

1125
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,640
of the Subgenius to put on

1126
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,440
its production by the

1127
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,440
Subgenius Foundation, which

1128
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,900
in this case was playing

1129
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,900
a radio station, WCSB's

1130
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,280
show, ESO Radio,

1131
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
a large segment of

1132
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,340
which is Brain Rot Radio

1133
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,720
Theater, which at that time

1134
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,540
came back around to the Church of the

1135
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,820
Subgenius, which you can get

1136
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,240
for nothing from

1137
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,680
Post Office Box

1138
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,860
140306

1139
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,220
Dallas, Texas.

1140
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,280
Just, I'm going to give that number again,

1141
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,840
have that pencil ready, right to

1142
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,280
Bob.

1143
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,860
Throw a self-addressed stamped

1144
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,640
envelope in there, and that address is

1145
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,140
Box 140306

1146
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,180
Dallas,

1147
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:47,940
Texas

1148
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,140

1149
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,040
Thank you.

1175
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,760
And then they passed out.

1176
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,520
And like seven people got sick from just being exposed to the blood crystals.

1177
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,280
Oh, my God.

1178
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,080
Stop.

1179
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:07,760
Stop. Close your workbooks and stick your pencils up your...

1180
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,080
page.

1181
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,340
You are now ready to begin the next part of this fabulous test.

1182
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,620
Brought to you by Whittle Communications and McDonald's Hamburgers.

1183
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,540
Infotainment is now acting upon the subject.

1184
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,220
Yes. Oh, that's her.

1185
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,560
She was on last night.

1186
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,220
Oh, wait a minute. I'm not on this show.

1187
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:30,980
Thank you.

1188
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,800
Will you hold the line, please?

1189
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,380
Will you hold the line, please? We have to kill the humans.

1190
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,020
You will dial 212 and the telephone number.

1191
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,000
Will you talk with anyone?

1192
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,840
Yeah, anyone.

1193
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,080
Anyone who answers at the...

1194
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,600
The mutants.

1195
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,040
The mutants of Rania.

1196
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,220
Okay, well...

1197
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,880
Kill me now or kill me later.

1198
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,660
Cool.

1199
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,900
And I shall go to dwell

1200
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,160
On Zion's hill.

1201
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:03,600
On Zion's hill.

1202
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,360
Our singing passenger pauses for just a moment,

1203
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,520
perhaps thinking about the gates of pearl that will soon be swinging open wide for him.

1204
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:22,280
He, the pearly gates will open

1205
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,720
So that I may enter in

1206
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:38,780
For he purchased my redemption

1207
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,760
For he purchased my redemption

1208
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:48,040
And forgave me all my sins

1209
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,320
Ladies and gentlemen, darkness seems to be falling about us as the passengers approach the gate of death.

1210
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,840
But everyone keeps moving along at a steady pace as if there were a guiding light.

1211
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,780
For they are proceeding to the gate of death.

1212
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,220
They are proceeding without fear of any kind.

1213
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,320
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

1214
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,840
Is he waiting there for me?

1215
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,200
Is he waiting for me?

1216
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,380
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

1217
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,380
What could be waiting there for me?

1218
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,540
What could be waiting for me?

1219
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,260
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

1220
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,760
What could stop the aliens from killing me?

1221
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,620
Let's hope you love me.

1222
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,700
Bob can't help me.

1223
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,960
He can help.

1224
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,200
But will he?

1225
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,280
Will he help me?

1226
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,300
Got nothing in my face.

1227
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,700
Watch my inner guide.

1228
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,100
And he's keeping my body.

1229
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,560
Keeping my body.

1230
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,760
He's even nice to my head.

1231
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:56,960
He's nice.

1232
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,160
He's nice to my head.

1233
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,580
Watch that little voice.
