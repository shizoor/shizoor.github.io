I see the greed.
I see the self-centeredness.
I see the avarice that brought them down.
And now, here they come, our hosts and hostess.
Take off your jacket, your tie, loosen any belts you might have.
Take off your shoes.
Make yourself really, really comfortable.
If there's anything at all in your clothing that's tight, loosen it up.
Select a floor that has a rug and spread it.

Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight and spread with it lots of rain,
up to seven inches of rain for the folks in the Carolinas.
For Saturday, a better day.
Sunday, a better day still.
Bob will begin to move onshore, though, again tonight.

I tell you to listen to the subgenius hour of slack with your ascended host, the cyborg
handyman, Reverend Ivan Stang, the lovely Robert Bob Dobbs, and an ectoplasmic cast
of billions.
This lively little ongoing saga features exotic humor and skull-powering music that was not
only banned in Boston, but noobs in Newark.
You'll be down on your hands and knees looking for your lost brain after just one cat-sterilizing
dose of...
The subgenius hour of slack.
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets, out of the churches, and change
America.
That I endorse you and what you are doing.
And so the world continued to dance through another war, and with a murderous song in
its heart.
Accompanied by the propeller blades, this benevolent mankind used his greatest intellectual
invention of the airplane to deliver one of my greatest, boldest, most spectacular
triumphs.
Subgenius Radio Ministry.
Hour of Slack.
Subgenius Radio Ministry.
Welcome, human.
Welcome, human.
To the hour...
Of Slack.
Of Slack.
Of Slack.
Of Slack.
I'm glad you could all make it.
I'd like to now introduce the man who came to host our show.
His illustrious career is known by everyone here, and we're so glad he could make it.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ivan Stang.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.

Ah.


Ah.
Oh, the old remarkable man.
Oh, what aquijole.
I can do anything with this.


I know that man값tugas rocks packages.
I'll take your time,
aroo.

I do. I do indeed.
Continue, and without interruption.
Man was created in the image of God, but there the similarity ends.
And Jim Baker's PTL television ministry was the fastest growing phenomenon in religious broadcasting.
I'm sick and tired of hearing about all of the radicals, and the perverts, and the liberals.
And the leftists, and the communists coming out of the closets.
It's time for God's people to come out of the closets, out of the churches, and change America.
And change America.
And change America.
Yeah, we want your back, Bob.
Bring some of that crap here with you.
Come on.
I said this.
The next time you come back, bring more pills.
Mortal, not immortal, are we.
Of the flesh, not of the spirit, are we.
Human, not godlike, are we.
But whatever our sins, whatever our shortcomings,
we believe the good deeds done by man on earth far outweigh the bad.
Thereby earning him the right to survive.
Objection.
Okay, that's it for stupid human tricks.
Boy, what a curious assortment tonight.
That's not Bob.
No, it's Bob.
Where's Bob?
There's Bob.
He's hiding.
Let's go up.
Let's go up to Bob.
Go on up there.
He's not dead.
Aw, not again.
Every one of them!
Oh!
That could get too lame!
and touching him.
You have to look at the job
and saying that this dead man
is going to be a half an hour late.
Are you sitting comfortably?
Ah!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
What's your problem?
I'm trying to scratch my
problem.
I just can't reach it.
I just can't reach it.

I said I'm going to stretch
my problem.
I enjoyed the hell out of that.
You know, the doctor music
trend and anti-music
has a lot to do with noise, not music, too.
Hey!
Bye.
I know, but the problem with doctor bands
and anti-music bands is sooner or later
they learn how to play those instruments.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
All right.
You're going to wake yourself up.
Oh!
Yes.
It's when the person gets on stage
and lets Bob speak through it
and just,
it cuts loose.
It's the living tongue acting on him.
Exactly.
It's the undirected energy of Bob
spewing forth through the human carcass.
Satanic cult.
Police have found no proof.
Made no arrest.
But that's no surprise.
For nationwide,
police are hearing strikingly similar horror stories.
And not one has ever been proved.
But she kept getting nastier
and nastier and nastier.
And I finally just went,
I just had had enough.
And I just started going,
well, I'll just have to control your soul then.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
What have you done to it?
What have you done to its eyes?
What have you done to him, you maniac?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
People come first.
It's the way some people interpret the Bible.
The book of Revelations,
where it's written,
Satan can be identified by the number 666.
Bob's 999 is not enough.
It's not enough to be identified by 666.
It is the opposite of 666.
So...
Or not exactly the opposite.
It's not...
He ain't, you know,
Bob ain't Jesus.
He's just, uh...
But he is certainly the anti-Antichrist.
There was a routine inquiry which didn't discover what was going on here.
B-O-B, Bob.
We inherited the Earth.
And we're blessed with certain rare gifts.
An opposable thumb.
With which to build tools and weapons for survival.
The capacity to speak, to think, to reason.
The ability to walk erect on two solid arches.
We were fruitful.
We multiplied.
We were resourceful.
We replenished the Earth and subdued it.
These were the kinds of things that we were blessed with.

Covenants.
These we fulfilled.
Unfortunately for me, you broke all of the Ten Commandments doing it.
Order in the court.
There is one piece of evidence already referred to which has not been placed on exhibition.
The Bible.
Objection.
That book has no place in this trial.
And no bearing on its outcome.
Objection overruled.
Proceed.
The Wiki.
The book is a work of the deceitful work.
But to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.
My lords, I rest my case.
In the matter of the story of mankind, this high tribunal has weighed most carefully the good of man against his evil.
And finds that man is as evil as man.
And as evil as he is good.
Did you hear what he was saying?
Did you hear what he was saying?
I don't like that last sound.
The Lord is my Shepherd.
No, that won't do.
All right. Close your eyes, please.
Now, please, and repeat this prayer after me, right out loud.
Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng, Ng.
Beach party, beach party, it never stops.
I'm tired of this nightclub.
This band is so bad.
Why do I have to pay $5 every night to stay alive?
Well, how many times do we have to play this worst song over and over and over again?
Today we have found Satan is alive and thriving.
I'm alive?
Yes.
You're alive.
Or at least plenty of people believe he is.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
I'm alive.
Bob is dead.
Or at least plenty of people believe he is.
We have all types of perversion going on.
America is being affected.
I am not a piece of...
What are you smiling about?
Order me that six more demerits.
All of them were investigated by police, but usually without much result.
I hate that old demon.
But just yesterday I went to the store to buy shoes for my children.
And I was driving home and it seemed like a force that came over me.
And when I woke, the shoes were gone.
And there was three empty wine bottles in the back of them.
The vaccine.
We stress it's perfectly legal.
And these are typical commercial outlets you'll find just about anywhere.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Probably given a lot of people the idea to listen to records backwards.
They've never had the idea before.
I think it is pretty sick in America when they're selling this junk over the counters.
And it's doubly sick when Christians give their kiddies money to buy the stuff.
What would you do if Jesus walked into some of those homes of all the Protestant movies?
I think it's a good idea to have a little bit of a movement.
And lo and behold, guess what's in the bedroom, friend?
The rapture is not going to be overcrowded.
I don't think we're going to have a traffic jam getting up to heaven.
What we need is to get them played through down here. Amen?
When they're crawling through their radioactive rubble with their fingers falling out,
looking for some battery for their tape decks or their flashlights.
Oh, then they want to get back to Bob.
Then they're going, oh, I got my $20 record stag.
Where's my $20 record?

I'm going to get my $20 record stag.
Oh, there's that book of the stroke genius that tells me what to do at a time like this, eh?
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.
The symbolism is all there.
Shout. Shout.
Oh, oh, oh.
What?
Shout, which will be out in about a month.
Shout. Shout.
In a bookstore, my friend hit the shelf and a book fell out and I caught it.
And it had a pretty weird looking guy on the back.
It might be like the smile face of the 90s.
The baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob.
The face that can pile through eight foot thick titanium steel conspiracy fort knocks doors.
The face that can burn through metal with that mighty pipe.
And I believe that that had a lot to do with it.
We can get a glimpse of his theories and his rituals in this 1970 documentary.
This is a world of the future.
World of the future.
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants.
Dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.
First of all, just on their face value, they sound so good.
And then they're so unusual or bizarre that most people hearing that message really don't think that it's true.
If you start listening for something, you're likely to hear it.
He listened to the tape backwards too.
Yeah, we'll turn the thing on.
Everybody up in the balcony sing.
Good bro friend, Neil and his hopes, good bro sleep.
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
I might have heard different things if you've given me different phrases.
That's not how they're describing it.
They're just happy around me.
We want Bob! Where's Bob? We want Bob!
Right now! We want Bob!
And experts say they were lucky to escape.
Many youngsters are into it, teenagers and younger.
It could be harmless. It could just be a diversion.
But it could also be deadly serious.
Oh, we're dead serious. This is all too real, George.
Uh-huh.
Our fans collect a lot of negative energy that was meant for us.
Nothing new perhaps, but then, what is?
The spuds just keep trickling down.
Oh, how hard it is.
We're regressing then.
Oh, absolutely.
At a dangerous rate?
Not dangerous enough. It just, you know, things go...
I told you the dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.

incorrect

was talking about well you don't have your subgenius decoder ring why not how can you
get a subgenius decoder ring well there are two ways you can get a subgenius decoder ring
of course you can get it in a box of sugar bobs cereal that's one way but you can also get it
in a box of that non-nutritious carcinogenic snack food substitute cracker bobs
or whatever other things that are sweet to your stomach so just go out and buy one of these fine
dobsian products and you can get your decoder ring free as a bonus inside and eat the stuff
that it's packed in too because it's real good for you oh now okay i know what you're saying
now you say you can't get sugar bobs or cracker bobs why because you can't find it at your local
supermarket why can't you find it at your local supermarket i'll tell you why you can't find it
at your local supermarket because there's a blockchain of decoder rings in the city of

supermarket this is evidence of conspiracy deprogramming on the part of
your so-called friendly neighborhood grocer who refuses to stock sugar bobs
and cracker bobs
that's precisely the point I mean to make no one villain can affect mankind
unless mankind itself supports and encourages his villainy here is a case
in point this man could and did commit the souls of a million men to the devil
because they wanted to be committed well I knew I wouldn't know I wasn't gonna
drink today but well since I already had this damn case
I guess I'll drink it.
I might as well do something with it and well I could take it back but well they
usually don't like you to do that and well I wouldn't want the grocery store
to get mad at me I you know I've been trying to win their bingo game and you
know if I take a bunch cans back well they don't like that kind of thing and
you know well I could probably just pour all the beer out of it but well
it probably kill me
my grass and yeah I don't want to do that and I could trade in for the aluminum but yeah they
wouldn't be really worth the price of the gas of driving down to the aluminum recycling plan
they're probably probably worth is you know it then yeah that's what I take them in for the
aluminum now because if I drank them well it'd probably be worth more if they were just the
aluminum is no one no recycling plants gonna buy aluminum with beer in it so I probably would have
to drink it and well it you know helps wash down my food and it's probably you know it's five you
know didn't drink any today well five more days from now it'd be Sunday and I might want some and
wouldn't be able to drink any so at least I can say well hell I got blowed off my ass last Monday
and you know with these pop-tarts
well some little kid could step on them or you know even though they are still full beers and
well yeah they are in my refrigerator but you know by some twist of the imagination is the little
boy's foot could conceivably I'm not saying that it's impossible but it could probably come into my
refrigerator and he could you know cut his foot open and well if he sued me or something like
that the hospital bill would be far greater than that and I think that's a good thing to do and I
think that that sounds pretty clever and you know it Leo would give me pretty much any quarterback
would for his little kid now put this one on his power now the strength of the relatively
affectionate good cause I think that's pretty cool better than this pics and 마� mountain
can profit you though even though you know well I'm not saying there's anything more better than
this pier pocket for still also very helpfulooooo
and say a trash can along with a beer can.
Oh, yeah, but I was going to send him, take him to the recycling plant
so I could get the money for him.
That was another reason.
Well, you know, they went to all the trouble

Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make unto me...

no limit to lunacy. He arranged the suicide of most of his closest friends, had his mother
clubbed to death, and poisoned a lot of the people he knew, and sought out other similar amusements.
Well, I'm not amused, and I'm certain mankind wasn't either. Oh, but you're wrong. Look at the
merriment all about you. They don't look unamused to me.
Oh, is that good.

How can we tell
whether a Gospel
is the true Gospel or not?
Now we come to the next gift, diverse different kinds of tongues, the Old Testament.
And that, of course, is just not true.
That is not true at all.
We are running the risk of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.
In verse 22, or in verse, in verse, yes, in verse 22.
I haven't really made up my mind if one way or the other is acceptable or not.
We better trust the Bible and not the note in the margin.
With absolutely no biblical validation and with a total mistrust of what the Bible teaches.
And everything begins to feel very holy and I would see what I thought was the Lord Jesus
and he would begin to speak to me from the Bible.
What could that be?
We know this, that this happens through Ouija boards and tarot cards and haunted houses and that kind of thing.

known to the ancients,
is the application of hot irons to the,

And someone with hot irons on his back goes through accelerated motions.

Gee, I can't wait till that Bob time train comes around the bend.
Oh, look out, son. Here it comes now.
Shut up!
You two, get up.
To other people, it's a big joke.
We're back to people now, and the other half of the butt, son.
So, so much of history.
And it is a mystery to me.
I don't know what's going on in our community anymore.
We don't know.
All I know is that Bob said some mighty important things.
Most importantly, he said that I don't practice what I preach.
Because I'm not the kind of person I preach to.
You couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things.
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small.
He's simple and he's wise.
He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of larceny in his heart.
He seldom walks up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left a nickel there.

As far as this flesh is concerned, it doesn't matter whether we are slaves or free men.
We are to obey the masters over us.
We have no rights.
The Bible is quite clear with that.
We have no rights.
We are to honor them.
We have no choice.
This is God's word.
Like it or not.
Spiritually speaking, too, since the preceding three chapters in 1 Timothy have to do with elders,
qualification of elders and deacons, leaders, overseers in the church,
and how to rebuke them, how to work with them, how to be under them,
then spiritually speaking, we are also to honor those masters over us.
We are servants of God.
Spiritually speaking, we are to count our own masters worthy of honor, worthy of all honor,
so that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed.
Sometimes we need a big dose of it.
Some little thing will happen and we will suddenly become frantic.
We'll lose our heart and act in ways we never thought we would.
I know I've been there.
I have.
Sometimes we need a big, big dose of it to understand that we're dealing with it all the time, actually, though in a smaller degree.
Sometimes we need a big dose of the trembling, the tightness of one's stomach as it keeps working us over,
week in, week out, year in, year out.
Sometimes we need a big dose of it.
I told you the dopes are going to inherit the earth anyway.
I wonder, dear, if this Don Quixote hasn't got the jump on all of us.
I wonder if it isn't a curse to go through life, wised up like you and me.
Now look here, kid.
If you're going to wonder, let's go down and do it over a hump of steak, huh?
Come on, snap out of a drinker.
Here's to bigger and better dopes.
We're concerned Christians for Reagan.
Oh, Hunter!
You're the only one who can do it.
You're the only one who can do it.

Wake up, Fyler.
Here you go.
Get your mouth real close to the microphone.
Really close.
Now listen.
Oh, here's something.
The gods, by definition, are crazy.
Hmm.
That's what I say.
Here come the Bob-yons and the Lotrons.
Oh, here's something you've heard sometimes, just marked out with horizontal lines.
Let's look at the record.
Groovy, isn't it?
Your holy words didn't do much good, did they?
Oh, yes, they did.
New hope had come into a world where hope had been dead.
Mankind was reaching out for the light.
And all he found was darkness.
Darkness and Attila the Hun.
Attila swept across the known world, destroying everything that thousands of years of progress had achieved.
He burned in pillage, trampling cross and blade beneath his hordes of men.
Everything withered before him.
Death.
Faith.
Learning.
Medicine.
The arts and sciences of something he feared, for a long time he lived in.
Huromatito or the dark ages of that dark era, until nothing was left below him anymore
except misery, fire, and blood.
Idiots!
Idiots!

I'm Reverend Cleve, the best son of Blondfly, Dr. Rudy Ray Moore, and Mama Steve Dolomite.
I ain't the next, I know what's what.
Babe, I like the shape and size of contour of your butt.
So come on over here and give up the gas.
Whip some scum to me, babe.
Oh, give me all of your cash.
Return you wanted to worry about your soul.

Well, maybe it wasn't always fun.
But he developed something else, too.
Because one day, after hundreds of years of lawlessness,
he brought back the basic principles of law
at Runnymede.
Indeed, in England, when the barons forced King John
to sign the Magna Carta,
the provisions of which were to become the cornerstone
of law, order, and civil liberty.
Triumph of blithering idiocy,
coupled with a criminal cruelty
even I couldn't have surpassed.
Human rights, eh?
Noble sirs, may we look at what mankind did to that young woman.
God is with us.

Trouble, I'm getting out!
And out of the same chaos came the breathtaking architecture of the Lombardos,
the dazzling art of Titian and Michelangelo,
and the free thought of the individual, as so beautifully expressed by Tilesio, Machiavelli and Campanella.
Is it to mankind's credit that he enshrines this alleged genius who envisioned atomic destruction?
Can my colleague answer that?
Furthermore, can you deny the great influence that such daring dreamers exerted on...
on venturesome people like... like Christopher Columbus?
Boom! No more ship.
Columbus showed the way, and mankind followed.
I concede the point.
But to what?
To what end?
Murder? Pillage? Rape?
Does my noble colleague remember what happened within thirty years
after Columbus showed benevolent mankind the way to the New World?
Have you too quickly forgotten the slaughter of the Aztecs by Cortes?
This violent pattern set by the bloodthirsty Cortes, all in all,
turned out to be one of my better jobs.
The slaughter of the New World was endless.
But delightful.
They begin creeping up on you.
Trying to sell you something.
They get long claws.
And they get a stranglehold on you.
And you squirm and you duck and you holler and you try to push them away but you haven't got a chance.
They gut you.
First thing you know, you own things.
A car, for instance.
Now your whole life is messed up with a lot more stuff.
You get license fees.

And oil.
And taxes.

And bills.
And flat tires.
And dents.
And traffic tickets.
And motorcycle cops.
And courtrooms.
And lawyers.
And fines.
And a million and one other things.
And what happens?
You're not the free and happy guy you used to be.
You gotta have money to pay for all those things.
So you go after what the other fellas got.
And there you are.
You're a helot yourself.
You win, Colonel.
Here, take the fifty.
Go out and get rid of it.
You bet I will.
Just as fast as I can.
I'm gonna get some canned goods, a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
Give away?
Hey, get me a pitcher's glove.
I gotta get some practice.
Say, he's giving it away.
I'm gonna get me some of that.
Hey, come back here, you helot.
Is that you going through the muskrat?
Now, why in the world would I be going through that?
You're a muskrat.

What if Bob came to the door right now and rang the doorbell,
and you opened the door and Bob himself was standing there with his pipe hanging out of his mouth?
You wouldn't let him in?
If he was shivering out there in the cold?
If Bob came to hand you a check for a million dollars, would you let him in?
No.
Why?
Because I hate him.
I hate him.
I hate him.
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

Mr. Rogers, what are you going to talk about today?
Mr. Rogers, what's hanging out of you?
Oh, forget it.
I'm not supposed to talk about that on TV.
Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers, that's your wife, Tracy.
You're putting down on Mr. Rogers.
No, no, no.

Madam, I must make my meaning clear.
Peace or war?
Yes! That's it!
The only way to control you is to put the brain of this chicken in your head!
I have just received word that the warring armies have moved against each other on the planet Earth.
And in accordance with the destiny of time, the great Super H-bomb will explode at exactly 11 o'clock.
I direct your attention to the great clock of outer space.
When the clock strikes 11, the bomb will go off and bring an end to mankind.
Unless, as such decisions are entrusted to us,
we decide that...
the bomb shall not go off,
and that mankind shall survive.
Therefore, speak quickly, Mr. Scratch, and make your summations brief.
For we must make a decision before the clock strikes 11.
Speak, Mr. Scratch.
My distinguished colleague rests his entire case on the so-called man of tomorrow.
By inference, he almost acknowledges that mankind deserves no better end,
than annihilation by the Super H-bomb.
And yet, weak and sentimental, as is all mankind,
he introduces a sentimental trick,
and hopes to gain the mercy of the court by introducing a pathetic last witness, a child.
I accept the challenge, and I shall use as my final summation the very witness brought here by man.
I call your attention to the witness, innocently playing with his toys.
This is mankind's bright hope of tomorrow.
The hope of peace and virtue.
Have you seen the toys with which the child plays?
A toy gun and a toy sword.
Who cares?
Show the child the Brady Binken interact.
You have all you need is patience, patience, and Ingles's smile.
The ball will come in the right direction if you throw it.

Take heed and listen well.
The time runs swiftly.
The fate of man is now laid at the doorstep of man himself.
By the villains you encourage.
By the heroes you create.
You shall soon achieve eternal life or oblivion.
Therefore, it is the decision of the High Tribunal of Outer Space.
This court shall soon convene again.
To determine finally whether mankind shall continue or be destroyed by the Super H-bomb.
This choice is entirely yours.
It is entirely up to you.
