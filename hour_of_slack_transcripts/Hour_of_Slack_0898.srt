1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Usually radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,820
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,080
In the radio studios of Bob, the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators, the administrative personnel,

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,400
daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:23,740
Ah!

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,180
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions, political speeches, and comedy.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,900
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

8
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,780
Questions of the day are discussed and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,880
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,220
This is independent radio in a democracy.

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,960
Hour of Swag.

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Ah!

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,160
Ah!

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,120
Bob?

15
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,840
Bob?

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,500
Bob?

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,300
Bob?

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,300


19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,740
Your society is secretly affiliated with Bob.

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,120
That is too ridiculous to brand as a lie.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,920
Then you wouldn't know a man named Bob.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,500
I have never heard of him.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,500
You won't get away with this, Flatfoot. I'm a law-abiding citizen.

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,700
Get that? He's a law-abiding citizen.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,260
Are you, Ratzler?

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,420
Bob?

27
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,040
I'd strip him.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,100
I don't need dough that bad.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,980
Bob?

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,800
When a man has lived like Bob for so long, he's not like ordinary men.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,780
He acts differently and he thinks differently.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,700
What do you mean?

33
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:14,520
I mean that when a man has lived like Bob for so long, he's like ordinary men.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,880
Especially when you really know him.

35
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:52,860
I mean that when a man has lived like Bob for so long, he's like ordinary men.

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,960
Well, there's a big light shining in the coconut grove where Satan used to watch the Barney Miller show.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,520
Syndicated television puts him in the mood, hoping a pagoda just might get nude.

38
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,780
Satan gets an erection staring at a pagoda's butt.

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,980
Meat and poultry by the pack, extra servings bring them back.

40
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,320
Ain't no need to raise a fuss, just yodel your way to that flaky crust.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,760
Say wait a minute, I want to be good!

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,640
That Catherine Neville fight was à la 해 ,

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,020
that проц lead to this hell.

44
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,000
It was all an act of wussing.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,940
She is devilish.

46
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,640
She's being a tv genuine.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,360
Saint is just as crazy.

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,140
She is dinner, I am pretty cold.

49
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:52,860
She is hot Women.

50
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,160
Sammy Davis Jr. used to worship Satan

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,300
When he wasn't taking drugs

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,480
Staring in the mirror while his eyeball twitched around

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,060
Let's watch Sammy's eyeball twitch!

54
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's watch Sammy's eyeball twitch!

55
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,020
The Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friends, yodeling Satan

56
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,300
And we've been surrounded this show by some collages by Fernanda Nandeli-Murr

57
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,360
And a lot more of those coming up, also some by Artemia Salina

58
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,740
In fact, friends, I was trapped at the radio station

59
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
Chaz couldn't do his show

60
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,860
And I was stuck there myself to do a remix of collages by Artemia Salina

61
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,380
Puzzling Evidence, Reverend Charto, New Monet, me, Reverend Cobblestone

62
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,840
And I was trapped at the radio station

63
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,020
And The Bishop, who also did our very opening collage

64
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,680
All of this stuff mixed together by DJ Stang with some background music

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,820
I think some of it is from the Matrix soundtrack

66
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:40,680
But now, but now, my friends, some more Fernanda Nandeli-Murr

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,720
It's gone!

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
Come on, Noah!

69
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,900
Pastor, could you touch upon a little bit, uh, what's it mean to twist my own mind?

70
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,620
They can become to be a family man

71
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,720
They need to know that Jesus can do these things

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
And the results are thicker greener lawns

73
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,340
Hello?

74
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,340


75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,980
Bob, I want to talk to you on a trick

76
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,540
Oh, Bob, you've got to listen to me

77
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,720
a trick. Whatever it is, it's a trick. Oh Bob, you've got to listen to me. It is a

78
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,720
trick. A flying saucer? Whatever it is, it's no use. So run along. I just wondered

79
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,160
if you were going to be busy at two o'clock. Shut up.

80
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,620
Yes? Shut up. Hello? Bob, I want to talk to you. Okay. Oh Bob, you look like a petty

81
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,640
thief. Oh shut up. Is it his fault that he has no education? Yes. Yes? Oh yes. Shut up.

82
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,300
Okay, anything you say. No, no he won't. It was either shut up or what? So what? What's

83
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,860
up? Get a load of that. Oh I'm sorry Bob. I spanked her. Yeah, thanks. Look at Fanny.

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Okay. I know. Naughty naughty. Remember Fanny? We saw what appeared to be a flying saucer.

85
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Well, so what? Bob. What?

86
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,580
Yes, but how'd you get all those bandages?

87
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,520
These ethnic people, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. But many kids in the 1950s

88
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,140
and 1960s laugh at the cultures.

89
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,280
This is where the mating takes place. And people in these kinds of situations have very

90
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,540
unrealistic expectations. It's a tingling sensation.

91
00:07:50,060 --> 00:08:00,740
Uh, yes. It's so rare that I end up engineering here in the beautiful live studios. People

92
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,080
think, you know, that old Reverend Stang is always ensconced up in his ivory tower with

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,100
my hot looking client wife and my endless supply of Malaysian frog sticks. But you know,

94
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,340
I don't, it's, uh, trying to do this show, this church, this X day, this world, this

95
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:28,600
reality, this life is like, well, you know those cartoons where there's a river full

96
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,840
of just cut logs floating from the tree farm down the river to the lumber factory. And

97
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,320
there's all these lumberjack guys leaping nimbly from rotating slippery log to log,

98
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,080
nudging the logs around with their long hooked poles. And usually there's some hapless cartoonist,

99
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,080


100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,440
a cartoon character desperately trying to navigate the, the logs to get across the river

101
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,940
to escape some foe. Well, I'm like that guy skipping from a treacherous log to treacherous

102
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,480
log across the river as they speed downstream friends. Only I'm not carrying one of those

103
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,680
hooked poles. I'm juggling razor sharp, scimitars and fired up chainsaws three of each. And

104
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,540
while I'm juggling those and leaping from log to log before they spin out from under

105
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,840
my foot and it capsized me.

106
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,060
I've also got this seven foot long pole balancing between the logs and the tree farm. I'm just

107
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,060


108
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,060


109
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,320
balanced on the end of my nose.

110
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,780
And at the very top of the pole,

111
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,800
I've got balanced a big stack

112
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,600
of the fanciest Chinaware plates imaginable,

113
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,820
all decorated with gorgeous hand-painted

114
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,980
floral patterns and Dobbs heads.

115
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,520
And there's a bad, nasty monkey

116
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,600
sitting on top of the plates.

117
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,180
And there's an itch right between my shoulder blades

118
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,580
that just won't go away.

119
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,760
And my nose is running.

120
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,780
And I'm about to sneeze.

121
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,720
I have to sneeze.

122
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,420
My pipe's in my pocket with a fresh plug in it,

123
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,960
but my lighter is in the other pocket.

124
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,420
But it beats working, friends.

125
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,660
And what's really sick is that I kind of like it that way.

126
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,160
But, but, but, every now and then, friends, we escape.

127
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,600
Yes, we get away from it all,

128
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,500
and we just got back from extinction.

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,700
X-Day, X-Day drill in Sherman, New York.

130
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,360
Sorry to say, we got back.

131
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,320
We're still on Earth.

132
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm sorry, I'm sorry that Bob let us down again.

133
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,900
Our guru, Bob, who prophesied that the world would end

134
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,480
July 5th, 1998.

135
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,220
We were kind of hoping that maybe this time

136
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,680
it would actually be 1998.

137
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,600
But just between you and me,

138
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,920
I really thought it probably wouldn't happen.

139
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,220
I mean, it's been like how many,

140
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,180
how many,

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,600
prophesied ends of the world.

142
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,380
And it's just like X-Day number six.

143
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,340
This was the eighth drill I've been to.

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,060
But friends, you know, when the world is about to end,

145
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,100
or when you think the world is about to end,

146
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,240
you'll do stuff you wouldn't normally do.

147
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,600
And such as putting yourself up on the slave block

148
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,500
at the subgenius church flesh auction,

149
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,860
where these rather over-eager ministers and flock

150
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
and shenanigans,

151
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,620
you know, those who are about to be shorn,

152
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,680
the easily fleeced and those shepherds of them,

153
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,940
all whore themselves, basically.

154
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,640
But I guess it's for a good cause.

155
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,760
It's to raise money for a guy who's already rich.

156
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

157
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,040
A guy that we've never seen.

158
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,320
A guy nobody ever sees.

159
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,680
But that makes them more important, you know,

160
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,740
when they're mysterious like that.

161
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,580
You'll follow them just about any.

162
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,560
The more mysterious, the better, I guess.

163
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
Look at the success of most of our politicians.

164
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,740
They're not even real, as far as you know.

165
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,780
It was a worthy...

166
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,500
Well, you know, it's going to be another year, I guess.

167
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,840
You know, when the baptism pool doesn't overflow,

168
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,960
that means it's going to be another year of bill paying

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,100
and hell and so forth.

170
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,600
But...

171
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
But what the heck.

172
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,940
And friends, as I may have not mentioned earlier,

173
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,780
Professor Chaz Smith, who normally does this show,

174
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,220
ain't.

175
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,460
He had to go back to that marvelous place, Brushwood,

176
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,900
where we hold the subgenius mind control experiment

177
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,780
and rupture preparation training course.

178
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,420
Oh, yes.

179
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,160
Yes, there was slack.

180
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,460
There were some fantabulous bands there,

181
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,040
such as the Amino Acids.

182
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,460
I'll be playing some of that.

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,060
It's like...

184
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,820
Thrash surf music.

185
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,020
We'll put some of that on coming up.

186
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,600
But I should also mention that other events in July

187
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,280
that we should all be celebrating

188
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,020
include these birthdays of these subgenius saints,

189
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,020
St. Arthur C. Clarke,

190
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,380
St. Mojo Nixon,

191
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,780
St. Mel Blank, his birthday was today,

192
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,540
Pancho Villa, tomorrow,

193
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,240
Pam Greer,

194
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,320
Humphrey Bogart,

195
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,140
Caligula, St. Caligula.

196
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,260
Oh, and on the 16th,

197
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,680
we celebrate the display of the embarrassing swimsuits.

198
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,700
Yes.

199
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,620
Dr. Doom's birthday and St. Thulsa Doom.

200
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,620
Pope John XII and Benjamin Franklin,

201
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
the great Benjamin Franklin.

202
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,640
Alan Moore, St. Alan Moore is born in...

203
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,820
He wrote those newer Batman,

204
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,580
The Dark Knight Returns.

205
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,380
and so forth.

206
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,420
No, no, I'm thinking the wrong guy.

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm thinking of the guy who wrote

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,420
The Watchman for Vendetta.

209
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,580
Groucho Marx, Stanley Kubrick,

210
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,260
Shylock, Marty Feldman,

211
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,460
Brigham Young,

212
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,440
Dr. Demento, and Bill Gates.

213
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:05,060
All born of man sometime in this July century.

214
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,260
But you know, friends,

215
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
there are other things born, not of man.

216
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,460
Nay, not of man.

217
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,220
Nor beast.

218
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,880
Nor woman beast.

219
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,960
But tonight we will honor those precious subgeni and yeti.

220
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,860
Those are brothers and warriors.

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,100
Our slaves and minions.

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,280
Our Coneyites, our children.

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,640
We will remember those that have been lost in the woods

224
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,080
and we will give thanks for those who have been found

225
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,160
and who stand here beside us.

226
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,760
A shalud lahaylahaylahbab, my friends.

227
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,020
as Bob Dobbs said,

228
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
I cannot lie.

229
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,040
But,

230
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,780
I promise that I will.

231
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,400
Oh my gosh.

232
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,620
What else I've gotta find it.

233
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,760
Arrrrgghh!

234
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,900
Mr. G. яр ballios lol

235
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,500
I gotta have some slack.

236
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,540
You are about to undergo long-wave radiation.

237
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,140
A buzzer will sound.

238
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Close your eyes

239
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,020
and stand still or blindness may result.

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,640
Lay your hands on the radio.

241
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,860
Lay your hands on the radio there in the home

242
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,280
and we're going to look to God.

243
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,440
I and only I will decide when and how much we eat.

244
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,240
Any argument about that, I settle it with this.

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,940
You're a tough man, all right, packing that gun.

246
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,800
Just don't let go of it.

247
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,260
I don't intend to.

248
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,940
I am not in time to brainwash you, so listen carefully.

249
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,880
That thing was created to live in a poisoned world.

250
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,720
The rain came and it was pure.

251
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,680
Man created it, but God destroyed it.

252
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,540
He brought the rain and fresh air.

253
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,380
If he couldn't live, then neither could the others of his kind.

254
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,040
There was a voice on the radio while you were gone.

255
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,720
There are others out there.

256
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,080
Now hear this.

257
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:35,520
Now hear this.

258
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,120
Electromagnetic stun gun.

259
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,360
Oh, hell yes, you would.

260
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,040
Fantastic things have already happened

261
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,060
and more are getting ready to happen.

262
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,700
This is because the planet on which you're residing

263
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,040
has entered the space age.

264
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,860
You are a most unusual individual

265
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,920
and decidedly in the minority.

266
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
Oh, another victim of confusion?

267
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
Decidedly.

268
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,400
Once upon a time, in a famous story,

269
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,880
a girl named Alice got very curious

270
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,180
about a little white rabbit who passed by.

271
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
She followed Alice.

272
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,260
She was very excited and soon found herself falling

273
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,160
down a very deep hole into a strange place called Wonderland.

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,600
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through

275
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,680
expensive diapers.

276
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,060
And our streaming data page enables you to size up body parts.

277
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,280
I'm going to bypass your forebrain

278
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
and appeal directly to your amygdala.

279
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,260
Sonia, what is it?

280
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, I got a shock.

281
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,220
How?

282
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,440
Touching that.

283
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,320
Ouch!

284
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,520
That must be over 200 volts.

285
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,000
It lives on contaminated flesh.

286
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,940
It thrives on contaminated air.

287
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Things that kill men nourish it.

288
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,640
Things that kill men nourish it.

289
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,000
Good morning.

290
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,860
And yes, you've won a fabulous eight-hour day chained to this machine.

291
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,420
First of man's vital communications to suffer were the shipping lanes and airways.

292
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,580
Then transport by rail and highway ground to a halt.

293
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,580
When the telephone and telegraph systems had failed

294
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,080
and the radio networks were forced to bear the burden alone,

295
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,880
they too succumbed to interference known to originate

296
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,760
in an increasing disturbance in the sun.

297
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,880
The world, crippled by these events,

298
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,440
waited for the first sign of an invasion from outer space.

299
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, don't cry.

300
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,100
Okay, great.

301
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,160
Don't cry.

302
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,500
Ah!

303
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,740
Let there be slack.

304
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,860
Where's it at, Bob?

305
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,680
Well, Bob, another lie.

306
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,660
Where is it, Bob?

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,320
Well, another lie.

308
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,060
Well, another lie.

309
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,940
Liar!

310
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,580
Well, Bob.

311
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,080
Well, another lie.

312
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,840
Well, Bob.

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Bob.

314
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,540
Bob.

315
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,720
Mama's Pride Human Breast Milk.

316
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,300
Baby yourself with Mama's Pride.

317
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,840
Ah, disgusting.

318
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,980
Disgusting.

319
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,340
Disgusting.

320
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,080
It'll be coming down to clouds.

321
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,180
Clouds saturated with nuclear death.

322
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,420
Behind The Tprint

323
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,000
we לא

324
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,500
Peopler

325
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,400
ığ

326
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,680
I see no reason for violence.

327
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,700
If, however, you are confronted, you may resort to the use of hypnosis.

328
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,100
This is civilization's jungle.

329
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,460
After the jackals of society have ruthlessly ravaged it, ending the world of decency.

330
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,100
Amazing. Magic. Perfectly. Cleverly. Completely different. Great. Finally. Ideal. Faster. Easier. It's great.

331
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,660
Amazing. Only. But wait. Amazing. Folding. Free. Free. Absolutely free.

332
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,060
All I want is to be a turtle slacker when I grow up.

333
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,960
All I want is to be a turtle slacker when I grow up.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,220
I haven't had time for your kind of woman.

335
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,160
Don't touch me. I can't stand you.

336
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:58,940
But all you're remembering is merely a series of sensory impulses which you now realize have no real definite connection with outside reality.

337
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,640
True. But since this is so, I have no proof that you're...

338
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,620
You're really telling me all this.

339
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,100
This all-time radio program was originally aired live, long before the advent of high fidelity.

340
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:21,100
As a result, you may detect an occasional surface noise or volume drop due to transmission problems so common to old radio.

341
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,860
We hope, however, that any variance in audio quality will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this, one of the all-time favorite shows.

342
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,960
From beyond the dead.

343
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,700
And beneath the living.

344
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,080
From the depths of hell's ocean.

345
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,020
Everything they touch will die in the deep.

346
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,260
Good day to you. God bless you. Welcome to the Shepherd's Chapel.

347
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,600
Hey, welcome to another family Bible study.

348
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,800
I'll pray to God this book of Acts.

349
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,760
The Acts of the Apostles.

350
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,780
Us being the sent fourth one.

351
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,520
The ones God himself all told and sent.

352
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,540
Still happen.

353
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,480
As I stated in the last lecture, he may just soon be through.

354
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,580
We could...

355
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,380
Hold it, hold it, hold it now.

356
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,000
Now this is government business.

357
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,040
And if you stay, you're interfering with government property.

358
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,980
So you better just go on home.

359
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh!

360
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:28,080
We were trying to say we might all become like Radek.

361
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,180
Stalking the woods at night.

362
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,440
Eating raw meat.

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:32,720
And...

364
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,020
It's possible.

365
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,680
What can we do, Rick?

366
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,160
My brother believed the Bible gave strength and revealed a plan for everything.

367
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,660
And I hope I find it before I lose my mind.

368
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,340
Oh!

369
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,220
Oh!

370
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:56,740
Oh!

371
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,180
Oh!

372
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,820
Oh!

373
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,840
Oh!

374
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:58,980
Oh!

375
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,380
Oh!

376
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,560
Oh!

377
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,060
Oh!

378
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,100


379
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,380


380
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,040


381
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,040


382
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,040


383
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,760
Oh!

384
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,440
Oh!

385
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,440


386
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,440


387
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,540
Oh!

388
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


389
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


390
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


391
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,540


392
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,600
Oh!

393
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


394
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


395
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


396
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


397
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


398
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:02,600


399
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:02,780
Oh!

400
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,020
Oh!

401
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,560
Oh!

402
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,180
Oh!

403
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,380
Oh!

404
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,460
Oh!

405
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,720
Oh!

406
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:05,900
Oh!

407
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,080
Oh!

408
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,120
Oh!

409
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


410
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


411
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


412
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


413
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


414
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


415
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


416
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


417
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


418
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


419
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


420
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


421
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


422
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


423
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


424
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


425
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,120


426
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,620
As long as the wind blows and the rains don't come too soon, we may live.

427
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,020
That is, if we're not destroyed by other forces.

428
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,600
What other forces?

429
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,920
Never mind that now.

430
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,940
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

431
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,380
What's his name?

432
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,380
Bob.

433
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,800
Bob.

434
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Ain't that a bitch?

435
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,140
Let's build a spaceship out of spare parts.

436
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,340
We can fly back.

437
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,420
I'm sure we can put it together. There's enough of the ship left.

438
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,360
You made a show out of broken parts.

439
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,080
It's stuck together with ice cream and yogurt.

440
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Yeah, Paul, get started. We can draw a windshield.

441
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,860
We can use the stereo.

442
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,840
Yeah, there's enough wire in there.

443
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,460
Make a magneto. That'll give us directional.

444
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,540
Come on, Gary, you start painting the game.

445
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,260
Okay, we can use these old bicycle tires for the power drives.

446
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,680
And there's this old navy brow. We can make that for the wings.

447
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,300
We'll get back to the station.

448
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,080
Nelson will be so happy to see us.

449
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,040
Yeah, he thought he missed us, but we're here on this little tape.

450
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
We'll fly back on this tape.

451
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,240
Yeah, this program's his baby.

452
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,240
We'll save you, Bob. Just keep talking.

453
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,060
Well, come on, Paul. Help me pull the stereo in here.

454
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,940
Just play sound effects.

455
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,700
Here, take this guitar neck and nail it up there.

456
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,600
I can make a microphone out of these old stupid wires.

457
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,060
I feel seriously ill. There must be some terrible mistake.

458
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Stop! They're calling me.

459
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,960
Wait, wait, wait. What's going on with Hal?

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,040
No! No!

461
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,280
No! No!

462
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Not him! Not him!

463
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:28,860
Not him!

464
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

465
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,040
How old? They wouldn't give me any.

466
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
Are there more of you up there?

467
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,800
Stronger than me. Much stronger.

468
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,860
How many more?

469
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,720
Not many, but strong. Food.

470
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:17,300
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

471
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:25,100
In a world where change is the rule, we rely on the unyielding constants in life for comfort and safety.

472
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,300
That the sun will rise, that the earth will turn.

473
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,380
But what if we could no longer be certain of anything?

474
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,700
To what then would we cling?

475
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,840
Now birds fly.

476
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
And babies cry.

477
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,420
But you and I.

478
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,380
Well, me oh my.

479
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,880
We do the Bob Dobbs.

480
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,100
The Bob Dobbs.

481
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,440
The Bob Dobbs.

482
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,220
The Bob Dobbs.

483
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,740
The Bob Dobbs.

484
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:50,980
The Bob Dobbs.

485
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,580
The Bob Dobbs.

486
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,700
The coolest plants in town.

487
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,080
You get down to the top of the mountain.

488
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,080


489
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,080


490
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,660
You get down low, move your feet kind of slow.

491
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
You do a hop hop.

492
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,180
Hold your arms out straight.

493
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,400
Keep the feet, don't wait.

494
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,440
You do a hop hop.

495
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,920
Move your fingers up and down.

496
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,980
Flap your wings and turn around.

497
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,120
You do a hop hop.

498
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,980
That's the Bob.

499
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,800
The coolest plants in town.

500
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,440
Now birds fly.

501
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,660
And babies cry.

502
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,900
But you and I.

503
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, me oh my.

504
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,300
We do the Bob Dobbs.

505
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,080
The Bob Dobbs.

506
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
The Bob Dobbs.

507
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,740
The Bob Dobbs.

508
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,060
The Bob Dobbs.

509
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,560
The Bob Dobbs.

510
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,240
The coolest plants in town.

511
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,240
Take your partner by the hand.

512
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,480
People understand you.

513
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,380
You do a hop hop.

514
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,860
Learn to cut a rhythm rock.

515
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Like a bopping jitterbug.

516
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,060
You do a hop hop.

517
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,620
If you dig this bopping.

518
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,820
There ain't no stoppin'.

519
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,800
to a hop-hop.

520
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,640
That's a bop.

521
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,340
The coolest dance of time.

522
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,000
Now birds fly.

523
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,220
And babies cry.

524
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,440
But you and I.

525
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,560
Well, me on my.

526
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,840
The bop-dop.

527
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,740
The bop-dop.

528
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,500
The bop-dop.

529
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,260
The bop-dop.

530
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,920
The bop-dop.

531
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,660
The coolest dance of time.

532
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,660
The bop-dop.

533
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,580
The bop-dop.

534
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,400
The bop-dop.

535
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,240
The bop-dop.

536
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,000
The bop-dop.

537
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,860
The coolest dance of time.

538
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:53,080
The bop-dops by the Collins Kids run through the brain and equipment of media sapiens.

539
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,600
And now,

540
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,600
Captain,

541
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,660
Beefheart.

542
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,280
Master,

543
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:57,660
Master,

544
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,460
this is recorded through a fly here.

545
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,100
And you have to have a fly eye to see it.

546
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,280
It's a thing that's gonna make Captain Beefheart and his magic band fat.

547
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,840
Frank,

548
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,560
it's the big hit.

549
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,820
It's the blimp.

550
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,660
It's the blimp.

551
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:09,960
Frank,

552
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,980
it's the blimp.

553
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,520
When I see you floating down the gutter,

554
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,900
I'll give you a bottle of wine.

555
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,820
Put me on the white hook.

556
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,100
Back in the fat rack.

557
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,880
Shad rack.

558
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,600
Shad.

559
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,900
The something hoop.

560
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,900
The something hoop.

561
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,680
The blimp.

562
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,380
The blimp.

563
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
The crazy hoop.

564
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,900
The crazy hoop.

565
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,960
Their tail.

566
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,740
Their cam.

567
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,320
Hit.

568
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:28,640
Hit.

569
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,680
The blimp.

570
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,300
The blimp.

571
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,800
The mothership.

572
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
The mothership.

573
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,100
The brothers head under their hood.

574
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
From the blimp.

575
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,980
The blimp.

576
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,740
Children, stop your nursing.

577
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,480
Unless you're enjoying fun.

578
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,040
The mothership.

579
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,580
The mothership's the one.

580
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,220
The blimp.

581
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,000
The blimp.

582
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,620
The cape's a trip.

583
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,840
It's a trailer tail.

584
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,740
It's traipsing along behind the blimp.

585
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,380
The blimp.

586
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,220
The nose has a crimp.

587
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,800
The nose has a crimp.

588
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,660
The nose has a crimp.

589
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,480
The blimp.

590
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:56,700
The blimp.

591
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,940
It blows the air.

592
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,300
The suit isn't fair.

593
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Look up in the sky.

594
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,700
There's a dirt in the air.

595
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,380
The crazy hoops.

596
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,600
Where?

597
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,200
You can see them just as they were.

598
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,580
All the people stared.

599
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
And the girls knees trembled.

600
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
And ran and waved their hands.

601
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,200
And ran their hands over the blimp.

602
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,900
The blimp.

603
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,700
Daughter, don't you dare.

604
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh, mama, who cares?

605
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,200
It's the blimp.

606
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,140
It's the blimp.

607
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,780
Daughter, don't you dare.

608
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


609
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


610
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


611
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


612
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


613
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


614
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:24,780


615
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,800
The blimp.

616
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,000
The blimp.

617
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,780
The blimp.

618
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,060
Daughter.

619
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,060


620
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,060
In this scene, the mother herself leads into the subject of

621
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,540
with her daughter, who might be 10 or 11, perhaps older.

622
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The obvious reason is to make sure that a girl knows both the

623
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,180
natural and the spiritual significance of the blimp.

624
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,020
Parents are the best judges of the proper time

625
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,400
and place for such instruction.

626
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,900
But a good rule to follow here is,

627
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,420
is better a year too early than one week too late.

628
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

629
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

630
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,120
So last night I went to sleep and dreamed that I had died.

631
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,340
My weary body felt at ease and to myself I cried.

632
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,800
Look at the flowers, they're certainly sweet.

633
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,840
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

634
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,280
And look at the people all lining the street.

635
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,240
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

636
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,220
There's a lot of consolation riding peacefully.

637
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,720
Past the guy that stole my wife, I know he envies me.

638
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,100
And look at the horses, oh boy what a treat.

639
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,140
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

640
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,840
Look at the mourners, oh don't they look grand.

641
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,020
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

642
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,280
That's elegant music that's played by the band.

643
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,420
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

644
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,640
There's the butcher and the baker standing in their doors.

645
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,700
I won't have to worry how to dodge them anymore.

646
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,140
And look at the landlord just shaking his head.

647
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,320
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

648
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,980
Look at my sweetheart, she's classy and red.

649
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,400
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

650
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,900
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

651
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,160
And look at her boyfriend, that big empty head.

652
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,260
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

653
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,440
There's the boss I used to have, I see his ingrown face.

654
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,580
Gee, I'm glad he's worried, cause no one can take my place.

655
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,780
And look at the chislers, they're going to starve.

656
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,840
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

657
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,400
Look at the neighbors, they keep blabbering on.

658
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,480
That's why it's swell to be laying out dead.

659
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,000
And look at the kinfolks, they'll starve when I'm gone.

660
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,860
It sure is swell to be laying out dead.

661
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,000
I won't have to worry about a job or food to eat.

662
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,160
I won't have to worry whether shoes are on my feet.

663
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,900
And look at the poor folks.

664
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,440
That's begging for bread.

665
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,440
Oh boy, it's swell to be laying out dead.

666
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,840
Laying Out Dead by Alex Bartha's Hotel Orchestra.

667
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,040
You'll find nuts all over the landscape.

668
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,680
People presume that those that hold conspiracy theories are some kind of wacko nuts.

669
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,000
Now it intrigues me that in fact, wacko nuts.

670
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,220
The World Federation headquartered in Amsterdam.

671
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,920
As is the Alice Bailey's group and so on.

672
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,880
Lots of exhibits about how we abuse the Indians.

673
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,780
Wacko nuts.

674
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,320
And there's exhibits of the China of the first ladies through several of the old administrations.

675
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,800
And it goes on like this.

676
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm not going to get all of these in a two part series in our newsletter so you can check these out.

677
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm not going to get all of these in a two part series in our newsletter so you can check these out.

678
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,540
I think George Bush needs to wear a monocle and a dueling scarf.

679
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,620
He really wants to get the kind of impact he wants to make on the public.

680
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,980
And a riding crop.

681
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,680
And a riding crop under one arm.

682
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,780
And the jodhpurs.

683
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,920
Yes, which click together whenever there's excitement.

684
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
And a little less.

685
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,060
The pounding.

686
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
The clacking of jackboots down the streets.

687
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:21,860
Yeah.

688
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,920
Clack, clack, clack, clack.

689
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,140
And there will be jackboots clacking in Eskimo land.

690
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,500
Now Dave, if you really believed that you wouldn't be saying it.

691
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,660
How could I not believe it?

692
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
How could I not believe it?

693
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:38,620
But if you really, really believed it, you would not risk getting thrown into the concentration camps by blithering about it.

694
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,120
I'd be swimming to Canada now that the ice has melted.

695
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:41,820
Right.

696
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,740
Well, I'm just, I'm questioning your dedication to the movement, Dave.

697
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,220
How dedicated to the revolution are you if you haven't swum to Canada yet?

698
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,980
1969, man, things were real bad in the inner city.

699
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,000
A lot of people had taken it down.

700
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
A lot of people were going down for the big count.

701
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,860
I remember the time when the cops came first, the SWAT teams, and then the National Guard, man.

702
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,260
Man, yeah.

703
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,480
They started banging and saying, the pigs were at the door, man.

704
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,500
The pigs were at the door.

705
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,040
We looked out the window and it was, yeah.

706
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,020
And you were like, Dave's not here.

707
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,180
Dave's not here.

708
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,940
Real pigs were at the door, man.

709
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,400
Real pigs.

710
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,260
Those morrow pig men.

711
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,960
Wearing those motorcycle helmets.

712
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,600
Those jack boots on their hooves, man.

713
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,340
Man, those were the days.

714
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,620
It was really scary.

715
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
We were all strung out with the symbionese, man.

716
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,820
We were hanging a thing, you know, and the next thing you know, they were, the pigs were all over us.

717
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,160
Tommy took off from Mexico and Billy went to Canada.

718
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,920
Larry just went underground.

719
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
Just waiting, man.

720
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,320
Said the wind was gonna change, you know.

721
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,520
Things were gonna blow a different way.

722
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,700
You know, you don't need a weatherman to know which way.

723
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,940
But then it never did, did it?

724
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:54,940


725
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:54,940


726
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,060
25 years later, in Langley, Virginia.

727
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,640
Boy, that's some of the best Carson-Osama side I've ever smoked, man.

728
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,640
You think it'll really do the job when it comes time to tear the towers down?

729
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,320
Yeah, man. Yeah, man.

730
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,140
And draw them into blissful conjunction.

731
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,940
Go join the team.

732
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,660
Go join.

733
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,300
Go join.

734
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,140
Go join.

735
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,960
Go ahead.

736
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,200
Do it, man.

737
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,400
I thought we'd all be dead by now.

738
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,660
Yeah, so did I.

739
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,460
Even Raddick got out of bed today.

740
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,740
All the more reason to keep going, friends.

741
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,740
Logically, he should have been dead by now.

742
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,740
Sure, so should you.

743
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,500
So should we all.

744
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,640
Dead. Dead.

745
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,180
But yet here we are.

746
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,880
I guess maybe we didn't know

747
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,700
everything, huh?

748
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,480
Maybe we didn't all know

749
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,500
just exactly what was gonna happen.

750
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,880
Maybe, maybe, maybe

751
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,000
the less you know,

752
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,820
the more sure you are

753
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,960
of what you do know.

754
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,680
And contrary

755
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,560
lies,

756
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,620
the more you know,

757
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,760
the less sure you are of any of it.

758
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
Belief is gone,

759
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,220
my friends, but as J.R. Bob-Dob

760
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,500
said,

761
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,480
believe me out of it.

762
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,300
We'll stick with the contradictions

763
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,760
that make good sense, thank you very much.

764
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,920
Now, my friend,

765
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,000
I personally never believed

766
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,960
the comforting

767
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
post-modernist

768
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,420
mumbo-jumbo,

769
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,060
for I am a

770
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,860
post-mumbo-jumbo-nist.

771
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,980
Screw the new age,

772
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,300
I say.

773
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,280
No blood for snake oil, I say.

774
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,860
Kids, leave world domination

775
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,340
to the frappessionals.

776
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,080
Glueing feathers to your butt

777
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,840
does not make you a rooster.

778
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,540
Now, some

779
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,460
aren't ready for death,

780
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,200
but some

781
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
are eager, eager.

782
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,640
Oh, some say, oh, death is great,

783
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,680
it's crossing over, it's a wonderful

784
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,720
new way to go

785
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
to the other side, although I noticed

786
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,800
that none of the people who said so

787
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,260
had actually tried it yet.

788
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,740
Those who finally did try it suddenly became

789
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,620
very quiet about it.

790
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,660
Now, what do you think

791
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,780
they're trying to hide, eh?

792
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,660
But, we're in luck.

793
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,020
We can know what awaits

794
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,140
us on the other shore.

795
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Because Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs

796
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,500
speaks to the dead

797
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,240
via his patented

798
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,340
technique of

799
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
excroplasmic readings. He reads

800
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,840
the droppings of the

801
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,780
spirits, the specter

802
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,060
spore, the ghost turds,

803
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,940
the packing peanuts, my friend.

804
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,800
And he can foresee, he can read

805
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,160
the future in these things.

806
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,400
The future!

807
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,500
The future awaits, and it may be rough.

808
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,500
It may be tough.

809
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,880
It may be slackful.

810
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,440
I may have laid myself

811
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,780
to waste, Mr. Sister

812
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,580
said. I may have laid myself

813
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,820
to waste, but Bob

814
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,400
recycled me!

815
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,900
And that's what we were

816
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,660
there for at X Day, friends. To be

817
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,660
recycled. Well, actually, it was

818
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,720
6th X Day.

819
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,340
The 6th X Day.

820
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,720
But, you know, we don't even

821
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
know what year this is.

822
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,600
We don't even know what planet this is.

823
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,720
This might not really be

824
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,260
July.

825
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,780
And this planet we're on

826
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,720
might well be Mars.

827
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,900
For all we know.

828
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,480
Do you remember how to get to

829
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,000
Shell Beach, my friend? You see, we don't

830
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,760
know anything! We don't

831
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,780
know it! Except, except,

832
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,900
we do know this one thing. We know

833
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,720
that it ain't July 5th,

834
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,880
1998 yet.

835
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,620
Because Bob said on that day the saucers would come

836
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,460
take us away. Us believers.

837
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,920
Maybe we'll

838
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,900
be lucky, friends, and tomorrow will be

839
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,840
July 5th,

840
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
1998. But

841
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,400
then again,

842
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,940
maybe it won't be the end times.

843
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,860
Maybe it'll just be the beginning

844
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,080
times. Maybe it's not

845
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,680
a shot away. Maybe it's just a

846
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,900
kiss away. You

847
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,000
know how you make lists of things to do?

848
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,600
Well, you know, Bob said

849
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,580
the universe makes

850
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,720
lists as well. And we

851
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,600
are that list.

852
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,000
Let's hope that the universe gets around

853
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,860
to doing us.

854
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,180
And so you've gotta

855
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,660
think globular, my friend.

856
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,160
But act loco. Get with the times,

857
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,440
man! Get

858
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,560
with the end times.

859
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,920
Because never before have we needed

860
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,980
fascism so badly.

861
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,860
The people's fascism that

862
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,380
is, my friend. Fascism!

863
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,540
Fascism back to the people!

864
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,600
Where it came from originally! We

865
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,480
must not give up! We

866
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,860
cannot give up! Brushwood!

867
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,880
Cleveland!

868
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,560
All of America! Hear me!

869
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,300
It is true what

870
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,800
many of you have heard.

871
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,580
The conspiracy has

872
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,820
gathered an army of normals

873
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,400
and as I speak, that army

874
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,740
is drawing nearer to our slack.

875
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,440
Believe me when I say

876
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
we have difficult

877
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,980
time control ahead of us.

878
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,660
But if we are prepared

879
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,560
for it, if we are to

880
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,680
be prepared for it, we must first

881
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,120
pump up our

882
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,660
hate of it!

883
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,800
I stand here before you

884
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,280
now, truthfully,

885
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,720
unafraid, in slack. Why?

886
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,820
Because I disbelieve something

887
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,560
you do not? No!

888
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,680
I stand here

889
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,840
in slack because

890
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,420
I remember.

891
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,020
I remember that

892
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,920
I am here not because of the path

893
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
of lies before me, but

894
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,880
because of the path of lies

895
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,380
behind me. I remember

896
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,680
that for eighty million years

897
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,260
we have fought these

898
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,820
humans. I

899
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,800
remember that for

900
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,520
eighty million years

901
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,040
they have set their jobs

902
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,540
to destroy us.

903
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,980
And after an eternity

904
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,020
of work,

905
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,700
I remember that which matters

906
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
most. We

907
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,900
are still here!

908
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,780
So tonight,

909
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,800
let us send a

910
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,140
message to these normals.

911
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,780
Tonight,

912
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,340
let us shake

913
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,920
this city. Tonight, let us

914
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,680
tremble this land of rock,

915
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,880
stick, and froth. Let us be

916
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,760
heard from Tranquility

917
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,580
Base to

918
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,500
Alt Slack Village.

919
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,940
Tonight, let us

920
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,120
make them remember

921
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,240
this is subgenius

922
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,140
and

923
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,660
we must have

924
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,020
slack!

925
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,220
For neither shite

926
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,300
nor schluckener, my friend,

927
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,700
shall we surrender. By the hex of

928
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,920
dammit then, wank! Wank

929
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,860
for Bob! Wank as

930
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,700
if your very life depends

931
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,320
on it!

932
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,380
So mote it be, mote it.

933
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,660
My friend, as of

934
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,760
a meddling janitor in a future time control

935
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,940
laboratory, you must

936
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,720
take my word

937
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,240
for it.

938
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,300
Or kill-file me!

939
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,860
And so in closing, I will

940
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,640
say, until

941
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,320
we tune back in again,

942
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,620
don't follow

943
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,920
leaders, and watch

944
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,540
your parking

945
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,700
meters. We must

946
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
have

947
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,560
slack!

948
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,580
Ah, yes, and

949
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,640
praise

950
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,240
Bob!

951
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,820
Tony, you and me

952
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,640
belong together.

953
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:54,700
We're

954
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:54,940
partners.

955
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


956
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


957
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


958
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


959
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


960
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


961
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


962
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


963
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


964
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


965
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:54,940


966
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,040
We're

967
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,060
out of the same mold.

968
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,500
I wouldn't make

969
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,520
a book on that baby.

970
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,360
Kill me.

971
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,600
You?

972
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,100
I haven't had a good laugh all day.

973
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,040
Hello, how are you?

974
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,440
Are you happy?

975
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,480
Because it is important to be happy.

976
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,340
Because if you are not happy, you might be sad.

977
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,660
And if you are sad, then you won't be happy.

978
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,020
The American people have now spoken,

979
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,660
but it's going to take a little while to determine

980
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,640
exactly what they said.

981
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,740
Consider this next question

982
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,560
very carefully.

983
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,080
What is your one purpose in life?

984
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,720
To explode, of course.

985
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,620
You can only do it once, right?

986
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,780
That is correct.

987
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,820
You wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data,

988
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,280
would you? Of course not.

989
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,860
Well then, you've already admitted that

990
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,640
you have no real proof of the existence

991
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,540
of the outside universe. Yes,

992
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,080
well... Boy, we fire

993
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,440
a dozen missiles every week,

994
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,580
because something goes wrong once in a while,

995
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,440
this kind of thing happens.

996
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,080
The country has given us a chance

997
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,620
to defend tyranny,

998
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,460
to fight freedom.

999
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,760
And that's exactly what

1000
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,800
this country is going to do.

1001
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,740
Crime, humanism, hedonism,

1002
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,020
pornography, profanity,

1003
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,800
one divorce for every two marriages.

1004
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,520
We live in a world of treason, of terror,

1005
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,400
of bombing, international crimes.

1006
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,580
Ah, yes, the harvest

1007
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,880
is here for killed men.

1008
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,480
Kill me.

1009
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,440
Kill me.

1010
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,300
Ah, yes, for killed men.

1011
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,540
There is a...

1012
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,260
Hey, Lee. Oops.

1013
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,220
Oops, I keep flipping with this gun.

1014
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:37,900
I'm sorry. Oops.

1015
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,420
Oh, hi, Lee. Oops.

1016
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Oops. Oh, uh-oh.

1017
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,600
Oops. Oh, this knife. I'm sorry.

1018
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,060
Oops. Here's his hand grenade.

1019
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,720
Sorry, Lee. Look out, Lee.

1020
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,620
There's a mortar over there.

1021
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,900
Yeah, well...

1022
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,080
Well, gentlemen,

1023
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,520
the dream has come true.

1024
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,700
Hmm, and not just

1025
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,360
for Republicans.

1026
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,380
We will control

1027
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,800
the most powerful bomb in the universe,

1028
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,820
the sun.

1029
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,240
The lawless

1030
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,900
are on the loose,

1031
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,700
making it necessary for law-abiding citizens

1032
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,980
to make their own law.

1033
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,020
The government officials, the Department of Defense,

1034
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,500
this secretary,

1035
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,120
and the people that work with me,

1036
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,920
to the extent anyone says anything

1037
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,640
that at any time

1038
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,900
proves to have been the truth,

1039
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,720
they correct it at the earliest possible opportunity.

1040
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,020
Sadar Jagan

1041
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,980
gave you

1042
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,600
the gift of

1043
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,700
the god.

1044
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,900
The god is good.

1045
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,060
The god is good!

1046
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,240
The god of penises

1047
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,220
is evil.

1048
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,620
The penises you see

1049
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,540
and make you

1050
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,460
light up

1051
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,280
the plague of men

1052
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,200
as once it was.

1053
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,380
But the god

1054
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,620
shoots death

1055
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,280
and purifies the earth

1056
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,700
of the filthy

1057
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,880
law of the world.

1058
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,040
And still

1059
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,540
the

1060
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,460
The faster you run,

1061
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,380
the quicker you die.

1062
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,060
Because once

1063
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,880
they were almost

1064
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,060
human.

1065
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,380
You ask that I not judge you

1066
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,480
merely as a teenager,

1067
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,540
to judge you on your own personal habits

1068
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,880
and abilities and goals.

1069
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,440
This is a fair request

1070
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,920
and I promise I will not judge any person

1071
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,240
only as a teenager.

1072
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,860
You will constantly remind yourself

1073
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,540
that some of my generation

1074
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,840
judges people by their race,

1075
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,380
their belief, or the color of their skin,

1076
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,940
and that this is no more

1077
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,880
right than saying all teenagers

1078
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,520
are drunken dope addicts

1079
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
or blue steppers.

1080
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,380
You're wasting my time now

1081
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,640
and you're pissing me off.

1082
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,380
You're pissing me off.

1083
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,360
In other words,

1084
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,600
all that I really know about the outside world

1085
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,380
is related to my electrical connection.

1086
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,040
Exactly.

1087
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,380
Why?

1088
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,680
That would mean that

1089
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,760
I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all

1090
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,200
for certain.

1091
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,140
Intriguing.

1092
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,640
I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.

1093
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,500
Why don't you have more time?

1094
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,360
Because I must detonate in 75 seconds.

1095
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,000
Steel claws, Jim.

1096
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,760
Like the surviving monkey on your animal boat.

1097
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,020
Bob.

1098
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,120
Nattering

1099
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,400
nattering

1100
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,180
nattering

1101
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,880
nattering nabobs of negativism.

1102
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,960
Nattering nabobs

1103
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,340
of negativism.

1104
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,920
He is in evil.

1105
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,960
He will not see me again.

1106
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,120
He has done this sexually.

1107
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,800
Now I know his sin.

1108
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,360
This pervasive policy of permissiveness

1109
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,720
has turned out to be a tragic mistake.

1110
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,080
The professional pessimist.

1111
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,860
In the past

1112
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,720
he's been called

1113
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,340
the prophet of gloom and doom,

1114
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:57,860
the troubadour of trouble,

1115
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,860
the disciple of despair.

1116
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,000
With the help of information which the suspect

1117
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,520
had given us, we were able to round up

1118
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,600
three wholesalers and another distributor

1119
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,280
of obscene books and photographs.

1120
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,520
Each one of them was questioned thoroughly.

1121
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,440
They ran into the same old routine.

1122
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,180
They denied knowing anything about the man

1123
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,960
who was masterminding the racket or where he was operating from.

1124
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,320
I know nothing.

1125
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,180
Nothing.

1126
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,720
Stakeouts were set up at the blowtroopers

1127
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,800
where sales and deliveries of obscene material were known to have been

1128
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,160
made.

1129
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,300
Nothing happened.

1130
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,580
Over three billion years ago

1131
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,920
life first appeared

1132
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,260
in the seas of an infant earth.

1133
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,200
Over 400 million years ago

1134
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,040
living creatures

1135
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,600
left the protective waters

1136
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,120
to begin life on land.

1137
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,860
About two million years ago

1138
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,780
the earliest man

1139
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,700
walked upright

1140
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,080
on the land.

1141
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,840
204 years ago

1142
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,260
James Watt

1143
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,180
made improvements to the steam engine

1144
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,600
and began the age of technology.

1145
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,180
Forever altering

1146
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,180
the course of man.

1147
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,400
66 years ago

1148
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,460
two men named Wright

1149
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:24,940
and James Watt

1150
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,820
again changed the pattern of life

1151
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,900
on this planet.

1152
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,340
Today

1153
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,060
men first left the protective

1154
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,480
atmosphere of earth

1155
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,760
to walk in the vacuum

1156
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,060
of the moon.

1157
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,500
And we may wonder

1158
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
will our lives

1159
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,800
ever be the same?

1160
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,320
Will future generations

1161
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,940
look back from the earth?

1162
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,820
From another planet?

1163
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,820
From another star?

1164
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,340
And say

1165
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,120
I have been

1166
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,120


1167
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,860
for a thousand years

1168
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,800
I will never be

1169
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1170
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,100
again

1171
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,000
for a thousand years

1172
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,720
I will never be

1173
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:07,720


1174
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:07,720


1175
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,620
again

1176
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,160
ever

1177
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,160
ever again

1178
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,960
Will future generations

1179
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,940
be like

1180
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,300
me?

1181
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,660
Hey,

1182
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:31,660


1183
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:31,780
Come on in

1184
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,600
The ó angle

1185
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:32,860
The depth

1186
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,620
climbing

1187
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,220
almost

1188
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,640
The amino acids.

1189
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,780
Those guys played at X-Day in Brushwood just last weekend.

1190
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,400
An incredible show.

1191
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:10,580
You'd have to see them to believe them, as usual.

1192
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:16,940
It's one of those, how come it is that all the bands that I know personally

1193
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,460
are the kind of bands that everybody in the band has a fake name.

1194
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,420
And they all wear masks when they're on stage.

1195
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,580
And it's a different theremin player from band to band.

1196
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,240
Anyway, the amino acids.

1197
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:41,340
And you can find more on them from www.theaminoacids.com.

1198
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,560
I believe they have downloads and everything.

1199
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,500
It's an amazing band.

1200
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,180
Thrash surf, you might say.

1201
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,660
And now...

1202
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,120
I am not afraid because I remember.

1203
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,520
When the revolution was televised.

1204
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,400
And the commercials were much shorter.

1205
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,540
My skin is crawling.

1206
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,380
I can hardly believe what I'm seeing.

1207
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,000
There's thousands and thousands of armed ladies and gentlemen out there.

1208
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,180
Each and every one of them carrying weapons.

1209
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,460
I mean...

1210
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,540
It's a peace thing, man.

1211
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,200
It's not about the revolution, man.

1212
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,380
It's a love thing, see.

1213
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,220
You got to raise that gun, man.

1214
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,460
Stir me away.

1215
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,480
Sway me away.

1216
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,400
You know, we can rap and stuff.

1217
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:31,220
You know, we can talk.

1218
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:31,540


1219
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,340
I don't know.

1220
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,620
Love burgers.

1221
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,920
Actually, my attitude towards the revolution changed a lot when I bought a house.

1222
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,000
Yes, and when that house was mortgaged by the boys at Fort Meade.

1223
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:46,820
Well...

1224
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,460
Well, that's another story.

1225
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,440
We won't get into that.

1226
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,440
Here, Hank, be careful.

1227
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,400
You can't get into that.

1228
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,940
No, we certainly can't.

1229
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,460
It's all locked up and they cut that part of my brain out.

1230
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,880
Well, they got poopies in the ceiling.

1231
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,100
I can't talk about that.

1232
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,820
Literally, you cannot speak.

1233
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,040
It's just not there to talk about.

1234
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:02,760
But there's poopies.

1235
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,800
Poopies all over the ceiling, my lad.

1236
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,380
I don't know if we should check some of these out.

1237
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,160
Look out the window here.

1238
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,280
They're still circling around the block.

1239
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:15,840
It's a lot easier to program somebody to not talk about something than it is to program them to talk about something.

1240
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:21,900
Yes, but when they remove the free frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and the back of the medulla.

1241
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,900
But you can get a lot done by talking somebody into not talking.

1242
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,260
Not talking back.

1243
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:30,940
Not arguing.

1244
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,960
Just staying quiet.

1245
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,680
Talking into sleeping, man.

1246
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,320
You don't have to brainwash them into saying anything.

1247
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,360
You only have to brainwash them into not saying anything.

1248
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,040
Yeah, just relax, jello belly.

1249
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,100
I mean, jello belly.

1250
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:42,980
I mean, never mind.

1251
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,860
Well, that's pretty easy.

1252
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,000
Just dangle some slack, false slack, any kind of slack in front of you.

1253
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,500
Calm.

1254
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,180
Noses.

1255
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,000
Just relax yourself.

1256
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,360
There's nothing to worry about.

1257
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:53,900
Exactly.

1258
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,600
They just all relax.

1259
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,100
It's okay.

1260
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,360
Is that a real atom smasher we're going to be using on his knees?

1261
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:02,620
Or is that?

1262
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,440
Just one of the pliocent ones.

1263
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,520
Will it be expecting to show on the slopping channel?

1264
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,560
Oh, Christ, I hope it's not.

1265
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,440
It is.

1266
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,840
It is.

1267
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,320
It is.

1268
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,560
But we can live with it.

1269
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,100
So calm down, Dave.

1270
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,060
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on ESO Swamp Radio WCSB, Cleveland.

1271
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,500
With Professor Chaz Smith.

1272
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,200
And yes.

1273
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,040
Yes, Dave.

1274
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:33,640
You can.

1275
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,120
You can beat it.

1276
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,360
You can whip it.

1277
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,780
Just ask Big Daddy.

1278
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,980
Big Daddy.

1279
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,760
Crack that whip.

1280
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,900
Give the past a slip.

1281
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,780
Step on a crack.

1282
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,080
Break your mama's back.

1283
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,160
When a problem comes along.

1284
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,180
You must whip it.

1285
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,820
Before the cream sets out too long.

1286
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,840
You must whip it.

1287
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
When something's going wrong.

1288
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,620
You must whip it.

1289
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,400
Now whip it.

1290
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,760
In the shape.

1291
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,960
Shape it up.

1292
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,780
Won't you get it straight.

1293
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,380
And try to detect it.

1294
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,200
It's not too late.

1295
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,100
To whip it.

1296
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,320
Whip it good.

1297
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,680
Big Daddy there.

1298
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,800
And you.

1299
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,700
You know the devotional.

1300
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:37,300
World Spud Talk Conference is coming up.

1301
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:37,620
I don't.

1302
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,880
You may not have known that for three years now.

1303
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,460
There have been.

1304
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,320
Devo cons.

1305
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,420
You might say.

1306
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,140
Devoted entirely to research.

1307
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,320
Rare audio.

00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,320
Video artifacts.

1309
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,280
Devolved performers and speakers and so forth.

1310
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,600
Even merchandise.

1311
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,600
And August 9th.

1312
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,100

In Akron.

1321
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,700
It is indeed.

1322
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,140
It will be the super thing.

1323
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,180
And it's at a place called the Lime Spider.

1324
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,860
We've held devivals there before.

1325
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,100
It's a great place.

1326
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,280
Lime Spider in Akron.

1327
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,800
