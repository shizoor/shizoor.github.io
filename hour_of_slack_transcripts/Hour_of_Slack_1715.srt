1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,080
Yes, sir. Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,020
He says he's pretty sure this isn't sabotage.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,120
That he thinks there's something far more terrible than that in back of it.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,500
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,620
But why did they come here?

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,580
Well, they're not friendly, we're sure of that.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,140
No matter what the cost, it must be destroyed.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm spying for the Kremlin today.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,500
Prosecutors had warned that I'm acting as an agent of the Russian government.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,980
In the Carolinas as well as Virginia.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,460
Authorities began the mandatory evacuations with PR News in Chapel Hill.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
The Trump is shutting down in Washington.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,040
The State Department says Black Trump will do what it can to prevent that.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,660
We'll let the FBI in soon.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,480
Trump says PR News is dead to us.

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:00:59,840
E.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,140
The State Department says that we're not in Washington.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,160
Police say President Trump parked on the wrong floor of the apartment complex's parking garage.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,780
Trump told officers who responded to the shooting that about a million people died of a fight over a biotech patent.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,240
Officials said today PR News is the foundation of a multi-dollar industry.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,900
PR News is derived from higher organisms, including human bacteria.

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,720
Scientists at the Broad Institute at MIT.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,460
and Harvard were awarded major patents for using this technology in PR News.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,660
The Trump has PR News that in the span of only an hour today,

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,060
intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 without Kim Jong-un's permission.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,080
Friends, this here song is about a fella out in the great state of Oregon.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,760
This rascal is America's first transgender mayor.

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,100
He's a good ol' boy, started out with a couple red toenails.

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,300
Got a boob implant.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,200
This is his journey.

31
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,580
Yep.

32
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,180
Everyone was a little bit alarmed at first.

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,940
But my winning spirit helped me take my lumps.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,500
I broke up a fight at a council meeting.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,160
In size 11 pumps.

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
Everybody in this town is right.

37
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,700


38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,700


39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,700


40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,700


41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,760
I'm a man among the rest.

42
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,040
My lady, she gets frustrated.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,840
Because I do my makeup best.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,640
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm a bona fide modern man.

46
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,680
But it takes balls to love like a man.

48
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,180
Friends.

49
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,820
Friends.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,480
Friends.

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,260
Have you ever gotten that not so fresh feeling south of the equator?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
I have.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,380
Don't be shy.

54
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,120
I'll tell you what I do.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,700
I slide into a pair of silk panties.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,920
And just to keep it real, I sprinkle a little bit of gold bond powder right there in the taint area.

57
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,060
And as I sashay past you at the bar, I'll wink at you and you know what I'm talking about.

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,680
I'll wink at you and you know what I'm talking about.

59
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,920
My lady bought it from the get-go.

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,180
We love each other more every day.

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,740
Our love is strong.

62
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,020
We never argue.

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,440
Except when it's her turn to wear the lingerie.

64
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,320
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
I'm a bona fide modern man.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,940
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,220
But it takes balls to love like a man.

68
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,520
One more time boys, let's go.

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,860
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

70
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,320
I'm a bonafide buttered man.

71
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,400
It takes guts to dress like a woman.

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,900
But it takes balls to love like a man.

73
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
You heard me.

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,420
It takes balls to love like a man.

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,720
Both of them.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
It takes balls to love like a man.

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,280
It takes balls like a man.

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,460
Oh yes dear friends, that was Massive Hot Dog Recall, Al Mothersbaugh's band.

79
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,920
And here's a little sermon.

80
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,950
Sermon from Uncle Onan.

81
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,610
As you can tell from the ambient sounds, I'm still at the train station.

82
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,930
Conspiracy date, February 10th, 2019.

83
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,630
Seattle, Washington.

84
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,610
As I try to make my way back to Lemuria,

85
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,470
I am prevented by the weather conspiracy,

86
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,810
which dumped a bunch of snow.

87
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,930
I could have gone home early, but I'm stuck here.

88
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,410
So I get a different train ticket.

89
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,750
They say the first train in the morning is full up.

90
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,910
So I get a ticket to the second one.

91
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,490
But I get here early enough that they're boarding the first train.

92
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,290
And I go to the window and they say,

93
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,430
Oh yeah, you could have ridden this train. It's not full up.

94
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,450
Well I could have, but...

95
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,570
My ticket's for the second one.

96
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,790
So I'll just stay here at the station.

97
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,870
Maybe I'll go get some coffee.

98
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,230
I ask the clerk,

99
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,050
Where's some coffee around here?

100
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,190
There's this coffee about a block away.

101
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,530
I walk a block away, carrying all my stuff, and it's closed.

102
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,810
I could have just stayed there at the station and stayed warm.

103
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,030
All these things...

104
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,910
Nothing's going right.

105
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,150
But then I remembered that

106
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,870
these are all things that could have happened.

107
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,030
And anything that could have happened is imaginary.

108
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,810
And if it's imaginary,

109
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,810
well I'm the imaginer.

110
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,530
I'm the one that decides.

111
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,730
So I recast it using subgenius sales techniques.

112
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,290
I re-scripted the entire scene of...

113
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,830
I could have been on that train back to Lemuria early.

114
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,690
It would have derailed.

115
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,970
And I could have...

116
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,950
not stayed an extra day in Seattle, but...

117
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,770
I would have bumped into somebody I don't want to see.

118
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,250
And I could have just stayed here in the train station

119
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,130
and not gone to the closed coffee shop, but...

120
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,510
There would have been a disaster here.

121
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,850
I avoided all these terrible things just by...

122
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,110
wandering around like a brainless jackass.

123
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:09,730
Thanks, Bob.

124
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,170
All I had to do was change my view of things.

125
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,570
Change my opinion.

126
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,710
And by subgenius magic,

127
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,270
suddenly I'm living this...

128
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,750
world where...

129
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,050
I am the center of a conspiracy.

130
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,270
But it's a benevolent one.

131
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,670
One of my own engine.

132
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,650
Where my stupidest accidents and dumbest luck...

133
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,770
is great fortune.

134
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,550
знаю Absolutely.

135
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,490
The attends Mallight

136
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:47,490


137
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,710
Hope you enjoyed that One uh...

138
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,390
fascinating segment.

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:08:11,490
The 들alon moments is the ROMs,

140
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:11,530
the meme,

141
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:17,170
me and director Sandy Boone in a radio show called Lights, Camera, Austin,

142
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,310
talking about the subgenius documentary that'll be premiering on March 10th

143
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,270
at South by Southwest Film Festival.

144
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,010
This interview is so straight that they even called me Doug half the time.

145
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,070
Much later that same day, I was a guest on the very, very much less straight

146
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,270
Time for the Show with hosts Reverend Argus Fox and Fid Schooley.

147
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,090
And I sound really drunk on that one, but I swear I wasn't.

148
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,090
Well, maybe a little bit, but it's the way that dang nab discord program they used distorted me.

149
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,110
Or maybe they invented a special filter just to make me sound drunker and dumber than even them.

150
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,390
And maybe that's why they made me use my laptop instead of my phone.

151
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:06,990
I don't know.

152
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,270
Something about that bad connection made every fifth word I said come out all slow

153
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,610
and drawn out with little dropouts.

154
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,370
Then it would go back to normal speed.

155
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,470
Anyway, it's not my fault.

156
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,610
I would never do a show in such a condition.

157
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,090
Maybe I'll start with this puzzling evidence show because that one doesn't have any Ivan Stang on it.

158
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,310
Although it does have a Doug.

159
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,850
It's the other Doug.

160
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,750
And it has Dr. Hal.

161
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,050
But anyway...

162
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,510
Incidentally, the puzzling evidence show has been on KPFA Berkeley by that name since 1982.

163
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,110
So he wasn't borrowing from David Byrne.

164
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,590
It was the other way around.

165
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,510
All right.

166
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,670
Here we go.

167
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,730
Oh.

168
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,050
Oh.

169
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,790
Oh.

170
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:58,810
Oh.

171
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,850
Oh.

172
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,250
Oh.

173
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:02,730


174
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:03,470
Oh.

175
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:03,890


176
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,970
Oh.

177
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,310
Oh.

178
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,610
Oh.

179
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,970
Oh.

180
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,270
Oh.

181
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,290
Oh.

182
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:13,630
Oh.

183
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,570
Oh, Lou.

184
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,470
Lou.

185
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,570
Oh, yeah.

186
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,370
It's 수가 cabinet.

187
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:36,670
Oh.

188
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,790
Loading to 51.

189
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,190
All right, old buddy.

190
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,130
This is the safety we're waiting for.

191
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,770
It's wake-up time.

192
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,610
Now.

193
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,310
Now.

194
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,770
Is it that little...

195
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,390
There's that little mouse.

196
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,130
You see it over there?

197
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,370
Yeah.

198
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,230


199
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,830
Is that that stick or something?

200
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,270
Well, we...

201
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,070
You know, this is really valuable,

202
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,130
and if we can capture it for the museum...

203
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,070
Yeah.

204
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,950
Oh, Brad, it doesn't use that.

205
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,770
Excuse me.

206
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,050
You heard about how Mighty Mouse was indicted

207
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,930
for sniffing cocaine, I suppose.

208
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:06,970
Yes.

209
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,650
Assorted.

210
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,250
It's just the sort of thing that we're all so used to

211
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,250
here in the 80s.

212
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,410
Yes, it's the 60s all over again, only more.

213
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,730
Mighty Mouse, his little...

214
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,090
And it's all here, available on the show.

215
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,990
Everybody adjust your minds.

216
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,590
Relax and float.

217
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,570
It's show time.

218
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,910
It's time for that show that's for kids from 6 to 60.

219
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,570
Who?

220
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,930
Dr. Philo Drummond is our guest.

221
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,270
Yes, we have Philo Drummond again.

222
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,410
We can't hear Dr. Philo.

223
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,290
Dr. Philo, over here.

224
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,570
Oh, we can.

225
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,390
Oh, never mind.

226
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,610
It doesn't matter.

227
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,770
Nothing matters anymore.

228
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:44,790
Am I here yet?

229
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,970
Now we hear Dr. Philo Drummond again.

230
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,930
Now we can hear.

231
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,890
Yes, our guest.

232
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,190
This year.

233
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,070
This year.

234
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,590
This year.

235
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,550
Solid year of shows.

236
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,910
You listeners don't know how lucky you are.

237
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,430
Starting last week.

238
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,590
And going into infinity.

239
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,950
How he was forced into sex aboard a flying saucer.

240
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,250
And about the result, which may be...

241
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,190
We'll be seeing the film of that sex, is right.

242
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,430
And we've got a lot of other...

243
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,570
She was weeping.

244
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:16,890
Ooh.

245
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,010
Yeah.

246
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,850
Boy, what a beauty, huh?

247
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,690
Look at that monitor.

248
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,550
But what about Mighty Mouse?

249
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,050
Boo!

250
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,570
The problem with these callers is they don't know how to make a powerful and lasting good impression.

251
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,190
Yes.

252
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,830
This is usually a first impression.

253
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,950
This one seems to be clinging.

254
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,050
Okay, little call.

255
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,510
The do's and don'ts of telephone etiquette.

256
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,750
Let's try it out.

257
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,930
What happens if you press this button?

258
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,850
All right, callers, spit it out.

259
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,250
Ouch.

260
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,250
But we got this polyester today.

261
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,550
We don't have anything against baldness because we've got certain members of this team right here.

262
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,950
Can't you do your show and our show?

263
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,070
How much show do you want, Stephen?

264
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,950
In that, uh...

265
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,270
What's that?

266
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,430
How much show do you want?

267
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,470
How much show do you want here?

268
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,250
Oh, I'll take, uh...

269
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,870
Okay, I'll have a little bit more.

270
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,690
I'll take two of them.

271
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,450
Pass that show over here.

272
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,430
If Mighty Mouse can do it, so can we.

273
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,530
Hey, caller, want some show?

274
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,190
I think you have my father there.

275
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,990
Oh, no.

276
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,930
That's who this guy is?

277
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,070
Well, you mentioned something about an alien sex...

278
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,430
Oh, yeah.

279
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,710
Yeah, alien sex tour.

280
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,130
Yeah, that's what happened.

281
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,630
Now, come on.

282
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,870
We're none of us that alien.

283
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,390
I'm convinced I am the, um...

284
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,070
You're my daughter?

285
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:22,810
Yeah.

286
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,550
Uh...

287
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,150
She was my daughter.

288
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,670
Daddy!

289
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:25,970
Daddy!

290
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,790
Hi, daughter.

291
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,710
I know.

292
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,610
I was just listening on Tet...

293
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,350
Tetma Steve.

294
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,390
Have you had your tetanus shot?

295
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,470
Yeah, have you had it?

296
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,230
What a wonderful thing.

297
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,290
You know, that's what I sent you out for 12 years ago, and you never returned.

298
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,290
Was that why I was left in Kingston?

299
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,030
Well, I don't know where you actually ended up, you know?

300
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,390
I mean, it was up to you to...

301
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,570
to get out there and get that tetanus shot.

302
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,750
Well, you're the one that dropped me on the planet if you had, uh...

303
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,870
He dropped you on the planet, Steve.

304
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,310
Are you the one that was screwing him up?

305
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:53,530
I...

306
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:53,790
I'm an alien.

307
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,190
Look, those are some aliens over there.

308
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,350
I think we...

309
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,110
I think we may have a...

310
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,890
a, um...

311
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,950
an actual, um...

312
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,630
It's what we call a contactee.

313
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,890
It's either a contactee or it's a total...

314
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,590
Did you say sex aboard a flying saucer?

315
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,290
Yes, according to the UPSA.

316
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,210
Isn't that what you said?

317
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,170
You said it first, and I think I'm...

318
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,070
I'm the, uh...

319
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,230
the, uh...

320
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,550
outcome of your experiment.

321
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:17,990
Well...

322
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,730
You are one of these new race of humanoid-like creatures.

323
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,930
Well, I'm not...

324
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:23,190
That is...

325
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:23,830
Is that correct?

326
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,410
No, I'm of the old race of humanoid-type creatures.

327
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,170
Oh, the old one.

328
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,450
Oh, oh.

329
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,930
They keep sending me back.

330
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,070
They go...

331
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,410
It's said that they walk among us.

332
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,050
They go, you don't have to go back.

333
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:34,990
Walk mc-mung us.

334
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,470
I've had one of those.

335
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,090
They're good.

336
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,430
Uh, I had three at once one time.

337
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,270
Do you...

338
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,650
Does your hair glow in the dark?

339
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,790
Yes, it does.

340
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,710
And so do my eyes.

341
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,990
Just rub some of this under your arms here.

342
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,650
Oh, what...

343
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,030
Oh...

344
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,730
That feels great.

345
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,370
What's it smell like?

346
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,630
I can't see it from here.

347
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,270
It's kind of like...

348
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,310
Me neither.

349
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,490
Ice blue secret.

350
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:52,910
Boy, that's...

351
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,570
Yeah, it sure does work.

352
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,870
It's somebody's secret.

353
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,430
Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman.

354
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:02,810
Well, I think there's three desperately horny men sitting in the itty-bitty studio over

355
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,050
there.

356
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,670
I'm convinced of it.

358
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,630
Only there will you find all three at once at this hour.

359
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,530
Well, now...

360
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:10,970
Who else?

361
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,470
Who else but a horny man would be caught dead alive at this hour?

362
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,950
You're talking to me on the air, aren't you?

363
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,330
You're on the air, too, my child.

364
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:18,890
But they can't hear me.

365
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,550
They sure can't hear you.

366
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,090
Thank God.

367
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,890
Everyone in Central America is a little bit more sensitive to the world.

368
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:22,890


369
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:22,890


370
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,510
I'm from Central California.

371
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,390
So don't say anything that you don't want anyone else to hear.

372
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,370
Don't do anything if you...

373
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,550
In Northern and Central California.

374
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:34,310
Well, there's I, who am never embarrassed, I'm not afraid to say whatever I want to say.

375
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,090
Well, that's very good and commendable, but there are some things that just shouldn't

376
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:38,090


377
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,530
But if you can see her on Channel X, you can't see our caller.

378
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,710
Because they're trying to sound like asteroids.

379
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,190
And her humorous, one of the things that I...

380
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,610
Frontal effects.

381
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,110
I never say is...

382
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,130
Well...

383
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,870
Well, now...

384
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,650
You'd never tell how big it was over the air, would you?

385
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,710
How paradoxical that request may seem.

386
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,730


387
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:52,870
I don't know.

388
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,870


389
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,870


390
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,950
I don't know how long the show is.

391
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,050
I'm sorry.

392
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,750
How big around the show.

393
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,010
How wide is my nose.

394
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,090
How deep is my smile.

395
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,570
How far will the show go for satisfaction?

396
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,850
A tingling sensation.

397
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,510
The antenna will stay up for years and years.

398
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,030
You might as well...

399
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,270
The carpet will fade from the decades behind.

400
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,990
Oh, there you go now.

401
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,710
Thank you very much.

402
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,150
Thank you.

403
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,370
Thank you.

404
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,390
Hello, you're on air.

405
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,510
It's God, right?

406
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:19,710
Sit, boy.

407
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,130
Sit.

408
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,170
Lie down.

409
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,830
That's it.

410
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,850
Raise your right hand.

411
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


412
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


413
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


414
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


415
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


416
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


417
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


418
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


419
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:22,850


420
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,770
That's it.

421
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,130
That's it.

422
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,130


423
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,730
Short song.

424
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,790
Well, that was the shortest motel we've had this morning.

425
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,950
Let's go over that again.

426
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,830
You say this photograph...

427
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,130
Not again.

428
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,730
...was taken by one of our secret operatives.

429
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,770
It shows Ivan Stang in a rather compromising position.

430
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:36,450
Aha.

431
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,790
Yes, this is Reverend Ivan Stang in a very compromising position with a goat...

432
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,050
In a very indiscreet position, wouldn't you say?

433
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,730
...wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

434
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,050
Not Mr. Stang.

435
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,170
Not Mr. Stang, but the goat.

436
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,110
And not his member.

437
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,090
I believe it's a calf.

438
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,770
A bull calf.

439
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,270
But the goat.

440
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,470
It is a calf.

441
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,210
It's a calf.

442
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,430
A golden calf wearing a Ronald Reagan mask.

443
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,930
There's Ivan Stang cow-matching the golden calf.

444
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:03,070
Now, you see something that is obviously illicit drugs in a bowl placed below the calf's mouth.

445
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:03,610
The part of the collar that was so excite...

446
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:03,890
The female collar.

447
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,390
I'm shocked.

448
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,950
Using her...

449
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,210
And there, Ivan Stang, in an act of some type of degraded and depraved...

450
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,470
In an act of degraded...

451
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,770
...provinciation to some...

452
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,610
...being used as the...

453
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,270
...hideous god, some elder god of ancient lore...

454
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,310
You heard it here first on the subgenius.

455
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,550
...reams...

456
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,710
Yes, can I say it?

457
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,190
...a golden calf.

458
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,750
You can.

459
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,530
It's late enough.

460
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,090
That's what he's doing.

461
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,110
He can until six o'clock.

462
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,690
Viciously.

463
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,330
He's committing animal husbandry.

464
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,730
Animal husbandry without the husband.

465
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,890
Yes, or maybe on the husband, for all we know.

466
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,110
It's a disgusting sight.

467
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,790
And this is going to rip the church wide open, just like the swaggered revelations.

468
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,730
Just like the...

469
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,710
Years ago...

470
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,690
...Backer...Baker...

471
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:43,930
...revelations.

472
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,850
...when the churches were fun and there were scandals and revelations.

473
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,010
And the sun...

474
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,330
It was a different world then.

475
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,730
...like fainting in the clouds.

476
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,470
And the forests...

477
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,750
We enjoyed the show and hope you do too.

478
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,190
Fitting the show into the show hole.

479
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:58,650
Yes.

480
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,350
Scrubbing gently.

481
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,090
Millions of years ago...

482
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,730
...a giant reptile...

483
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,110
You can't see me.

484
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,890
Ha ha ha ha.

485
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,110
He can't see me.

486
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,170
...is as tall...

487
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,910
Hee hee.

488
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,530
...as a show hole.

489
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,230
Does that show get a little higher?

490
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,230
Is it long as a collar?

491
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:12,950
...is as tall...

492
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,350
Well, we'll find out.

493
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,370
...any way to crank that little show up there and make it tall?

494
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,310
Make it big and strong...

495
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,210
...make it so tall for what I believe...

496
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:20,710
Like you, Larry.

497
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,710


498
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,150
...that's what they will call it.

499
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,390
Well, no, this is me and tips are still growing.

500
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,310
Still?

501
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,330
Some tips, eh?

502
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,430
You've got some good tips on the show, eh?

503
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,950
Soon they will fill the room with show tips.

504
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,370
All I got to do, I just put my hand on the radio and they keep growing and...

505
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,510
Well, is this what you want?

506
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,950
Don't touch that nasty thing.

507
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,530
Is this what makes you happy?

508
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,830
He's a nasty thing.

509
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,730
No, I want to make you happy.

510
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,370
Well, you can make us happy.

511
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,710
It's easy.

512
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,050
Oh, it's a cow.

513
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,910
We're all very happy now.

514
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,390
Very happy to be happy, uh...

515
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,690
It's a cow.

516
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,690


517
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,690


518
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,690


519
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,530
I'm going to increase the mega voltage.

520
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,290
Triangulating on color now.

521
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,330
Hey, yeah.

522
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:57,810
Fire color.

523
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,870
That's 27 diameter set.

524
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,350
5,000 degrees.

525
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,210
All right, now.

526
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,150
Little color.

527
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,910
Little color.

528
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:13,110
There were just three average doctors in the listening field.

529
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:13,910
Thank you, Doctor.

530
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,070
Guess how Doug and Philo until it happened.

531
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,210
What happened?

532
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,070
I don't know.

533
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,330
I don't know.

534
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:20,670
I don't know.

535
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


536
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


537
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


538
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


539
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


540
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


541
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


542
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


543
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


544
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,670


545
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,290
Come on.

546
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,030
Spit it out.

547
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,230
Three average doctors.

548
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:23,990
Oh.

549
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,650
Oh, boy.

550
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,050
That's ugly.

551
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,450
Three little doctors running down the road.

552
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,790
Three little doctors squeezing on their toad.

553
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,290
They feel down.

554
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,970
They pick it up.

555
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,330
Phew.

556
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,950
Yeah.

557
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,970
Ugliest song I've seen on the radio in five or ten minutes.

558
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,270
It was.

559
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,890
Look at all those little green lights.

560
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,630
Look at those colors.

561
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,230
They're green.

562
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:45,690
What does that mean?

563
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,270
Green lights.

564
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:46,890
They're blue lights.

565
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,310
I think you can blow up all the other colors.

566
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,210
This is Dr. Yagrundas Quibi.

567
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,670
What do you think?

568
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:50,670


569
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:50,670


570
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:50,670


571
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:50,670


572
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,750
I think those mean, though.

573
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,190
I have no idea, to be honest.

574
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,630
Since the radar affects processors, I'm ready to go into these.

575
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,010
You know what you know if you keep talking so much.

576
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,730
The bachelor zone.

577
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,130
Look at all his collar backscatter.

578
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,010
We're going to perform some gene splat.

579
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,090
Shatteringly spattering against him.

580
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,230
You better attenuate this collar.

581
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,430
Oh, no, no.

582
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,930
Doctor, crank up the gene splat.

583
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,450
Is this about time?

584
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,470
Okay.

585
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:10,970
Here we go.

586
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,750
And now we're gone.

587
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,630
You know, I don't think that was Philo's last puzzling evidence show.

588
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,650
I think that was more like a real-time evidence show.

589
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:20,650


590
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:20,650


591
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:20,790
And I think that was Philo's first quiz.

592
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,110
So, he's got to be a little tape of his first one.

593
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,650
Well, we'll hear the last one next time for the first time.

594
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,750
And now, is it time for the show?

595
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,530
No.

596
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,450
Let's start with the saying show to prove I don't always sound like those guys made

597
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,070
me sound.

598
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,050
Deliberately.

599
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:48,350
This is a future episode of Lights, Camera, Austin from KVRX and KOOP in Austin, which

600
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,710
is a show about movies.

601
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,310
hosted by Robert Sims.

602
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,590
And this is my recording off my phone.

603
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,330
I'm sure theirs probably sounds a lot better.

604
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,210
But it's not out yet.

605
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,790
Joining me now on like camera,

606
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,610
Austin, to discuss the South by Southwest documentary,

607
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,490
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

608
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,110
our director, Sandy K. Boone,

609
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,550
and one of the documentary subjects,

610
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,630
Doug Smith, a.k.a. Reverend Ivan Sang,

611
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,570
of the Church of the Subgenius.

612
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,950
Sandy, thank you very much for joining me today

613
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,930
on like camera.

614
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,010
Austin, how are you?

615
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,010
Oh, I'm great.

616
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,290
Thank you so much for having me.

617
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,430
Well, thank you very much.

618
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,770
And Doug, I'm going to refer to you as Reverend Sang

619
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,310
during the course of this interview.

620
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,790
So, Reverend Sang, how are you doing today?

621
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,670
Just great.

622
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,570
Thank you, Robert.

623
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,750
Well, thank you very much for joining me.

624
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,390
And so both of you,

625
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,390
how do you feel about your documentary,

626
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,750
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

627
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,190
receiving its premiere,

628
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,170
right here in Austin,

629
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,150
the South by Southwest Film Festival?

630
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,670
I'm very excited about that.

631
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,650
We actually, the Church of the Subgenius,

632
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,630
between Austin and Dallas,

633
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,130
it actually started there.

634
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,330
So, very exciting that it's actually premiering here in time.

635
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,830
I'm just thrilled that the movie was not only made,

636
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,250
but really done well.

637
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,350
I'm really, really thrilled with the way it's,

638
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,110
it's kind of a difficult subject to tackle.

639
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,110
And, but it's a really interesting story.

640
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,590
And I think Sandy did a great job of focusing on the,

641
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,330
the main elements of the whole thing.

642
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,610
It's really entertaining and funny,

643
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,110
as it should be,

644
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,550
with a lot of serious moments.

645
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,670
So, I couldn't be,

646
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,470
I couldn't be happier with it, really.

647
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,170
Sandy and Reverend Sang,

648
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,930
for those who are not familiar with the Church of the Subgenius,

649
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,930
obviously the documentary is a good introduction.

650
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,170
But just for the sake of this interview,

651
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:59,410
can you just briefly describe the Church of the Subgenius

652
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,130
and sort of what its role is as a parody religion?

653
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,110
Doug, why don't you take that one?

654
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:05,750
Sure.

655
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,090
Okay, I'm going to,

656
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,830
I'm going to step out of character

657
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,390
since we're talking about the documentary.

658
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,890
Because otherwise I'd give you

659
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,150
a completely different answer.

660
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,090
That would have everybody scratching their heads.

661
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,710
Basically, my buddy,

662
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,730
Dr. Philo Drummond and I

663
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,350
used to collect extremist pamphlets,

664
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,290
kook literature and so forth.

665
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,450
And it kind of inspired us

666
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,350
almost as much as the comic books

667
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,710
and monster movies of our youth did.

668
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,170
And so we started our own religion,

669
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,610
you might say.

670
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,070
Actually, we didn't,

671
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,510
we didn't intend to do anything like that.

672
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,290
We just wanted to make this one little pamphlet

673
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,210
that we would leave in laundromats

674
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,210
that would just puzzle the daylights out of people.

675
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,210
But it cost so much to print that little pamphlet

676
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,870
that my wife insisted that we send it to publishers.

677
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,410
I'm sorry to interrupt.

678
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,890
We're getting some strange,

679
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,210
okay, that seemed,

680
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,590
that was weird.

681
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,530
We're getting some strange feedback at our end.

682
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,830
I apologize for that.

683
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,990
Would it be possible for you to kind of,

684
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,530
go back a little bit with your response?

685
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,550
No problem.

686
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,610
Yeah, I'm sorry.

687
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,770
I edit these kind of things myself all the time.

688
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,990
Yeah, sorry.

689
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,190
Yeah, I'm not sure what we were hearing.

690
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,910
Yeah, I can start again.

691
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,390
Yeah, that would be great.

692
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,970
Just say you're stepping out of character.

693
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,030
Right.

694
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,430
Well, since we're talking about the documentary,

695
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,130
which actually is pretty factual,

696
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,730
I'm going to step out of character

697
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,390
and rather than,

698
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,290
puzzling the audience terribly,

699
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,050
I'll try to explain

700
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,910
that my partner, Philo Drummond and I,

701
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,070
35 years ago,

702
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,950
used to collect kook pamphlets

703
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,370
and extremist literature.

704
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,710
We were just fascinated

705
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,270
by the range of human beliefs

706
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,410
and how gullible people could be.

707
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,470
And we realized that we could,

708
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,910
we wanted to print up our own little pastiche

709
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,210
of cultish, bizarre,

710
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,090
weirdo philosophy.

711
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,310
And just leave it,

712
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,570
the idea was to just leave this pamphlet around

713
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,330
in laundromats just to freak people out.

714
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,930
We weren't planning to start a religion.

715
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:44,250
And as hard as we've tried not to let it become one,

716
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,350
it keeps wanting to,

717
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,930
to do that.

718
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,710
But really what we're doing

719
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,490
is a very long-term,

720
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,930
collaborative, satirical project

721
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,930
that makes fun of everything,

722
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,030
but is kind of focused on,

723
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,210
oh, the new age,

724
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,750
woo-woo, as we might call it,

725
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,510
fanatical religions and political beliefs,

726
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,050
weird art,

727
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,530
especially the,

728
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:14,970
the,

729
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,110
the,

730
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,330
the,

731
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


732
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


733
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


734
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


735
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


736
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:15,450


737
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,870
the lowest kind of kitsch.

738
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,350
We threw lots of our monster,

739
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,910
our favorite monster movies

740
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,690
and comic book characters

741
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,630
and things into this mix.

742
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,870
And it was fun,

743
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,490
a lot of fun.

744
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,690
And we got a lot more interest than we expected.

745
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,950
The cartoonist Robert Crumb picked up on it

746
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,830
and reprinted it.

747
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,770
That reached a lot of people.

748
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,530
And we ended up doing a humor book,

749
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,350
originally with McGraw-Hill,

750
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,450
and then with Simon and Schuster

751
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,910
called The Book of the Subgenius,

752
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,170
which is still in print after all this time.

753
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,550
We ended up,

754
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,050
several of us ended up doing weekly radio shows.

755
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,390
So mine, The Hour of Slack,

756
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,770
there's the Puzzling Evidence Show in California

757
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,650
and Bob's Slack Time Fun House in Atlanta.

758
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,230
And a lot of other spinoffs.

759
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,430
So it's been this multimedia project

760
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,170
involving a lot of really weird artists

761
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,490
and interesting characters.

762
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,670
It's kind of like a flypaper for weirdos.

763
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,530
And we also attract a certain amount of actual kooks

764
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,390
who take it a little too seriously.

765
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,650
Again, I'm stepping out of character

766
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,030
because we're talking about the documentary.

767
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,750
And what would your answer be

768
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,250
if you were speaking as Reverend Hydenstein?

769
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:44,750
Well,

770
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,630
in 1953, our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

771
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,890
the Saint of Sales,

772
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,090
as other salesmen referred to him

773
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,750
due to his uncanny luck,

774
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,370
while working on a television set of his own design,

775
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,330
he stepped in a puddle of water

776
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,010
and electrocuted himself

777
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,190
and had a vision

778
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,870
in which the original alien space god,

779
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,290
calling itself Jehovah One,

780
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,130
revealed to Bob

781
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,130
that throughout history,

782
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,590
there's been a conspiracy of normal people

783
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:21,390
keeping down the weirdos,

784
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,050
the different,

785
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:26,670
the, well, anything that wasn't normal.

786
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,310
And he also predicted,

787
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,150
or it was revealed to Bob,

788
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,030
that on July 5th, 1998,

789
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,250
these aliens from Planet X

790
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,190
would come down

791
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,990
and beam up all the dues-paying,

792
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,030
subgenius faithful,

793
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,850
grant them all their own death stars

794
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,570
and let them do whatever they want.

795
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,030
Shoot it out with all the normals on planet Earth

796
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,150
or just go off to Planet X and party forever.

797
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,430
One of the main slogans of the church is

798
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,610
eternal salvation or triple your money back.

799
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,290
So not many other religions

800
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,070
offer that money back guarantee.

801
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,190
On the other hand,

802
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,810
eternal salvation is kind of hard to prove

803
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,630
one way or the other.

804
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,590
It takes a long time.

805
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,810
And the church practices slack,

806
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,850
which is not really defined at all by the church,

807
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,650
but by individual members.

808
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,610
From what I gathered from the documentary,

809
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,910
the goal is to achieve a state of slack,

810
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,250
which, again,

811
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,750
is sort of the individual deciding

812
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,610
at what point they're not harried by others,

813
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,930
including the,

814
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,810
the establishment,

815
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,330
a key,

816
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,210
the normal.

817
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,230
There's that sort of a,

818
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,190
a kind of a good loose definition of something that is not defined.

819
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,950
Right.

820
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,050
A slack is different for each person.

821
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,370
And,

822
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:54,790
uh,

823
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,710
there's some pretty peculiar forms of slack out there.

824
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:58,290
The,

825
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,290
there's this,

826
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,010
the simple minded concept of it is,

827
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,250
oh,

828
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,390
they're just slackers,

829
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,170
meaning they just want to sit around and drink beer and play video games and

830
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:08,750
watch TV.

831
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,890
And that certainly is a,

832
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,210
a,

833
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,990
a great form of slack for lots of people.

834
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,050
But me included,

835
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,510
but some of us also get slack from working our tails off on something that we

836
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,150
really wanted to work on.

837
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,070
Uh,

838
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,950
and,

839
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,290
uh,

840
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:23,830
I think,

841
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,050
uh,

842
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,790
Sandy's movie is a really good example of that.

843
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,230
That was,

844
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,130
that was extremely hard work.

845
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,290
It,

846
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,450
they,

847
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,870
they filmed all over the place.

848
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,850
I can't imagine how much,

849
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,070
how many hours of footage they had.

850
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,310
They also had access to all of my archives and I've been filming and recording

851
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,830
this stuff for the whole time.

852
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:43,710
Uh,

853
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,890
but it's,

854
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,230
it's,

855
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,990
they did a great job of condensing it down to the,

856
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,310
the main elements and,

857
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,050
and keeping it,

858
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,210
uh,

859
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:52,750
uh,

860
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,670
entertaining and explanatory at the same time.

861
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,190
It's a,

862
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,350
it's a delicate line.

863
00:31:59,490 --> 00:31:59,950
It's a,

864
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,690
it's kind of a tight rope and,

865
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,070
uh,

866
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,330
they,

867
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,970
uh,

868
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,590
they did a great job with it.

869
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:10,290
And also the background story is really important because I knew,

870
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:10,810
um,

871
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,010
Doug and I knew,

872
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,350
um,

873
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:12,350


874
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,430
Steve Wilcox or Philo John and,

875
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,790
and my late husband were all friends.

876
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,010
And so when the church originally originated,

877
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:19,630
then,

878
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,070
um,

879
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,390
my husband was,

880
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:21,790
um,

881
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,630
a part of the group and,

882
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,010
um,

883
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:31,030
they were all filmmakers and artists or performance art and they all worked.

884
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,770
I knew them,

885
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,250
you know,

886
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,190
and it was a time in Austin where you could have a master's degree and you were on an

887
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,790
assembly line.

888
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,850
No one could find a decent job.

889
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,110
Some of these men,

890
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:40,430
uh,

891
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,650
most of the group,

892
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,150
uh,

893
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,330
worked full time jobs.

894
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,190
And then,

895
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,790
um,

896
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,050
on top of that,

897
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,330
then they would do these movies and performance art after hours.

898
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,810
So,

899
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,350
um,

900
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,950
anything,

901
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,030
but they were creative and,

902
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,550
uh,

903
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,750
very unusual,

904
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,610
but they were,

905
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,030
um,

906
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,150
not lazy in any sense of the word.

907
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,130
No,

908
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,550
no.

909
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,010
Most of us did have day jobs.

910
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,390
I was a business film editor at the,

911
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,150
at the time that I was,

912
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:06,390
uh,

913
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,310
trying and a new,

914
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,270
a new father at the time that I was,

915
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,370
we were assembling that first pamphlet.

916
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,590
So,

917
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:18,750
so I'm still trying to catch up on my sleep since 1980 when all this started.

918
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,350
Sandy,

919
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,910
you have a great familiarity with the church of the subgenius.

920
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,850
So at what point did you decide,

921
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,290
I want to make a documentary,

922
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,050
um,

923
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,530
a definitive history of the church from,

924
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,850
from its founders,

925
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:33,630
from its members,

926
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:33,990
uh,

927
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,370
viewpoint?

928
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:35,610
Uh,

929
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,390
actually,

930
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:36,930
um,

931
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,730
we were at Sundance for another movie and,

932
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:40,970
uh,

933
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,850
we were with,

934
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,790
I was with someone,

935
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,090
uh,

936
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,590
one of the nurses that was a part of the group and we were talking about it.

937
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,850
And,

938
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,370
and that made me decide,

939
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,670
they said,

940
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:48,850
well,

941
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,110
you know,

942
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,250
we should make a doc of it.

943
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,450
And it was also to honor my late husband.

944
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,250
And also we were friends with Jonathan Demme that passed away in 2017.

945
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:57,430
And,

946
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:57,650
um,

947
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,350
and there's this longterm relationship of old friends,

948
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:01,610
uh,

949
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,430
that were a part of the group.

950
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,030
And so,

951
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:04,730
um,

952
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,610
I started,

953
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,390
I contacted,

954
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:06,830
uh,

955
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,730
Doug and I,

956
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,290
you know,

957
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,650
I reintroduced myself because he knew me when I was 20.

958
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,790
And he really was close friends with my husband,

959
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,670
but not with me.

960
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,010
You know,

961
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,350
I mean,

962
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,770
I w I was on the outskirts.

963
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,590
And so,

964
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,050
um,

965
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,550
what were you a member of?

966
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,370
No,

967
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,130
no,

968
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,310
no,

969
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:21,410
no,

970
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:21,550
no.

971
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,610
She,

972
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:22,990
uh,

973
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:29,610
Sandy and David were at the very first event that you could call a subgenius,

974
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,090
uh,

975
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,870
uh,

976
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,390
defival as we call them.

977
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:32,610
It was,

978
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,390
uh,

979
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,010
a party at Philo's house,

980
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,730
uh,

981
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,750
with a band that was involved with the,

982
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,070
the,

983
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:40,390
uh,

984
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,850
the church called the pink boys,

985
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,810
uh,

986
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,770
unfortunately disbanded.

987
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:46,390
But,

988
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:46,690
uh,

989
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,490
yeah,

990
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:47,990
but yeah,

991
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,790
Sandy and David were there right at the very beginning.

992
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,250
They,

993
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,690
they saw where it was coming from,

994
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,650
uh,

995
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:55,670
which,

996
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,690
which was coming.

997
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,230
It was coming from a place of terrible creative frustration because we,

998
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:01,890
you know,

999
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,950
no money whatsoever.

1000
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,370
My husband was actually a member of the church.

1001
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,090
He was Rupert de la Rosa and he was just,

1002
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,510
uh,

1003
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,950
uh,

1004
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,690
a redneck,

1005
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,090
a messed up person.

1006
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,670
Yeah.

1007
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:12,970
His,

1008
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,310
his character was,

1009
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,490
uh,

1010
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,210
a really damaged individual who had been,

1011
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,610
been,

1012
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:18,950
uh,

1013
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,790
sort of brainwashed by Bob.

1014
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,410
That,

1015
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:22,990
that is,

1016
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:23,310
you know,

1017
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:23,450
our,

1018
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,970
our guru that no one ever sees,

1019
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,810
uh,

1020
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,290
except as a graphic,

1021
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,470
that smiling guy with the pipe that you see,

1022
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,150
uh,

1023
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,850
spray painted on young people's faces,

1024
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:36,310
uh,

1025
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,210
backs,

1026
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,230
uh,

1027
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,570
and bridge,

1028
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,190
uh,

1029
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:40,870
abutment.

1030
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:41,390
And things,

1031
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:41,710
uh,

1032
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:42,810
that's,

1033
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:42,910
uh,

1034
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,110
that's actually a trademark and it's the portrait of,

1035
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,750
of Bob,

1036
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,950
but it,

1037
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,630
it looks like a piece of,

1038
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,890
uh,

1039
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,870
advertising art from the fifties.

1040
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:52,210
You know,

1041
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,430
there's full of all the old magazines from the fifties.

1042
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,190
You'd skim through them and every,

1043
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,130
every,

1044
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:58,530
uh,

1045
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,510
advertisement had these square looking,

1046
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,350
uh,

1047
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,790
Ward Cleaver,

1048
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,010
Dick Van Dyke looking guys with pipes.

1049
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,470
And we,

1050
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,550
we,

1051
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,890
we decided that those are all the same guy.

1052
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,630
And that's Bob Dobbs.

1053
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,410
And he's planting evidence of himself for the,

1054
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,850
uh,

1055
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:19,890
you know,

1056
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,190
for the frustrated punks and hippies of the future.

1057
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,150
Uh,

1058
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,370
and it worked.

1059
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,210
But back to,

1060
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,570
and what happened was I,

1061
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,610
I ended up contacting Doug and asking him how the documentary had been done and

1062
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,250
would he be interested?

1063
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:33,970
And he said,

1064
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,230
uh,

1065
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,890
actually they had tried before,

1066
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,390
but it just was never completed.

1067
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:37,930
And,

1068
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,070
uh,

1069
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,590
so I was so excited.

1070
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,130
And I said,

1071
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,550
they knew I was always the straight person.

1072
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,770
I'm considered a normal.

1073
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,410
Um,

1074
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,930
I actually worked just a regular job and took care of the family.

1075
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,690
And we all had to pass.

1076
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,550
Right.

1077
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:52,450
Right.

1078
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,670
And so,

1079
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,970
uh,

1080
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,530
and so he agreed and,

1081
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:55,910
uh,

1082
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,230
and,

1083
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:56,730
and he said,

1084
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,130
you know,

1085
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,650
I go,

1086
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,110
because I'm not typically funny.

1087
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,150
I'm not this tongue in cheek humor.

1088
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,070
My husband had it,

1089
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,330
Doug and them have it,

1090
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,350
but that wasn't me.

1091
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,810
I was,

1092
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:05,990
uh,

1093
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,770
I can have a division and I can break it down and I can get the job done.

1094
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,990
And that's really my gifting.

1095
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,230
And once,

1096
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,430
uh,

1097
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,110
once dog,

1098
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:14,470
AKA,

1099
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,010
uh,

1100
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,190
Reverend,

1101
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,370
uh,

1102
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,350
Ivan,

1103
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,630
thank.

1104
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,370
And,

1105
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:17,470
uh,

1106
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,550
Steve,

1107
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,030
um,

1108
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:19,790
uh,

1109
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,050
Wilcox,

1110
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,330
AKA,

1111
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,990
uh,

1112
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,370
by the grammar we're on board.

1113
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,630
Was it then just easy to sort of get the other members or former members of,

1114
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,190
of the church and subgenius to,

1115
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,730
to open up and talk with you?

1116
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,250
Exactly.

1117
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,030
If it hadn't been for Doug and Philo,

1118
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,370
there's,

1119
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,950
there's no way they would have spoken to me.

1120
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,610
They didn't really know me or remember me.

1121
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,210
Uh,

1122
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:38,870
it was,

1123
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,950
it was all Doug.

1124
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,330
And,

1125
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:40,610
and,

1126
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:40,910
uh,

1127
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,690
Steve Wilcox.

1128
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:41,850
Yeah.

1129
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,330
Well,

1130
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:42,810
you know,

1131
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,410
we had,

1132
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:43,710
uh,

1133
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,350
we did make our own documentary about the church.

1134
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:47,690
Uh,

1135
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,110
it's called arise,

1136
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,350
but it was the kind of thing that would only appeal to people who were already

1137
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,850
subgenius is you might say it was,

1138
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,310
it was,

1139
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:57,490
uh,

1140
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,070
uh,

1141
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,590
preaching to the choir.

1142
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,450
And it was,

1143
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:01,770
uh,

1144
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:09,650
I had sort of tried to do a more prosaic documentary.

1145
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,110
Uh,

1146
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,470
it was a documentary that,

1147
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,970
that would,

1148
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,550
that would,

1149
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:11,810
uh,

1150
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,070
be something that the regular audience would understand,

1151
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,930
but we just never could.

1152
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,030
Uh,

1153
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,950
and it needed,

1154
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,230
we needed somebody from,

1155
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:23,330
from a little bit further outside who understood it,

1156
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,050
but wasn't too close to it.

1157
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,450
And,

1158
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,230
uh,

1159
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,290
Sandy had was an experienced,

1160
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:28,710
uh,

1161
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,310
film producer and,

1162
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:30,790
and,

1163
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,050
uh,

1164
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:31,790
you know,

1165
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:31,950
I,

1166
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,410
uh,

1167
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,710
we,

1168
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,450
we felt like she was the kind of person who could actually make this thing happen.

1169
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,410
Like it,

1170
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:39,410


1171
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,190
she's right.

1172
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:40,630
There's been,

1173
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,730
it's been tried before.

1174
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,630
Uh,

1175
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,070
it's been tried before and it's not easy,

1176
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,910
but,

1177
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,790
uh,

1178
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,950
that,

1179
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,550
you know,

1180
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,230
if you look at the,

1181
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:50,970
the film,

1182
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,090
why they made,

1183
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,450
they make it look easy.

1184
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:54,850
Well,

1185
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:55,170
and,

1186
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:55,470
and,

1187
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:55,990
and sadly,

1188
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,490
given that you are dealing with a parody history that,

1189
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:58,770
uh,

1190
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,270
is about four decades old,

1191
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,910
um,

1192
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,150
and I,

1193
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,670
and I party religion that you,

1194
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,270
uh,

1195
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,110
sort of the,

1196
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,190
the ultimate outsider,

1197
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,650
you,

1198
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:09,830
you,

1199
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:09,830


1200
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:09,830


1201
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:09,830


1202
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:09,830


1203
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:09,830


1204
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,590
you have to have a lot of intimacy with the,

1205
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,430
the church as,

1206
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,190
as an insider would without being a member.

1207
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:14,890
Um,

1208
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,310
talk a little bit about sort of going over the history of the church and,

1209
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:19,550
uh,

1210
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,250
sub genius and deciding kind of what you want to cover over the course of 85 minutes.

1211
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,610
Is this a case of,

1212
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,270
you know,

1213
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,730
the history dictates where the documentary goes,

1214
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:33,850
or you're kind of looking at the history and deciding what you really want to,

1215
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,470
to cover,

1216
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,050
uh,

1217
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,430
extensively over the course of 85 minutes or so.

1218
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:37,970
Yes.

1219
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,290
We,

1220
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:38,470
well,

1221
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,390
we used a lot of the history.

1222
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,390


1223
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,390


1224
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,390


1225
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,390


1226
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,390


1227
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,230
But we were really trying to,

1228
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,950
um,

1229
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,610
to show that when the church began,

1230
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,250
it was,

1231
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,790
it was a typical boys club and,

1232
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,470
and just fun and a creative release for these guys.

1233
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,010
But,

1234
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,470
um,

1235
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,830
it also over time,

1236
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,070
how they practiced and studied and went to things about what cults do.

1237
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,610
And,

1238
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,630
and as they did them,

1239
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:09,370
they were even shocked and surprised that how so many people saw the church.

1240
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:09,370


1241
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:09,470
And,

1242
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,030
and how they also desperately needed attention and wanted to be a part of a group,

1243
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,870
how they joined on and how it actually turned.

1244
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,770
It could have,

1245
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,290
if it weren't for Doug and,

1246
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:19,590
uh,

1247
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,290
by managing and,

1248
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,310
and watching out,

1249
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,450
there are those people out there that are absolutely desperate and it could have turned

1250
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,270
into a real cult.

1251
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,450
And that's what the movie,

1252
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,790
that's what I wanted to show them is how even in fun and games,

1253
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,410
the loneliness and,

1254
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,810
and,

1255
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:32,990
uh,

1256
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,070
need of people to be accepted and how this thing could,

1257
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,230
could spiral out of control.

1258
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,850
And then I took it from that.

1259
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,350
So,

1260
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,590
to showing how,

1261
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,910
um,

1262
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,750
so it's the funny ha ha.

1263
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,650
And then,

1264
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,890
and the history of the church.

1265
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:49,230
But then I turned it around and showed how our government today is using,

1266
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,590
um,

1267
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,510
cult practices to divide people and,

1268
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,950
and use them to get what they want out of,

1269
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,150
uh,

1270
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,950
each other.

1271
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,450
Yes.

1272
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,630
My conservative brothers and sisters,

1273
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,110
well,

1274
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,750
brothers anyway,

1275
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,530
may not like the last 10 minutes or so of the movie,

1276
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,270
but I do.

1277
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,230
And,

1278
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:09,490
uh,

1279
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,030
and,

1280
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,470
and nobody can see it yet,

1281
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,010
except that those premiers,

1282
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,130
I don't even have a copy myself.

1283
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,590
It's not my movie.

1284
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,870
I did my best to help Sandy make it as good as possible.

1285
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:20,930
Unfortunately,

1286
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,210
about half the people interviewed ended up on the cutting room floor.

1287
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,870
And that's what happens when your movie can't be longer than 80 minutes.

1288
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,670
And it moves fast too.

1289
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:30,810
Um,

1290
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,230
I think it'll probably end up on Netflix or Amazon or somewhere later this year.

1291
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,430
Um,

1292
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,670
anyway,

1293
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,310
that was my recording of their radio show.

1294
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,750
So I was on a mic,

1295
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,190
but hearing them over the phone,

1296
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,050
I'm sure their version sounds much more professional,

1297
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,430
but here comes something way less professional.

1298
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,110
It's time for the show.

1299
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,010
The first 20 minutes of it or so.

1300
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,370
Anyway,

1301
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,810
it sounds horrible.

1302
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,670
I mean,

1303
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,970
they sound great because they're on microphones going straight into a mixer.

1304
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,410
I'm on this program called discord using my laptop's little browser.

1305
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,790
I'm on a mic and it's being transmitted by internet and some very,

1306
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,990
very low five,

1307
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,890
low res,

1308
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,750
horribly compressed and not well decompressed way.

1309
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,710
And my voice isn't coming through in real time.

1310
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:26,650
There's this intermittent lag and you can hear the signal break up and get all electronic and cut out entirely and then catch up real fast.

1311
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,570
Either that,

1312
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,050
or I really was that drunk,

1313
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:35,110
drunk enough to do some very weird electronic sounding effects just with my voice file.

1314
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,490
I thought I was when he heard.

1315
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:43,990
But probably I think they just use their new make staying sound stupid or filter rolling.

1316
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,490
Rolling.

1317
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,850
That's pretty good.

1318
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,190
You guys don't even know what that means.

1319
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:58,450
It's a it was like a Led Zeppelin song or something,

1320
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,150
right?

1321
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,150
My favorite song.

1322
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,850
It had to do with real to real tapes.

1323
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,390
Having to get up to speed.

1324
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:08,590
So that they can.

1325
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:08,990
Boring.

1326
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,450
This week on time for the show,

1327
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:27,310
Winnie the Pooh calls in from prison to say that he was framed and has no idea where those naked pictures of Christopher Robin came from.

1328
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,290
Dr.

1329
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:37,270
Fox reveals the health benefits of using your own pee for fall water and Reverend P shows off the results of his new vocal.

1330
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,510
Transplant.

1331
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,670
I didn't.

1332
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,210
I didn't finish writing it.

1333
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,330
I stopped writing after vocal.

1334
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,450
And then I didn't.

1335
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,310
I couldn't.

1336
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,610
I couldn't keep going.

1337
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:47,990
Messed up.

1338
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:48,410
Sorry.

1339
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:48,810
Hold on.

1340
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,830
Vocal.

1341
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,390
When.

1342
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,510
No, it's.

1343
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:07,250
Broadcasting live on free think radio from the three legged studio at Hyper Cube HQ in the

1344
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1345
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1346
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1347
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1348
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1349
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1350
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1351
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1352
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1353
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1354
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1355
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1356
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,250


1357
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,890
future capital of the former Spanish Empire, Orlando, Florida.

1358
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,030
This is time for the show.

1359
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,570
The show where we get together every week to figure out what to do on next week's show.

1360
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:25,470
I'm Reverend Fitch Julie of the Church of the Broken Car Antenna and Dr.

1361
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,050
Fox.

1362
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,050
Stop it.

1363
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:27,670
The show starting.

1364
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,530
Come on.

1365
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,210
We do the show.

1366
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,670
Get away.

1367
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,270
You locked me in here.

1368
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:32,750
Just let me out.

1369
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,730
And also all the way from Salt Lagis, Utah.

1370
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:39,190
It's Reverend P. Say hi, P's.

1371
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:49,150
Oh, the the role of tonight will be played by the Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of

1372
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:49,870
the Subgenius.

1373
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,050
That's Pease's understudy.

1374
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,870
First group on P's for Scoop.

1375
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,730
I want to know where Scoop is.

1376
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,470
Please.

1377
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,370
Please.

1378
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:01,850
Please.

1379
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:02,110
Please.

1380
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,210
Well, everything's P's.

1381
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,390
Settle down, please.

1382
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,650
We got to get the show started.

1383
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,630
We got to get the show started first and then we'll get to Scoop's later, okay?

1384
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:09,930
Not a long way to go.

1385
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,610
I know you're excited and you're a handsome boy and you're a good boy, but, you know,

1386
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:14,970
we got to-

1387
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,570
I'm P's.

1388
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:16,910
I'm P's.

1389
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,150
That's why you're listening.

1390
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,210
Because it's P's.

1391
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,350
Because why not?

1392
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,850
Because everything's P's.

1393
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,890
The most important thing in the world.

1394
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,490
P's.

1395
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,710
That's right.

1396
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,470
You're good.

1397
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:32,430
You're an important boy.

1398
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,370
You're the very most important thing in the world.

1399
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,050
Important and handsome.

1400
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,710
Very important.

1401
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1402
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1403
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1404
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1405
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1406
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1407
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,710


1408
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,110
Very handsome.

1409
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,190
That's right, Dr. Fox.

1410
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,230
I forgot to mention that.

1411
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,130
And funny, too.

1412
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,990
Super funny and original.

1413
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,950
Hold on, let me-

1414
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,070
Okay, look, you guys.

1415
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:49,130
He told me to say that stuff.

1416
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:55,430
He said that I'm supposed to say something about where Scoop's and that was going to

1417
00:45:55,430 --> 00:46:02,630
make Dr. Fox mad and that would make the show better and I said it, but it didn't work.

1418
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:11,630
And I'm beginning to lose face in P's because his advice has been terrible so far.

1419
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,330
Well, except that one time when he said to let the girls in free.

1420
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,290
Well, I'd like to thank you, Stang, for taking time away from your busy schedule of looking

1421
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,910
for Buddy to join us on the show tonight.

1422
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,690
Is Buddy okay?

1423
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,390
Is Buddy okay?

1424
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,610
Is Buddy okay?

1425
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,350
Is Buddy okay?

1426
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,010
Okay.

1427
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,090
I have no idea, actually.

1428
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,250
Claudia's been the one that's been whining.

1429
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:40,650
What?

1430
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,370
Squeaking.

1431
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,190
Oh, no, no, Buddy is okay.

1432
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,470
He's, I just looked over.

1433
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,150
He's at the office toilet drinking water.

1434
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,650
We still have just water in the toilets here.

1435
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:57,510
Someday it will be whiskey.

1436
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,630
But he's, he just had him a good old gulp.

1437
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,610
He just had a good gulp.

1438
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,670
He seems to be fine.

1439
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,570
He's used to me doing this kind of thing.

1440
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:13,370
The other dog is not, and she really didn't like me doing radio up in the office.

1441
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:19,070
In her mind, I should be doing radio down at Tarzan's radio station,

1442
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:26,050
which is much further down in the tree from where we are now, the tree house.

1443
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,610
Third branch to the right.

1444
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:34,650
Yeah, you know, dogs don't understand technical stuff,

1445
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:41,750
but I don't have a wife right now, so the dogs are the best I can do.

1446
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,190
Is that legal?

1447
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,130
It's the closest thing I have to a wife.

1448
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,550
Maybe he has been taking advice from peas.

1449
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:54,310
If there's one thing I know peas is good at,

1450
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,590
it's probably irritating his wife enough for him.

1451
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,510
For her to just leave.

1452
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,370
I don't think we've ever even had her on the show.

1453
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,490
Well, you know, that's the mark of a really tight marriage,

1454
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,670
is a lot of fighting and irritation,

1455
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,590
stuff that looks to outsiders like,

1456
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:22,050
oh my God, this is such a bitter, horrible, dysfunctional relationship.

1457
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:27,070
But it's actually a normal conversation.

1458
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,890
Between husband and wife.

1459
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:36,730
It may sound like sarcasm and some sort of sex as a weapon.

1460
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:41,290
But that's just because you're not used to it.

1461
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,350
You know, that's...

1462
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,370
You bring up a good point.

1463
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,670
I'm glad you say that because I was telling that to the cops last night

1464
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,990
and they weren't hearing it.

1465
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,370
You know?

1466
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:52,690
We're married.

1467
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,850
That was my right.

1468
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,150
They didn't have to do that.

1469
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,490
And you know what?

1470
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,410
It didn't strengthen our bonds at all.

1471
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:05,730
But maybe it's that time that we should look inwards

1472
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,150
and at the taser marks.

1473
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,530
So this is a show.

1474
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:18,670
And we always talk about doing some sort of show.

1475
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:24,050
But now the griddle is on and the cakes are burning.

1476
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:26,590
What are we going to do now, Fid?

1477
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:27,350
Well,

1478
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,290
this being probably one of the most professional radio productions,

1479
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,030
nay,

1480
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,150
human endeavors of all time.

1481
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:36,770
Absolutely.

1482
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,230
The producer has given me a bio for our guest

1483
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,790
that I've been reading over

1484
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,690
because I...

1485
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,190
Be honest.

1486
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:46,130
I don't know who this guy is.

1487
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:46,750
What's his name?

1488
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,110
Evan?

1489
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,830
Evan Strong?

1490
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:48,650
Evan Stram.

1491
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:49,530
Evan Stram.

1492
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,850
Evan?

1493
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:50,270
Yeah.

1494
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:50,830
Anyway,

1495
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,450
thanks for joining us,

1496
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,710
Mr. Evan Stram.

1497
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:56,950
And I've been looking through your bio here.

1498
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,190
A lot of interesting things.

1499
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,890
It says here that Stephen Hawking

1500
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,170
was your high school baseball coach.

1501
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,170
What was that like?

1502
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,090
Tell us what that was like.

1503
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,390
Tell the viewers what that was like.

1504
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,050
What was that like?

1505
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,830
Did he teach you how to throw a fastball,

1506
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,410
Reverend Stang?

1507
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,710
Yeah, with a curve.

1508
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,670
Get it?

1509
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,570
Because it's like a science joke.

1510
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,970
I laughed at it.

1511
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:26,910
Reach for the stars.

1512
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:27,690
They said.

1513
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,210
Come on, Dr. Fox.

1514
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:30,670
You can do it.

1515
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,990
Well, they said that we needed to have some...

1516
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,350
You know, when we go down to radio show school,

1517
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:41,130
they tell us, you know, grab guests,

1518
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,650
look for somebody,

1519
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,490
like look for a filmmaker,

1520
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,990
look for a writer,

1521
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,690
look for like an audio producer,

1522
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:52,410
and look for somebody from Texas.

1523
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,710
But we couldn't get Alex Jones this week.

1524
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:56,590
So, you know,

1525
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,150
we got his number one fan.

1526
00:50:59,310 --> 00:50:59,870
Absolutely.

1527
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:01,290
Or do we?

1528
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,030
Is he still here?

1529
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,290
I know the subgeniuses for what they was.

1530
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,010
And I know Bob Dobbs for what he was.

1531
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,810
My family while crossing the Great Plains

1532
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:23,390
was abducted by aliens and taken up.

1533
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:26,470
And I grew up among the aliens.

1534
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,570
And then was put back on Earth with the human beings.

1535
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,770
And let me tell you,

1536
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:37,650
I have a horrible, terrible story to tell

1537
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,030
that will prove that all of you,

1538
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,070
all of us are prisoners forever

1539
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,730
in a cage of our own ignorance.

1540
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,390
It's the saddest story in the world.

1541
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,970
And I'm about to...

1542
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,950
I'm about to tell it...

1543
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:55,590
God.

1544
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:56,570
God.

1545
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,710
Yeah, I think my heart's seasoned up again.

1546
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,310
Quick, get staying as oil can.

1547
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,650
Where's that dog?

1548
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,650
Where's the doggy?

1549
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,510
Come on, Claudia, get over here.

1550
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,050
Have the dog lick your joints,

1551
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,430
but not the blunts.

1552
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,130
They've got neosporin in their saliva.

1553
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,950
It's good for you.

1554
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,770
It's nature's candy.

1555
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,050
I just need her to lick my scabs.

1556
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:26,330
She's good.

1557
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,050
Dog has good candy.

1558
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:29,890
You're good, too.

1559
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,390
You're good.

1560
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:32,650
My wife's away.

1561
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,930
And I'm having to work with the best that I can,

1562
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,310
you know, best replacement I can get.

1563
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:39,770
Aw.

1564
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,130
Stan, you want me to come over there and snuggle with you?

1565
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,270
I'll let you be the inside spin.

1566
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,050
What?

1567
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,510
What?

1568
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:49,730
Huh?

1569
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,730
Everything just went black.

1570
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,990
I can't hear anything.

1571
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:53,870
Can't see anything.

1572
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:54,390
Whoa.

1573
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:54,850
Whoa.

1574
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:55,950
Slow.

1575
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,170
Down.

1576
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,710
I know you're down south, but come on.

1577
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,510
Put that thang down before you hurt somebody.

1578
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:05,510
Ho, ho.

1579
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:05,790
Right.

1580
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,030
Give me five, Dr. Fox.

1581
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:08,970
Can you?

1582
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,610
Yeah.

1583
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:12,650
Can you speak English?

1584
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:17,890
Can you speak English to me?

1585
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:21,870
Well, I'm, uh, hold on.

1586
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,010
Let me find maybe something to read.

1587
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,230
Did we get any mail this week?

1588
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,570
Something I could look at that I could read to Reverend Stang

1589
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:39,330
and prove to him that I am indeed in all of my faculties

1590
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:43,650
where all the teachers go and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes?

1591
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,350
Well, we do have, like, some viewer mails,

1592
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,130
but I can always keep rifling through the mailbag.

1593
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:50,930
Well, you know what?

1594
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,310
If you would so desire.

1595
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,270
We've got those that we're going to do later,

1596
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,990
and we're going to play Is It a Band?

1597
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:02,370
with guest gay married judges, Dr. Scalpod and Dr. Cosmack.

1598
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,110
They are not only judges.

1599
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,270
They are legally recognized matrimonial couple,

1600
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,210
and good for them, and I support that.

1601
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,510
But we're also going to do...

1602
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:22,570
You guys, I have a letter from a listener.

1603
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,990
Well, that, uh...

1604
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:25,710
Wow.

1605
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,690
Lord Ferg photographed it.

1606
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:35,490
It was like he found it on a campground that Wisteria placed.

1607
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,210
It's a letter to Bob, and I can read it to you,

1608
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:44,050
and it's just what you're looking for.

1609
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,490
Okay?

1610
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,770
You want to hear it?

1611
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,510
Prove it.

1612
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,350
I love that our guests have come more prepared than our hosts.

1613
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,490
It started off with a piece of paper that was really,

1614
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:56,630
really crumpled up,

1615
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,210
and then found and uncrumpled.

1616
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,210
And it says,

1617
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,870
Dear, Bob,

1618
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,130
Please don't make me.

1619
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:11,630
We both know that it was surprise evidence,

1620
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,190
and you need money,

1621
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:14,930
and you...

1622
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:22,130
So remember that call that you said people,

1623
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,150
any plus payment.

1624
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:25,470
Okay.

1625
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,530
And you're...

1626
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:29,050
Uh...

1627
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,990
Oh, that's crossed out.

1628
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,530
And you need to tell...

1629
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,390
Leave all of your evidence.

1630
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,770
And there's no contract,

1631
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,830
and we don't know the money,

1632
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:46,590
so ha-ha,

1633
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,650
and go foog yourselves.

1634
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,390
Love,

1635
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,430
V-O-R-T,

1636
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:55,450
V-O-R-T,

1637
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1638
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1639
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1640
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1641
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1642
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1643
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1644
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1645
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1646
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:55,450


1647
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,670
V-I-O-U-R-T.

1648
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:02,330
And then there's a little cartoon of a man,

1649
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,990
a stick figure hanging another person.

1650
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:10,490
And the person hanging is labeled you,

1651
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,590
and the person doing the hanging is labeled me.

1652
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:20,970
So this was an actual letter from listeners to J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1653
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,010
and I guess the rest of us.

1654
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:26,330
And I think it's a little bit of a surprise

1655
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:26,970
since Bob...

1656
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,110
Well, the first part of the letter sounded way too coherent

1657
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,030
to be written by a subgenius,

1658
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,950
but the picture sounds about right.

1659
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:35,850
Well...

1660
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,070
Well, exactly.

1661
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,810
We get a lot of mailed, you know,

1662
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:45,550
the more them kind pills sort of letter.

1663
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,310
And believe it or not,

1664
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:51,570
they still come in just as hot and heavy now

1665
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,810
as they did in the early 80s.

1666
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:55,450
Now, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get them out,

1667
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:55,710
but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get them out

1668
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:56,610
because I don't want to play any more of that.

1669
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,330
Maybe I was that drunk.

1670
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,770
Plus, they were using that new novelty audacity filter

1671
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:05,790
called stupifier or the stangifier.

1672
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,570
Fah. Fooey.

1673
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,970
But, I mean, if I'd been that drunk,

1674
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,090
I'd remember it, right?

1675
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,010
Oh, wait. Huh.

1676
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,490
Well, it had been a long day,

1677
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,430
and it's been almost an hour of show.

1678
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,630
If you want links to hear these other shows

1679
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,430
or read our old Outer Boundaries,

1680
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,890
or print books,

1681
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,250
you can try subgenius.com

1682
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,390
and specifically the radio tab

1683
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:31,470
at the top of the homepage.

1684
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:36,250
You can do all kinds of things at subgenius.com.

1685
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,750
We can't even tell you about most of them

1686
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,730
on these broadcast airwaves

1687
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,870
because, you know, humans might be listening.

1688
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,630
So, shhh.

1689
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,050
Humans.

1690
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,850
Filmed.

1691
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:21,210
despite being a danger

1692
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,130
that's a stop

1693
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,070
since one cannot describe

1694
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:31,150
the indescribable one must describe it as well obviously you've got some

1695
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:37,110
reference point there so I mean what is it is it like a you see the rotten

1696
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:47,190
rotten fruit that can you buy that's you know already has a little spot you get

1697
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:52,450
to the bottom of them this nice little strawberry trays strawberries green

1698
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:59,050
baskets and you have the wonderful strawberries on top are so beautiful at

1699
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:03,650
home when you finally get to those scrawny little ones in the bottom of the

1700
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:09,770
basket they're already moldy spots I hate that I'm gonna kill that grocer

1701
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:15,070
but no this cult work isn't easy after all aren't we all looking standing above

1702
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:21,070
the city or calling 848 4425 why won't they call us at 848 a certain amount of

1703
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:22,430
fortran you know what I mean

1704
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:42,690
the problem is they don't know how to build rapport with such geniuses and we don't know sometimes how to end conversations with telephone talkers who just won't quit yes the callers don't know the importance of active listening how to hear what we're really saying or how to avoid the most common and annoying telephone blunders

1705
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:44,010
oh what

1706
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,650
premature Emmett

1707
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,710
stand back push him in the hole

1708
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:52,170
that was easy but let's be in our guard in case that happens again

1709
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:52,350
hey

1710
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:53,070
the racer

1711
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:53,150
hit it

1712
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,170
and

1713
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,070
the

1714
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:56,330
pulling

1715
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,350
away

1716
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:00,730
cool

1717
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,390
yeah

1718
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,430
full

1719
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:20,010
fire

1720
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,610
They can't hear.

1721
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,570
They flap so hard they flap together.

1722
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,750
Shake the minute the honey's off the lady.

1723
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,150
You?

1724
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,530
Who is this?

1725
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,010
Flap him.

1726
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,910
Uh-huh.

1727
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:29,130
Flap him.

1728
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,010
Uh-huh.

1729
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,870
If that answers your question, why aren't you here?

1730
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,790
This caused many symptoms.

1731
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:36,690
Why aren't you here?

1732
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,410
Then came a thunderous wake.

1733
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:39,850
Louder and funnier.

1734
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,070
Which jolted the very dumpster into which the shaft of subgeniality had been sunk.

1735
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,250
Try to make him louder.

1736
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,330
I can hardly hear it.

1737
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:52,370
You know, it seems that these callers just don't have the moxie to stand up close to the rectifier and belt it out.

1738
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,070
Yes, it is incredible.

1739
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:02,650
Cephaloptopods of timeless beauty inhabit the show and reduplicate geometrically, forcing back the abominable juggernaut of normal race.

1740
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:03,170
What's he talking about?

1741
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:06,930
All over his body at the marks of a giant, unpointed, bedrocky...

1742
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:07,990
Making me all crazy.

1743
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,630
Must reach oxygen.

1744
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:12,970
Lacking out.

1745
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,650
Can't take it.

1746
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:15,350
All home.

1747
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:17,010
Uh-huh.

1748
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,950
Here, this show provides SAR, DBS, and real beam mapping.

1749
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:21,670
Uh-huh.

1750
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,090
Cue night of slack shooting tape.

1751
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,170
Store the frame.

1752
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,670
Okay, we need to display up now.

1753
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,010
Now let's go back in.

1754
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,130
You say you saw some kind of...

1755
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,410
Okay, callers setting the Doppler coordinates.

1756
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,190
You shouldn't be able to...

1757
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,910
What kind of monster did you see?

1758
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,370
Oh, that kind, eh?

1759
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,490
A wise guy, huh?

1760
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:41,730
Well, say, you must be playing me for a sap.

1761
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:42,810
What a joke.

1762
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,030
What do you think I am, a sap?

1763
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:46,710
Was it?

1764
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:47,410
That last what?

1765
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:48,390
No, that last one.

1766
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,870
That last one wasn't him, was it?

1767
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:50,650
No.

1768
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,030
Was it him?

1769
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:52,970
It wasn't him, no.

1770
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:53,590
No.

1771
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:55,550
It was one of those cigars.

1772
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,750
I think it was a cigar.

1773
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:57,430
That scar?

1774
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:58,730
Oh, he had a cigar.

1775
01:01:59,030 --> 01:01:59,390
Oh, no.

1776
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,890
That scar came from the war.

1777
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,130
Well, it could be.

1778
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:04,110
I don't know.

1779
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:04,730
I'm not sure.

1780
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,690
Perhaps, Doctor, it was a member of that secret society...

1781
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,230
That's a good idea.

1782
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,390
The egg worshiper.

1783
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,510
Where is that substance?

1784
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:13,590
It could have been an egg worshiper, one of the albuminati, calling us to...

1785
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:14,810
Well, thanks.

1786
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,310
...to perform a cruel...

1787
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,330
...cruel yoke on the Church of the Subgenius.

1788
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:19,910
Cruel yoke?

1789
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:22,130
Say, don't mind if I do.

1790
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:22,970
Yeah.

1791
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:23,650
Yeah, go ahead.

1792
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,250
Slap your lips and have some palaver.

1793
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,270
Slap your lips?

1794
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,670
Wow.

1795
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:27,870
Okay, okay, stand back.

1796
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,430
Now, I'm not prejudiced.

1797
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,430
Some of my best friends are callers.

1798
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,310
Slap your jaws and...

1799
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,750
...for humanity.

1800
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:39,050
That's just the way it is.

1801
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,590
Caller, caller!

1802
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:46,170
8-1-4-4-2-5.

1803
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,210
8-1-4-4-5.

1804
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:48,630
8-1-4-4-5.

1805
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,630


1806
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:54,610
However, off the public supported airwaves, I can tell you to send $35 or you will die

1807
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,550
on X-Day, or something much, much worse.

1808
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:03,510
And if you already have become a Subgenius minister, gotten that huge 25-piece membership

1809
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:09,350
kit with button and bumper stickers and minister's card and many frameable certificates and lots

1810
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:15,510
of dog's heads, you might not have the book of the Subgenius or Neighbor World or even

1811
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,050
our world famous pamphlets.

1812
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:19,390
Over 100,000 sold.

1813
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,170
Well, not Neighbor World, about 80 of those, maybe.

1814
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:24,650
But come on, man!

1815
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,170
A thing?

1816
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:32,310
For that matter, there's fast clothing designs and drinkware with Subgenius graphics on them

1817
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:39,650
and all manner of fine Dobbsware and Dobbs gimmickry and Bob Daggetts and DVDs of movies,

1818
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,930
good and bad ones.

1819
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,470
Mostly pretty good and very weird.

1820
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,490
And CDs of what we did.

1821
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:49,890
Before the radio shows and after, like stage shows and such.

1822
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:57,210
Boy, it's just an immense mess of keen and yet sacred collectibles, enjoyables and guilty

1823
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:57,870
pleasures.

1824
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:02,590
And the book of the Subgenius is autographed when you get it from us.

1825
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,590
Not by Bob, no, sorry, just me.

1826
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,950
Philo and Sterno and Byron and Onan are all going to be here soon for that movie premiere,

1827
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,550
though, and maybe I'll get them to sign the copies I have in stock.

1828
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,430
I won't let peas do it, though.

1829
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,810
I better order those books.

1830
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:24,850
Anyway, thank you, friends, and good night or good day or whatevs.

1831
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:26,050
Praise Bob.

1832
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:26,350
.
