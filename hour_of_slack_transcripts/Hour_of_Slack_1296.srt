1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
When Princess Wee and I drive home from WCSB, we hear Dr. Sinister talking about how crappy our show was.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,340
Yeah, he does that a lot. I hear that a lot.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,740
And what show is it, Ivan Stang?

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,280
It's the Hour of Slark!

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,140
The voice of the Church of the Subgenius!

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,580
With your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,300
And special guest, Lonesome Cowboy Dave!

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,040
Dave!

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,660
And now...

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,140
We are no queen of all!

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,940
Oh, wait, we can do that again.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,860
Oh, wait, that was take one.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,920
And now, it's the Hour of Slark!

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,480
Praise Bob!

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,480
With your host, of the Subgenius!

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,540
No, we got another take. Let's try it again, try it again.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,560
No, it's not gonna work.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,060
We can cut it.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:57,860
It's not gonna work.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,760
We can cut it together.

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,820
Yeah, we'll fix it in the lab.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,360
We'll fix it in the lab. Don't worry about it.

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
The lab will fix it.

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,420
The lab gets it right.

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,060
This won't even be on the air later when the people are actually hearing it.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,260
And now...

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,540
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slark!

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,700
With your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,680
And special guest star, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

30
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,820
With the beautiful Princess Wee Ardo, queen of all.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,980
The UFO.

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,680
And now...

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,100
Here's Ivan!

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,760
That's pretty good, huh?

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,860
Okay, that's a wrap.

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,020
That's a good...

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,900
We'll put that one right in the can right now.

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,980
Here's a can.

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Stick it in there.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,940
I rinsed it out.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,260
I know it was a cat food can, but it'll still work.

42
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,180
Just stick it in there.

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,220
That was a really excellent shout-out.

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,900
I must say, Reverend Stang, my mother has been a supporter of KPFA forever and ever and ever.

45
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,400
Really?

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,580
She lived in Ohio.

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,940
She sent money every month to KPFA.

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,180
Yes.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah, that's so nice.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,480
So good to give a shout-out.

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,780
Yes.

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,040
Well, she's a snowbird like us.

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Traveling, flitting from good weather to good weather.

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,160
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,020
Just hither and thither across this great land.

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,640
Ours.

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,520
Or this land of ours.

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,240
It's not great.

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
I know we're supposed to hate it, but...

60
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,880
It's wonderful.

61
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
I like the land.

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,240
I feel for those people in the flyover states.

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,040
I see them as real people.

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,620
You feel them?

65
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Yes, I feel for them.

66
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,580
You feel them, playa?

67
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,820
I feel...

68
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,820
Do you feel me, playa?

69
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,300
I do the feeling for them because they're just flyover people.

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,800
They're not real.

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,140
Not like people on the coast.

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,200
The great coast.

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,940
It was for a month.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
The great terror, planet terror.

75
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,900
Yeah, I like this.

76
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,760
There's Death Valley.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,200
You could go there.

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,280
We could go to Death Valley.

79
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,160
But we have to get on a plane and go home.

80
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,220
There's no time.

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,300
It's so sad.

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,300
Did you know that it was 10 degrees below zero?

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,640
Windshield factor.

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,200
At your house?

85
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:17,780
At your house.

86
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,980
How high at my house?

87
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,020
Now, is there someone...

88
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,020
You have, like, there's a bunch of minions there guarding your stuff.

89
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,920
You know, within...

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,880
Until tomorrow.

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Until tomorrow.

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,280
Until tomorrow.

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,280


94
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,480
Actually, there are.

95
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,420
Weaponry, right?

96
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:36,040
In fact, there is a plumber carpenter who is staying there and working on...

97
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,800
And you know what?

98
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,280
You know about plumber carpenters.

99
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,920
They have sharp tools.

100
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
They can use to defend...

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,860
Oh, and Mr. Sister.

102
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,780
They can use...

103
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,400
Defend the staying household.

104
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,780
Going in, guarding the house.

105
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm wearing the...

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,100
I'm displaying the radio.

107
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,080
Yeah, there he is.

108
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,940
Mr. Sister.

109
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,480
T-shirt.

110
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,380
There really is.

111
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,600
See?

112
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,400
Puzzling evidence.

113
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,260
The Mr. Sister.

114
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,980
Mr. Sister.

115
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,000
Nice.

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,240
Nice.

117
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,580
And this was done by Reverend Imager, the greatest troll in the world.

118
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,840
The greatest troll.

119
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,180
Who...

120
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,920
Reverend Imager.

121
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,220
It's in Polish or Russian or something.

122
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,440
It says, Mr. Sister, pork products.

123
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,060
I get it.

124
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,780
So, you see, when...

125
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,600
So, what is it?

126
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,420
The subgenius cult has become so inside joke that at the New York Revival, when the ladies

127
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,220
at the front desk of the hotel said, hey, you're the third person walking with that guy

128
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,120
on this shirt.

129
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
It wasn't Bob.

130
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
It was Mr. Sister.

131
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,500
And then Mr. Sister himself walked in and they thought, oh, my God, Dom DeLuise himself

132
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,340
is here.

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,820
I thought he was dead.

134
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
Ah, yes.

135
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,420
This is a great, great country.

136
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,160
Guess where one cult can replace another cult overnight?

137
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
At one funny looking face.

138
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,360
You know, for three years, instead of mutating dog's heads, they've mutated pictures of

139
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,320
G. Gordon Gordon.

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
Yeah, the old...

141
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,560
The subgenius has got so tired of worshipping one true God, they started worshipping his

142
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,300
bodyguard.

143
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,300
And called him that.

144
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,580
Yeah, that.

145
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,440
That.

146
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,280
That.

147
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,520
Not to be confused with that guy who is a jerk.

148
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,540
Not to be confused with who?

149
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,540
That guy.

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,660
There's that and there's God.

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,580
And then there's this jerk named that guy.

152
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,380
And there's also...

153
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:28,800
No connection.

154
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,660
But there's also another guy that's not connected, but similarly named as that one guy.

155
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, that one guy.

156
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,120
Remember him?

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,700
Yeah, people.

158
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,220
Yeah, people.

159
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,540
Sure.

160
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,620
That one guy, we never...

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,660
From that one time that we all got together, remember?

162
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,600
That one guy was there.

163
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,820
We had to kick him out.

164
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,940
That was awesome, man.

165
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,780
That was so cool.

166
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I remember that.

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,840
You know what, though?

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,560
What?

169
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,760
There was a tape of him trying to get that 14-year-old girl to have fun.

170
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,340
And not only was there a tape of it, but Ed Strange played it on his subgenius show up in Pennsylvania.

171
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,000
Really?

172
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,480
Yes.

173
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,720
Where'd that tape come from?

174
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,620
Sex is work, folks.

175
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
The kids who called that one guy.

176
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,220
Wow.

177
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,600
And they were taping the attempted...

178
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,500
What did they call it?

179
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,260
Sexual molestation of a child.

180
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,280
Over the phone.

181
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,740
Yeah.

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,780
Taped it.

183
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,840
This was long before to catch a predator.

184
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,500
Yeah.

185
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
In fact, this was...

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,540
That reality show, To Catch a Predator?

187
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,920
I saw that for the first time.

188
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,800
I've watched television this week.

189
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,340
I've been amazed.

190
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,380
They still have commercials and everything.

191
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,720
Did you see the one about the teenage mother?

192
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,540
I was a teenage mother or something.

193
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,400
That's a reality show about unwed mothers.

194
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,100
I've read about...

195
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
I've seen pictures of her on the superficial.com.

196
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Man, that one rocks.

197
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,760
That was so hot.

198
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,420
I get all my news from a celebrity website.

199
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,780
A celebrity basher.

200
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,100
I've seen a bashing website called the superficial.com.

201
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,400
I was looking at it earlier tonight.

202
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,480
I get all my...

203
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,780
I just make up my news.

204
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,240
I don't even get it anymore.

205
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,200
It's like, I waste time getting it.

206
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,820
What bothered making up?

207
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,180
You can see it when you check out the grocery store.

208
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,020
I just make up news now.

209
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,760
I mean, anytime I want.

210
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,640
When I think about news, I just think in my head.

211
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,680
Earthquake in China.

212
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah.

213
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,240
There's one right now.

214
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,440
We said it on the radio, so it'll happen too.

215
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,540
Disease wipes out all bats.

216
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,500
I hate...

217
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,280
We have to be careful about what we say because things will come true.

218
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,000
And then we'll be sad.

219
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,060
We don't just write the news.

220
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,160
We make it.

221
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,600
We make it.

222
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,980
And when we can't make it, we make it up.

223
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,840
And when we can't make it up, we steal it.

224
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,700
And when we can't steal it, we plagiarize it.

225
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,100
When we can't plagiarize it, we go out into the hallway and we find a magazine

226
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,780
and we just start taking words.

227
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
Words from page one.

228
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,780
And then some words from page six.

229
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
And then some words from page one again.

230
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,920
Isn't that how you wrote the lyrics to your last album?

231
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,080
It was just, you know, a little William Burroughs cut-up technique there.

232
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,820
I can't say I...

233
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,500
You guys weren't even doing that.

234
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,340
I did that myself.

235
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,140
The last time I saw Dr. Drummond singing in a rock band...

236
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,820
What happened?

237
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,560
Six-Fisted Tales of Connie.

238
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,980
He was...

239
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,600
The lyrics of his song were the ingredients of soda pop cans

240
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,460
and instructions for Linux installations.

241
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,780
And I was like, what the hell?

242
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


243
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


244
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


245
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


246
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


247
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


248
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


249
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


250
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:25,780


251
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
They were singing them in death metal style.

252
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,440
We were really innovative that night.

253
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,700
Coming in at the Reverend Angry Larry.

254
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,640
Hey, did you hear the amino acids had broken up?

255
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Yeah, I did hear that.

256
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,780
The only place they will ever appear again is subgenius shows.

257
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,260
Yeah.

258
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
They will be at every X-Day.

259
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,660
What a case.

260
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,040
They will be at every Devival that they can be at, but no other...

261
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,800
But no other...

262
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,180
Those aliens will not play for humans anymore.

263
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,340
Any...

264
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,600
No humans.

265
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,600
Only subgenius.

266
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,280
No more human audiences for the great amino acids.

267
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,780
Yeah.

268
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


269
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


270
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


271
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


272
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


273
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


274
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


275
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


276
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


277
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:55,780


278
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,360
They will be in blocks.

279
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,380
Well, that's okay.

280
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,020
He's got...

281
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,060
You know, you can only do...

282
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,220
That's all right.

283
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,580
They got other things they got to do with their time.

284
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,360
And being with humans is a hard thing to actually have to do, you know,

285
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,300
with regular humans.

286
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,060
When I hear this music, I think of women that have machine guns for legs.

287
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,180
No way, it's for legs, yeah.

288
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,100
Was it a machine gun or a shotgun?

289
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,800
I can't remember.

290
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,840
It was a machine gun.

291
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Is that what this is from?

292
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,480
One of those grind cows?

293
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,600
Yeah, Planet Terror.

294
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,780
I'm so jealous of that Robert Rodriguez guy who cut his fingers off to keep him from editing.

295
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,460
Yeah, I'm with you.

296
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,660
I'm so jealous of South Park guys.

297
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,840
I'd like to cut their ears off so they can't hear me.

298
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,900
I'd give you the scissors.

299
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm so jealous.

300
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,440
I'd hold your coat while you cut.

301
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,940
No matter what it is, Philo will give you the scissors.

302
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,700
I got lots of scissors.

303
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,140
Actually, Philo, a few years ago, I asked you, I said,

304
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,520
do you ever watch South Park get jealous?

305
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,420
Because we were kind of coming, you know, since we invented that.

306
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,780
Yeah, since we did.

307
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,440
And Philo said, no, not at all.

308
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,140
I feel like they're living my life for me.

309
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,280
What a slackful attitude.

310
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,620
Saving me money.

311
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,120
Thinking all the money I don't have to spend on those fancy houses

312
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,400
and cool clothes.

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,780
Cool clothes.

314
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:25,780


315
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Cool editing equipment.

316
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,220
I don't have to make those choices.

317
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,820
I can just, you know, make my regular choices.

318
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,580
Cool Korean animation company.

319
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,140
Think about that.

320
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,900
It's slack.

321
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,160
It's total slack.

322
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,280
I do not have to do that.

323
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,700
I do know how it is.

324
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm on an hour of slack number.

325
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,740
Those guys don't really have fun.

326
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,440
Got 1,290.

327
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,000
They don't really have fun.

328
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,140
They hate what they do.

329
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,880
They wish they were free of it.

330
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,200
And, you know, I can't cuss.

331
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,260
I can't cuss on the air.

332
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,560
But aside from that, I'm not beholden to any commercial.

333
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm not beholden to any audience.

334
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,300
It's not like there's anybody I have to worry about listening.

335
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,080
No.

336
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,860
It's not like I have to worry about some sponsor getting angry

337
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,600
or some listener getting offended because that's not what it's about.

338
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,720
Because I'm a true artist, like the Jackoff artist.

339
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,620
He works only for his own benefit.

340
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,660
His own truth.

341
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,360
His own satisfaction.

342
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,420
He doesn't care what others think.

343
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,320
He's a true artist.

344
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,760
Yeah, a true artist doesn't care for any type.

345
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,960
It's all about expression.

346
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,380
In a saxophone.

347
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,680
In a saxophone.

348
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,320
In a sax.

349
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,260
That's what I like about those.

350
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,500
That sax is so nasty.

351
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,580
Why did you quit Morphine?

352
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,700
The band Morphine.

353
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,300
You used to play sax in that, right?

354
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,300
Yeah, I did.

355
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,300
Yeah, for a little while.

356
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,240
Yeah, why did you quit?

357
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,580
Dana.

358
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,360
Yeah, Collie.

359
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,080
You know, got the gig after me.

360
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,000
He was a little better.

361
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,820
Actually, he was a lot better.

362
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,320
Didn't he die for you?

363
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,560
I wonder what he did after.

364
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:14,480
No, actually, the guitarist, Mark Sandman, died of a heroin-related death on stage.

365
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
That's what, okay, I knew one of them.

366
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,060
Died on stage.

367
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,020
What a way to go, man.

368
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,880
Wow, that is, now talk about cool.

369
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Doing the things he loved.

370
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,860
Talk about cool.

371
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,980
Of course, he was only like 37 or something, you know.

372
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,240
Whoa, that's even cooler.

373
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
If only he'd been 21.

374
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,460
Go out.

375
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,200
Like the only subgenius rock star.

376
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,680
Go out like a flaming candle.

377
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,200
Sublime.

378
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:38,040
You know, we actually had, there was a guy verging on being a huge rock star.

379
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,720
He was a massive subgenius fan.

380
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,880
And he did some cool songs.

381
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,740
Some really cool tunes.

382
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah, Sublime albums are great.

383
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,560
They were the only CDs that my daughter and I both liked.

384
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,280
He had a Bobhead tattoo, didn't he?

385
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,340
And he had Bobhead on their first album.

386
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah.

387
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,100
Yeah.

388
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah.

389
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,060
Yeah.

390
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,180
Yeah.

391
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,200
Yeah.

392
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


393
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


394
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


395
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


396
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


397
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


398
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


399
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


400
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


401
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


402
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


403
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


404
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


405
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


406
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,200


407
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,740
You know, we all knew him for it.

408
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,840
That's how we heard of it.

409
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,160
Yeah.

410
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,340
And they paid, then Jesus called up their manager, the record company.

411
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,560
Record company said yep, sure enough, that's your trademark.

412
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,560
Call the band.

413
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
They have to pay for it.

414
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,700
Because we're the record company and we screw the band.

415
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,500
So, we called the band and the bass player answered the phone.

416
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,560
And Jesus said you guys used our Bobhead and didn't ask us for anything.

417
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,820
He goes, yeah, our lead singer was really into that, but he's dead now.

418
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,080
We don't know what's gonna happen.

419
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,240
Yeah, it was sad.

420
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,040
He was.

421
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,220
How much would you charge him for the album?

422
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,640
We said, oh, about two grand.

423
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,500
And they sent us two grand.

424
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,540
Yeah.

425
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,140
That was the most we made.

426
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,480
We made more off of that guy's death that year than we did off anything else.

427
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,500
What was your one biggest money-making item of the year?

428
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,400
Was the money we blackmailed him into giving us the Dobbs head?

429
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:53,440
We made more money off of out-of-court settlements of Dobbs head rip-offs than we did off of actual sales.

430
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,080
We'll probably do that this year, too.

431
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,880
It'll be one of our biggest items this year.

432
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,600
Oh, man.

433
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,020
If only Steve Spielberg.

434
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,740
It's in the projections.

435
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,680
I mean, we have to do it for budget considerations.

436
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,840
We put that in our projections for our revenue projections for later in the year.

437
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,260
You know, in that family court, we took that child away from the subgenius family.

438
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,000
Right, right.

439
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,880
And we made more money that year because it made so much news.

440
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Publicity and stuff.

441
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,480
I've got a brilliant idea.

442
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,660
We've got to do it to another family.

443
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,160
Exactly.

444
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Yeah.

445
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,340
You know?

446
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm thinking of.

447
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,440
Who?

448
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,320
Spiridix.

449
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,240
A nice family.

450
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,660
They're at X Day every year.

451
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,160
Happens to have a nice little child.

452
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,420
Happens to be a nice-looking mom.

453
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,020
Milf, who's been in some pretty compromising photographs on our website.

454
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,120
Got to have all the ingredients there.

455
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,160
They live in a small town.

456
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,980
Don't say their name.

457
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,720
Don't say their name.

458
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,480
They would be big news in the computer world.

459
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
We've got to clear it with them first.

460
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,100
Huh?

461
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,500
We've got to clear it with them first.

462
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,480
No, no.

463
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Well, it doesn't.

464
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,020
This has to be done anonymously.

465
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,760
Oh, God.

466
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,720
That's right.

467
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,300
I just blew you.

468
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm a certain kind of gringo that I'm not going to say what kind I am.

469
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
You just so told everybody.

470
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,660
But fans of the movie Sorcerer will know what kind of gringo I am.

471
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,420
What's the highest during the day?

472
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,220
I'm a fan of the movie Sorcerer, and I can't remember that.

473
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm a big fan of it.

474
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,520
Gringo.

475
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,160
Sorcerer, the guy's driving the truck.

476
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,120
Are you driving the truck?

477
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
I love that movie.

478
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,080
I actually have it.

479
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:32,860
Roy Steiner is being harassed by this cop in a little Central American town at this sheriff guy.

480
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,420
And he goes, why are you doing this to me?

481
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:43,240
And the policeman says, because you are a stupid gringo.

482
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,360
And every day I find myself telling Princess Marie,

483
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,860
you know, you're married to a certain.

484
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,040
And I think you know what kind I'm talking about.

485
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,260
Yeah, I know about that.

486
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,020
Man, that was a great movie.

487
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,480
When they're driving that truck, those truck driving scenes are just great.

488
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,200
They're driving that nitro, that old truck in the rain.

489
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,080
It's based on an old French movie called Wages of Fear.

490
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:08,660
Right.

491
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,720
Which has a much better looking native booker.

492
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,660
Really?

493
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah.

494
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,160
But does it have a William Peter Blatty in that?

495
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,080
No.

496
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,680
What did he have to do with that movie?

497
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,740
Nothing.

498
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:21,980
Nothing.

499
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,980
William Friedkin.

500
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,780
William Friedkin.

501
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,920
Yeah, William Friedkin.

502
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,980
Also.

503
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,940
I knew it was a William.

504
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,720
One of those Williams.

505
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
He knows a popular name.

506
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,420
The Exorcist and Bug.

507
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:32,760
Bug.

508
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,120
If you haven't seen that, you need to.

509
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,680
Really?

510
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,180
Bug.

511
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,200
That William Friedkin.

512
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,020
It's a beautiful.

513
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Yeah, I'm surprised.

514
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,680
There's something about Sorcerer that is just.

515
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,000
It was beautiful.

516
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,060
It was beautifully filmed, I believe.

517
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,620
That truck was.

518
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,980
Driving that truck.

519
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:51,980


520
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,640
Yeah.

521
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,480
Across that bridge.

522
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,340
That one bridge.

523
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,180
That dynamite in the background.

524
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,900
Nitro.

525
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah.

526
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,580
How do you know?

527
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,460
Is this Alvin and the Chipmunks doing?

528
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,120
Yeah.

529
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,440
Yeah.

530
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,260
Everybody does Beautiful World now.

531
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,040
That's what I thought.

532
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah.

533
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,160
You checked out the new Alvin.

534
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,200
Have you ever seen this one yet?

535
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh, yeah.

536
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,420
Yeah.

537
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,060
That's what it is.

538
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,760
Oh, that's D 2.0.

539
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,180
Yeah.

540
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,020
So it's really Alvin and the Chipmunks doing it.

541
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,420
Yeah.

542
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,980
All the young people.

543
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


544
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


545
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


546
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


547
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


548
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


549
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:21,980


550
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,440
You know, the plastic hats.

551
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,540
The way it was.

552
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,460
I know for me.

553
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,900
Yeah, I know.

554
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,080
Whatever.

555
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah.

556
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey, I'm at the.

557
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,920
I had a copy of this book.

558
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,260
I couldn't listen to it more than once.

559
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,080
I would go to that every year.

560
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,140
They're a lot of fun.

561
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:33,780
Yeah.

562
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,420
Really great.

563
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,160
I would think so.

564
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,260
That's a good audience, man.

565
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,060
A couple of years ago, Bob Casale cooked dinner for everybody at the Devo-tional.

566
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,140
Really good chicken curry or something like that.

567
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,840
I'll be.

568
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,500
Yeah.

569
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,860
That was a lot of each other.

570
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,280
I know.

571
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,380
I know.

572
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,920
The Devo's are nice fellas.

573
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:52,820
Yeah.

574
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,140
They're nice.

575
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,820
All the ones on there.

576
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,060
They cook chili.

577
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,360
They're nice fellas.

578
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,660
Chili is as good as ten mothers in the theater.

579
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,080
Well, it sure has been great having you guys here in the.

580
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,320
Yeah.

581
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,440
Sorry you have to leave tonight.

582
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:02,620
On the show tonight.

583
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,820
Or this morning or whatever.

584
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,060
Yeah.

585
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,460
Tomorrow night we'll be back.

586
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
I'll be back at.

587
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm tuning in WCSV to make sure they play the right.

588
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,740
The right.

589
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,160
Yeah.

590
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,080
You got to do that.

591
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,320
Keep on top of them.

592
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,920
We'll be back just in time.

593
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,260
And that's if we can dig our car out of the snow in the short period of time.

594
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,440
The long term parking lot.

595
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:22,680
Yeah.

596
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,080
I hear that.

597
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,560
They're not.

598
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,080
Chipping in from the ice.

599
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,780
Worrying about that.

600
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,760
They're just going to let them melt.

601
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,940
You find mammoths in between the cars.

602
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,060
Let their minds melt?

603
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,360
It's like you can't get it now.

604
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,500
Do you ever want to.

605
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,160
Meld.

606
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:34,660

607
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:34,940

610
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,340
Yes.

611
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,860
Yes.

612
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,640
They're going to quit plowing.

613
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Make mine a double.

614
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,960
Okay.

615
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,100
Call her your last few minutes here.

616
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,980
Make it good.

617
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:42,900
Yeah.

618
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,220
Oh, sorry.

619
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,700
Sorry.

620
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,640
I've heard her before.

621
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:45,960
Yeah.

622
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,680
What am I supposed to.

623
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
She calls a lot.

624
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,240
I didn't take any notes.

625
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,840
What do I do?

626
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,480
The radio.

627
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,200
You push button A.

628
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,780
Okay.

629
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,880
Oh, yeah.

630
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,740
Slider one.

631
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,380
Yeah.

632
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Turn down my mind.

633
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,340
I'm at the beach now.

634
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,260
Part three.

635
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,720
Dave, I'm fighting you out now.

636
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,000
Dave.

637
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,920
Dave, I am fighting you out.

638
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,060
I always hate that part.

639
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,700
Because little Dave disappears.

640
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Goodbye, little Dave.

641
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,820
Yeah, I don't think I like to have Dave fade out.

642
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,360
Well, we don't have Dave here tonight.

643
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:12,960
No, no.

644
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,300
He's here.

645
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,660
No, it's just the virtual Dave.

646
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,000
He was just here.

647
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,360
Yeah, he was just here in the mix.

648
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,420
So, that's a wonderful thing.

649
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,220
It's so cool.

650
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,260
It's so cool.

651
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:20,260


652
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,680
It's a beautiful world.

653
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,660
It is.

654
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,200
For you.

655
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,500
It's such a sarcastic song.

656
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,380
It actually is a beautiful world for me.

657
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,560
Yeah, it's a beautiful world for you, too.

658
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,120
I have slack.

659
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,040
I didn't always have slack.

660
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,160
I had to earn my slack somehow or accept my slack, actually.

661
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,940
You don't earn it.

662
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,200
No.

663
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,820
You simply accept the slack that you were born with.

664
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,780
And for me, most of the time, it is a beautiful world.

665
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,520
You have to accept it much like you put on a jacket or a coat.

666
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
I may be cursing bitterly in five minutes from now.

667
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


668
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


669
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


670
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


671
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


672
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,240


673
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,220
I may be cursing bitterly in five minutes from now and feel like it's a terrible life.

674
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,680
But right now, it's great.

675
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:55,980
It's a terrible life.

676
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,540
It's a terrible life.

677
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,680
For you.

678
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,160
For you.

679
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,180
For you.

680
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:05,720
Not for me.

681
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,300
Not for me.

682
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,700
Not for me.

683
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,600
Not for me.

684
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,260
You interrupted our recording session, man.

685
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,160
Keep going.

686
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,680
On top of the grill.

687
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,720
On top of the grill.

688
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:18,940
Okay.

689
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,860
See you next week.

690
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,200
Yeah.

691
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,220


692
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,220
Bye.

693
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,160
Bye.

694
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,160


695
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,160


696
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,560
This was great.

697
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,560


698
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,560


699
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,560


700
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,120
I'm ready for donuts.

701
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,100
Donuts and show.

702
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,540
Oh, yeah.

703
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,580
You're right.

704
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
The show's going very slowly tonight.

705
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,740
It's like one minute.

706
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,300
It's going really super slow.

707
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:36,640
One minute left.

708
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,560
Sand is slipping through the eyes.

709
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,460
Ah, okay.

710
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,740
Well, I'm going to go get a head start on the donuts.

711
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,380
No, I didn't say one line from my script here.

712
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,740
I'll do one.

713
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,060
Here.

714
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
I'm going to do one line from my script.

715
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,180
Okay.

716
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,800
Every day is X day when you have a billion dollars.

717
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,040
That's true.

718
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,700
So true.

719
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,200
I've done one line from my script.

720
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:56,760
Excellent.

721
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,320
That was my line, too.

722
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,440
Think of what it could have been.

723
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,900
Think of what it could have been.

724
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,440
Really cool.

725
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,240
The words of Ivan saying you're on the show and goodbye.

726
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,560
Riveting.

727
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,880
I can't turn off Queen of UFOs.

728
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,200
It would be like Dave disappearing.

729
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,260
This is the Hour of Slack number 1296.

730
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:30,400
That was the last 20 minutes of the Puzzling Evidence show of January 28th, 2011.

731
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:39,500
And what follows is the first 38 minutes of the Puzzling Evidence show of February 4th, 2011.

732
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,240
A broadcast from KPFA in Berkeley, which is not the station you are hearing now.

733
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,480
And the phone numbers of which you should never call.

734
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,060
And now, the news.

735
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,780
Farms?

736
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,220
In Dobstown?

737
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,520
Hello?

738
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Yes, it's true.

739
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,140
In historic Dobstown, now agricultural production is up 20%.

740
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,180
The year 2011 promises to be the year of the world.

741
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:17,620
It's to be the brightest one in a series of bright lights on the horizons of international agriculture

742
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:24,100
and the great financial transfer made possible by their success.

743
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,580
And a direct score on the show.

744
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:35,320
In other news, scientists have determined that the solar system is filled with many black holes

745
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,060
the size of the atomic nucleus of peanut butter.

746
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


747
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,240
Junkie or smooth?

748
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,020
Smooth.

749
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,060
And where are they?

750
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,620
Near us?

751
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,480
I hope not.

752
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,560
I don't want to be a mean man.

753
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,880
Ha ha ha.

754
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:09,920
Philo Drummond, Dr. Philo Drummond has just now noticed that I, Van Stang, have confiscated his microphone.

755
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,800
I, yes I'll admit I lied last week.

756
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,300
We said that we were going to get it on a plane last Sunday and take off.

757
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,520
But, uh, that's actually this week.

758
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:27,840
We didn't want to advertise the fact that the Slacker Mansion was empty for that whole week.

759
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,320
But, we'll be home tomorrow evening.

760
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,680
Uh, back in our crop circle where we live.

761
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,160
The one with the...

762
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,460
The giant blue concrete gorilla brought in front.

763
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,680
Yeah, yeah.

764
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,180
I repainted that gorilla, by the way.

765
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,700
The giant concrete gorilla.

766
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,360
I thought it looked good the way it was.

767
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,860
You can't improve on perfection.

768
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,880
Well, it wasn't perfection.

769
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,840
It actually had been so covered with bat droppings and bird droppings that it needed cleaning really bad.

770
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,300
Well, it made it look like it was a silverback.

771
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,280
I know just how that silverback felt, too.

772
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,140
Good night, Doc.

773
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,440
I wish somebody would give me a bath.

774
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
The shipments here at Dock Six.

775
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,400
Shipment at Dock Six.

776
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,140
Just a moment.

777
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,360
Uh, don't worry.

778
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,880
This gorilla can't possibly get loose, Captain.

779
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,720
These chains are made of chrome steel.

780
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,660
A bath suggestion was good.

781
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,440
We've got him locked up good and tight.

782
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,660
Uh...

783
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,860
Helicopters are being deployed.

784
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes?

785
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,280
What do you need those helicopters for?

786
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,340
I don't quite get you...

787
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:38,860
Can you?

788
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,760
Hong Kong lives.

789
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:55,220
While we're undergoing guerrilla transfer, it's probably a good time to remind our listeners that safety is always an important thing to keep in mind.

790
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,100
The moments slip, and you could be sorry for quite some time.

791
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:09,320
Just a message from the National Council of Worrywart Subgenius Usulianus.

792
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,660
Yeah, be careful, kids, and take missions.

793
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,380
Remember, when you go mountain climbing, you should always do it alone.

794
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:28,140
And if you encounter a mountain lion, you should pretend, act like his prey, and either flee or cower.

795
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,120
I think we covered that last week.

796
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,680
Under the bad advice of Dr. Howell.

797
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,600
By the drum of the overman, God, Dr. Howell.

798
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,100
Special guest stars, Ivan Stang, Princess Weave, and the UFOs.

799
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,240
It's the subgenius show of the stars.

800
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,340
It's also the hour of slack.

801
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,820
And don't forget Bishop.

802
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,400
Joey.

803
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,720
I did?

804
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh.

805
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,700
This time, maybe he won't be voted off the island.

806
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:11,940
And we have a roster of surprises for you that you'll remember for the rest of your life.

807
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:19,320
If you can dare to listen to the Puzzling Evidence Radio Program.

808
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,420
So where's that?

809
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,000
No one will be admitted during the last five minutes.

810
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,740
Just yak, okay?

811
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,280
Okay.

812
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,880
So where's the fancy Puzzling Evidence Radio Show?

813
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,360
Look for the fear flasher and the horror porn.

814
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,400
And now, in the big sky.

815
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,120
Introducing.

816
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,800
But you know, there's a lot of room in the band for all kinds of radio stations.

817
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,320
In projectile vision.

818
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,040
So, Ivan Stang, what happened on X-Day?

819
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,660
And Rumble Rama.

820
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,460
What happened on X-Day hasn't happened yet, obviously.

821
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,080
Oh, that's right.

822
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,560
It's almost.

823
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,200
X-Day will happen on July 5th, 1998.

824
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,580
And we will be able to start dating our calendars correctly.

825
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,940
Okay.

826
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,400
Moment.

827
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,400
Dating a calendar girl, eh?

828
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,380
Hey, dude.

829
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,400
So, that's some tricks.

830
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,100
Dating our calendars in the correct fashion.

831
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,680
Well, these calendars have to be post-dated.

832
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Bishop Kelly, what happened on St. Stupid's Day?

833
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,220
Oh, so many things happened on St. Stupid's Day.

834
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
I can't even begin to describe them, but I will.

835
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,700
So, the first one that happened was I showed up.

836
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,800
And then the next one that happened was other people showed up.

837
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,040
Now, that's 90% of it.

838
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,960
And then we went for a walk.

839
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,960
So, who's playing Lonesome Cowboy today?

840
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,800
And where's the queen of UFOs?

841
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,220
She's here.

842
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,040
Isn't she?

843
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,040
I don't know.

844
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,800
You can hear her snoring in the background just then.

845
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,220
Oh, it is a difficult show.

846
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
But that's that captive yeti.

847
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,500
It's on a pretend 3 a.m. hour on Earth.

848
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,940
I tell you, this is no ape.

849
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,940
This is the lost, abominable snowman, the yeti himself.

850
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,920
Why won't any of you believe me?

851
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,480
All the evidence can only point to that.

852
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,380
We don't have much time.

853
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,760
While analyzing the stool samples, doctor, I can't but concur.

854
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,620
Smell this.

855
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,500
It's getting the radio going.

856
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,980
Good lord, that is wonderful.

857
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,720
Can't but concur.

858
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,520
How does that, how do you, how do you, this but concurrence?

859
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,600
These fumits definitely presuppose the gram-inifera diet of all full-blooded yetis.

860
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,560
These strange rituals these young children are performing these days.

861
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,240
I'll just take some of this sample.

862
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,300
You're not young people.

863
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,160
Call in, 848-442-50.

864
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,260
And I suppose that concludes our session for today, doctor.

865
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,500
Good.

866
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
Can we go home and sleep now?

867
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,380
Of course.

868
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,560
I think that might not be a bad idea.

869
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:37,900
But remember, while even one of these creatures is on the loose, we won't be able to sleep well.

870
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,280
Keep that in mind, too, gentlemen.

871
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,620
If they bring a sword, I'll bring a hatchet.

872
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,160
They just want to live in peace in mountain fastness.

873
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,800
Far away from civilization.

874
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,520
If they bring a scimitar, I'll bring a broadsword.

875
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
And the bursar of human action.

876
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,120
And the scimitar of human activity.

877
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,160
Not to be back to the purity of nature's bosom.

878
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,840
But what if they bring a lawyer from Lawyer's Island?

879
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,580
Not Lawyer's Island!

880
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,800
Those who go to Lawyer's Island...

881
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Oh, no.

882
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,280
Never.

883
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,940
Why did you say the L word?

884
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
You can't say that word.

885
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,760
That's one of the seven deadly words of pride.

886
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,500
We must confront the deadly word of the lawyer.

887
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,640
Lawyer's Island.

888
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,020
Hey, man.

889
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,460
The very worst place in the world to bury...

890
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,180
Sheet music for my best song.

891
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,520
...your treasure.

892
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,160
Don't bury your treasure on Lawyer's Island.

893
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,900
Double trouble on Diamond Island.

894
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,740
I'm interested to hear how you interpret those pipe notes.

895
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,860
Oh, those notes piped by the piper at the gates of dawn?

896
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,580
Yes, we've all heard the pipes a-playing.

897
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,900
That wee piper out there capering in the meadow...

898
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,260
Oh, my God.

899
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,920
...with the goatish...

900
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,700
...leaf legs and tiny horns.

901
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,560
Ear horns, maybe.

902
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,940
That's a fawn.

903
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,060
Better than horny ties.

904
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,840
Yes, he is, isn't he?

905
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,340
Well, the thing is, you see, he is the product of certain...

906
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,300
The product of his conservative up-and-coming...

907
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,080
...lifestock, not wisely, but too well.

908
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,780
And then, in the foaling time, a tiny wee fellow would caper among the new lambs,

909
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,920
one with features of both human and...

910
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,060
How can one...

911
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,460
Goat.

912
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:25,860
...feel...

913
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:25,900
...feel...

914
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:25,900


915
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:25,900


916
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:25,960
...feel...

917
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,100
...this way?

918
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:37,140
Love is a many-splendored thing, like the gleaming polyhedron of ancient lore.

919
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm telling you, it is a bright marble.

920
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,980
Oh, at this moment, I've got a call.

921
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,260
I'm going to jam for a little while here.

922
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,940
I'm on drums.

923
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,480
Oh, jam.

924
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,860
Oh, yeah, great.

925
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,900
Me and Bishop Joey, we're going to jam.

926
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,560
Yes.

927
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,540
So, how...

928
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,800
How about it, ladies and gentlemen, Mother and Father America and all the ships at sea?

929
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:08,060
Isn't it a time that you got in lockstep with Dr. Howland Owl's renowned worldwide course in sex and real estate?

930
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,860
Ask your doctor if Dr. Howland's course in sex and real estate is right for you.

931
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:23,200
Side effects may include acute tightness, pedomorphia, erectile dysfunction, partial or complete blindness,

932
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,900
some hair loss, loss of bladder and bowel control...

933
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,000
...loss of bone density and massive loss of identity and memory.

934
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:36,940
Go 1.2 miles and turn evil.

935
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,520
Then go 3.5 miles and turn invisible.

936
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,480
Turn green.

937
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,880
Turn into a bat.

938
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,880
Go 3 miles and turn invisible.

939
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:55,880


940
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:55,880


941
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,820
You are a werewolf.

942
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,780
A werewolf?

943
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,740
A bear to the right.

944
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,780
A bear?

945
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,040
In 0.2 miles, turn and run.

946
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,720
In 0.3 miles, turn the other way.

947
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,360
This will kill you.

948
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,940
Your playing is so passionate.

949
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,200
In 4.3 miles, turn into Mr. I.

950
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,600
I.

951
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,000
I.

952
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,520
I.

953
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,860
I.

954
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


955
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


956
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


957
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


958
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


959
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


960
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


961
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


962
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


963
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


964
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


965
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


966
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


967
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


968
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


969
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


970
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


971
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


972
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


973
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


974
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


975
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


976
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


977
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


978
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


979
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:25,860


980
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,580
In 0.9 miles, turn into a zombie.

981
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,280
Some folks say this is a way that was haunted.

982
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,220
Only ghosts and skeletons and spooks go down this way.

983
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,780
In 2.1 miles, turn inside out.

984
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm not sure I like this boy.

985
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,240
In 2.5 miles, turn off the radio and do nothing.

986
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,320
Now we can relax and get in touch with our inner feral child.

987
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,000
That's not what that is.

988
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,100
I think we throw it overboard.

989
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,700
He can only communicate in a series of grunts.

990
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
His behavior at the table is most shocking.

991
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,780
We don't want him to escape.

992
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,900
We don't want to throw the feral child with the bathwater.

993
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,660
Grouching on the floor and grunting for hours.

994
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,040
Is that what that is?

995
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,620
Sure.

996
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,760
unintelligible, bestial fashion.

997
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,000
Simple electroshock clears him for a new life.

998
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,680
Here in the Institute,

999
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,920
the Kasperhauser Institute,

1000
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,960
rudiments of social behavior,

1001
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,100
balls, I say, balls,

1002
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,300
discipline and firmness.

1003
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,660
And then the great day comes,

1004
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,220
graduation day,

1005
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,140
when he leaves the wrought iron doors

1006
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,860
of the Demilitar Institute

1007
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,940
to go out and search for a job

1008
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,140
in the real world

1009
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,940
and the great shining new economy

1010
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,280
of that economic dynamite.

1011
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,800
Dynamo called America.

1012
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,720
Wow, cool.

1013
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,420
Hi, caller, did you get your job yet?

1014
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,520
Sorry, job's not available.

1015
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,480
Hi, other caller, did you get your job yet?

1016
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,820
Did you get your job?

1017
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,800
Get a job.

1018
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
State short job, please.

1019
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,540
Did you get your job?

1020
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,880
You need the patience of job.

1021
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,840
Did anybody get you a job?

1022
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,260
Oh, I see.

1023
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,540
Hey, guys, it's a secret subgenius signal.

1024
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,760
What job is that?

1025
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,180
Is it?

1026
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,040
Is there more than one opening?

1027
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,320
Sure, but somebody else has to get you a job.

1028
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,420
Oh, get the job.

1029
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah, the government has to get you a job.

1030
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:53,800
What do you know?

1031
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
Obama has to get you a job.

1032
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,180
Oh, no, someone has to get you a job.

1033
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,460
It's all about jobs, Obama.

1034
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,240
It's all about getting you a job, though.

1035
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,360
It's all about jobs.

1036
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,140
What kind of a job are you looking for, my boy?

1037
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
We've got plenty on the force.

1038
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,680
There's no job with Bob.

1039
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,820
I've got a job.

1040
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,140
I'm down with jobs.

1041
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,020
I've got a job for someone.

1042
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,660
With slobs.

1043
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,220
Oh, all right, with miniskirts.

1044
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,640
Yes, exactly.

1045
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,420
Wasn't that the way it went?

1046
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,380
Something like that?

1047
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm down with jobs.

1048
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:31,580
Well, you're supposed to repent, slack off, and quit your job for Bob.

1049
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,800
March off that production line.

1050
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,700
Assert your inner Yeti purity.

1051
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
I don't want to.

1052
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,880
I want a factory-built job.

1053
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,020
I want to make my own job.

1054
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,180
Well, don't let us keep you back, Mac.

1055
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,620
Have you got the parts for me to build my own job?

1056
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:06,920
We can provide the motive power, the inspiration that comes from our transliteration of the

1057
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
Dobbs principles.

1058
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,380
You do understand I'm looking for a good thing for that.

1059
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,060
I'm dreaming of a wide history.

1060
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,520
Just like the one I used to know.

1061
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,620
Did anybody there at the studio bring a poop dog hat for me to wear?

1062
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,800
Is anybody actually at the studio?

1063
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,760
No one is actually there, as you understand it, at the studio.

1064
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,500
Where there is.

1065
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,080
There is no there there, Gertrude Stein wrote famously of Oakland.

1066
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,700
There is no now here.

1067
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,940
Did you bring a poop dog hat for me to wear?

1068
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,620
Yeah.

1069
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:43,880


1070
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:44,960
Yeah.

1071
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah.

1072
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000


1073
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000


1074
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,000


1075
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,380
I'm going to cuff the poop dog hat.

1076
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:46,720
Yes.

1077
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,400
What is this?

1078
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,040
What of the poop?

1079
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,400
What did and what has become of the poop dog hat?

1080
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,600
Who is this king of glory?

1081
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,400
How did we?

1082
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,100
How did we?

1083
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,320
That's ancient church managed to forget the poop dog hat.

1084
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,720
And we'd have to call Stern to normalize on that one.

1085
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,140
So all the stories.

1086
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,760
Byron, because he's a historian.

1087
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,980
All but stories.

1088
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,700
Lord Byron and Pope Stern.

1089
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:09,980
Comrades.

1090
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,400
They're staying in the middle of the country because it's the safest.

1091
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,880
You know what?

1092
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,240
the beginning of the end of the world.

1093
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,820
They have a little while longer to store history

1094
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,020
than we do on the coast.

1095
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,300
The coast of the lakes or the coast of the ocean.

1096
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,000
The high coast of the...

1097
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,600
I live on the north coast.

1098
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,460
That's what they call Cleveland.

1099
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,380
The north coast.

1100
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,120
City of light, city of magic.

1101
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,640
Cleveland is city of magic?

1102
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,140
Cleveland, you gotta be tough.

1103
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,480
That actually was a motto

1104
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,660
of the city, the official motto

1105
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,840
during its darkest days.

1106
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,280
Which weren't very dark

1107
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,480
because the river was

1108
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,560
brightly lit on fire.

1109
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,620
The Cuyahoga?

1110
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,880
The Cuyahoga River was flammable

1111
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,580
in the 70s.

1112
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,580
And so was the mayor's hair,

1113
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,920
oddly enough.

1114
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,980
Just like Michael Jackson?

1115
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,940
One slogan they had,

1116
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,920
the brightest nights in Ohio.

1117
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,160
But those days are past

1118
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,660
and now there's at least

1119
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,220
three fish in Lake Erie.

1120
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,160
And you can swim in there

1121
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,980
if you really, really, really dare.

1122
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,600
What about those pleasure saucers?

1123
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,500
Oh yeah, I hear that a lot.

1124
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,160
What about those pleasure saucers,

1125
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,100
Mr. Dobbs?

1126
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,520
Mr. Dobbs?

1127
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,500
We're ready for the finals, Mr. Dobbs.

1128
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1129
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,100
It is a solution to all our problems.

1130
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,820
You know, one might as well

1131
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,380
live life normally until,

1132
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,080
until the advent of the saucer people.

1133
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,240
The message of X-Day is obviously

1134
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,140
that we know not when that hour may come.

1135
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,840
It could be tomorrow.

1136
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,700
You put your shoes on today,

1137
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,960
but the Undertaker may be

1138
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,840
yanking them off tomorrow, yes?

1139
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,240
Will you be yanked off by the Undertaker?

1140
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,420
There's only one way to avoid that,

1141
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,380
and that is to be in the Book of Life.

1142
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,420
Have your name listed in the Book of Life,

1143
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,640
which is the book of life.

1144
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,600
Which actually is implicated

1145
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,440
in a little program on my laptop.

1146
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,400
And the underwear,

1147
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,940
the underwear taker is usually preceded,

1148
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,260
preceding the Undertaker too, so.

1149
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,960
You won't enter the next world with clothing on.

1150
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,000
I have a Jack Van Impey movie

1151
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,980
in which the devil is going to put,

1152
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,260
he makes everybody get the PCD disk,

1153
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,480
and then they'll put it in their computer

1154
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,000
at the X-Day moment of the bad devil.

1155
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,940
All the PCs will come alive

1156
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,740
and make you, uh,

1157
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,240
that was the first, uh,

1158
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,940
the first Macintosh virus.

1159
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,420
That happened.

1160
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,000
In 1984.

1161
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,920
It was by Jack Van Impey and his wife

1162
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,700
who show up on a TV in a couple scenes.

1163
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,580
I don't know why.

1164
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,280
That's just to provide sheer authenticity.

1165
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,860
Jack still providing the word out there on the TV.

1166
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,320
For Dr. Reverend.

1167
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,660
I thought a piano fell on it.

1168
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,260
Well, this is,

1169
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,900
this is the peepos to talk to about that church.

1170
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,680
That's right.

1171
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,940
Is this one of the tiny collars

1172
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,320
or the large collar?

1173
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,840
I have a note.

1174
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,720
I've had a note.

1175
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
A magnetic body collar.

1176
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,260
That said,

1177
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,860
email the large.

1178
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,980
Cause I didn't mean to fool the large last week

1179
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,820
when I said we were about to leave town.

1180
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,140
A little gas.

1181
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,920
I actually wanted to meet the large.

1182
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
Well, it might be the large.

1183
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,380
Who knows?

1184
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,020
But all I know is he's got questions

1185
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,080
for the Reverend Stang.

1186
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,040
Stang.

1187
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,640
Yeah, Stang.

1188
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,540
Reverend Stang.

1189
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,120
Base fornicating bats.

1190
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,060
Base fornicating bats.

1191
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,260
Totally new.

1192
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,480
A totally new idea.

1193
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,280
A base fornicating bat.

1194
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,540
The first time anybody's ever brought this up.

1195
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,180
Well, on our show, yes.

1196
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,920
We don't go in for such grisly details.

1197
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,800
I've heard some stories about them

1198
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
and I want to know if it's true.

1199
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,460
They are simply a part of nature's mystery, my boy.

1200
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,780
It's a circle of life.

1201
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,240
The circle jerk of life in some cases.

1202
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,860
You see, they have to get rid of this sexual energy of theirs somehow.

1203
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,740
They depend on it, of course, for their survival.

1204
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,360
Oh, my God.

1205
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,280
Bringing that complicated package of germplasm forward.

1206
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,680
When the bat delivers germplasm.

1207
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,500
What the bat delivers into, obviously,

1208
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,720
there's no obvious reproductive reason

1209
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,080
for a bat to deliver its seed down a human's gullet.

1210
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,740
The bat that flits at close of eve.

1211
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,480
There's a parasite in the seed of the face fornicating bat.

1212
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,080
Okay.

1213
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,240
And this parasite,

1214
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,980
requires a human host.

1215
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,160
And it can only survive in a human host

1216
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
that occasionally smokes a pipe.

1217
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,760
It's a life cycle of some complexity.

1218
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,200
The pipeless ones are likewise

1219
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,100
probably free of the face fornicating bat parasite.

1220
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,060
It's all about the pipe.

1221
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,240
At this time, the...

1222
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,860
Well, some things are worth it.

1223
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,240
...still believe that he's speaking to live people.

1224
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,640
...private pleasure of a good...

1225
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,340
He's actually speaking to a computer.

1226
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,680
...soul food and soul.

1227
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,280
He's speaking to the pudding.

1228
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,780
It's actually...

1229
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,040
Pudding people where they want to be.

1230
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,760
...to kill the parasite

1231
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,520
before it can lay its parasitical eggs all over your hair.

1232
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,280
...horrible, writhing...

1233
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,220
That's the kissing sound of the face fornicating bats.

1234
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,520
Have you seen Alien...

1235
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,420
Echo location.

1236
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,440
If you saw Aliens, you saw the whole thing.

1237
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,860
Because they'll try to make out with you before they get serious.

1238
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,420
Well, they are amatory, certainly.

1239
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,160
...blending all the...

1240
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,600
There...

1241
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,980
Uh...

1242
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,260
They're innocent creatures just trying to return to their cave.

1243
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,660
And when you're standing on a hilltop with your mouth open, your mouth looks like a little cave.

1244
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,920
It does indeed, especially after they've been there for a while.

1245
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,200
...looks like a bat house to me.

1246
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,940
They're like little guys stepping out of the...

1247
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,280
...a...

1248
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,380
...a...

1249
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,520
...a...

1250
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:57,860
...a...

1251
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,100
...a...

1252
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:03,340
They don't wish to choke the philosophical esophagus with the roughage of knowledge.

1253
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,000
Thank you.

1254
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,200
I think that's my job.

1255
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,680
Thank you.

1256
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,920
These insects are not in a sect that is in...

1257
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,980
...I don't really think you are.

1258
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,600
...in a...

1259
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,980
Or, although they are of the brethren of the chitinous arthropod...

1260
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:22,980
...they are also, as we are, residents of our own teraqueous globe...

1261
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,920
...the planet Telos or Earth.

1262
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:27,560


1263
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:36,940
We welcome our space friends at any time, but particularly around the time of extinct.

1264
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,360
Do you see the space friends?

1265
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,820
...since the confusion of the years...

1266
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,920
...where we are now?

1267
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,480
Not when 1998 might actually advent upon us.

1268
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:53,460
Oh, brethren in space, descend upon us with your giant saucer vessels

1269
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:00,200
and transport us to our true home as subgeniuses among the stars.

1270
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:07,320
This has got to be the most disorganized religion I've ever heard a radio show of.

1271
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,340
Many are called, but few are chosen.

1272
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Now you can get this.

1273
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,600
Your dose goes on forever.

1274
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,080
Is there nothing your little box won't do?

1275
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,260
Maybe $3.98 on your local cash.

1276
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,540
What's that?

1277
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,120
I see Princess Wee.

1278
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,800
She's like signaling over there.

1279
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,320
Is she done getting?

1280
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,120
Oh, she needs a microphone.

1281
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,260
Show us your microphones.

1282
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,960
Well, do the talking.

1283
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,100
See if I can figure it out.

1284
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,640
There you go.

1285
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,760
Now I hear you.

1286
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,600
You have to do the talking part.

1287
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,820
This show's just crazy.

1288
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,800
I mean, this is crazy stuff.

1289
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:53,560
It doesn't make sense.

1290
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,580
It just doesn't make any sense at all.

1291
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,800
I mean, it's just supposed to be funny.

1292
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,960
It's just supposed to be a joke.

1293
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,180
I mean, it's just like some statement that the world is ridiculous or absurd.

1294
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,080
I mean, what is this?

1295
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,460
It's just like theater of the absurd.

1296
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,100
It's just like.

1297
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,380
Stream of consciousness.

1298
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,700
I mean, is this supposed to be funny?

1299
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,440
Was that funny?

1300
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,120
Okay.

1301
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,080
Look at the Mellotron.

1302
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,200
Did you ever have a Mellotron?

1303
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,820
Whip out your Mellotron, America.

1304
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,100
Dude, you're harshing my Mellotron.

1305
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,740
You took too much.

1306
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,180
You are seriously harshing my Mellotron.

1307
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,100
Hal explained everything.

1308
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,940
And once Hal explains everything, nothing's clear.

1309
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,560
He's just saying the danger of overindulging in this new designer drug.

1310
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,840
Your headphones might be.

1311
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,560
Tee hee hee.

1312
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:42,940
You should.

1313
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,760
I thought of this new drug.

1314
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,740
You might turn up your headphones if you can't hear.

1315
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,220
That's kind of broked it, but I can use them.

1316
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,980
We can hear you.

1317
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,320
So I'm talented that way.

1318
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,140
It was concocted by the CIA.

1319
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,600
Oh.

1320
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:52,980
Oh.

1321
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,700
Oh.

1322
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:53,920
Oh.

1323
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,180
Oh.

1324
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,180


1325
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,180


1326
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,860
Tee hee hee was originally invented by the military, wasn't it?

1327
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,620
It was.

1328
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,660
But it only lately escaped into the civilian world.

1329
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:17,100
Where it has marched through many territories, taking their prisoners, investing in garrisons,

1330
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,660
and consolidating political power.

1331
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,880
The only good thing you can say about the drug Tee hee hee is it has put the Jinkum cartel

1332
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,640
out of business.

1333
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,720
That's right.

1334
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,940
That was some dirty, dirty business.

1335
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,880
Well, they call it green Jinkum.

1336
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,300
And then there was the design of the drug.

1337
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,500
The designer Jinkum and the Franken-Jinkum.

1338
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,080
Yes, those kinky euros always have a way to twist and pervert.

1339
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:51,700
What parents don't understand is that the Jinkum of today is 400 times stronger than

1340
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,400
the Jinkum they might have smoked in college or in pale.

1341
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,520
It can be apprehended from literally blocks away.

1342
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,760
Please feed the baby.

1343
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:07,280
And as often as you feed the baby, the baby produces the mountain of wings.

1344
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,280


1345
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,280


1346
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:14,480
The taste which continues to flavor the monumental mountain of original human effluent.

1347
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,640
I can hear those tubes making noises.

1348
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,380
Doctor, I need more Tee hee hee so I can get off the Jinkum.

1349
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,680
Please feed the baby.

1350
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,980
I'm sorry I can't write you a prescription for a controlled substance as you really ought

1351
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,960
to know, but although I never told you this, well, here's a phone number.

1352
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,020
Oh man, I'm jonesing.

1353
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,280
I'm jonesing for the day.

1354
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:37,420
J.

1355
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,600
Now get on that honker and call the Dutchman.

1356
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,340
I need the jank, man.

1357
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,020
And you never got it from me, get me?

1358
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:46,440
See?

1359
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,860
And the children walk down the hill together.

1360
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,580
What on earth?

1361
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,040
Pick yourself up.

1362
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,500
Is this the way you act in front of the children?

1363
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,020
Oh my.

1364
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,600
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play.

1365
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,780
What is it?

1366
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,060
Pew!

1367
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,960
That's awful.

1368
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,600
Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!

1369
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,940
Twirling lollipops are really vibrating and getting in my eye and getting in my optic stream.

1370
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,180
A caller was asking earlier about the church of Pew!

1371
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:40,760
Well, did that caller get sorted out, ship-shaped and squared away?

1372
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,080
Well, you know, there's been a big schism between the church of Pew!

1373
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,940
Oh, schism all over.

1374
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,660
And the church of Pew!

1375
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,000
Somebody ought to clean this up.

1376
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,300
And the church of Pew!

1377
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,100
Well, that was the original Orthodox church.

1378
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,980
It was a little too messy.

1379
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,780
Oh my gosh.

1380
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:07,500
Yeah, because sometimes people without control could have a bowel movement accidentally.

1381
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,040
Opus 12.

1382
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,420
There it goes.

1383
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,000
Loot splashed away.

1384
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,020
Mafioso.

1385
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,340
Mafioso.

1386
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,240
That's horrible.

1387
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,100
That is just absolutely horrible.

1388
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,460
The thought of that is enough to make me have projectile vomiting.

1389
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,260
Oh, please, please, please.

1390
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,440
I want to watch.

1391
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,860
That's what we call a Cleveland steamer.

1392
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,580
Now in act two.

1393
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,240
There it goes.

1394
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,980
It sounds like I'm a chirping bird.

1395
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,020
From her serving lady, Dulcinea, that Rodrigo has not been true.

1396
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:45,100
In vain, she rushes to the battlements to throw her off, only to be apprehended by the adoring

1397
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,570
footman, Gascon.

1398
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,390
So that's 8484425.

1399
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,750
Do you want to talk to Ivan Stang?

1400
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,230
Yeah, we're not going to play the opera right now.

1401
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:02,650
KPFA 94.1.

1402
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,670
Drumming the overman, Bishop Joey.

1403
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,250
Or even puzzling evidence.

1404
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,290
Your show host, Berkeley.

1405
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,230
KPFA in Berkeley, 89.3.

1406
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:15,790
88.1 Fresno.

1407
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,730
And of course, all over the world.

1408
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,530
And in France at 7 a.m. on KPFA.org.

1409
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,810
An incredibly powerful signal.

1410
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,870
And you're like the world's premier knob twiddler.

1411
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:26,990
Ah, yes.

1412
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:27,750
There are many.

1413
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,170
There are many right here.

1414
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,290
And I think I speak for all of us when I say we welcome our Chinese overlords.

1415
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,710
Get your hands on the controls.

1416
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,510
I never want them to be anywhere else.

1417
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:43,550
I was hoping for Mexicans because I like their religion better.

1418
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:47,830
I was hoping for Mexicans because they have an exciting religion.

1419
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,490
That's Santeria religion.

1420
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,290
It's really hoping.

1421
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,730
Frozen ocean in the month of May.

1422
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,270
I was just wondering if you guys saw you opposing Cleveland.

1423
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,570
You would be the person to talk to about that.

1424
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,750
You sound like you're talking to me from Cleveland right now.

1425
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:02,250
Underwater?

1426
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:02,950
Oh, okay, yeah.

1427
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,090
It might be those headphones.

1428
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,610
Cleveland's flats in St. Louis' Clabber Alley, Boston's North End.

1429
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,970
But this is the really nice part of the show.

1430
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:13,690
Yeah.

1431
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:19,170
This is the cuddly and family-friendly, accessible part of the show.

1432
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:26,090
This part of the show is the twinkle in the eye of a red-faced old geezer who hands you

1433
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,830
your first cup of coffee in the morning.

1434
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:33,910
Because there's nothing friendlier than down-home radio practiced by those who've been cooking

1435
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,930
up the big cauldron of it for all these years.

1436
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,550
And it still hasn't stopped.

1437
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,350
The crud rising to the top.

1438
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:42,770
Mm-hmm.

1439
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,670
Smell.

1440
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:44,190
Smell that show.

1441
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,210
Smell that crud of cooking.

1442
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,830
Now they're going to dump in a couple of rucksacks full of brown sugar.

1443
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,130
You've almost got it rendered down into a gradu-like form.

1444
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:59,350
It's kind of thick, and this is the candy-like, you could say.

1445
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:04,350
This would be a good time to wake up your children and make them listen to the show.

1446
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,390
Like the primordial earth itself.

1447
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,770
We'll wait here while you do that.

1448
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,770
A brilliant blazing ball of molten magma.

1449
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:12,530
Wait, wait.

1450
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:12,990
How don't they?

1451
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,750
I've got there now.

1452
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,210
1,000 degrees.

1453
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,330
Oh, jeez.

1454
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,070
There goes the town.

1455
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,350
I miss the big news about the planets.

1456
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,490
Oh, what are they up to now?

1457
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,170
I'm going to see Pete Goldie go on and on and on about the planets.

1458
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,150
Is it centripetal?

1459
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,530
I want to go.

1460
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,810
I want to get off this planet.

1461
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,070
Get off this dirt ball.

1462
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,570
It's a conspiracy.

1463
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:35,710
Just a conspiracy.

1464
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:36,870
You don't get that option.

1465
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:40,950
Generally, that's not one of the options on the menu.

1466
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,030
The scientists.

1467
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:42,730
The scientists.

1468
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,430
I never saw the get off this dirt ball checkbox.

1469
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,810
Just telling us that, man.

1470
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:47,470
So we think.

1471
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:47,970
I did.

1472
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:49,170
You did.

1473
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,710
Yeah.

1474
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:50,410
Did you check it?

1475
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:50,930
What happened?

1476
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,690
I signed my name to that check.

1477
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,130
And I sent it in.

1478
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,010
Post office box.

1479
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,170
One in the floor.

1480
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,870
One in the floor.

1481
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,910
Oh, you can't ask for money.

1482
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,870
That one.

1483
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,650
Yeah, I know.

1484
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,090
That's why I didn't give the P.O. box.

1485
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,230
Well, you know, they don't have a P.O. box in space.

1486
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,810
The post office will not deliver your mail there.

1487
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,410
I guess we won't be able to get there for some time to come.

1488
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:24,510
I personally don't really want to be in outer space.

1489
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,130
It'll boil your blood right away.

1490
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:31,930
I would love to have my own planet that I could direct through.

1491
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,810
How are you going to get there?

1492
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,370
You know, you've got to get there.

1493
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:36,950
I know how to get there.

1494
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:38,470
Planet one to planet two.

1495
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,710
I know how to get there.

1496
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,930
And the answer is with patience.

1497
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:41,550
Here's your stateroom.

1498
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,910
And if you've got any problems.

1499
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,370
Wait and have faith.

1500
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:46,510
Talk to the captain on the intercom here.

1501
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,110
I'm your steward.

1502
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:49,910
You should be on the show.

1503
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,630
I'll be giving you all you want to make your voyage a comfortable one.

1504
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:56,910
And we hope that you'll fly into space with us again.

1505
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,730
Why don't you be on the show now?

1506
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,190
Well, I guess we have to work on Mars first and work our way up.

1507
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,850
Yeah, Mars has to be fixed up.

1508
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,250
We've got to kick Mars into shape.

1509
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,090
Mars is falling behind.

1510
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:11,090
But we can do it.

1511
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,710
We've got that get up and go.

1512
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:13,430
That oomph.

1513
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:14,510
That drive.

1514
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:20,750
That zest for living that brought man out to touch the face of Mars.

1515
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,750
When you get up and go, done.

1516
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,710
Got up and went.

1517
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,650
What do you do then?

1518
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,150
He has slipped in surly bonds of earth.

1519
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,870
What if you walk out of the station and there are big bugs everywhere?

1520
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,030
Then like eat through the top of Mars.

1521
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,150
X-ray delta one.

1522
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,610
This is A-OK.

1523
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,870
And when you're driving across country, you're just ahead of him.

1524
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,550
You have liftoff.

1525
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,030
Waves of big bugs that are eating.

1526
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,930
Because the storm ship trooper thing didn't work.

1527
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,790
Roger on that.

1528
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,110
This is your radio operator, Doug Smith.

1529
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:50,490
We'll be bringing you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

1530
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,330
Cheese?

1531
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:52,330
Oh, boy.

1532
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,470
Decades have gone by.

1533
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:55,350
No green cheese.

1534
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,090
And there it goes, ladies and gentlemen.

1535
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,050
Up into the stratosphere.

1536
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:03,190
That contrail of fire showing where...

1537
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,690
Is that the little fake Don Joyce?

1538
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,750
Recording everything going fine.

1539
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,230
The little tiny blooper of over the years.

1540
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,550
Of outer space.

1541
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,170
Oh, gosh.

1542
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,330
It's gross.

1543
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,570
I could never live here.

1544
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,030
There's all those over the edge bugs everywhere.

1545
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:21,770
Yeah, and little leakage of...

1546
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:21,830
Yeah.

1547
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,390
Disgusting life forms.

1548
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,030
What's with that?

1549
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:30,310
But didn't we learn in our last episode that Don Joyce, host of that show, doesn't have

1550
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,690
an FM radio in his car and so never hears your critiques?

1551
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,630
He may be listening right now though.

1552
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,690
You'll never know.

1553
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,610
Because he could be at home.

1554
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,010
Well, he could be.

1555
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:39,490
That's fine.

1556
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,810
Doesn't he have better things to do than listen to the puzzling evidence?

1557
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:42,910
Yeah, yeah.

1558
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:43,330
He could make his own show.

1559
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:43,710
He could make his own show.

1560
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,770
I know I do.

1561
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,230
What am I even doing here?

1562
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:51,510
Well, that's an existential type of question.

1563
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,870
That's the whole question.

1564
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:52,710
There's the laugh track.

1565
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,410
Oh.

1566
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:59,430
Even though your heart is breaking, laugh clown, laugh.

1567
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,270
What are you doing here?

1568
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:07,690
But you must surely know more than anyone else that radio is an unparalleled opportunity

1569
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,150
to present your views to the public in what you consider necessary.

1570
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,850
What a big deal.

1571
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,710
What are you doing here?

1572
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:14,730
That they might know.

1573
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:23,070
So, continuing in your educational mission, what announcement do you have for many interested

1574
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:31,130
followers that you might reveal here in a typically awesome fashion on our radio show

1575
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,670
on this historic and ceremonial occasion?

1576
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:42,290
Friends, as we stated a little earlier, X Day could be any second now.

1577
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:42,890
Any second.

1578
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:43,290
Any second.

1579
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:47,390
Are you truly ready?

1580
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,270
Is he saying something?

1581
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:48,770
I'm ready.

1582
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:56,050
You may think that you've got it all together for 2012 and ready to see the world out with

1583
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,330
a bang or a whimper, whatever your plan may be.

1584
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:09,330
But the evidence in front of us, twiddling the knobs, convinces us that, in fact, we

1585
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:11,950
know absolutely nothing.

1586
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,710
We know absolutely nothing.

1587
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,870
We know absolutely nothing.

1588
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,870


1589
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:12,890
We know absolutely nothing.

1590
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,550
But we do know absolutely nothing about the future except what Bob has chosen to reveal,

1591
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,610
and that is that X Day comes July 5, 1998.

1592
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,470
And that obviously hasn't happened yet.

1593
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:28,550
And so, but we do have a wonderful party, where we get together to practice for the

1594
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,450
end of the world.

1595
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,470
And this party is also known as X Day.

1596
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:34,550
But it's not really, they're really drills.

1597
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:40,010
They're not to be confused with the prophesied worldwide event called X Day, during which

1598
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,370
most of you listeners will die in the process in the form of a

1599
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:42,370


1600
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,890
horribly, if you're lucky, it will be quick.

1601
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:51,510
Most of these listeners are not listed in the book of life.

1602
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,390
They may be big contributors to KPFA.

1603
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,450
They may have, they could be like Gandhi or Mother Teresa,

1604
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:06,710
great hypocrites who were sainted by the PR of their actions.

1605
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:18,410
But in fact, all of that is meaningless compared to having the little minister's card from the church of the subgenius.

1606
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:18,770
That's it.

1607
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,570
Damn straight.

1608
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,410
Why couldn't he remember the name?

1609
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,570
What's happening here?

1610
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:25,870
I don't know.

1611
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,170
There's this bleed over that's coming in.

1612
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,010
What was that about?

1613
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,030
The church of rub fog.

1614
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:33,010
Bleediness.

1615
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,430
The clutch.

1616
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:36,670
Birch of the.

1617
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:37,110
Punch.

1618
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:37,950
Menius.

1619
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:38,410
What?

1620
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:40,130
The crutch of the.

1621
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,310
No, I know.

1622
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:42,290
Evil genius.

1623
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,330
Of the crutch of the.

1624
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:44,590
Menius.

1625
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:45,110
Dub.

1626
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,270
Menius.

1627
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,110
Oh, no, it's.

1628
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,090
Church crossover.

1629
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:50,570
The.

1630
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:51,430
That's the.

1631
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:57,790
That was the first half of the puzzling evidence show of February 2nd,

1632
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,390
and the end of this Hour of Slack number 1296,

1633
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:06,410
which, like 1295, was assembled partially in a car,

1634
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:11,650
in fact, in the I-van of Wild Princess, we and I were on the road.

1635
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:21,370
For more about puzzling evidence, see kpfa.org or quiveringbrain.com.

1636
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,210
For more on the church of the subgenius and the Hour of Slack,

1637
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,550
you may wish to see subgenius.com.

1638
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:35,050
