A one, two, three, fire!
Leave it to the subgenius.
Power of sweat.
Whoa, isn't that something?
What do you mean?
If anyone gets any answers, it'll be the psychiatrist.
Oh, that's terrible.
Yes, yes, and no.
Huh? Are you trying to give me the double talk?
Yes, I'm sorry.
The subgenius agenda.
Through the leadership of J.R. Bob Dobbs,
his vision of a 22nd century America
where subgeniosity is the subgenius lifestyle,
Dobbs has repeatedly addressed subgeniuses,
saying, I have a vision and you are part of it.
Topic.
Welcome.
Come on.
Mind research.
Research.
That's why.
You call fooling around with superstitions
and voodoo rights research?
Yeah.
Well, it's...
It's a cult.
We have to do this.
The work I'm doing is very important.
Look, they're over the bridge now.
They're on the other side of the...
It's okay.
Oh, darn.
Well, that wouldn't be avoided.
It's just wiggled around.
Oh, I see.
That'll work.
That'll work.
We'll just use that scene then.
You just need to alarm them.
Tie him down securely.
Doctor!
Here, see?
Your friend.
Quickly.
Oh, oh.
I guess even the doctor begins to lose faith
when he's caught up with him.
I think he's leaning on his computer.
I mean, his keyboard.
All right.
Forever?

I'd like to try it.
That's a heck of a long time.
You know, Doc,
I made an amazing scientific discovery
in this laboratory of yours.
Looks like he's coming around.
Okay, all right.
It's Ivan Stang.
We're resuscitating Ivan Stang now.
It's my dad.
I'm stabbing...
I just stabbed a scalpel into his heart.
That's just a stupid superstition.
No, no, no.
You're a real guy.
Come on.
Yes, you are right.
Come on, come on, come on, Ivan.
You can do it.
Come on, come on, come on.
There's a queen of you.
Oh, she's outside trying to get in the studio.
Come on, Ivan.
Come on.
We're attaching the...
Okay.
There we go.
You know,
it's not nearly enough for you to believe in Bob.
You must suck his entrails with your psychic firmament.
You must live in Bob's own depleted spaces.
It is only musky-roomly.
Oh.
God, it's musky in his humily.
His little humily door where he keeps his humily worms.
His little humworms and men pets.
Oh, look at that.
Men things.
I wouldn't want that on my leg.
I'm excited.
Horrible.
Not in the middle of some...
Ugly men things.
Soon enough, you'll be searching for dobs on the scaly roof of your mouth.
Soon enough.
There.
You hear me?
Oh, none.
The male will change from a greasy green to a bright, beneficent blue.
Blue.
We're worried about the subconscious messages that they're sending.
Me too.
Yeah, we worry.
You mean the subliminal radio signals that are in everything?
Even your back teeth fillings?
Are they?
Those are the ones you should really worry about.
The ones they broadcast right into your teeth.
Because you can hear those at night when you're asleep.
And your ears, you know, you got your ear canal right there next to your back teeth.
It's sort of whispering up that ear canal all the time and you don't even know it.
So how do you know that there are subliminal messages happening?
Well, the government, the new government channels, and I switch channels and then I just get stuff.
You get stuff on the channels?
They're editing this out right now.
Yeah, there's some kind of editing going on.
I think you need to turn up your phone or something.
But it's funny because a lot of people are different.
I think that...
Now, do you have that antenna hooked up right now?
Well, yeah, I have.
I have the...
I got some stereo wires and I drug them all across my floor.
Back and forth?
Yeah.
I hope with this show turned up very loudly.
So did it generate a static charge negative ion field on the surface of the floor about three inches above the floor?
That you were only able to detect with the use of your vacuum cleaner?
Yeah.
You know, maybe not like...
You're confusing.
Well, I think you should be confused to a certain extent because your receptivity will increase that way and therefore make the antenna more powerful.
Yeah.
From PR News in Washington, I'm unacceptable.
This was confirmed this morning in conversations I had with leaders of Russia and Japan.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called PR News a threat to the entire world.
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.
PR's reports remain on a downward...
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.
PR's reports remain on a downward spiral with a drop of PR News in Washington.
Reminds me of a...
Really?
Flying along here with us now.
Early in the morning.
On a happy...
Happy.
It's a cloud.
Sort of.
A new political wind.
I'm all there.
I'm all for it.
Yeah, we're all over it.
I'm up.
Lockstep.
I'm right with you.
Yeah.
The Homeland Security people will.
We buy in the morning.
And they'll check out your house and your life and...
Can you...
Do not want to check out my house.
FM radio waves to me?
They have to check out everything.
Yeah, we use all radio waves.
But can you explain how they work?
How radio waves work?
Yes.
We have the overman here tonight.
Tough question.
Yeah.
Philo Drummond.
Philo Drummond.
Philo Drummond.
Philo Drummond.
Philo Drummond.



After being in the...
You can hear the conference in the background.
What do you think?
You know, is that...
We'll explain that.
How does radio work?
Dr. Drummond, we have a young lady who wanted to know about how radio waves work.
So do you have, like...
Do we have...
You've got headphones on?
Yeah, you can know.
Radio waves.
I do have headphones on.
Radio waves.
Okay.
Yeah, radio waves.
Well, they're like...
Because I am the show.
They're these little things.
They sort of float out there.
They've got, like, little tentacles on them that kind of hang in space but have their own
modified cilia that are constantly flowing in the breeze and as the breeze
passes by the cilia sort of undulate and drive the organism, the sound wave, on its journey to your ears.
Does that help? It helps. And this music always plays when radio waves are, you know, even if
you're listening to a discussion show about atomic waste, this music would be
playing in the background, you just can't hear it. But music like this is always
controlling your emotional reaction. That's true. Music like this is hanging
around along with the radio waves. Or music like this. Radio waves have an
affinity for music like this. They just kind of hang together in a symbiotic
relationship. There were a few producers who were involved with the kind of underworld.
But then, if you do it, if you accept the money from them,
you must be ready for the guns as well. Well, you accept it for what it is. It could be money,
it could be guns, or it could be butter. You know, depending on your state and the state that you're
in. You know, I want to get back to some of the magic about Pangea and Lemuria and Guandana.
Oh yeah, back in the old days, the old, when we were just hanging out. The old ways. Because I've
seen video from that time. Yeah, we were like just a pack of amoebas, you know, like
running wild, hanging around. It's like, let's extend our protoplasm over into that area for a while.
You know, the next thing we know, they were just like, I had a twin there, looked just like me.
And, you know, what's going on here? So we started hanging around together for a while. Next thing we
knew, we were like a symbiotic organism of individual cells that was all together with
their own collective purpose. Slathering and slithering until
one day we had a flagella. And we stuck that flagella out. We started manipulating our environment and we decided, you know, maybe we should think about crawling out into that other atmosphere. You know, we should leave this sweaty, liquid environment and move beyond it. Move over into that dry area. Of course, we need some legs.
Looks like ghost town. No, it does look like ghost town.
So we did, and there we are. And so that's how it happened.
Okay, any more? Can I help you with any other questions?
Ladies and gentlemen, station KOQW would like to present now a serious documentary program,
an investigation of serious topics of our time as they relate to the industry. Would you get that up, please? Thank you very much.
I got it.
Shh, now everybody is public service.
Let me get in here. Let me get in here.
Do I sit right here?
Yes, sit right here.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Now, the microphones will be coming on in just a moment.
Okay.
Do I put on a little rubber?
Am I supposed to read this?
I don't need a rubber.
Here's your cue coming up.
Your cue is coming up.
Shubbing up, please. Watch the music.
Quiet, please. Here it goes.
Just a moment now.
All right, fade music and, uh, lights on.
Love that tune.
Shh.
When we speak of G-men, all of us gets a picture immediately of a band of little-known, courageous men risking their lives to defend the Tri-City area from the soft underbelly of criminals, spies, saboteurs, or shoe-women.
The
Tonight in the studio with me is Mr. Blank, special agent in charge of the metropolis field office of the feudal federal chest of drawers.
All right.
Sorry.
Federal bureau of drawers to investigate us about little-known facts concerning his work.
Yes, Mr. Announcer.
Everyone is hearing about espionage agents and saboteurs so much now, it's hard to think.
There's more.
No, it's hard to think that just a few years ago, no one even knew that saboteurs had agents.
Yes.
To start off with, Mr. Blank, shouldn't I have your name here?
Blank.
Blank.
What are some of the violations handled by the squalid squad, which are not as well known as the White Trash Traffic Act and the National Migratory Sponge Theft Act?
Well, for example, you, Mr. Announcer, are presently, right now, in violation of the concealed radio statute.
No.
Yes.
By not broadcasting the call letters of this radio station every 10 minutes, you could be jeopardizing the security of this area and my family and friends within its perimeters.
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Blank.
This is exciting and serious as if it were real.
Oh, yes, yes, of course this is real.
And you'll be convicted and sent to radio prison after the show is over.
No doubt, Mr. Blank.
Many of...
Oh, no doubt, Mr. Blank, many of our listeners who have traveled around extensively today will...
and other small towns in Arizona,
will remember that Radio Prism
is located in this particular section
of extremely rugged and unusual beauty
because of the pointed desert nearby
and the many very colored canyons.
Yes, that's where the colored people are kept.
Mr. Blanc, although we think of women as the Gentile sex,
I recall that in the past you G-string G-men
have been dealt from the bottom of the deck of sex
with some who were not gentle in any sense of the term.
That makes sense to me, Mr. Announcer.
Yes, a special agent was once assigned the task
of taking 15% of a mannish, big-boned woman of 150 pounds
who was charged with shooting a frog.
Bang, bang!
That must have been terrible, Mr. Blanc.
Yes, Mr. Announcer.
You know, taking a picture of a Frenchman
can have some pretty serious consequences nowadays.
I get the connection.
Uh, you bet, Mr. Blanc.
No, no, I don't.
It's against the law, too.
Accompanied only by three dozen officers,
he started down the path to the shack.
But this path was by no means easy.
No, it was guarded by two mean gridley bears.
Gridley bears who lunged, lunged horribly right toward them.
The party walked around them.
Then walked around.
And then walked around them again.
Can we take this again?
Was she finally taken into custody?
Yes.
The officers entered the one-room shack.
Even then, it took two days to reach the other side.
No.
Yes, the one-room shack was also a zeppelin holder.
Or hanger, so-called,
because you could either hang the zeppelin up
when you weren't using it,
or you could hold on to it.
No.
Now, the special agent, he talked to the woman,
stroking her gently,
describing the pleasure of a 75-year-old woman.

she'd been to the jail for a five-mile ride in a fast car.
Well, she went willingly,
and later confidentially advised her agent
that she liked the jail very much
since she was steam-heated
and had to be around a lot of water.
Well, you must be thinking of Comley Lucy Baumiller,
the 39-inch secretary to Kurt Klaus Pfeffer, the Nazi spy.
I don't think I'll ever be able to stop thinking about her.
Well, Mr. Blank, Blonk,
I want to thank you for being here.
Yes. Good morning.
Good morning.
You have given us all a new slant
on the topic of oriental girls in crime,
and it has been most interesting.
With you G-men on the job,
we must sure feel that Nazi communes
will surely be unsuccessful in their attempts,
however vague, to injure our area.
What's happening?
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
We'll be back once again next week
with the Pet Me Eye Story,
brought to you for Public Service Talk,

every time, every week at this hour.
We'll take it again.
We'll take it again.
No, we'll take it again.
It's all right.
We can take it again.
We can take it again.
Why don't we go to Top 40 now?
The gun scares the children.
Top 40.
Top 40.
Top 40.
Top 40.
A reverend staying here in the alleged year of 2021.
That was the Firesign Theatre,
a recording from when even I was a baby tweenager.
From their ancient radio show, All That.
Off the new old album collection called Dope Humor of the 70s.
Findable at FiresignTheatre.com.
We're doing a thing tonight that's half puzzling evidence
and half rare Firesign Theatre
and half ESO Swamp Radio
with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and me,
and half Philodrummon following an alien around
out in the desert planet somewhere.
The Murr did titles and news,
and the background music here is by CyberCharm.
And now, in the future,
back to 2001 for the puzzling evidence show on KPFA Berkeley
with special regular guest stars Dr. Philodrummon,
Dr. Hal, and hapless callers number 67 and 879.
So what if the South had won the Civil War?
What would have happened then, huh?
Huh?
What if the Spanish had won the Spanish-American War?
Well, if the South had won the Civil War,
we probably would have been able to have another...
What if the Germans had won World War VI?
Then we'd have to frat.
I think it's time to frat.
Okay.
All right.
Whew!
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure glad that happened.
Okay, um...
I want to be glad.
The thing is, the Civil War never ended.
It's still going on.
The South winning, if you have...
It never started.
It started all right.
No, no, no.
It was the uncivil war that started.
There's nothing civil about that war.
Well, you got all...
That was a damnable war.
Romantic.
Yeah, but what would James Joyce have said about it?
What would Aunt Bertha have said about it?
What would...
Yeah, what would Aunt Bertha have said?
Jesus did not always stay a baby,
although I think he must have been the most adorable baby
you ever saw.
Aw, Aunt Bertha.
He's a Jesus.
Still, he was the only baby, and he grew,
just as you boys and girls have grown.
Oh, boy.
Oh, hey, let go of me.
Oh, let me go.
Let go.
It's wonderful to know that Jesus
was once a child like me
and lived on earth and worked and played
in his home in Galilee.
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus
Who was once a child like me
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus
Like him I want to be
Before his parents could hardly believe it,
Jesus was 12 years old.
He was a fine lad.
And Luke tells us in chapter 2,
verses 41 through 42,
a beautiful story about Jesus
when he was 12 years old.
Yeah, was Jesus, or was Dean Moriarty Jesus?
God is in every sparrow plummeting to the ground.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well put.
Well put.
Or is that old?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that one before.
Is that old or something?
It's a cross-reference.
It's James Jones or somebody else.
God Junior said that.
Oh, God Junior said that?
God sees every...
sparrow that falls.
Oh, see, Chaz, I was just going to ask about
on the Easter theme.
I am kind of a...
The thematic Easter theme.
Do you believe in the classical that God and Jesus is the same guy?
Or do you believe that God is...
Jesus is God's kid, and therefore...
but then see, it wouldn't...
I don't believe in any separation between God
and any atom in the universe.
And so therefore, it's a moot point.
Why are you asking me?
I might as well be a secular humanist, rationalist,
sub-genius for all the difference it would make.
Now, but where did the evil come in?
I'm actually a totally mystical, cosmic-minded philosopher.
I think evil came in.
But it happens to take the form of atheism.
I think the evil started when they let him stink in the tomb too long.
Yeah, well, evil started...
No, I think evil started when...
Because we're, you know, the remnants of a burned-out star.
Ruminants, ruminants.
An older star blew up.
Weren't ruminants like the...
Yeah, an older star blew up, made our solar system...
The shadow.
We came out of that.
Maybe in that explosion, something went wrong.
I think evil was invented about the same time as time.
Any explosion, something goes wrong, doesn't it?
As soon as something started to happen, some things were good,
and some of the things were evil.
Right. There's your yin and yang and your potatoes right in your thumb.
You know, when you said it was...
Is that where evil started with the...
Any explosion, something can go wrong.
So perhaps if it was like Jali,
and like you guys were claiming that you could hit the wall with your sperm a couple hours ago.
Remember when you were bragging about that?
Yeah.
God probably thought he could shoot his seeds across the entire...
You know, it's a big place.
Well, that's called the Milky Way.
Well, the fact that it created this beautiful world that we live in is the good part,
and the fact that it created this hideous world that we live in is the evil part.
Hello, friends.
Yes, I'm Bernard Flapdoodle,
founder and president of the Funny Name Club of America.
That's right, the Funny Name Club.
You see, many Americans don't realize
the plight of that crippled member of society,
the fella or gal with a funny name.
And that's where we come in, in the Funny Name Club of America.
At our weekly meetings, held weekly in many friendly communities,
a member of this underprivileged, yet usually highly paid minority,
has a chance to mingle with others who share his infirmity
and to gain a sense of pride and brotherhood for the achievements of his kind.
Most Americans don't realize that it was our own right,
Robert Louis Dildo,
who invented the retrievable garage door.
That Mrs. Louise Yakamoto, the well-known war heroine,
purchased 45 gas bags, which still float above selected American cities,
each proudly bearing a funny name.
And while most wouldn't know the well-known Donald Duck,
what of the pain to his family and friends?
Yes, we all owe quite a debt to these guys.
These brave Americans of humorous descent.
Will any of us soon forget Adolph Schicklgruber?
We can't afford not to.
Yes, soon is quick enough for us.
So send your support to a chapter near you.
Don't forget about the little ones at Christmas either.
Yes, here's our poster girl, little Tricky Schlemiel of Metro Glen, North Carolina,
to remind you that Americans with funny names are just people too.
Thank you.
I'm glad that we have warning messages on everything now.
Yeah.
So that there's product lia- there is no product liability anymore.
I mean, people can't be- it's a good thing we stamp it on everything now
because, you know, for a while there, lawyers were just getting rich
from people that, you know, they'd walk up, they'd hit themselves in the head with a hammer
because they didn't- couldn't aim it,
and then they would sue the hammer company and win, you know?
And it's like, so now they put a- they put a label on a hammer that says,
do not hit yourself in the head with this.
I think you can get some money.
Yeah.
It all depends who wins the argument.
Oh, it definitely, certainly.
No, people that lose arguments generally don't win.
Generally.
And so, what happens?
If you find- if you find something offensive on a major label-
Unless, of course, the object was to lose.
... have a label?
Yeah.
Maybe?
Yeah, if it doesn't have, like, a parental advisory label and you find something offensive on it,
like, and then you let a kid listen to it, can you then say,
well, I'm gonna sue the major label?
A good lawyer can win the argument.
Probably could.
But, you know, it all depends how good the listener is.
I think if a kid listens to a record that's got the parental warning on it,
and then he still goes out and kills, they can sue the parents for not heeding the warning.
I'd sue negatively.
Yeah, that's what I would do.
Well-
You can always sue the parents for not being good parents, no matter what.
Yeah.
They're sort of like the last resort.
Last deep pocket.
I mean, even if you were suing a major company and they weren't getting what you wanted,
you could always sue the president of the company's parents for raising him wrong,
and then you could shake them down for a few bucks, you know.
Where do rules come from, mother?
Where do we get them?
Rules are very, very old, Bobby.
They're like stories and poems.
Men learned them before they had learned to write.
But how did the first rules get made?
You remember, Bobby, that we read from the Bible a big poem about how Grid planned the world?
Yeah, he planned land and water and light and darkness and grass and animals and power lines.
I remember.
God planned the world so that we could depend upon it.
God made the world so that the sun and the seeds and all the power lines would obey his rules.
Did the sun and the seeds and the power lines really obey rules?
Yes, dear.
That's how farmers and scientists and policemen can know when to plant their crops.
And when to expect them to blow up.
Did God make rules for people too, mother?
God did make rules for people, son.
But there's a great difference about the rules for people.
For instance, you blow pot.
Daddy and I get stinko.
The sun and the seeds do not choose.
They just obey their rules without knowing that they are obeying their rules.
And that's the way you should obey your rules, Bobby, or I'll belt you.
Can we do the Stations of the Cross now?
Okay, ready?
Hit, heap, hit, heap, heap.
You've got to get in line if you're going to do them.
And remember, every time you genuflect, you want to flip off a little prayer this way or that way.
Okay?
This way.
Let's pray this way.
Let's pray that way.
Get down on your knees and bend over.
Jesus has his face wiped by the women.
Jesus has his nose flung.
He's been flexed by the man next door.
Is that what Jesus was doing under them when...
Jesus flares his nostrils.
Jesus cries out in pain,
Why don't you leave me alone?
Come on, Chaz. We've only got seven more to go, or twelve, or whatever.
I'm sorry.
Jesus pulls his hat down tight over his eyes.
Um...
Jesus forgives the Sagittarians for plummeting his mothbroughs.
Jesus falls for the nineteenth time.
Ow!
That's blasphemous, you guys.
Jesus takes the Thorn of Crowns and uses it as a fetish device on Mary Magdalene.
I am so glad I wasn't raised religious.
Jesus prepares the onion dip before...
Hey, baby.
...achieving Golgotha.
You know, I didn't get into that.
I took some serious S&M ass-whippin' from them nuns.
I can say anything I want.
Yeah, you know, it's funny, though.
Chaz went to serious, serious schoolage.
People are always there saying, Reverend Stang, what religion burned your brain?
You must really hate some religion.
Was the nuns wrapping your hands with those rulers, or what?
It's like, no, my family didn't really particularly go to church or anything. We were...
You're a rationalist family.
Sort of, yeah.
And so you rationally...
Actually, my dad is like a lay preacher and knows more about the Bible than most preachers do.
So those guys just...
For that matter, I know more about the Bible than most Christians do.
But I...that...you know, I never did go...know much about those rituals of the Catholics or the...the Presbyterians.
Actually, the Presbyterians have...are...you know, kind of lively.
Do they have rituals?
What are their rituals?
The tonguers are my favorite, of course.
The whaters?
The tonguers. Those are the ones that speak in tongues.
Oh, the tonguers.
They have many different types of tongues.
That's what the other Christian nuts who aren't quite as crazy as the tonguers call the tonguers.
Those are the folks who put the pits in the cream cheese?
I had a guy tell me...he was telling me about the tonguers.
He was going...they're just crazy.
He'd just suddenly start talking these nonsense.
They're going to go to hell.
You know, they're going to have to answer to God for that.
And then he told me about Jamaicans.
He goes, I was going out to Jamaica.
That is great religion, though.
That is right.
You know what those men do?
They put cow dung in their hair.
They put cow dung in their hair.
And they said to me...
They're going to have to answer to God for that.
I just see these Jamaican guys standing in front of God.
Don't you think that's kind of strange?
Explaining the cow dung in their hair.
And God goes, cool.
Yeah, I think God would love a rastaman.
And then God would go, you know what?
I already knew that because I'm you and that cow dung.
I thought John was a rastaman.
And they'll go, man, that's what I was hoping.
I was hoping that there was an answer, that it was true and good and right.
And you are me and you are the rastaman.
And I'm the cow dung and we're all one and we're all together.
Praise God!
I think I'd like to live in a world where that cow dung can not only talk and not only
make the stations of the cross, but can also dance like Carl Simargo.
You remember that guy?
I think he had a...
What are you guys on?
What are we not on?
What is it on?
It's a plane that we can all achieve by simply colding our concentration.
At our navels.
Simply think of the spot one inch from the end of the tip of your nose.
Now place that spot at the end of the tip of your nose down at the tip of your navel.
Hold your concentration at the end of the tip of your nose and to your navel for approximately five minutes.
While not looking at your watch.
Making sure to count slowly, breathing through your ears.
One.
Breathe out through your eyes.
In through your ears.
In through your eyes.
In through your eyes.
Now everything you've heard you will smell and you will see everything you've heard after you smell it.
Now when the navel is calmed, think of the navel as the entire center of the universe.
Larry.
Larry curly curly mo mo.
I would like to transplant a few of you wonderful people.
I am totally fine.

I'm a little bit of a bummer.
I've met here on earth in my short brief stay in your world.
The Christ, a cowboy friend of mine.
We played wood chips together and stocked ourselves full of the latest stockings and cooperated.
That's the key word here.
Cooperation.
And you, I remember you the day they nailed you to the solar helix.
Let me in, she cried.
Let me out, he cried.
Sex jam.
Sex jam.
New from Paranoid Picks, Legs Lex and Polyhuman Fig are underage in sex jam.
She was trapped by her wanton way of life, always wanton something.
He was trapped by her, a smart cookie about to be singed.
Lex, listen to me.
Together we can be a team, just you and me.
Together, I'll kill you.
I love you, baby.
Excuse me, honey.
I love you, too.
Sex jail!
Sex jail!
For singles only, admitted in pairs,
don't let anyone know the awful beginning of this terrible drama.
Don't watch!
This film is rated 4X for medicinal purposes only.
Don't watch!
Twin seals will be in the aisles for every performance.
And remember, absolutely no one will be permitted to leave the screening of...
Sex jail!
Sex jail!
So they said, okay, let's put all this stuff in a warehouse.
We'll deliver it to people.
And then we'll charge them more.
But people won't pay more.
The people will laugh.
Not enough of them will pay more.
Yeah.
That's the problem.
Well, I would...
But isn't it great having...
When Webvan was working, it was great having them bring food to your house.
Now, you know, I always thought there would be two signs.
If we were really in the future, there would be two signs of it.
You would have flying cars and you would have food replicators
where you could just push a button and the appropriate food would just be replicated.
Not really replicated.
It would be, like, transported from some place where the perfect food was grown,
none of which was tainted by any horrible substances or illegal insecticides and things.
And then we would be able to eat wonderful food for free.
And then we would get into our flying cars
and fly to the movies.
And then we would fly to our jobs where we would only have to work one minute a week.
And at that time, we would just push a giant button.
We would come to work at about lunch hour.
We'd push the big button and then we would go home.
We'd do that once a week and they'd pay us a million dollars a minute to do that.
It's like a Warner Brothers cartoon.
Hi, I'm the Everly Brothers and in our business, we hear a lot of talk about drugs.
The heavy message now is that speed kills.
It refers to a good...
...group of drugs called antipetamins, including OPS, PEP pills, MAP, DEX, even VENY's.
You've seen what speed drugs can do.
They're dangerous, much too dangerous to fool around with.
To find out more about drugs, go to National Institute of Medical Health
or the Adventist Box 101 in Washington, D.C.
Don't get smug, you'll be in the back of the...
Drop it or I'll break your arm.
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.
And there...
Oh, look!
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.
Ridiculous.
She was terrified and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car is sitting in the garage.
She was out or in bed with the flu or maybe she was abducted by aliens for all we know.
I'm calling.
I'm calling.
The alien pees in the bushes.
He staggers.
His behavior is erotic and erratic.
He can't focus.
Yes, he is.
She's lonely.
Just see the démons speak.
That's tamam.
Pipes and liceackes or logs and snowmen.
They are just
minding their own business as artists do.

There he is, just sort of walking.
Yeah, I think they walk.

I'll hire Harry, what's that guy?

Harry Cobra.

Harry Von Zell.
I had some great camera angles planned for this week's show, too.
You did?
We were going to shoot up through a glass table.
Yeah?
Yeah, we were going to do a couple of shots shooting directly down through a rotating fan.
No, no, no.
Yeah, it was going to be another great issue of Dragnet, and you messed it all up.
Oh, you weren't going to have a shot of him sitting in a white shirt in a slightly overstuffed chair in a hunting lodge waiting for the lemon duck to get finished in the...
I remember that.
I can't forget it.
Dragnet finally no longer scared me when they were sitting there.
When do you think the duck's going to be ready?
I don't know.
When do you think the duck's going to be shot?
I don't know.
What are we going to do sitting here in a hunting lodge?
Two cops.
What are we going to do?
No, they were in Ed's apartment or whoever his partner is, Harry.
That's right, Harry.
When do you think...
When's the duck ready, Harry?
I don't know.
Joe.
Joe Friday?
Yeah, Joe Friday.
I don't know, Joe.
My wife gave me this recipe over here.
Let me take a look.
Oh, you better take a look now.
They do it like...
Hey, Joe.
You better take a look now.
Yeah.
Hey, Joe.
Yeah, Harry.
I took a look at the recipe.
Yeah, so you took a look at the recipe.
You know what it says, Joe?
Well, no.
What does it say, Harry?
It says we got to wait another hour.

Ted is shrinking.
He's in pain.
He can't stand living another second.
He must kill himself to relieve himself of such horrible, horrible pain and agony.
People thought negative art was just a trend.
But then it raced back with all the vengeance of shadow mastery.
I thought I would be able to find my way home.
But now it seems I'm just wandering.
Is that really you, or is that like a space suit in your inside someplace?
Maybe just your brain in a little jar or something like that?
Here it is straight.
One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.
Don't look at me like that.
These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is,
it's a prehistoric thing, and do you laugh, I'll brain you,
is romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.
A monster. How can she love a monster?
Let's get that through your head.
You dried up monster.
We've been hearing the sexual stuff for years.
You know, the five-day orgasm.
It all happens without physical contact.
It's only the beginning.
Why should this reality be public domain?
What's so great about it?
Maybe they gave you some drugs.
Maybe none of this is real at all.
He's going into shock.
Yeah, this is the one thing you don't think about on the show.
Oh.
Give him the allergen.
Get him the allergen.
Well, you lower down those plastic curtains.
You can't tell what's real and what isn't.
Lower yourselves into the caller's brain.
Okay, speak now,

Yes.

Yeah, yeah.
They just seem like normal guys.
Want to trade me the rest of the peanuts, banana?
They remain a dangerous choice.
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple of bananas.
Absolutely.
I've done it before.
I'm giving you great input.
Thanks for the input.
Yeah.
We have to put it in somewhere.
Oh.

That's good.

Keschner, Peter.
Peter has been an expert on drug abuse for many years.
He was with the Drug Abuse Council in Cincinnati.
He's taken more drugs than any police officer you'd think in the world.
Mr. Keschner, can you tell us about, by golly, this is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.
Do you always wear that hat, Mr. Keschner?
That's, I think you'd call that far out, right?
Okay, now as a police officer, John.
Oh, no!

And there he goes.
Doomed to an existence.
Of pain and sorrow and suffering.
One in which.
Those are just regular feelings.
One that the common alien has to experience.
And he sees them as fun.
In fact, if he were here to experience fun, it would seem like pain to him.
And there he is with his hideous, hideous, foul, fetid, smelly face.
And foul body fungus.
And.
Hideous excretions and ejecta vomitoid.

And he falls backwards into the mists of hideosity and ludicrosity.

Yes, negative art.

went to a picnic with a bunch of other people in the publishing business, and a young man
named Tim McGinnis, who was a brand new editor at McGraw-Hill, found this smudged pamphlet on the
floor of her car. He goes, where'd this come from? She goes, that was my crazy brother-in-law.
He and his buddy did this. He goes, I want to get in touch with him and tell him to get an agent.
The next thing we knew, Simon & Schuster, McGraw-Hill, and Macmillan were all bidding on
the Book of the Subgenius, which caused the asking price to go up to $20,000. That was enough to pay
Paul Mavridis and John Hagenbrenner to do professional design on it. Doug brought in
hand-scrawled manuscripts and, you know, packets of clip art and stuff that he wanted included.
So, you know, I'd take a chapter and I'd paste it up. I'd generate some original material.
John's style was perfect because it kind of matched the clip art. When McGraw-Hill first
released it, some places we could find it in the religion section, and I thought that was a huge
win. We got a contract for a book, we got it in the stores, and it's in the religion section
instead of the comedy section. It's not next to Doonesbury, it's next to the Bible and stuff.
People go, man, I barely made it through high school. But I stumbled upon your book,
and I realized I'm not the only one. I got that book. I read it beginning to end.
I absorbed that book. I adored that book. I loved that book. They kept me with, I get this,
I get this, I get this, I understand it. This is directly from my heart.
What the f*** are you talking about?
No idea what this is.
This is the word of Almighty Bob. It's the roadmap. There is no other book like this book.
It was these older, wiser miscreants letting us know that indeed all of these human-made
organizational systems are as flawed as you suspect because they're made by us.
I was thinking it would be fun to have the Celebrity Square,
the
the subject be esoteric subgenius concepts.
Yeah, yeah.
So like the story of Bob being shot could be part of that.
Well, so many things could be. That's a great idea because it's
mining the ancient depths of subgenius. Some of the origination myths rather than these newer church things.
But they would be brought out in a playful,
fundamental way.
And we could really dig,
as I do sometimes when I find these old tapes and listen to some of the old jokes of the old church,
and I think they're just fun to dig up again.
That was P. Bicker Fleamouse and the Cajun country band.
And I just want to throw in some of the old jokes so people know there was a little old church and these little guys limped around the little campfire at night.
By cranky, it was better back then.
Yeah, did their religious thing and said as people always do universally,
it was better back then because you know folks it was better back then.
Sure it was.
No matter who you were or where you were in history, it was always better back then.
Because there was more youth. That's what I was thinking.
And less withering from time being blasted by grief and ill usage.
That's right.
So now let the myrmidons of chicken infuse energy into the show while we, the elder archons, simply lap up the cream provided on the occasion.
Oh, absolutely.
By the creamettes and the other performing groups.
They are also referred to as naked fire goddesses by chicken.
Oh, I love that.
I love that.
I don't know what the deal is there.
Who cares?
I mean, he's claiming that that...
They'll just fit in just fine to the subgenius mythology of saucers and pleasure guides and...
All that stuff.
All that stuff that they pay 10 bucks to come see.
That's right.
Dinosaurs of slack.
All your favorites doing all the same things over and over again.
That's 13 bucks.
That's Jesus at subgenius.com.
If you want to know about subgenius, go to subgenius.com.
You can get your salvation or your $275.
It's Jesus at subgenius.com.
Yeah, it's not Chaz.
It's ESO radio.
It's ESO swamp radio.
And it's not Reverend Stagg at the hour of slack.
And it ain't lonesome cowboy to involve himself out there in the fray.
It's you.
It's you and me.
You and Zoro and Bob Nye in between you and Bob.
You don't need an intermediary of a priest or a preacher.
I'm sorry.
You don't need a preacher.
You just need Bob.
You don't need Reverend Stagg.
You don't need Ken Schilling.
You don't need the bank.
You don't need the ambulance.
You don't need the antidote.
You only need one thing.
That's Bob.
And a little frock, probably.
And, uh...
When God come back on a happy Easter's day,
and it carries a lace around the flowers,
and everybody pukes on his head...
He's still talking over there.
Ivan Stagg can talk forever.
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying.

I want you to check a box next to each one of these that's a true statement.
Let's go get fresh eggs, ham, and bacon.
A true statement.

True or false?

My father was a good woman.
True or false?

My mother dresses me funny.
True or false?
I believe in an afterbirth.
True or false?

True or false?
I prefer spiders to lima beans.
Spiders?
Did you make spiders?
I think you're most likely dead, John.
Often I think I am a special agent.
I can talk forever.
But shan't.
And all there is left for you to know is at subgenius.com and much of it's right there on the home page.
And now a word from our sponsor.
The preceding portion of this program was brought to you by Schleicher beer.
Remember, Schleicher beer is better than Nordlander.
Either that or if I really get serious I can put on two hours of people listening to show.
Yeah, people listening.
Just people listening to radio.
Sure, yeah.
People.
Two hours.
People, yeah.
It's easy for you to say.
Did they say that?
Putting people, people listening on.
Putting people.
Putting people first.
If you put people listening on, nobody, I mean it's going to be kind of boring.
People are just going to be listening to people listening.
And it's sort of like.
Well, like Dear Friends.
I think, yeah, it was on the Pacific Island.
Like right now.
Dear Friends, which is just what we're doing right now.
In the Pacific Ocean.
And I believe Gary listened to the original.
Fire Science Theater doing just yacking.
About listening.
Yeah.
And about listening.
About all the stuff we do.
It's interesting to think about listening to someone listening.
It's sort of like thinking about thinking.
In one way, you know.
It is.
In one way, yeah.
In one way it is.
In the fact that it's.
It is in one way.
In another way it's absolutely unrelated.
It's sort of like, it's stupid to even think about them as being related in another way.
Well, it's stupid to think about it.
You don't even waste time thinking about them being related.
It's stupid.
Why would you do that with your life?
Stupid.
Don't be so stupid.
To think they were related.
That's coming up, isn't it?
St. Stupid's Day.
Well, not for some time.
I don't know why that's in April.
Hey, Hal.
I can dream my dream.
Hey, everything's coming up.
I can dream my dream.
