1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
And there'll be no smoking in the gas chamber.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,660
Dr. Raymer, please report to ICU. Dr. Raymer?

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,420
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,340
I didn't have it!

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,780
I wish I was a spaceman, the fastest guy alive.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,020
What do they want? Where are they from? Where are they going?

7
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,680
I don't know.

8
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,180
The Second World War, and for the first time in the history of man,

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,480
nations combined to fight against nations using the crude weapons of those days.

10
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,400
The Second World War involved every continent on the globe,

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,660
and men turned to science for new devices of warfare,

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,440
which reached an unparalleled peak in their capacity for destruction.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
And now, fought with the terrible weapons of super-science,

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
menacing all mankind and every creature on Earth, comes...

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
The Church of...

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,260
The Subgenius.

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,540
The Church of the...

18
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,560
Subgenius.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,680
Subgenius.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,460
Subgenius.

21
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,920
Subgenius.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,820
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,320
The Subgenius Hour of Squatch.

24
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,640
You are all now starting the third man in the chaos of the conscience of Nicholos and Porqué.

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,020
We're friends!

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,200
Hey, that's right! We welcome you!

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,900
We're friends!

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,380
Yeah.

29
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
Ey, Silicones, are not insoles,

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,000
Cookies, cannot escape the power of the Spirit.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,920
chickens.

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,220
SUPER Team, you can never escape these clingy disciples.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,520
IV.

34
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,660


35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,980
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Their soul is to control.

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
A woman with a tattoo?

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,540
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special news bulletin.

39
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,280
All you of earth are idiots.

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,320
First, dear friends,

41
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,620
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,660
is performing live at the Starwood Festival.

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,720
It's really good to be playing here at Starwood

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,400
because most of the clubs that my band plays at

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,620
turn you into this.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,320
A grimacing shadow of what you thought it was all about.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,380
But you come here to Starwood

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,900
and you're like,

49
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
there's no TV sets around here.

50
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,080
And this song is kind of about a TV set,

51
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,380
so it doesn't really pertain to you,

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,800
but I'm sure you know a few friends who it does.

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
Oh, let me get the right preset on.

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,040
By the way, it's not mine.

55
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,880
But you might recognize it.

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,860
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

57
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,940
Welcome to talk with you again.

58
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,560
Because the vision softly creeped in.

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,280
Left its seeds while I was

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,540
sleeping.

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
And the vision

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,160
that was planted

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,620
in my brain

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,260
still remains

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,800
within the sounds

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,320
of silence.

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,780
And I placed the all my bits in my brain.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,720
I could hear all the voices at once

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,260
and then they patted down.

70
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,600
And I was like,

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,600


72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,600


73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,600


74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,600


75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I didn't hear the sound of my old spines.

76
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,220
In restless dreams I walk alone.

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,460
Narrow streets of cobblestone.

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,840
Neath the hill of an E street lamp.

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,240
I turned my car to the cold and damp

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,800
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Of a neon light

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,880
That split the night

83
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,180
With my song

84
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,760
Of silence

85
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,300
Of silence

86
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:49,820
Of silence

87
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,820
Of silence

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:49,400
Of silence

89
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,740
Of silence

90
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Of silence

91
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Of silence

92
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,500
Of silence

93
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,560
Of silence

94
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
Of silence

95
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,280
Of silence

96
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,900
Of silence

97
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,500
Of silence

98
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,200
Of silence

99
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,820
Of silence

100
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:49,820
Of silence

101
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Of silence

102
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,820
Of silence

103
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,360
Of silence

104
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:19,500
Of silence

105
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,340
Of silence

106
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,660
Of silence

107
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:26,660


108
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,680
Of silence

109
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:35,600
reaction man you can't use these implants on us man I'm I'm so I'm so high

110
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,940
the whole world looks like that t-shirt that I can't fit into anymore

111
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh brother guts you'll never make it out of this Halloween like a Salisbury steak

112
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,140
I'm convinced all right what after that halloo during that hallucination when I

113
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,780
gave you the second dose did you see this man this pipe smoking man during

114
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:04,220
your hallucination during any of that long series of lifetimes you hallucinated

115
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,340
living did anyone show you or did it you see in any way a picture of this pipe

116
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,560
smoking man but now that you mention it I had a number of dreams they were very

117
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,860
frightening dreams I dreamed I was on a lonesome road traveling off in the

118
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,120
dark

119
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,300
Yao

120
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:23,300


121
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,580
it's better than going to the Heystrike park it was a starry night I remember

122
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,780
that and then we came to a place where there were no stars at all

123
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:37,920
and uh for some reason I felt compelled to pull over, and as I did, I walk over

124
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,100
by the old aqueduct near route seven and look down into the valley and

125
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:53,600
And I saw a huge face, a huge face coming up over Blacktop.

126
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,240
And it was the biggest face I'd ever seen.

127
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,300
And, yeah, I can't get it out of my head.

128
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,020
I had dreams of it night after night.

129
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,420
And I see the face of Bob.

130
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,980
He gazed upon the naked face of Bob.

131
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:24,840
He was smashed under the stark fist of removal.

132
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:31,220
And as he crawled out from under, he knew he had been chosen.

133
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,300
He had been swept up in the spirit

134
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,000
and had been chosen.

135
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000


136
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,320
And as he gazed upon the face of Bob,

137
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,660
he'd been swept into the very dots.

138
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Each single individual dot of the halftone pattern

139
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,400
had captured a piece of the soul of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

140
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,520
This is all pre-molecular, man.

141
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,680
I got the gist, man.

142
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,200
I got the gist of the whole thing.

143
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,720
This goes way, way deep, deep down beyond the DNA,

144
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,920
beyond the beginning, the protoplasm, the ectoplasm,

145
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,620
the cytoplasm.

146
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,880
It reminds me, I gotta go get a flash, man, in my arm.

147
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,260
Something burning is falling down through the sky.

148
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,440
Friday's John!

149
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,980
A witch's brew we made just for you.

150
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,460
Give away, I'll give away.

151
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,860
Give away, I'll give away.

152
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,240
Give away, I'll give away.

153
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,160
Give away, I'll give away.

154
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,060
Incredible adventure of men.

155
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,840
This odyssey of reaching out into space.

156
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,900
For the next hour, sit quietly,

157
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,820
and we will control all that you see and hear.

158
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,500
You'll be...

159
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh, the pain.

160
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,000
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

161
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,660
You are...

162
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,920
You owe Bob...

163
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,160
You owe Bob...

164
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,920
You owe Bob...

165
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,480
$30.

166
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,600
$30...

167
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,260
A mere 30 clams, dear friends.

168
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,160
Ballets.

169
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,300
What's your gleet worth to you?

170
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,160
$30.

171
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,560
Is your gleet worth $30 to you?

172
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,000
Is the non-compromisational...

173
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,000


174
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,440
Is the non-compromisational...

175
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,520
Is the non-compromisational...

176
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,540
...the real-life gleet worth $30?

177
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,640
I'd...

178
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,380
Maybe not.

179
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,060
Maybe so.

180
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,820
I really don't care.

181
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,000
Most of you wouldn't even know if you had real gleet.

182
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,280
All you have is that synthetic conspiracy gleet that they feed you.

183
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,340
Just feeding you their fake gleet.

184
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,720
And, oh, you're just so happy to have that gleet.

185
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,980
Oh, they're gulping it down.

186
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,720
They're just...

187
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,660
They just love it.

188
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,500
They're lapping it up!

189
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,260
That's right.

190
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,440
They suck up...

191
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,180
Accent on the lap.

192
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,420
...gleet like a blowfish.

193
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:04,760
...gleet like a blowfish.

194
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
Yeah, they're...

195
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,140
They might as well just be a great big old gleet vacuum.

196
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Man's best friend is the blowfish.

197
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,220
The blowfish provides many things for men.

198
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,740
It provides a safety valve.

199
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,700
A safety valve against too much gleet buildup.

200
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,300
Oh, yes, because you can build up that gleet.

201
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,760
And soon, it will back up into your very veins.

202
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,020
Back up into your brain pan.

203
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,160
Oh, yeah.

204
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,980
Color your judgment, you might say.

205
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,840
Or the foot gland.

206
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
Oh, it'll back up either way.

207
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,920
You'll be packing a real mean load.

208
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,820
That's right.

209
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,480
The poison of the flu nights, friends.

210
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,920
And there's only one way to excise that poison, to get it out.

211
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,640
And that's to write to Bob.

212
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,980
Well, that's the other way.

213
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,520
Oh, the other way, too.

214
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,460
Okay, there's two ways.

215
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,600
I didn't worry.

216
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,480
That's the way.

217
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,000
Yeah, okay.

218
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,180
Write to Bob.

219
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,460
That's the preferred way.

220
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,360
There's a cheaper way, but you really don't want to try it.

221
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,640
Write to Bob for free information.

222
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,240
It could be dangerous.

223
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,880
I tried to using Dr. Legume's pornography that he has hidden in his bathroom where I spent the night last night in his bathroom.

224
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,980
But you know what?

225
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,740
Dr. Legume's pornography was...

226
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:19,780
Spent the night in his bathroom?

227
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,160
Yeah.

228
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,120
His pornography was too normal for me.

229
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,040
I thought I'd keep the gun magazines there.

230
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,080
That's what I like.

231
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,460
That was it.

232
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,540
Gun magazines and what was it?

233
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,180
Big bore.

234
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,920
Oh, man.

235
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,440
I thought I'd keep the Puritan magazine and Golden Girls.

236
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh, that's right.

237
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,760
You went to see that movie.

238
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,060
Muzzle Velocity.

239
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,060
You went to see that movie Mimic wearing a trench coat and nothing else because you were getting off on all that bug porn.

240
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,340
Bug porn.

241
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,260
I know about you and the bug porn.

242
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,740
I love bug porn.

243
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,100
Mimic have bug porn in it?

244
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,620
Yeah.

245
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
Big John.

246
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Bugs and humans and things are doing that.

247
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,180
Oh, I didn't know that.

248
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,220
Yeah.

249
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,840
You missed the bug porn?

250
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,140
That's new, though.

251
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,120
That just came out, didn't it?

252
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,340
Yeah.

253
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,980
I didn't know that.

254
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:00,980


255
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:00,980


256
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,600
I thought you would have known about the...

257
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,100
Oh, man.

258
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,360
I can't believe.

259
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:03,360


260
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,220
I didn't know about that.

261
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,040
Bug porn, man.

262
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,100
I guess I saw...

263
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,880
I think I saw an ad for that on TV the other night, but I was all hopped up on Gleet and

264
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,740
I barely remember.

265
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,240
Yeah.

266
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,200
Yeah.

267
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
We were all hopped up on Gleet and...

268
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,780
It was my own Gleet, though.

269
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:16,880
...watching that.

270
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,100
It wasn't like I was...

271
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,120
I wasn't like taking the devil's Gleet or nothing.

272
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,520
No.

273
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,600
We wouldn't want to do that.

274
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,220
I wouldn't take it.

275
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,000
No Gleet shall pass these lips but Bob's and my own.

276
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,860
And the occasional bug Gleet.

277
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,540
Well, bugs don't exactly create...

278
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,660
I don't think they...

279
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm not sure what exactly comes out.

280
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:38,900
Well, who knows?

281
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,200
Would you lick a toad just for a little Gleet?

282
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,440
No.

283
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,800
Well, toads, yeah, sure.

284
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,380
Toad.

285
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,920
But that's different from an arthropod or damn, you know, six joint exoskeleton damn thing.

286
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,080
I smoked one then.

287
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,340
The Prozac Free Radio Show filled with Gleet and music.

288
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,260
This is the Department of Crooks playing Nine from Las Vegas.

289
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm not sure what that is.

290
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,660
Can you write it down for me?

291
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:04,660


292
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:04,660


293
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:04,660


294
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,460
We're going to show...

295
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,020
After that...

296
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,500
Not that we've actually just talked about anything for hours straight.

297
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:14,500


298
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,560
David Whene.

299
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,740
Never

300
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,840
What the ....

301
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,820
I don't think I should go on.

302
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:30,820


303
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:30,820


304
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:30,820


305
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,320
Thank you.

306
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,060
Thank you.

307
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,060
Thank you.

308
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,820
Thank you.

309
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,840
Thank you.

310
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,040
Thank you.

311
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,020
Thank you.

312
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,920
Thank you.

313
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,180
Thank you.

314
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,140
Thank you.

315
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,920
Thank you.

316
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,260
Thank you.

317
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,420
Thank you.

318
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:11,260
Thank you so much.

319
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,060
Thank you.

320
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Thank you.

321
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,480
Thank you.

322
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,840
Thank you.

323
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank you.

324
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,320
You're a genius of the soft drink world.

325
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,660
Get the goddamn company

326
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,680
to pay the bills.

327
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,240
Tractors plowing down the hills

328
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Pepsi

329
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,020
Kids are still drinking Pepsi at the general store

330
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,040
While ghastly stench of puppy mills

331
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,800
Pepsi

332
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I feel like a puppy

333
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,260
Sheets with stinking urine

334
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,800
What hard feelings are

335
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,860
Bloody shards of glass

336
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,840
Come on, pop

337
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,220
Butt flaps burned by hot exhaust

338
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,360
Against your product

339
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,420
Drunkards passing gas

340
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
I don't see how much you're sick

341
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,080
Children dying of disease

342
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,240
Pepsi

343
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,600
The press I delivered to Pepsi was my power

344
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,860
I can use it any way I want

345
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,540
Leading helpless teens astray

346
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Pepsi

347
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
It's a sword

348
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,860
It cuts through the blades

349
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,920
I can't find the strength to say

350
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,060
Pepsi

351
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,180
Forget it!

352
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,740
Medicated or

353
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,500
Deploitment being

354
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,220
Spread on painful rash

355
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,680
We get it! We get it!

356
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,280
Old outdated software getting

357
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,780
Thrown into the trash

358
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,440
Everything still tastes the same

359
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,280
I think I can

360
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:46,460
Pepsi

361
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,900
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet

362
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,820
But if you threaten to extend your violence

363
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,580
This earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder

364
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,600
Go home to even worse.

365
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,160
I've stayed in this fucking cult of mu fold

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,340
And don't complain no more

367
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,480
Trying to be back in your own shit

368
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,480


369
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,300
Wembley and C kroise

370
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:12,540
I don't even know where

371
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:12,720
It's just another

372
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:12,860
ear

373
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,480
Charles

374
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:14,820
�면

375
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,640
Christine

376
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


377
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


378
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


379
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


380
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


381
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


382
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


383
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


384
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,640


385
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:15,840
Everything for a reason

386
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,320
I mean who can guess the game?

387
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,940
What happens they can't see thecha

388
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,880
because it's so offensive.

389
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,740
Move them earthlings north.

390
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,640
Oh, man.

391
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,480
Ship those earthlings back.

392
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,380
Oh, this sounds almost racist.

393
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,060
It's pink-a-billy.

394
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,800
Pink boy, pink boy.

395
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,860
Pink boy hatin' me.

396
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
It's like hate songs.

397
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,720
It's subgenius hate songs and normal hate songs, both.

398
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,180
I don't suppose we can play any of those on the radio.

399
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,180
I don't know.

400
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,460
Judging from the quality of manner of subgenius hate.

401
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,880
You just offended the Pepsi company by playing that negative land piece.

402
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,960
By the way, Reverend Strange, I want to say,

403
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,460
I really like the music that you play on your shows that I hear tapes of.

404
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,040
Because I usually don't hear that music any other place,

405
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,200
not in Dallas, Texas, where I live.

406
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Why would you hear it in Dallas?

407
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,000
I mean, it's Dallas.

408
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,780
Well, that's not funny.

409
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
Stock butchers, stone butchers, lipstick fems,

410
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,840
bisexual, transgender, transvestite, heterosexual, transsexual,

411
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,360
gay, transsexual, bisexual, lesbian,

412
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,680
biological males to post-op female bisexual

413
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,420
who lives in a lesbian lifestyle.

414
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,820
What is that about?

415
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,060
For what we believe in.

416
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,900
Telling them that it's okay that I should go to jail.

417
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,340
How many of you can, at 35 years old,

418
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,800
sleep with 16, 12, 13-year-old girls and boys and animals?

419
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,440
Hey, this is the life.

420
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,380
I just hate everybody.

421
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,660
There's no need for me to like everybody.

422
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,840
Everything that I...

423
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,360
have in this world, I put back into number one.

424
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,220
I am number one.

425
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,820
I don't need to give anything to anybody.

426
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,420
You don't need to.

427
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,800
Do you have any idea how these people were born?

428
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm not afraid.

429
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,500
I'm not afraid.

430
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,480
The difference in most products today is really in the skill.

431
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,180
I was sick, sick under death.

432
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,020
The revolution will not be televised.

433
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,180
Will not be televised.

434
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,360
Will not be televised.

435
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,660
How would you like to ool your cool with me, mon?

436
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,000
Huh?

437
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,300
All of the DJ's surely have taken a lesson.

438
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,500
Start talking trash and I'll come with my Smith and Wesson.

439
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
But they talk.

440
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,220
They have orifices that move and words come out.

441
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,260
Yeah.

442
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,100
That would be great.

443
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,140
Boy, I hardly ever get to do that.

444
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,600
We'll heal you, we'll sicken you, we'll marry you, we'll counsel.

445
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,660
We'll... counseling.

446
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,560
On ear subgenius counseling.

447
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,020
That's right.

448
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,340
We're ready to do that.

449
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,980
Call now for your free counseling session.

450
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,280
Well...

451
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,660
Do you have questions about your baby's health?

452
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,020
Your child's upbringing?

453
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,020
Ask a subgenius priest.

454
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,740
That's right.

455
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,420
We're family counselors here, Dr. Lecum and I.

456
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:05,920
We will be glad to tell you what you can put in your mouth and what you can't.

457
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,980
We've been studying the subject of what you can put in your mouth.

458
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,240
I imagine...

459
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,940
To suck or not to suck actually was the question.

460
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,640
That is truly...

461
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:14,640


462
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:14,640


463
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,100
...the question.

464
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,680
Some stop when they taste...

465
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,660
Whether it is nobler to suffer the...

466
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,480
Well, we won't go there.

467
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,320
I don't want to go to that place.

468
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,960
I can't go there.

469
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,000
I've heard...

470
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,320
My own wife started using that phrase recently.

471
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,460
I can't go there.

472
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,740
When did that appear?

473
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,020
When did you start hearing that?

474
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,500
I don't know.

475
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,160
When people started being really afraid, I think, of everything.

476
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,220
Hey, man, why don't you quit that job and like have a life for a change and have some...

477
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,620
I can't go there.

478
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:44,860
I can't go there.

479
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,000
I can't go to that place.

480
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,500
I can't go there.

481
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:48,500


482
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,260
That's like some encounter group therapy session thing.

483
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,320
Yeah, probably.

484
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,680
I guess.

485
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,260
Or educationese.

486
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,820
One of those...

487
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,220
Some overeducated college type people probably came out of that.

488
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,840
Came out of one of those, you know, pink nerd support groups you read about and hear about

489
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,380
on the daytime television.

490
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,600
And yet, in less than 11 months, there shall become a prophecy that shall come true.

491
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,500
300...

492
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,720
The saucers will come.

493
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,860
...15 days, dear friends.

494
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,640
Actually, I'm not sure.

495
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,320
I'm not sure exactly what day we're on, but it's roughly that.

496
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,420
Now, actually, I don't like nailing it down for the listeners, because truth in fact,

497
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,400
half of them really don't get it.

498
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,060
The half that do get it, they know.

499
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,100
You don't have to tell them, but the other half, I'd rather just leave it a surprise.

500
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,340
Yeah, we'd like to tell you, but we can't go there.

501
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,480
We can't play that tape, because you might be offended.

502
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,540
Yeah.

503
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,580
Might be.

504
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,160
Wah, wah, bam, bam.

505
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,560
We pray.

506
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,280
You'll be offended.

507
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,680
We pray that you would be offended.

508
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:55,600
If you have any decency, if you have any human decency at all, you would indeed be

509
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,020
offended.

510
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,180
I hope you are offended.

511
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:04,520
I pray that you are offended, because we love you, dear friend.

512
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,520
Bob loves you.

513
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,460
That's right.

514
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,120
Admittedly, he loves your money more than he loves you, but he does also love you.

515
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,600
You.

516
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:11,860
You.

517
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,180
The very you that I'm talking to right now.

518
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,020
You as an individual.

519
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,160
You, sitting there.

520
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,560
On the drugs, yes, we know what you did.

521
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,640
Three will kill an elephant.

522
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,600
Bob can take five.

523
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,740
Think about it.

524
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,520
That's right.

525
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,120
Especially if they're the American ones.

526
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,760
If it were the German ones, Bob would foolishly be dead.

527
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,520
Who do you trust?

528
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,300
A friend?

529
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,480
Man?

530
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,460
Certainly not myself.

531
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,880
What do I know?

532
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,300
Man made...

533
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,980
Man made God, but he used a monkey to do it.

534
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,540
Man made God, Bob made Frop.

535
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,800
Who do you trust?

536
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,820
Bob, of course.

537
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,700
You know, actually, lately I've been trusting in Bill.

538
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,440
Bill Hicks is my new short derp or saff.

539
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,600
You ever heard that so-called comedian?

540
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,860
The so-called truest work of art.

541
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,120
The worst words I ever heard poured from that man's mouth.

542
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,180
Yeah, you can't play him on the radio because somebody might be offended.

543
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,560
This guy listening to me right now would probably be offended.

544
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,400
He'd be too offended.

545
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,080
We wouldn't be able to play a Bill Hicks tape because he cusses, you know, and he...

546
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,640
He's an offender.

547
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,880
You would be offended if you were normal.

548
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,500
But, but, if you were a subgenius, why, you'd die laughing.

549
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,280
If you're a subgenius, the pills that we hand out on next day won't hurt you a bit.

550
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,740
They'll transport you to heaven.

551
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,020
But if...

552
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,360
Boy, I love talking about Kennedy assassination.

553
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,940
Man, that's my favorite topic.

554
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,380
You know why?

555
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,360
Why?

556
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:09,440
Because to me, it's a great archetype example of how the totalitarian government who rules this planet partitions out information in such a way that we, the masses, are forced to base our conclusions on erroneous...

557
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

558
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,880
Wrong meeting.

559
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,600
I thought this was the meeting at the docks, no?

560
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,640
Oh, shit.

561
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,360
That's tomorrow night.

562
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,740
All right.

563
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,880
Everyone followed that.

564
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,160
That's the frightening fucking thing.

565
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,240
Everyone here is going, uh-huh.

566
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,420
God damn it.

567
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,340
Are we that cynical?

568
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,220
Yes, we are, Bill.

569
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,440
We will dig any blow you give us.

570
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,740
Gah!

571
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,860
We, too, will be at the meeting at the docks tomorrow, you fucker.

572
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,760
How much money do you ever want to get in?

573
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,300
What would you...

574
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,740
Wow.

575
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,100
Cool.

576
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,720
But I love Kennedy, man.

577
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,560
I was just down in, uh, just up and where I was just in Dallas.

578
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,080
And, uh, you know, you can go to the sixth floor of the school book department.

579
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,580
The school's like, you know, it's a depository.

580
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,740
Do you know it's a museum called the Assassination Museum?

581
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,300
Do you know that?

582
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,220
True.

583
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,820
I believe, name that, after the assassination.

584
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,340
I...

585
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,700
I can't be sure of the chronology here but...

586
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,180
But it's really weird.

587
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,880
You can actually, um, they have the window set up to look exactly like it did on that

588
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,380
day and it's really accurate, you know, because Oswald's not in it.

589
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,260
Yeah, so.

590
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,060
Yeah, I don't know who did their research but I'm talking about...

591
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


592
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


593
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


594
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


595
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


596
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


597
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,060


598
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,300
painstaking detail.

599
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,400
It's true, man.

600
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,600
It's called the sniper's nest

601
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,780
and it's all glassed in

602
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,960
with the boxes sitting there

603
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,700
and you can't actually

604
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,700
get to the window.

605
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,300
And the reason they did that,

606
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,640
of course,

607
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,560
they didn't want thousands

608
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,620
of American tourists

609
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,480
getting to that window

610
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
each year, you know,

611
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:54,920
going,

612
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,420
there's no fucking way!

613
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,820
I can't even see the road!

614
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,140
Oh my God, they're lying!

615
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,420
It's a giant totalitarian

616
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,220
government that rules

617
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,580
the planet via the airwaves,

618
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,980
partitioning off information

619
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,860
in such a way...

620
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,780
There's no fucking way, man.

621
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,080
Not unless Oswald

622
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,720
was hanging by his toes

623
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,340
upside down from the ledge.

624
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,080
Surely someone

625
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
would have seen this.

626
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,920
Either that or some pigeons

627
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,060
grabbed onto him

628
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,980
and flew him

629
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,940
over the motorcade.

630
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,300
You know, there was rumors

631
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,640
of anti-Castro pigeons

632
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,940
seen drinking in bars

633
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,360
the night before the assassination.

634
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,880
Someone overheard them saying,

635
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,900
Coup! Coup!

636
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,720
All right.

637
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,120
Don't get on your

638
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,640
we-hate-puns high horse.

639
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,080
Fuck you.

640
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,300
That is the best goddamn pun

641
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,000
you will ever hear.

642
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,820
Oh, God.

643
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,700
Well, that's kind of

644
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,360
a rotten trick

645
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,620
to make a pun out of that one.

646
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,940
Did you hear what...

647
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,420
Oh.

648
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,040
Jacking with the...

649
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,740
But, you know,

650
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Oswald...

651
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,860
I'll tell you,

652
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,520
it's interesting, man,

653
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,600
talking about Kennedy's

654
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:30,840
assassination,

655
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,740
because to me it really is

656
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,520
this incredible example

657
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,940
of something.

658
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,600
I don't know what yet.

659
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,280
It's pretty engrossing to me.

660
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,280
But people's attitudes,

661
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,480
it's just incredible to me,

662
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,760
you know?

663
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,600
People come up to me,

664
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,420
Bill, quit talking about

665
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,020
Kennedy, man.

666
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,540
Let it go.

667
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,080
It's a long time ago.

668
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,340
Would you just forget about it?

669
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm like, okay,

670
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,460
then don't bring up

671
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,240
Jesus to me.

672
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,920
As long as we're talking

673
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,860
shelf life here.

674
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,360
Bill, you know,

675
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,520
Jesus died for you.

676
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,640
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

677
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,160
Let it go.

678
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:07,900
Let it go.

679
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,540
Forget about it.

680
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,280
How about this?

681
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,380
Get Pilate to release

682
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,240
the fucking files.

683
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,660
Quit washing your hands

684
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,060
and release the files, Pilate.

685
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,660
Who else was on that

686
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,100
grassy Golgotha that day?

687
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,240
Oh, yeah,

688
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,780
the three Roman peasants

689
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,480
with the $100 sandals.

690
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,040
Yeah, right.

691
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,580
We wouldn't be able

692
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,640
to play a Bill Hicks type

693
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,520
because he cusses,

694
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,980
you know,

695
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,960
and he's an offender.

696
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,080
You would be offended

697
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,200
if you were normal.

698
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,600
But, but,

699
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,860
if you were a subgenius,

700
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,820
why, you'd die laughing.

701
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,940
If you're a subgenius,

702
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,140
the pills that we hand out

703
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,680
on next day

704
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,600
won't hurt you a bit.

705
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,660
They'll transport you

706
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,040
to heaven.

707
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,300
But if you only thought

708
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,460
or hoped

709
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,780
you were a subgenius,

710
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,160
if your faith in Bob

711
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,820
was nothing but the,

712
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,620
the, the,

713
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,060
getting the joke of Bob.

714
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,180
Oh, I get the joke.

715
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,540
I must be a subgenius.

716
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,840
Well, go ahead

717
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,580
and take that pill.

718
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,260
Go ahead.

719
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,880
Go ahead.

720
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,820
Just gobble it down.

721
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,100
Take a whole handful.

722
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,400
We want to watch your face

723
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,940
when it sinks in

724
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,040
that Bob really did love you

725
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,300
and you didn't give him a chance.

726
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,680
You thought it was all

727
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,460
just a big, funny joke.

728
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,260
Well, I'll tell you what.

729
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,780
When those brain worms

730
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,880
are chewing their way

731
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,000
through your eardrums

732
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,860
into your brain,

733
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,700
is that when you're

734
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,080
going to be going,

735
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,040
oh, I guess this is part

736
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,480
of that satire I heard

737
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,440
on that radio show

738
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,140
at one time.

739
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,280
Oh, I guess this must be

740
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,300
part of that millennium cult

741
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,000
comedy group that I read

742
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,180
about that one time.

743
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,440
Oh, yeah.

744
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,220
You'll be wishing.

745
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,780
You'll be, you'll be wishing

746
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,620
that you still thought

747
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,340
that joke was so funny then.

748
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,360
My mouth waters

749
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,060
in anticipation

750
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,080
of your pain.

751
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,200
In fact, I'm choking on the water

752
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,480
and spit in my mouth.

753
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,540
And even now.

754
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,440
My mouth is watering so much.

755
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,820
Help!

756
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,740
Help!

757
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,100
, help!

758
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,580
Help!

759
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,540
Help!

760
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,100
Help!

761
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,200
Help!

762
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,200


763
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,440
Even now.

764
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,900
Even now he's throbbing.

765
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,920
Throbbing in ecstasy.

766
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,580
Throbbing.

767
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,620
Throbbing with that drop

768
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,680
of anticipatory gleat.

769
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,460
Gleat.

770
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,880
Gleat.

771
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,320
Oh, oh.

772
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,520
Oh, but many stop

773
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,260
when they taste

774
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,540
the pre-anticipatory gleat.

775
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,800
That's, Ben, you better stop.

776
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,260
As well they should.

777
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,080
Because the germ, the,

778
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,040
the germ ain't in the gleat.

779
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,420
But what comes right behind the gleat,

780
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,780
man, it's packing a mean load.

781
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,040
That's true.

782
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,460
And soon shall come a day.

783
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,140
Disgorgeous, strange creatures.

784
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,240
Soon will come a day

785
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,120
when you cannot live without your daily gleat.

786
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,100
And you'll drop to your knees.

787
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,600
Oh, Jesus, give me this day my daily gleat.

788
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,620
Oh, God.

789
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,600
Good Lord, man.

790
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,860
Soon you're wandering the streets.

791
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,720
You'll be wanting to look at that person

792
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,600
who's walking on the other side of the street and think,

793
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,580
I wonder if he has any gleat.

794
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,340
Does he have gleat?

795
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,840
I must go and take his gleat.

796
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,840
And you'll stand behind an old man

797
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,540
in line at the supermarket and go,

798
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,960
He stinks of gleat.

799
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,540
He is gleat-ridden.

800
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,720
But it is diseased gleat.

801
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,480
It is foul.

802
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:07,000
It is a foul ichor that has disgorged from this old man.

803
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,440
And must I sit here and be offended by this offender

804
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,360
and smell him, smelling of him?

805
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:13,820
Ugh!

806
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,920
And yet you can't turn away.

807
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,860
For soon it no longer matters whether the gleat is poison or not.

808
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,680
You'll be willing to take that chance

809
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,400
just because you rationalize it to yourself.

810
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,680
Well, there's a 50% chance that his gleat is bad.

811
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,460
And I might end up taking it.

812
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,380
On a bad gleat trip.

813
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,960
But, but, but perhaps that gland is not half empty at all,

814
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,940
but half full.

815
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,540
Half full of gleat.

816
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,800
Uh, sure.

817
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,400
Go ahead. Give it a try.

818
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,840
Hey, man, too much is always better than not enough.

819
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,960
That's what Bob said.

820
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,580
Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.

821
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,440
I better drink this extra jug of Everclear.

822
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,560
I better, I better shoot up this extra wad of opium.

823
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,280
I better, uh, um,

824
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,180
suck down this extra five canisters of church air.

825
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:15,880
I might as well just swallow that one last load of anticipatory gleat.

826
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,240
Yeah, go ahead.

827
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,840
There's probably no germs in that.

828
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,660
There's probably no E. coli in that gleat.

829
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,100
Hey, hey, they probably serve that gleat up at Burger King.

830
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:26,580
Heck.

831
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,420
Yeah.

832
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,560
And, and eventually, you know,

833
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,120
Oh, man, just did a line of gleat.

834
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:32,500
you're gonna get caught.

835
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,960
You're gonna get caught eventually.

836
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,620
Oh, man, this stuff is legal.

837
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,880
Now, you'll get stopped down on the,

838
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,100
you'll, you'll get stopped by the police driving down the road,

839
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,440
I want your hands.

840
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,300
weaving.

841
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,200
Damn, I mean, I can't afford that.

842
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,020
And the cop's gonna look at you and he's gonna say,

843
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,520
I can't afford that.

844
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,380
Man, is that gleat dripping down your chin?

845
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,620
Ah, your whole car reeks of gleat.

846
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,400
And soon they're gonna drag out the gleat sniffing dogs

847
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,400
who are gonna come up and they're gonna sniff all around you,

848
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,560
trying to find out where that gleat is.

849
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,200
You can't hide this now.

850
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,000
And it won't matter where you hide the gleat

851
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,380
because the dog's gonna smell that.

852
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,060
No, no, sir, man.

853
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,480
You can pack it up your exit wound.

854
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,720
Haven't had any gleating weeks, sir.

855
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:08,480
Sir, I'm clean.

856
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,340
Townie, I'm clean.

857
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,620
Oh, next thing you know,

858
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,460
they're gonna be all getting together

859
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,140
in some old civic center on a Saturday night

860
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,840
and be like, hello, my name is Edward Strange

861
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,780
and I, I'm a gleat head.

862
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,320
I'm your slave.

863
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,680
Live from Hollywood High.

864
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,800
Live from Hollywood High.

865
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,180
Who else would be stupid enough to show up for the showdown?

866
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,040
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.

867
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,240
Look what else is new for you.

868
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,520
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.

869
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,020
The secret that unlocks flavor.

870
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,000
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

871
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,960
Everybody say amen.

872
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,000
Amen.

873
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,780
Amen.

874
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,200
Oh, oh.

875
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,020
Five, four, three, two, one, fire.

876
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,120
Do you believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel?

877
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

878
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,060
Empires and those civilizations,

879
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,220
they had a whole pantheon of gods,

880
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,780
none of whom really existed.

881
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,200
They had their concept of Zeus,

882
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,940
which was the Greek word for Jupiter.

883
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,780
Be part of the illusion,

884
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,540
because there are young people out there doing good things.

885
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,160
But you've heard so far.

886
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,760
What, what I believe is that there is one way, God's way.

887
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,740
The soul and the mind and the heart.

888
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,220
A penis does not make a person.

889
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,740
Then why aren't you more concerned with what's inside

890
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:59,200
and what the soul is instead of what's outside?

891
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,640
Let me...

892
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,500
Eyeglasses are forbidden by God.

893
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,000
We're talking about people here trying to cut off their genitals

894
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,120
to rearrange their God-given sex themselves with sharp instruments.

895
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,660
This...

896
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,760
You say God, there's God, whatever.

897
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,200
Yes.

898
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,460
God gave humans a brain.

899
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,100
He gave us knowledge to do whatever we want to do.

900
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,700
Who ordained you?

901
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,140
I had such a fierce, intense fight

902
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,620
with fire burning inside of me.

903
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,560
It just was so much that just wants to explode.

904
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,300
Well...

905
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,500
I've just totally run out of any kind of shtick

906
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,500
or any kind of imaginative thing to say, Dave.

907
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,480
I think we ought to just get real for a minute.

908
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,160
What did you have for dinner tonight, Dave?

909
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,840
Well, for dinner tonight, I had a six-pack of Gold's beer.

910
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,940
I had, uh...

911
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,520
Well, what was left of that stuff I had by the decomposed Brillo pad,

912
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,060
and I had, uh...

913
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,200
Someone offered me a sandwich, but I declined.

914
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,040
Well, I asked him to get real, and at least he got real.

915
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,720
Uh, Princess Wee, what did you have for dinner tonight?

916
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,840
What did I have for dinner tonight?

917
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,880
I think it was bug porn.

918
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,960
No, don't you remember...

919
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,580
I know, I was supposed to be real.

920
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,100
I forgot.

921
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,020
I'm sorry.

922
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,620
Reverend Stang, can you forgive me?

923
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,120
No.

924
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,560
Um...

925
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,740
Uh, uh, uh, no.

926
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,940
No, I cannot forgive you.

927
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,120
No, not this time.

928
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,680
And Bob will not forgive you,

929
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,960
because he does not think you have anything you need to be forgiven for.

930
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,740
He will merely excuse you for forgetting that, in fact,

931
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,280
you yourself cooked two hours ago, about three hours ago,

932
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,480
a fine repast of, I believe you called it,

933
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,760
Thai-Japanese-Scandinavian-Chinese-style curry.

934
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,220
Uh, vegetarian Italian-Chinese-Scandinavian curry.

935
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,660
With fish sauce.

936
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,860
With meat.

937
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,580
With tamari sauce.

938
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,240
Tamari and tamari and tamari.

939
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,440
Drip in this freaky paste hot sauce.

940
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,340
Endless drip sauce.

941
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:22,500
Through the last screaming syllabus of last year's college courses.

942
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,240
Engamated festerings.

943
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,220
Festerings.

944
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,740
And all the other things.

945
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,360
And all our report cards.

946
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:37,060
Uh, roast a path of plusty, lusty bug porn and bad breath.

947
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:45,360
Unto the final teardrops and bell ringings of a lost horizon.

948
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:54,380
Ah, yes, as the Liberty Bell cracks and California slides into the ocean,

949
00:53:54,380 --> 00:54:00,340
and all the UFOs spin, crashing to the ground in New Mexico,

950
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,340
the subgeniuses, yes, link themselves arm in arm and march.

951
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,200
Arm in arm.

952
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,840
One by one, two by two, into the Atlantic Ocean.

953
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:19,600
Their bloated feet shining, their eyes set on some distant star.

954
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,880
They march like lemmings into the sea,

955
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,420
with their hearts full of pride,

956
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:31,260
knowing that in a short time, they'll have drunk their last Ceylon solution.

957
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,620
And as they all disappear beneath the waves,

958
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,680
only one, the first one, the leader, continues on across the ocean.

959
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:47,680
The pipe stick alone, sticking out up over the surface like a periscope,

960
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,280
a backwards pointing periscope,

961
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,200
as Bob swims and breathes through that pipe like a snorkel,

962
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,960
a flaming snorkel that never goes out.

963
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,600
Bob swims on.

964
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:08,060
His followers long since drowned, lost in Davy Jones' locker.

965
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,140
But Bob swims on and on and on.

966
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,640
And where, where is Bob going? Where does Bob swim?

967
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,260
Well, five weeks later, he washes up,

968
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,660
and...

969
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,040
England, where he looks for a bowl of fish and chips

970
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,560
and wanders off into the night.

971
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,700
There was no point in the end to the deaths of the millions who followed him,

972
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,800
and no point to this story of Bob's final fish and chip dinner.

973
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,300
But friends, you know those fish and chips, as bad as they are,

974
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,380
don't taste all that bad with vinegar.

975
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:50,720
The old Christ Bob.

976
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,620
Tears me up, man.

977
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,040
Don't just stare.

978
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:01,620
And friends, you do know that the church does make its own malt vinegar,

979
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,400
which is also suitable for douching before the ceremonial ointment.

980
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:11,020
And this fish and chip dinner set, this whole china set right here,

981
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:15,320
imported all the way from London, is only, at this time right now, $16.99.

982
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,720
If you remove the tiny little, the nano screws,

983
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,200
and the other little, and just send them back,

984
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,040
we're recalling each and every one of them.

985
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,600
They don't work, we don't care.

986
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,860
But as long as you send your 30 bucks to the Church of the Subgenius,

987
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,060
I think we can work out something with you.

988
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,900
Don't you think so?

989
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,800
I don't think so.

990
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,460
Don't you think so?

991
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,380
I think so.

992
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,380
I don't think so.

993
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,220
Do you think so?

994
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,480
And if you aren't completely satisfied with this church,

995
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:45,000
send it back, and we'll send you another one free of charge.

996
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:45,680
.

997
00:56:47,820 --> 00:57:08,600
That's Bob at B-O-B, P-O-B-O-X, I-4-O-BOB, or P.O. Box 140306.

998
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,320

1006
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,020
But I'm not.

1007
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,600
And we've never lied to you.

1008
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,480
We've never told you the truth, but we've never, ever lied.

1009
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,980
We never will lie.

1010
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,480
And this that I'm saying right now is not a lie.

1011

Ja Question.

1016
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:23,340
souvenir after you're destroyed in the end times for being faithless. Ain't it great? He loves us

1017
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:34,800
so and hates you. That man Bob, if man he be, he don't care about you, but he cares about me.

1018
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:47,540
Devanda, come here honey. I met that guy again. You know that the chair Bob dog? Oh yeah, yeah.

1019
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,140
He was rubbing my chacha so hard I started to overheat man. I told him it was free.

1020
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:59,040
And then you know what happened? No. I ended up paying him. Oh you paid him? Yeah, I can hardly

1021
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,340
wait for him to come back tomorrow. Oh I would pay him too. I ain't walking these streets for nothing.

1022
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,540
Oh man, really, really? It was him? It was him. It was really him? You want me to introduce you to him?

1023
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:15,240
Yes. Oh yeah, I can do that. He likes all of us. I mean he told me so.
