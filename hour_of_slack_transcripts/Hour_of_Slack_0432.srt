1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,620
I got arrested. Come on, Hal. We're already two hours late for the show.

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,000
Watch it with that water, man. We don't have much. So where's the road?

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:24,320
Behind us. Behind us? What the? I thought we were going towards the road.

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Look, we've got to get to our show before there's just a big blank space and nothing else.

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,980
I hope it lasts till we get there.

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah, I know.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,080
My feet are killing me.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,700
See, the sun's this way, so the road's got to be over there.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,300
Yeah, but the moss is growing on the other side of that.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,460
The radiation warning signs are all pointing that way.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,740
It looks kind of menacing. The sun's just coming up.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,100
If that really is the sun.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah, the sun's just coming up.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,540
It looks pretty weird.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:52,840
What?

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,800
There it is.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,320


18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,900
Just wish...

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,080
I don't...

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,360
That looks like the Cactus Rim, Arizona's national...

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,280
No, I don't think this is Arizona, Hal. This is Texas.

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,180
Yeah, there it is.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,960
We've got to be in Texas.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,060
Let's get out of here. It's creepy.

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,520
I just hope the Indians haven't set one of their deadly traps.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,620
Hey, watch out.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,560
Boy, we'll never get back to KPFA at this rate.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,220
KPFA?

29
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,780
I thought we were going to KMON.

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,860
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,240
All we have to do is reach the mall.

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,240
We've got to get to the mobile field in town.

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,820
We can start our broadcast.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,560
And also, we should just be able to see the rocket from here somewhere.

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm afraid that went down several hours ago.

36
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,480
A rocket?

37
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,700
No rescues out of the question.

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,740
It would have shown up on our locule.

39
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,500
But...

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,640
Look over there.

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,820
Just a natural rock formation.

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,800
Nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,340
It's moving.

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,360
That's a secret.

45
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,180
It looks like a big scary monster.

46
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,020
I know, but...

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,180
You know, out in the desert, things can look like things that they aren't.

48
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,180
It's called a psychic heat mirage.

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,640
They call them duendes.

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,060
Oh, don't talk about the duendes.

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,320


52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,080
Yeah, the Indians say they're little shriveled, dried up, mummified like beings about a foot

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,860
tall that grab onto your bike like you're a monster.

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,680
Look at this rock over here.

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:05,960
Just...

56
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh!

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,100
Just tear a piece off.

58
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:08,820
That...

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,020
What's that?

60
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,460
A baby?

61
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,200
This cactus doesn't feel like plastic.

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,400
These rocks are made out of paper mache.

63
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,920
Nah, it's just a...

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
This tree is made out of a spring.

65
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
Maybe we can get some water, huh?

66
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,340
I don't know, you guys.

67
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,520
What does that symbol mean?

68
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,040
Oh, yeah.

69
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,980
This is bed springs.

70
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,300
That's what it's called.

71
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,300


72
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,300


73
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,460
I don't know.

74
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


76
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


77
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:24,540


78
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,200
We're not in any more coffee.

79
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,520
Doesn't that mean biochemical hazards or something?

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,220
I don't know sugar, no more beans.

81
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,780
I can't figure out where the road is.

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,080
At least we got a good astronomical observation last night.

83
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,620
Check out the man pack, see if we can figure out where we are.

84
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,500
We better get a Geiger counter reading.

85
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,420
... called it.

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,040
SS-433.

87
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,240
It's kind of cold out here.

88
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,380
Don't call it nuclear winter, but nothing.

89
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,140
The air is clear, but for our readings, we can take another reading a little later on.

90
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
I just hope we've got something to say.

91
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,300


92
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,300


93
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,300


94
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
I'll tell you when it's time for that broadcast.

95
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,540
Yeah, no kidding.

96
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I love my script.

97
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,140
A lot of people are counting on us.

98
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,020
Remember that.

99
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
All ten listeners in the Bay Area.

100
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,080
The Bay Area.

101
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
They've got to hear us.

102
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
There you go.

103
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,160
This is Texas.

104
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,260
Come on, you guys.

105
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,460
Oh, look, a jackalope, Arizona's national rabbit.

106
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,660
I thought those were extinct.

107
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,100
There it goes.

108
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,200
It's glowing.

109
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,980
It has little speakers on its head.

110
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,160
Yeah, I wonder where that's coming from.

111
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,140
It's probably an observation drone.

112
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,540
We all follow where the artists lead us.

113
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,660
They are our Galileans, our Louisians, our Edisons.

114
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,540
And the artists are telling you to pledge to them the show.

115
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,100
We'll see you next time.

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,500
What?

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,220
What?

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,260
What?

119
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:24,920
What?

120
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,660
What?

121
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


122
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:25,760


123
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,420
Oh.

124
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh.

125
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:27,940
What?

126
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:27,940


127
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Oh.

128
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,560
Oh.

129
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:29,660
Oh.

130
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,040
Oh.

131
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh.

132
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:30,920
Oh.

133
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,560
Oh.

134
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,160
The knee-deep sheep dip dipped deep down below the steep and chilly waters of the

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,700
deep stream floats on the surface like the ancient Egyptians floated on the current of

136
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,140
their beliefs.

137
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,140


138
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,140


139
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,040
for they thought they would never die,

140
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,160
but be reborn as gargling sarcophagi,

141
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,920
horrible mummies to march across the earth

142
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,020
and wreak and spew vengeance.

143
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,220
All of the little tiny dead deities

144
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,360
marched down the side of the subgenius church

145
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,740
and now live and die.

146
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,200
Within the great pyramid,

147
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,760
the secret chamber of the subgenius.

148
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,700
What light and steam come from the special effects department

149
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,980
located below the pyramid?

150
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,740
Here, inside the heart of the mighty structure

151
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,920
puzzling evidence broadcasts

152
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,060
from the inner chamber of the great pyramid.

153
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah, I'll teach you all how to talk on the radio.

154
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Come on down.

155
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,060
Yes, these giant pyramids are actually radio stations

156
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,240
of a primitive nature,

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,620
which broadcast by the strange shape of the sun.

158
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,540
I'll play rock and roll until everybody falls apart.

159
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,120
I'll copy that old Procter & Bergman movie.

160
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,540
Then they would show the strange films

161
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,220
to the walls of the...

162
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,020
Come on, let's watch it, Jamie.

163
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,280
Close your eyes gently

164
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
and let your mind develop a sense of the future.

165
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,140
Close your eyes gently

166
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,720
and try to imagine that this background tape

167
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,940
has not somehow lost its little fuzzy...

168
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,000
I bet that's...

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,280
No, the little fuzzy pressure pad is rotted away.

170
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,680
Yes, it's a little rotted away.

171
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,720
Let's try it up here.

172
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,260
I was trying to hypnotize you.

173
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,860
Easier.

174
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,400
There we go.

175
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,760
Ah, yes.

176
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,520
Regular.

177
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,800
I think...

178
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,660
And easier now.

179
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,480
I think we can get into it.

180
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,400
It will become regulated...

181
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,220
Into a faultless pattern

182
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,300
as you breathe slowly.

183
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,900
Yes, we can calm down now.

184
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,180
Let's be quiet.

185
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,620
And deeply.

186
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,180
And let's...

187
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,080
In perfect rhythm.

188
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,960
With Bob.

189
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,360
As you let yourself go...

190
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,000
To Bob.

191
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,000
And begin to relax...

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,780
And call the...

193
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,180
Completely.

194
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,880
Station.

195
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,840
Completely.

196
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,300
You are letting yourself go.

197
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,460
You're writing the...

198
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,480
A little more.

199
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,820
Writing the check.

200
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,780
And a little more.

201
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,560
You're thinking of Bob.

202
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,260
Every nerve.

203
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Every muscle is responding and relaxing.

204
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,560
To Bob.

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,520
As you drift deeper and deeper into quiet, soothing rest.

206
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,260
Quiet, soothing customership.

207
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,500
Your mind is perfectly at ease.

208
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,140
You finally paid up.

209
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,060
A delightful sensation of peace and quiet envelops and enfolds your entire body.

210
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,220
You know the station has your money.

211
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,520
A perfect sense of peace and contentment is taking possession of you.

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,700
No more guilt.

213
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,940
No more guilt.

214
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,780
You have completely let go.

215
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,200
You're gone.

216
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,500
Dismissed all your worries.

217
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,540
You're dismissed now.

218
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,740
All your tensions.

219
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,880
You've made your pledge.

220
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,560
All your fears.

221
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,880
You no longer need to fear.

222
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,740
And you can feel yourself.

223
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
Total and utter destruction.

224
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,640
Drifting away through the white, silky clouds.

225
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,140
Oh, yeah.

226
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,200
High above the peaceful green landscape below.

227
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
Oh, Frappy.

228
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,960
The warm, radiant sunlight is gentle and relaxing.

229
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:50,940
You're going to be fine.

230
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


231
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


232
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


233
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


234
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


235
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


236
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


237
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:50,940


238
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,900
As it sifts through the heavenly clouds so still and quiet above you.

239
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,620
No.

240
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,580
Quiet except for the sound of your fingers pushing the button.

241
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,040
To call and pledge all that you can spare.

242
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,500
Mayhaps even all that you have.

243
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,880
Just call the station.

244
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,480
Call the station.

245
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,240
We shall triumph with your donation.

246
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:36,960
You know, the subgenius foundation gets dozens of cassette weird outs in the mail every month,

247
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,320
yes.

248
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,480
And we extract the very best squeezings.

249
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,880
And then we boil that brew down even further to create that essence, that very resin of

250
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,520
slack that you seek.

251
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,940
And then we boil that brew down even further to create that essence, that very resin of

252
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:50,940


253
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:50,940


254
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,060
But too few have yet realized that the electronic media that the church and its allies generate

255
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,060
is as dense as its printed media and vice versa.

256
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,080
And those who buy usually come back for more and more and more.

257
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,640
Veritable junkies, my friends, for the Dobbsward.

258
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,400
But then some never buy.

259
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,720
Of course, I don't blame you.

260
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,560
You can get this radio show for free.

261
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,920
But only for so long.

262
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Only as long as somebody is making those lovely pledges and getting that wonderful hour of

263
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,180
slack t-shirt, oh yes, and those free tickets to some comedy show.

264
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,620
Of course, you know, we, I'm sure most of you wouldn't be interested in comedy.

265
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,880
This is a pretty serious radio ministry, actually.

266
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,100
And because, yes, Bob speaks now through his ministers and his disciples.

267
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,940
He speaks to you.

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,820
You can hear him in the background now.

269
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,580
It's Bob.

270
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,840
All by himself.

271
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,960
That's the way he sounds.

272
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,240
He's talking in his sleep in this special recording.

273
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,060
You know, there are subgeniuses on this earth who have practiced for so long and with such

274
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:16,080
fervor at the occult art of auto-psychic trance babbling that they've become channels for the

275
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
very word and song and fervor.

276
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,460
The filthy routine of Dobbs himself.

277
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,460
The holy media of mediums and extremists.

278
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,300
These shows, friends, are realer than any mortal can ever be.

279
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,400
Bob is moving across the face and tongue of all the Americas.

280
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
The time is drawing near.

281
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,760
The doctors for Bob are willing to be killing.

282
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
And the fall of the pinks.

283
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,400
The pinks is nigh.

284
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,640
But only if you call in, friends.

285
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,540
Only if you call in.

286
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,040
Well, we warned you that it was a pledge-drive night.

287
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:07,420
And by that self-same token, I think we should, as we did last week, rather than pester you

288
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,460
and harp on those who haven't pledged and so forth, rather than, we've decided that

289
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,260
honey will draw more of you flies than will toxic bees.

290
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,420
Cobra venom.

291
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,140
Uh, so with that in mind, let's see if we can call up CD number one for some lovely

292
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,900
background music by Rudy Schwartz Project.

293
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,180
And, uh, rather than harp on you for not sending money, let's harp on the conspiracy for making

294
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,180
us have to worry about this money anyway in the first place.

295
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,180
Because as it says here in this flyer from Radio Werewolf,

296
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,080
it's sad, dear friends, but you-

297
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,660
Wait a minute.

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,660
That isn't-

299
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,140
God, I have-

300
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,080
What?

301
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,200
If-

302
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,780
For-

303
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:15,120
You should pledge for no other reason than to pay for a goddamn recording engineer to come in here and make my decisions for me.

304
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,700
I just-

305
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:15,980
Some-

306
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:22,040
Some nights it just goes so smooth, and other times it's just not right.

307
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,660
Well, I'm gonna go for an old standby, one I can depend on, one that I know will play, uh, properly, for, uh,

308
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,460
well, maybe I won't.

309
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,320
Maybe I should just harp on the money after all.

310
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,260
What song is this?

311
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,000
I was trying to play Django's Waffle Apparatus.

312
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,920
I'm gonna try again.

313
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
Well, no wonder I did have it queued up wrong.

314
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,620
That's number eleven.

315
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,780
Push a one and a one.

316
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,960
And-

317
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,560
And-

318
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:49,880
Oops.

319
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,980
I did it wrong again, friends.

320
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,540
I'm telling you, there are those, uh, shows that-

321
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:05,000
You know, a lot of the time what you think has been carefully prepared is just happening by chance in the most marvelous way.

322
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,380
And then other times, it just doesn't all-

323
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,360
You know, I think it's gonna happen that way, and then it just doesn't.

324
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,920
Just-

325
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,940
It'll get you.

326
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,060
Okay, let's get back to hatin'.

327
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,360
Some good proper hatin'.

328
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:36,700
Radio Werewolf sent us this little flyer that says, you know, friends, work attracts the lowest elements in our society, those who will do anything for money.

329
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,340
Although the evils of employment are many, and the physical damage it does to the individual's health, it's not a big deal.

330
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,540
The worst aspect of working is the effect it has on our young.

331
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,700
A media images of successful businessmen with fancy cars and expensive watches and beautiful women-

332
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Or was that beautiful watches and expensive women?

333
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,760
Send our kids the message that working is okay.

334
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,480
That work pays.

335
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,800
In this way, the cycle of employment dependency is perpetuated from generation to generation.

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,460
This cycle is illustrated by the below chart from Berlin's Schoenwether Institute.

337
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:29,840
120 years ago, when people had pride in themselves and their community, only 6% of the population was willing to sell itself for money.

338
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,580
The rest lived by their wits.

339
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:41,780
But now that the public school system has rendered our nation witless, is there any reason to believe that employment dependency, already at 50%,

340
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,780
will not increase in the future?

341
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,860
We must act now, dear friends.

342
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,240
And the best way you can act on that, and end the very concept of work, is to support the church of the subgenius.

343
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,040
But you know something?

344
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,560
To completely and utterly destroy the concept of money, my friends, it's gonna take money.

345
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
It's gonna take a lot of money.

346
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,280
And I want you to call this station.

347
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,160
In the meantime, I want you to take a good look at yourself.

348
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,620
And listen to this list of 10 signs that you are employment dependent.

349
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,380
That you are an employee.

350
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,500
If any three of the following describe you, you probably have a job and should seek help immediately.

351
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,840
Number one.

352
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,740
On Saturday and Sunday, you're still waking up early for your morning commute.

353
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,180
And number two.

354
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,240
When trying to open the door to your house, you find yourself using the key to your office.

355
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,540
Do these things happen to you, friends?

356
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,080
While at home, you answer the phone in an official manner, citing the name of your company.

357
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,360
Hey, Will, you got another call.

358
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,900
Uh...

359
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,220
Five.

360
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,080
You have a jar full of quarters next to the coffee machine in your house.

361
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,120
Four.

362
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,760
While at home, you find yourself smoking in the bathroom and leaving cigarette butts in the unflushed toilet.

363
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:02,880
Six.

364
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,400
You habitually frequent places of employment.

365
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Stores, restaurants, malls.

366
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Any place filled with employees.

367
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:13,860
Seven.

368
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,320
You never drink until after five.

369
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,240
Even when someone else is buying lunch and you could stiff them with a large bill.

370
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,880
Number eight.

371
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,820
When behind a person paying with food stamps at the supermarket, you feel indignant and superior.

372
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,400
Telling yourself that only weak people don't work.

373
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,500
If he was a real man, he'd have a job.

374
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,360
Number nine.

375
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,760
You imagine yourself to have a physical dependency on work.

376
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,400
Believing that you would starve to death if you quit working.

377
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,200
You even wonder if you'd have any friends at all if it wasn't for the co-workers bonding you did at the company picnic.

378
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,920
And number ten.

379
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,780
You find yourself oddly silent when others around you, the subgeniuses, are mocking yuppies.

380
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:07,040
And you notice that you only think about sex when the Victoria's Secret catalog arrives in the mail.

381
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, friends.

382
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,260
If three or more of the above describe you.

383
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,340
You probably have a job and should seek help immediately.

384
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,460
So, and you can get that help apparently from Radio Werewolf.

385
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,100
Who, uh, did that little pamphlet we've been looking at.

386
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,740
At post office box 75416.

387
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,920
Washington, D.C.

388
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,740
Two double oh one three.

389
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,660
I know you, the half of you people are out there taping this show.

390
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,960
I know it.

391
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,980
And, uh, you know, I know that cassette costs you at least a dollar.

392
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,240
Why don't you spend another four or five keeping us on the air so you have something to tape.

393
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,720
Besides the Guy Lombardo record.

394
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,520
Uh, that we were gonna torture you with.

395
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,380
But we're not going to, friends.

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Because, well, we're gonna, we're gonna torture you some other way.

397
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,720
I think I'll, I think I'll do this!

398
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,260
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob.

399
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,320
My wife belongs to Bob.

400
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,720
Bob!

401
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,960
Coming out to you from the depths of my heart.

402
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,920
And I can, I can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones waiting.

403
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,060
Now the phones are ringing here.

404
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,000
We're doing great.

405
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,600
Uh, this time we got all the beautiful girls.

406
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,480
The, uh, the mighty studliest of genius ministers sitting here waiting to catch your calls.

407
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,120
They're all busy.

408
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,780
But if you get a busy signal, just call back again.

409
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,680
Because we sure ain't gonna turn down a bit of your money, dear friends.

410
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,380
You know that.

411
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,580
That's one thing you can always trust a Bob.

412
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,220
Listen to those things going off in the background and, uh...

413
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,520
So, bro...

414
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,960
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

415
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,260
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

416
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,560
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

417
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,740
You've found a new and interesting way of earning extra income, right?

418
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,940
In fact, quite a bit of extra income if that's your goal.

419
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,300
Even the chance for a whole new lifestyle.

420
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,380
Why not share it?

421
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,140
It's certainly to your benefit and to the benefit of those you sponsor.

422
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,340
So, for all I know, maybe these...

423
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,840
Ah, yes.

424
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,720
Oh, we've got...

425
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,100
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

426
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,340
That comes with a $200 pledge.

427
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,800
Sire, there is no more money.

428
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,340
We gotta get some money.

429
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,900
That dirty perky shark back here.

430
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,740
When this...

431
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,640
Oh, friends, you know I'm about to get serious when you hear the Doctors for Bob background music.

432
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,560
And it's true.

433
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,940
I mean, as bad as we need that money, you know what we need it for?

434
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,220
We need it to completely and utterly destroy the concept of work.

435
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,380
And yet, what's hideously...

436
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,360
What's most hideously...

437
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,440
Ironic of all of it is that we who most appreciate slack are actually the hardest workers.

438
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,880
I know it sounds incredible, ludicrous, crazy even, but it's true.

439
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:30,460
Pinks who only care about money and status are, contrary to popular belief, lazier than we are.

440
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,080
A subgenius once forced into an unpleasant situation, such as employment,

441
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,960
is usually gamed to go the distance in style,

442
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,900
and as a kind of reverse screw-up, actually do the job better than the conspiracy dupes would.

443
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,520
Of course, this so-called job well done might later be revealed as a completely destructive act of sabotage.

444
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:03,680
But you know, it's always infuriating to see nice-looking pinks getting paid mega bucks

445
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,520
for doing what any moron could do but doesn't want to have to dress up and kiss butt for.

446
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,280
The fact is, just about any moron could indeed do it, and better.

447
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,020
Being unfettered by megalomaniac concerns of grooming aids and ultimate lifestyle,

448
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,520
the moron calls forth creative solutions to whatever problems lay at hand.

449
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,940
Subgenii, if only to make themselves feel superior,

450
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,400
are always looking for ways to improve things, to cut through the red tape,

451
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,480
to force thrills from a chore in any way possible,

452
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,640
to customize everything around thing.

453
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,840
Normals are much more comfortable with bland, half-assed work,

454
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,620
and bland, half-assed relaxation as well.

455
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,880
They can't understand slack because they can't understand real work.

456
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,880
I.e. work one wants to do.

457
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,280
The idea of modifying the world around them is an alien concept to them.

458
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,880
They'll modify things according to the plan of some subgenius,

459
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,260
but they never really initiate anything because of their crippling fear of blame.

460
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,400
As pinks will go to the trouble of starting lynch mobs

461
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,140
just to avoid admitting they might have been wrong in the first place.

462
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,540
Because friends,

463
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,760
the conspiracy doesn't want you to care whether something works,

464
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,520
only whether everybody else is doing it.

465
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,720
This tendency becomes a serious liability

466
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,520
when the continued survivability of, oh say, a planet is in question.

467
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,380
But the life of the successful pink only appears tranquil.

468
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,340
Drones aren't quite as mindless as they seem.

469
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,740
Every moment of their lives, even when they feel happy,

470
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,120
they barrage themselves with unvoiced questions.

471
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,880
What's my share?

472
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,240
How well can I play the game?

473
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,940
When should I nod?

474
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,120
Who should I imitate to prove I'm an original creative person?

475
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,500
How can I gain from somebody else's creativity, labor, and effort?

476
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,380
How can I leech off the dues they paid so I don't have to pay any myself?

477
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,840
And most of all,

478
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,720
how can I prevent myself from being a loser?

479
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Ever knowing and admitting that that is what I'm doing.

480
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm not just playing around,

481
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,320


482
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,300
Never leaves a gap

483
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,380
Unfilled

484
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,240
Always pays on time

485
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,700
Always fits the bill

486
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,020
Hiccup worth repair

487
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,140
Cube tops

488
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,980
Squared off

489
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,940
Eight corners

490
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,020
Nine degree angles

491
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,600
Back top, step straight ahead, stop, march, blockhead!

492
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,820
Never tips over, stands upon his own, he is a blockhead.

493
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,480
Thinking man for wrong, he can fall prepared.

494
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,520
Q top, square off, eight corners, ninety degree angle.

495
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,140
Black top, step straight ahead, snake eyes, blockhead!

496
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:39,720
Black top, step straight ahead, stop, march, blockhead!

497
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:52,460
Never tips over, stands upon his own, he is a blockhead.

498
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Thinking man for wrong, he can fall prepared.

499
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:05,420
Q top, square off, eight corners, ninety degree angle.

500
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,000
Black top, step straight ahead, snake eyes, blockhead!

501
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,780
Q top, square off, eight corners, ninety degree angle.

502
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,080
Black top, blockhead!

503
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,920
Step straight ahead, blockhead!

504
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,720
Stop, march, blockhead!

505
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Blockhead!

506
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,520
Blockhead!

507
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,060
Yes dear friends, it's true.

508
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,780
Now I'm gonna continue with that little extra kick in the butt from Devo there.

509
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:50,160
To bitch and gripe about why it is that we have to bitch and gripe about money.

510
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,220
And I mean I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

511
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,660
We could go on like this forever and we would not be bored.

512
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,000
And even if you were, we wouldn't care.

513
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,660
Friends, the people to avoid are the ones with really large egos.

514
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:14,600
These are helpful hints, by the way, from Revelation X on how to deal with the job world.

515
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,360
We're trying to help you learn how to hack and chop your way through that job world.

516
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,460
And you think that's all you've got?

517
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,460


518
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,460


519
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,700
You see, as we say, the ones to avoid are the ones with merely large egos.

520
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:37,880
Now our egos are so huge, yet simultaneously so tiny, that they become as microcosm and macrocosm, encompassing all creation.

521
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:52,360
Pumped up to such a size that they thin out, become transparent, getting fainter and fainter until they're so delicate that their atoms pass between the atoms.

522
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,440
They're so delicate that their atoms pass between the atoms.

523
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,440


524
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,100
They're so delicate that their atoms pass between the atoms.

525
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,720
And finally they merge with them.

526
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,260
One might as well try to insult a tree, as insult a sub-genius.

527
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,640
But the people with merely large egos are the ones who require constant and copious feeding.

528
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,980
They seek proof of their greatness by, quote, demanding respect, unquote.

529
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:22,360
Now whereas we are so naturally great that we could take or leave greatness, and can forgive its lack in others.

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,440
While at the same time we attempt to destroy our own greatness.

531
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:39,040
Those who desperately need to prove they're great have to legitimize their existences by making a big deal out of how serious they are, or else how silly, as opposed to humorous.

532
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:48,100
Indeed, the degree to which one can't take a joke directly correlates with one's level of general incompetency.

533
00:28:50,100 --> 00:29:01,000
Paradoxically, as we said, subgeniuses like to work at what they like, and ironically are often the hardest workers on the team, even when the task is to not work.

534
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,880
They put things off, but then overdo the job at the last minute.

535
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:14,260
They loaf every chance they can get, and are always late, but in the long run, they get everything done that was worth doing.

536
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,080
Now, some pinks make wonderful co-signers.

537
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,480
Pinks with no egos or regular-sized egos can be a dream to work with.

538
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,000
Some even instinctively mock their own frailties and foibles.

539
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:40,560
But then there are those pinks with egos slightly larger than they themselves are, who are lazy, unpleasant, and incompetent, yet somehow think they are above the work, destined for a higher niche.

540
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:48,080
And it's so far beneath them to be working there in the shop with you that they see no point in doing their jobs adequately, if at all.

541
00:29:48,100 --> 00:30:02,420
These evil pink co-workers, whose every statement is some kind of transparent ploy, are so incapable of honesty that the best way to intimidate them is to be completely honest and sincere.

542
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,800
It's like confronting them with a five-headed baby.

543
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,080
They don't know how to deal with it.

544
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,940
It's outside of their existence.

545
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,580
They act like a monkey who's been handed an algebra book.

546
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,080
All they can do is gnaw on it, pee on it, get frustrated, and say,

547
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,080


548
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,080


549
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,020
Screech at it!

550
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,460
It's a fun trick to play on them.

551
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:32,300
Uh, note, friends, sincerity and honesty are not recommended for use on evil pink bosses.

552
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,700
That's a different thing entirely, and we wouldn't want to leave you astray.

553
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,100
Well, uh, yes.

554
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,640
Now I think it is time to...

555
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,780
...to calm down for just a second and change show.

556
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,300
As we listen to, uh, our good friend Jay Condom's, uh, background music here from his album...

557
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,840
...his and Gary Panter's album, One Hell's Sound Witch.

558
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,400
We just heard from Dr. Condom.

559
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm sure he wanted to remind us to mention his name over the radio.

560
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,780
And as well we should.

561
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
You should all run out of friends.

562
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,240
You ain't...

563
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,240
We've only got 25 more minutes of fledged drive here to go.

564
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,260
But we can make that 25 minutes seem like forever.

565
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,540
We really can.

566
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,680
All I have to do is start playing nothing but these old fledged drive tapes.

567
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,700
I guess that's what it's gonna be.

568
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,940
So...

569
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,400
When this show ends, if you haven't helped the st- the station, what you know as reality is gonna come to a crashing halt.

570
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,000
All energy of all universes...

571
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,240
...of all dimensions...

572
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,550
...of all time frames...

573
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,690
...of all realities...

574
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,130
...shall be channeled through the cheap amplifiers of Dr. Survive.

575
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:03,090
Yes, the universe shall be destroyed by amplification equipment bought on credit at Boyd's Music Center.

576
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,610
Yay, lo and behold!

577
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:16,470
And as all energy of all known universes begins to be channeled through their channels...

578
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,550
...and their amplifiers...

579
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,850
...a new and heretofore unknown force shall be created.

580
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,610
A force which shall be known as anti-sound.

581
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,110
And you thought anti-music was sound.

582
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:40,050
Anti-music is a force which has never, and by its very nature, can never exist in this universe.

583
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,590
Anti-sound is a force unlike anything...

584
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,170
...ever experienced before in any known universe in any time continuum.

585
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,370
The only reason it is even called this...

586
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,270
...that the word sound is even in the title anti-sound...

587
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,790
...is so that you'll have some type of reference point.

588
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,310
But anti-sound has nothing to do with sound.

589
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,450
These waves...

590
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,030
...these rays...

591
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,210
...these forces of anti-sound...

592
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,450
...shall vibrate...

593
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,250
...or anti-vibrate, I might say, through the entire universe.

594
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,790
And the entire universe will lose its form.

595
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,350
It shall be destroyed.

596
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,970
Every molecule shall be demagnetized from every other molecule.

597
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,690
Every electron demagnetized from every other electron.

598
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,910
Every proton demagnetized from every other proton.

599
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,750
Every atom shall be repelled from every other atom.

600
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:51,430
The universe shall lose its form as we know it today.

601
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:59,290
Born to lose, and now I'm losing universal form.

602
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,390
Hyperclites shall quip...

603
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,610
...breaking off one last one-liner...

604
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,890
...before the universe loses its form.

605
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,170
That sound is more important than you are.

606
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,870
That sound is more important than your entire life.

607
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,130
I am not an animal.

608
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,810
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder...

609
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,070
...and is well on his way there.

610
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,730
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home...

611
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,710
...then try to keep yourselves awake...

612
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,630
...and dial the phone.

613
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,950
Call in for pledges.

614
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:46,870
Call in for pledges.

615
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,130
828-9500-823-7490.

616
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,010
Answering the phones this evening.

617
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,370
Beautiful Dr. Seyfried.

618
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,070
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen...

619
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,750
...as quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

620
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,770
Well, Bobby's got a sweetie...

621
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,910
...and Connie is her name.

622
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,750
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

623
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,330
She reaches in Bob's pocket...

624
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,810
...fills her round for something hard...

625
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,170
...then pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card.

626
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,130
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.

627
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,070
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

628
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,470
And I never have to fear...

629
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,590
...because I know Connie's on the job.

630
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,390
And my wallet...

631
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,830
...belongs to Bob.

632
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,310
Well, you may have your lady...

633
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,650
...and your horny green man, too.

634
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,170
Their elemental energy may be what's right for you.

635
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,450
But someday you'll grow weary of those paganistic cults...

636
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,770
...and give away your money to the one that gets results.

637
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,350
And then your wallet...

638
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,590
...will be for Bob.

639
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,570
Yes, your wallet...

640
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,630
...will be for Bob.

641
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,530
And you will be subgenius...

642
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,910
...not another stupid slob.

643
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,730
Because your wallet...

644
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,750
...will be for Bob.

645
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,710
Well, I believe I am much calmer...

646
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,390
...got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer...

647
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,950
...sittin' on the dashboard of my car.

648
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:48,810
Praise...

649
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,730
...Bob!

650
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,750
Praise Bob!

651
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,370
Oh, and praise Sister Melodious Choss.

652
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,110
Enjoy the rest of the concert.

653
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,330
Thank you very much.

654
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,090
Praise Bob!

655
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:08,090


656
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,790
I want to meet him.

657
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,450
Many...

658
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,010
Many have seen him.

659
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:13,930
You try to meet Bob...

660
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,010
...and you never will.

661
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,590
...and you never will.

662
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,450
So this is the closest I'm going to get to meeting Bob.

663
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,370
No, one day a man will come up to you...

664
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,630
...and sell you something you don't really need...

665
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,410
...and when he does, you have been touched by Bob.

666
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,150
Praise Bob!

667
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,570
Don't join this church lookin' to get cool off us!

668
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,170
Huh!

669
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,490
Don't join this church lookin' to suck the slack out of Bob...

670
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,730
...'cause he won't help you!

671
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,670
Kill me!

672
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,630
There are people beyond redemption!

673
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,530
Yes, there are even people whose money...

674
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,270
...will not let them into the church!

675
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,430
They might buy a membership, yes.

676
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,550
They might attend meetings.

677
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,850
They might even yell when the Pope calls upon them...

678
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,510
...but deep in their heart...

679
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,870
...they're hip whims.

680
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,810
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

681
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,850
There's not a fundamental issue.

682
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,050
There's not a fundamental issue.

683
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,510
Jesus came back.

684
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,890
And, we are fruitless sinners.

685
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:16,890


686
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,850
We are fruitless sinners.

687
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,730
We are fruitless sinners.

688
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,770
We are fruitless sinners.

689
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,970
But even so, whatever happens to you,卿

690
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,350
and New Daniel as network supersedes the truth.

691
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,010
Understand the power of things is power as things,

692
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,670
as theybecome?

693
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,630
I don't know.

694
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,030
I don't know.

695
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,490
I don't know.

696
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,170
But we know you will.

697
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,690
You're just fun in us.

698
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,510
Just in the last five.

699
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,550
Minutes you're going to call it.

700
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,230
But sadder news.

701
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,750
Perhaps even than that.

702
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,750
Jack Kirby died.

703
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,150
Yes the comic book legend.

704
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,350
Who helped create such as superheroes.

705
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,670
As Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk.

706
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,650
Man I grew up on Jack Kirby.

707
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,970
Jack Kirby's dead.

708
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,850
Jack Kirby is dead.

709
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,990
And George Bush is still alive.

710
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,390
Ollie North is playing recorded.

711
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,730
Applause in the background.

712
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,070
And getting paid millions.

713
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,270
To speak at colleges.

714
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,670
And Jack Kirby's dead.

715
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,410
Man.

716
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,730
Just the very.

717
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:09,830
I don't know if I can handle it.

718
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:10,870
I really don't.

719
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,110
I mean.

720
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,550
Omak is crying.

721
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,530
Kamande is crying.

722
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,250
Devil Dinosaur.

723
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,710
Even the mindless Devil Dinosaur.

724
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,410
Weeps.

725
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,770
As the greatest.

726
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,650
Really one of the.

727
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,630
As this guy in the paper said.

728
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,090
Jack Kirby is the comic.

729
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,670
Who makes what Picasso is to modern art.

730
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:33,350
And it's true.

731
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,830
His rocky looking figures.

732
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,890
His strange.

733
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,110
It's almost 3D looking.

734
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,370
Even his women looked like they were carved.

735
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,890
From blocks of wood.

736
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,190
Or rocks or something.

737
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,650
And I know that.

738
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,550
I know Jay.

739
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,030
Jay Condom out there agrees with me.

740
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,910
Man it's a day to mourn.

741
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,470
There's been a lot of subgenius superheroes.

742
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,190
Who've died over the years.

743
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,250
And I never even mentioned most of them.

744
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,250
But Jack Kirby.

745
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,630
That.

746
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,530
Here's another sad one friends.

747
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,030
Man accused of getting high on toad juice.

748
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:11,350
The fact that a person would be accused.

749
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,430
As if this were a crime.

750
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,470
But the most.

751
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,810
Well let's.

752
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,910
Let me see.

753
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:17,250
I'm gonna.

754
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,530
Actually I'm gonna turn.

755
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,510
I'm gonna turn the music off for this.

756
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,150
Because this is.

757
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,410
This is really kind of.

758
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,550
Depressing.

759
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,150
San Francisco Chronicle reports from Angels Camp, California.

760
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,470
Squat.

761
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,070
Plump.

762
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,210
And covered with warts.

763
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,130
Hans.

764
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:32,710
Franz.

765
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,310
Peter.

766
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:33,890
And Brian.

767
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,670
Mark time in a terrarium in the office of an elite narcotics unit.

768
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:45,350
Material evidence in what may be the world's first prosecution of a man for smoking psychedelic

769
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:46,930
toad squeezings.

770
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,550
Bob Shepherd.

771
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:50,850
41.

772
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,170
A local teacher.

773
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,710
Explorer scout leader.

774
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,210
And blah blah blah.

775
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,170
Will be arraigned tomorrow on charges that he milked.

776
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,550
The toads.

777
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,450
Of their mind expanding discharge.

778
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,810
Put it in his pipe.

779
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,150
And smoked it.

780
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,190
His wife.

781
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,450
Connie.

782
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,110
37.

783
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,690
Faces similar charges.

784
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,330
Friends.

785
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:19,210
They charged Bob and Connie with smoking toad juice.

786
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:19,550
Can you.

787
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,390
God.

788
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,250
And yet George Bush walks free.

789
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,250
Taking people's.

790
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,170
Seats at rodeos away from him.

791
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,150
And then having them beat him.

792
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:29,970
And then having them beaten up outside.

793
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:30,430
It's just.

794
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,910
Other prosecutions may follow according to law enforcement sources.

795
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,770
They say drug agents are just beginning to catch on to the small underground culture.

796
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,790
Smitten by the intense psychedelic high produced by smoking toad venom.

797
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:50,450
In 1990 politicians in Georgia and South Carolina were concerned enough to introduce bills to

798
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,510
stamp out such freakish acts.

799
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,330
The proposals went nowhere.

800
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,430
Possibly because it is hard to prove just how prevalent.

801
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,710
The practice is.

802
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,170
How big a problem it is.

803
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,350
I don't really know.

804
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:03,330
Said John.

805
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,130
Slim.

806
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:10,870
A veteran Fremont narcotics agent who has traveled the world lecturing on hallucinogens and other illegal drugs.

807
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,830
I suspect that it might be increasing a bit.

808
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,970
But I don't think we're going to see people selling kilos of toad slime.

809
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,250
That's not what this is all about.

810
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:21,630
Ellum.

811
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,830
An agent for the narcotics team said his previous.

812
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,210
I can skip over that.

813
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,010
Slim said.

814
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:31,650
Here's some guy who squeezes toads to get where he's going.

815
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,390
We don't really get much training in this area.

816
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,150
Shepherd agreed to help the officers out.

817
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,810
Stepping before a video camera to tell agents what he knows for a training video.

818
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:48,010
Viewing the tape produced just hours after the consent search of Shepherd's home is quote.

819
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,270
Like watching the Discovery Channel.

820
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,710
He's very pleasant.

821
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,230
Not your average maggot looking dope dealer on the corner.

822
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:55,830
Of course not.

823
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,910
This is Bob and Connie they just busted.

824
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:04,250
Law enforcement officers will get still more help March 1st when the new Department of Fish and Game regulations take effect.

825
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:09,630
They make it a misdemeanor to possess a Colorado River Toad or Bufo alvarez.

826
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,870
The drug culture's toad of choice.

827
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:19,670
And it's not because of the chemical factory skills of the amphibians friends.

828
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,310
It's because they're endangered species.

829
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,810
No one knows for sure who first viewed toad venom as a drug.

830
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,350
It's because it was a vehicle for kicks or spiritual enlightenment.

831
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:34,850
But some date the practice to rituals performed by the ancient Mayan Indians of Central America.

832
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,530
Friends Bob was the first man to suck a toad I promise you.

833
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,830
The venom known to kill dogs is released from glands behind the toad's eyes and its legs.

834
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,510
Drug users pop it like a pimple.

835
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,570
Then dry the venom and smoke it.

836
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,690
Licking a toad will only make the licker sick.

837
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,790
Possibly very sick.

838
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,730
Experts say.

839
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,850
Firing up the venom in a pipe however denatures the poison.

840
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,710
And will give the smoker a 20 minute trip.

841
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:10,410
So intense that quote he can hear electrons jumping orbitals in his molecules.

842
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:15,170
At least that is what Bob told police he heard.

843
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,510
And friends you can hear that every week on the hour of slack.

844
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,670
If you will just support this radio ministry and keep us going.

845
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,490
I guess I know you will.

846
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:25,770
I know you will.

847
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,390
Give us all your money aha.

848
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,450
How much more do I owe you?

849
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:38,530
• • • • • • • • • • • • •

850
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,270
So how does it work?

851
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,290
You imagine you have any more money.

852
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:50,270


853
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,210
I'm a decent person.

854
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,830
But still but I'm not seeing any more than a bottle of pub tab, five cans.

855
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,750


856
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,670
from you here at the station in Dallas, Texas. Oh, I know what it is. Everybody in Fort Worth

857
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,510
and Arlington has been calling 823-7490 and getting some little old lady in their neighborhood.

858
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:16,590
It's area code 214-823-7490. Okay. Which is just 10 minutes left in the show. Please don't hurt

859
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:23,770
us anymore. As we announced that the British plan to reopen the investigation into the death

860
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:31,150
of Jimi Hendrix more than 23 years after the tragedy. Uh, yeah, sure enough. Scotland Yard

861
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:36,110
has been requested by the crown prosecution service to conduct inquiries into the circumstances of the

862
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:42,050
death of Jimi Hendrix. Um, Hendrix hailed as one of the world's greatest guitarists died in an

863
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:48,550
ambulance after, now this is what kills me. This is news for you. After overdosing on drugs at the

864
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:52,910
London home of his German, well, he, he drank too much and took,

865
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,750
you know, he drank too much and took, you know, he took, you know, he took, you know, he took,

866
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,750


867
00:46:53,770 --> 00:47:00,070
five pills too many. And, but what killed him was he threw up in the ambulance and okay,

868
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,270
this is the story. The official, most official real story is that he threw up in the ambulance

869
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:11,930
and, uh, stupid ambulance technicians didn't unstrap him. He was strapped in lying down and

870
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,970
choked to death of his, on his vomit because he couldn't shake loose. But his ex, his old former,

871
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:23,730
probably his main girlfriend, Kathy etching him seems to be behind the request for a new inquest.

872
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:29,870
Apparently, uh, she had a private investigation done into his death and sent the findings to the

873
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:36,450
attorney general who said the death was all very dodgy. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time

874
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:43,730
with the wrong people. And of course, uh, there was absolutely no indication that Hendrix was a

875
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:48,870
drug addict or wanted to kill himself or anything like that. He made a dumb mistake and somebody

876
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:53,370
may have taken advantage of that dumb mistake to make it, uh,

877
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,990
even dumber. Let's see what else in the news here. This last little thing, uh,

878
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,750
Oh, Oh, here's some sports news for you, friends. We don't usually cover sports on the, on the hour

879
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:12,090
of slack. This is from the leak news service from Neil Wilgus there at Albuquerque. The U S serial

880
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:17,670
killers took a commanding lead today as competition for the fanatic onus Memorial lethal instinct

881
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:23,210
award entered its final rounds. American mass murderers took an early lead with shootings in

882
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:29,190
Chicago and Atlanta and a bombing in Baltimore, but killers, the killers came on strong and overcame

883
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:35,410
the mass murderers, uh, chalking up a Zodiac in Boston, a Bundy in El Paso and two green rivers

884
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:43,290
in New York state. The early round of the 15th fanatic onus competition saw several of the weaker

885
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,990
contenders dropping out. And by the second level, uh, private security, second story men and postal

886
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:53,350
workers had called it quits. Next game, fierce competition in which the U S serial killers

887
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,550
were eliminated, which state troopers, stick ups, internal revenue, drunk drivers, and

888
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:04,230
cops were eliminated. Followed by county sheriffs, skinheads, cult killers, the gang, the church

889
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:10,350
and the clan in quick succession, uh, drug enforcement looked promising in the middle

890
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:15,510
rounds, but was shoved aside by ATF FBI, which scored heavy points in Waco, but failed to

891
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:21,190
follow through. Then it was a battle of the big boys, the joint chief, the mob, terrorists,

892
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,350
CIA cannibals.

893
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:27,250
the chief executive, doctors and lawyers, the energy department,

894
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,190
and, of course, the American mass murderers and U.S. serial killers.

895
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,590
Big Business and Bilderbergers declined to enter the competition this year,

896
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:41,370
stating that having shared top honors for 14 years in a row,

897
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,990
it was time to step aside and let the amateurs fight it out.

898
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,890
Fight they did, and seeing the American mass murderers and the U.S. serial killer team

899
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:57,650
slugging it out to the end can do nothing but renew our faith in the power of the free individual.

900
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:03,630
And you could renew our faith even more by paying attention to these simple instructions

901
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,850
here now down near the end of the Pledge Drive show.

902
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:07,550
Thank you.

903
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,670
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

904
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:17,010
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

905
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,190
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

906
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,790
That's the kind of sugar pop.

907
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,370
That's the kind of sugar pop.

908
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,670
That's the kind of sugar pop.

909
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,570
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

910
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,690
Oh, 200 pesos.

911
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,070
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

912
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,750
Welcome, little smackaroos.

913
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,890
And then there's the payments due on the car.

914
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,650
Oh, no.

915
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,010
Well, I'm just telling you, I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.

916
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:47,790
I mean, really.

917
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,570
I wonder if it's...

918
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:50,870
I wonder if it's...

919
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,930
It's worth even trying.

920
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,510
What am I...

921
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,310
What am I killing myself for like this?

922
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:55,770
What am I...

923
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,790
I don't know.

924
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,230
Oh, if I had any brains.

925
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:05,270
That's a trouble.

926
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:07,650
I've got the brains.

927
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,770
But I don't know.

928
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,770
Maybe it's my attitude.

929
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:11,990
It's wrong or something.

930
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,050
Nothing happens.

931
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,670
I figured I'd be.

932
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,510
Something.

933
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:20,770
Something.

934
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:20,790
Something.

935
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:21,590
Something.

936
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:23,770
Something.

937
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:23,770


938
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:23,770


939
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:23,770


940
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:25,670
Everybody gets pushed up ahead of me.

941
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,470
In that proportion.

942
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,530
And there's the wife.

943
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,070
The kids.

944
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,910
The trouble.

945
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:38,510
The car.

946
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,450
Yeah, and there's...

947
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,790
I don't know.

948
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,130
Let's have another drink.

949
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:50,330
Forget the whole thing.

950
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:53,370
Oh, stop it! You're killing me!

951
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:59,610
See, it makes me feel much better just talking to you.

952
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,830
Anytime, baby. Anytime.

953
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,390
Dive!

954
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:03,610
Oh!

955
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:21,590
Hi, this is Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo.

956
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,970
Give every cent you got to KNON.

957
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:27,610
At least tithe 10%.

958
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:31,410
If not all worldly goods, my friend.

959
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,070
Could mean your very soul.

960
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,550
Your very soul.

961
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,990
He speaks the truth.

962
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,190
And if you believe that, you'll believe anything.

963
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,870
And that's what we want you to do.

964
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,230
We want you to believe the Bible.

965
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:48,890
We want you to believe Marvel Comics.

966
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:50,670
We want you to believe Pee Wee Harmon.

967
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:53,570
He re-erected and he started channeling through me.

968
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,310
And Bob himself, that's J.R. Bob Dobbs,

969
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,350
for the benefit of those who may have just tuned in,

970
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,430
Bob himself, he told me that

971
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:02,810
if you don't believe me,

972
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,710
if you don't raise $8 million this evening,

973
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,990
he's going to die again.

974
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,650
Now, the listeners to this station,

975
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,770
so cold-hearted, so merciless,

976
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,610
so lacking in religious feelings,

977
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,810
they're going to let Bob die a second time?

978
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,370
I certainly hope not.

979
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,810
Hey, Fred, you don't know our listeners, Pope Bob.

980
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:20,690
I mean, to tell the truth,

981
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,610
these people would pay to watch Bob thrown to the Christians

982
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,090
while the lions watched in the Coliseum.

983
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,530
Oh, yeah.

984
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,550
They'd just soon see blood.

985
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:29,510
They want to see blood.

986
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,910
They don't want to call 823-7490.

987
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,250
And, but see if you...

988
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,530
Hello, this is Timothy Larry,

989
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,750
reminding you that just as you need slack,

990
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,430
KNON needs your help.

991
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,030
Send in those pledges and praise Bob.

992
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,330
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

993
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,210
I just want to say that I endorse Bob

994
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,150
as my running mate in this year's election.

995
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,530
And this is the hour of slack

996
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,050
on station KNON in Dallas, Texas.

997
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,850
You know, I know where that is.

998
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:02,610
Hello, Bob.

999
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,150
This is Father Guido Saraducci,

1000
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,730
formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

1001
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,910
and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church.

1002
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,010
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius.

1003
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,170
Carry on.

1004
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,630
I will have you paying Tiffany cufflinks.

1005
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:21,870
I'll demand that you pay up the money,

1006
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:26,270
the money that you have been withholding from Bob.

1007
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,390
You have to give unto Bob that which is Bob.

1008
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:29,470
Bob.

1009
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:29,710
Bob.

1010
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:30,090
Or Bob.

1011
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,070
Money is Bob.

1012
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,250
Sex is Bob.

1013
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:32,730
Slap.

1014
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:33,230
His Bob.

1015
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,610
And you, my friend, what you've got in your pocket

1016
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,270
and behind your pocket and right next to your pocket up in front,

1017
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,470
that is Bob, too.

1018
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,550
I want to see some calls coming in.

1019
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,110
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

1020
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,390
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob,

1021
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,830
you're going to burn.

1022
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,270
And KNON.

1023
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:53,250
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped,

1024
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:56,170
if she hadn't sent her $20 into jail,

1025
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,930
Bob Dodgers is going to burn in hell.

1026
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:00,230
Honestly true, but you know,

1027
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,590
there's so many of you, you've been out here,

1028
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,450
you're taping this show,

1029
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,910
and guilt is that feeling that you've been feeling.

1030
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,970
It's like, it's as if the most hideous henchman

1031
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:12,090
of the tiny demon, Ehig-Ehin,

1032
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:16,470
was gnawing and tickling incessantly at your very guts.

1033
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,930
And it isn't from being afraid of the punishment,

1034
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:21,910
it's from knowing that from that time on,

1035
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:25,130
you won't be allowed to forget what you didn't do.

1036
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,110
And here's some of our other friends.

1037
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,370
They call it the buckle on the Bible belt.

1038
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,590
Yeah!

1039
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,210
It has the largest quota of millionaires,

1040
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,810
the worst crime rate,

1041
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,570
and one of the severest poverty rates in any American city.

1042
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:42,670
Yet Dallas could also be described

1043
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,910
as the most Christian place on this earth.

1044
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:48,390
And over the airwaves,

1045
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,410
the pressure to buy, to give, to pledge was relentless.

1046
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,970
And although we've got hundreds and thousands

1047
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,010
that are so faithful, God bless you.

1048
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,310
God bless you for your faithfulness.

1049
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,830
Still there are hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands,

1050
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,670
who are not faithful, who made the pledge,

1051
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,710
and for some reason or another haven't sent it in.

1052
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,450
And when we count on that, and it doesn't come in everything,

1053
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,150
everything suffers.

1054
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,590
We are even having a hard time meeting the payroll right now,

1055
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,850
and the people that we have working for PTL have families too.

1056
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,630
And the power of slack.

1057
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,070
They have bills too.

1058
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:29,190
Jim Baker's running costs exceeded $2 million a week,

1059
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:29,290
but the money he made was not enough to pay his debt.

1060
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,290


1061
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,290


1062
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,290


1063
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:29,290


1064
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,130
That's nothing compared to ours, friends.

1065
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:35,710
This baby that I'm holding in my hands

1066
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:40,970
is one of the first babies that has been saved.

1067
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,770
823-7490.

1068
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:49,010
It's the magic of staying in there.

1069
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,310
We'll have to send him this part of the tape

1070
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:59,190
so he knows that we finally achieved something like major funding slack.

1071
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,670
This could be the flood we've been waiting for.

1072
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:05,750
People were just waiting to hear other people do it first,

1073
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:09,490
so that they could be joining something rather than starting something.

1074
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,010
So they waited, and now that the phones are ringing, they're all ringing.

1075
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,710
Thank these folks, these nice folks, these subgenius folks.

1076
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,070
Eric was the one that wanted to just make the pledge of faith.

1077
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,470
But he couldn't pay immediately, right?

1078
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:26,170
He says he wants the mug, but he can't pay that faith quite yet.

1079
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,650
But he wants to make that faith pledge, folks.

1080
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:28,950
Okay.

1081
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,410
He has the good dachshund ice feather.

1082
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,010
Well, he'll pay for that one.

1083
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,930
Give us that stuff.

1084
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,190
He wants the condoms and Jacksonian March.

1085
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,090
And they're already packed.

1086
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,770
I hate bringing eight for you in there in Brighton,

1087
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,750
but there's still a couple of empty phones.

1088
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,110
There's one.

1089
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:48,330
Well, this'll be good.

1090
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:49,690
Seven more stops.

1091
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,530
Lucky co-walk enough slack.

1092
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:55,430
That lucky caller will walk away with enough slack for a lifetime.

1093
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,810
He can never leave.

1094
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:03,230
Isn't it wonderful?

1095
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:04,690
Be a success?

1096
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,430
And that's all he thinks about.

1097
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,650
That's all he thinks about.

1098
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,970
You know, I longed so for success.

1099
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,010
It's kind of hard to believe that it's brought me all these problems.

1100
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:19,050
Listen, I hate to seem like the kind of wife that goes behind her husband's back with his boss.

1101
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:22,490
Subgenius people, why, they're the salt of the earth.

1102
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,010
This is a great program.

1103
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,890
You'd like to rub elbows with us.

1104
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:26,650
Sound impossible.

1105
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,730
I'd like to rub salt.

1106
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:31,210
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

1107
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,290
I now recognize that all of us make mistakes.

1108
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:35,050
Say what?

1109
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,270
You take the pinch of salt.

1110
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,270
You rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

1111
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:43,090
Walk with a sense around a burning, decapitated child's head,

1112
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:45,150
and then jump into the grave and say,

1113
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,250
Hop of my thumb, hop of my thumb.

1114
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,610
This is a problem I must overcome.

1115
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,830
Throw in a dead cat or a live cat that's not feeling well.

1116
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:56,570
Then cover with the sod.

1117
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,230
And when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

1118
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,430
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tubers.

1119
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,110
Show me what you're doing.

1120
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,050
I'm gonna start all over again.

1121
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,630
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

1122
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,550
Oh.

1123
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,230
Oh.

1124
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,650
Oh.

1125
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:14,330
Oh.

1126
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:15,350
Oh.

1127
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:15,470
Oh.

1128
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,910
Oh.

1129
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:16,150
Oh.

1130
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:17,110
Oh.

1131
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:17,450


1132
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:17,610
Oh.

1133
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:17,650
Oh.

1134
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:17,670
Oh.

1135
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,670


1136
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,810
Oh.

1137
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,610
Oh.

1138
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:35,150
Oh.

1139
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,330
Oh.

1140
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,050
Oh.

1141
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,810
Oh.

1142
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:38,050
Oh.

1143
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:38,310
Oh.

1144
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:38,690
Oh.

1145
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,390
Hold on, innit.

1146
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,350
You can do it.

1147
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:46,230
Holding on?

1148
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,050
Is it better, that I still sit?

1149
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1150
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1151
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1152
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1153
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1154
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,050


1155
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,050
First, you have to tone down, predictable, and literal.

1156
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:56,550
Kn자ě test my sense.
