1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,960
For men on the go, it's not what's in the pipe, it's the pipe itself.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,860
The Bob Dobbs Classic Meerschaum, hand-carved by the finest craftsmen in Malaysia.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,500
This and other fine Bob Dobbs smoking accessories cast a spell of their own for the discriminating smoker.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,020
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,040
Of style.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,020
Available at Kmart, Walmart, Target, and Hypermart.

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,300
Oh, too much church.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:54,620
Oh, too much church.

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,440
Praise God!

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,120
Praise God!

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,660
And welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Search.

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,460
Praise God!

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,020
Yeah!

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,720
Now, before we really get going with this sermon here,

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,020
I'd like you all to know that I'm not going to be doing this sermon for a long time.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm going to share something.

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,260
It's something we've done in Texas and Arkansas for many years.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,920
It's just to kind of make people understand the solemnity, the profundity of the whole thing.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,320
Lower your heads and we'll share a sacred moment of noise!

20
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,240
Take them, take them, take them!

22
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,500
All right!

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,460
Yeah!

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,320
Here we go!

25
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,700
I don't see some people here in this.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,140
These people have slack!

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,160
The sound itself, it has a stink to it.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,080
It's bad!

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,420
Who's going to drive that greyhound, children?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,680
Greyhound!

31
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,460
Who's going to drive that greyhound, children?

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,440
Greyhound!

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,920
Start a car, get the wheel to the middle.

34
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,820
Greyhound!

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Greyhound!

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
Greyhound!

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,080
Greyhound!

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,480
Greyhound!

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,720
Greyhound!

40
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,400
Greyhound!

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,140
Greyhound!

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,600
Greyhound!

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,600
Greyhound!

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,600


45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:51,600


46
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,660


47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,660


48
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:51,660


49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,120
Greyhound!

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,300
Greyhound!

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,100
Greyhound!

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,440
Greyhound!

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,440


54
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,480
Greyhound!

55
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,380
Greyhound!

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
I'm a ruse and a hilt as a virgin, maybe

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,220
Maybe I'm the old Dennis Boyd, maybe I'm a scamp and I'm a breakin'

58
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,400
Oh, he's in the city, with my kids and boys

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,620
And I'm coming for the man

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,000
He's the one

61
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,020
At Coitland's heading for the border

62
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,420
And they're running out of heels from a federal court order

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,780
Toll ahead, exact change, please

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,100
Three Hail Marys and on your knees

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,520
Take it to the bridge now

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,920
He's the one

67
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm just gonna drive that great old children

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,280
Father, son, and holy cross

69
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,820
He's our driver and our home

70
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,900
We always drive 55

71
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,840
I'm so smoky and all true and all love

72
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,260
Bust to Jerusalem as a virgin and a virgin

73
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,400
I'm a ruse and a hilt as a virgin

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Maybe I'm the old Dennis Boyd, maybe I'm a scamp and I'm a breakin'

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,400
Oh, he's in the city, with my kids and boys

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
And I'm coming for the man

77
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,440
He's the one

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
He's the one

79
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,280
He's the one

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,620
He's the one

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,460
He's the one

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,780
He's the one

83
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,560
He's the one

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,900
Kill my face!

85
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,800
And there's a subgenius down here with a bomb strapped to his chest, Owen.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,440
You goddamn well better enjoy it or he'll kill all of you!

87
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,300
Kill him!

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,040
He'll kill all of you.

89
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,540
He is Bob.

90
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,240
Ready for fun.

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,580
He wears a smile.

92
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,340
Everybody run!

93
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,720
Yep, the decks are all running, dear friend.

94
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,100
You can't run from home, Blake.

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,400
That wonderful song that started the show out was Greyhounded Jordan by my brother Cleve Donut Duncan.

96
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
And my brother, Satan.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,580
I think his best song yet, making it perhaps...

98
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,720
The worst.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,040
The greatest song ever recorded.

100
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
One more Cleve.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,900
No, no, no.

103
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,380
Because we're still in hell, my friend.

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,240
Well, we were in hell last week, if you remember, in our readings.

105
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,580
And we're going to be going back there again this time.

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,700
It's...

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,020
Oh...

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,320
As we were...

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,520
Reading from Revelation X, the bomb apocryphon.

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,600
The last hour of slack.

111
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,100
Why, back then, it was just the notes.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,420
It was...

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,820
It was just, uh...

114
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,560
And now, it's a first draft. Amazing.

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
But, uh...

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,740
If you recall...

117
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,340
Well, I think, actually, we can...

118
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,880
We can play you an illustration here.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,940
This is the subgenre of radio ministry.

120
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,340
Hour of slack on K-N-O-N-9-0-4-N-N-O-L-S-X-S.

121
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Praise Bob.

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,020
They're here.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,660
Some people believe that when people die,

124
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,260
there's a wonderful light as bright as the sun.

125
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,540
But it doesn't hurt to look into it.

126
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,060
All the answers to all the questions that you ever want to know are inside that light.

127
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,020
And when you walk to it, you become a part of it forever.

128
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh, that sounds like fun.

129
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,640
Amen.

130
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,900
I can't wait.

131
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,860
Some people die, but they don't know that they've gone.

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,680
Yeah.

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,300
I think they're still alive.

134
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,400
They're still alive, but don't know that they're dead.

135
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,180
Maybe they didn't want to die.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,920
Maybe they weren't ready.

137
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,520
Maybe they hadn't lived fully yet,

138
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,420
or they'd lived a long, long time,

139
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,940
but they still wanted more life.

140
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,500
They resist going into that light,

141
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,220
however hard the light wants them.

142
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,380
They just...

143
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,620
They just...

144
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:21,620


145
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,480
They just hang around.

146
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,040
They just don't believe in Bob.

147
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,980
Watch TV, watch their friends grow up...

148
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah.

149
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,200
...feeling unhappy and jealous,

150
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,460
and those feelings are bad.

151
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,500
They hurt.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,000
And then...

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,640
Some people just get lost on the way to the light.

154
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,800
Bob.

155
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,980
And they need someone to guide them to it.

156
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,000
Bob!

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,600
Bob!

158
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,940
Bob!

159
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,700
Indeed.

160
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,140
As...

161
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,760
As fanatical belief in organized religion

162
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,840
declines in the modern era,

163
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,780
the theocrats...

164
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,860
Those spirits who

165
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,900
enslave other spirits

166
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,980
on the other side...

167
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,540
The theocrats have even

168
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,580
devised ways to persuade

169
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:30,140
atheists and agnostics to join theocratic bands after death. The most common is simply

170
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,720
to invite them to join what appears to be a community of spirits that includes some

171
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,260
of their previously deceived friends and relatives, or some famous person they greatly admire.

172
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:55,620
There are also heavens whose gods claim to be the politicians, movie stars, writers,

173
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,020
scientists, rock stars, even fictional characters.

174
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,880
This is a war in heaven, friends, and there's cannibalism of souls. If you go to the normal

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
heaven, the pink heaven, pull the lever, you'll be in the middle of hell.

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:22,480
Down you go, as the great Dr. Gene Scott said about the caves and flames of heaven.

177
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:31,180
The most insidiously cruel aspect of pink heaven is that it's all self-inflicted punishment.

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,720
Nothing happens to those souls that they didn't ask for, that they didn't devise in their

179
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,940
own minds, down to the tiniest detail.

180
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,220
And nastiest things happen.

181
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,220


182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,420
First of all, just as their store of anguish is about to be used up, they're told they

183
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,740
could escape if only they could stop believing in it.

184
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,580
But that only makes it worse, for there they are, right in the thick of it, with flames

185
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:10,860
searing their skin, or vampire false gods or relatives slowly devouring their very essence.

186
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,120
It's just a little bit difficult not to believe.

187
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm not sure I can explain it.

188
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,220


189
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm not sure I can explain it.

190
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:22,940
And the helpless, impotent knowledge of the full depth of their stupidity is frozen in

191
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,120
their minds, amplified and protracted out over millennia.

192
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:35,200
It is the ultimate horror, induced by this climactic realization that hell is fueled.

193
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:44,080
The fear of fear itself, self-amplifying, is recycled through their heads over and over

194
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,400
feeding on itself like a breeder reactor.

195
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,700
Even the fighting Jesus won't be able to save you once you end up there.

196
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,920
You will be eternally trapped, your every nerve tormented by fiery orange-blue screaming

197
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,440
light frying your brain alive, and every nanosecond of it will seem like ten billion

198
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,740
eternities.

199
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,360
Not even the staunchest masochist will be able to ferret out the tiniest vestige of

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,540
slack from that.

201
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,060
I'm not sure I can explain it.

202
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:21,640
And as the last gasping, wordless scream escapes your lips, you'll wish that you'd

203
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,500
remembered instead to say, help me God, help me God.

204
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,820
But it'll be too late.

205
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,840
Even God won't help you in normal heaven.

206
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,520
You'll be up there laughing with the rest of them.

207
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,840
It's all been a complete scam.

208
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,060
The unprofitable servant will be the one to be blamed.

209
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,660
That will be in the judgment.

210
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,680
Call the next defendant, Scott Camp, to the bar.

211
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,740
Scott Camp, I sentence you to hell.

212
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,060
No, I have been saved.

213
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,040
I have been saved.

214
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,040


215
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,040


216
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,040


217
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,040


218
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,800
I've been in church practically all my life.

219
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,300
Yes, you have grown up in church,

220
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,280
and you have certainly had an experience with your God.

221
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,760
But the record reveals that you have been unprofitable,

222
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,800
and the word decrees that the unprofitable servant

223
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,480
must be cast into outer darkness.

224
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,560
But when have I been unprofitable?

225
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,700
You have rebelled against my word,

226
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,920
and you have stolen your Lord's money.

227
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,940
While you lived upon the earth,

228
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,420
I permitted you to earn a good living.

229
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,260
As my servant, I gave you power and health to earn money,

230
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,900
and in return for this, I decreed in my word

231
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,620
that a tenth part of those earnings were mine.

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,620
I left that ten percent in your care,

233
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,160
charging you to invest it for me into my church,

234
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,420
that the gospel might be preached.

235
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,580
But you, Scott, have rebelled against my word.

236
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,700
You have not only taken 90 percent,

237
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,920
which I freely have,

238
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,500
but you have been so covetous

239
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,680
as to take the ten percent also.

240
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,080
Did you know that rebellion is a sin of witchcraft,

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,860
and that no covetous person shall enter the kingdom of God?

242
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,140
Oh, sir, I tell you, I didn't realize it was so serious.

243
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,960
You made that choice when you were only 18.

244
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,620
Look at your record.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,720
July 15, 1953.

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,180
Will a man rob God?

247
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,060
Yes, sir, I did.

248
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,740
You have robbed me,

249
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,740
but you say,

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
when have we robbed thee?

251
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,500
In tithes and offerings.

252
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,620
You are cursed with a curse,

253
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,820
for you have robbed me, even this whole nation.

254
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,360
No, God wouldn't do that.

255
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,600
He's a loving God.

256
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,180
Besides, there's plenty of people that have more money than I do.

257
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,200
I need mine.

258
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,120
Scott, you made your choice.

259
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,060
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

260
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,140
And to your eternal sorrow,

261
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,160
you have my blessing.

262
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,700
You have found that not only could you afford

263
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,160
to give to God that which was his,

264
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,540
but you could not afford to do otherwise.

265
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,000
The Senate still stands.

266
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,180
Oh, but, sir, please.

267
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,960
Cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness

268
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,600
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

269
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,260
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

270
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,280
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

271
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,260
Sir, no, no.

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,660
Thank God I don't want to go to hell.

273
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,580
Sir.

274
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,040
Now, on the first word I want to hear out of your filthy shores is,

275
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,680
Praise Bob.

276
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,340
Let me hear it.

277
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,660
Praise Bob.

278
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,200
Sound off like you've got a pair.

279
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,460
Praise Bob.

280
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,140
Dear Bob,

281
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,860
my life has changed completely

282
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,940
because of your ministry.

283
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,880
Dear Bob,

284
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,600
my life has changed completely

285
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,640
because of your ministry.

286
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,620
Dear Bob,

287
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,300
my life has changed completely

288
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,420
because of your ministry.

289
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,420
Dear Bob,

290
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,280
my life has changed completely

291
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,280


292
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,420
Here's another one.

293
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,740
Dear Bob,

294
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,220
my life has changed completely

295
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,380
because of your ministry.

296
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,380
Bob needs an order to pursue his plan

297
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,340
for world domination.

298
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,620
I said,

299
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:46,480
But, got my head in all things, and pays me off in pure slack.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,300
Here's another one.

301
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,300
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

302
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I dare you to kill me!

303
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,700
That's right, and you couldn't tell when he was doing it either. It was either there or it wasn't there.

304
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,920
And that's something I just don't understand. How can it either be there or not there?

305
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,340
Why isn't there any in between?

306
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,420
Well, that's what we call escaping from those Newtonian laws, Doctor.

307
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,140
Yes, escape velocity. Is that what you're implying?

308
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,680
You can escape velocity, but not the need for veracity.

309
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,540
Look, if you're both a particle and a wave, you're exhibiting a certain particle, particulate-like behavior.

310
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:01,120
That behavior can be measured, but you're going to collapse the wave function into the wave implement of that.

311
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
It is well with that kind of...

312
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes.

313
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:10,960
...wavefront you suffer from the need to employ such a mechanism in figuring things out in a two-dimensional type of schema.

314
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,420
Maybe the listener knows about this.

315
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, those little glistening listeners would never understand, but what's that sound like? Heavy breathing?

316
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,220
There's a lot of power. It's a small room, but there's a...

317
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,160
There's something that sounds like a huge beast drawing its scaly coils along a stone floor in here.

318
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,500
Oh, I'm sure it's not Mimico.

319
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,840
Oh, maybe it is Mimico.

320
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,640
It's Mimico's theme song.

321
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:37,780
Mimico is the tiny monster, not the giant dragon that causes such unseemly smells and body sounds.

322
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,380
Her power equals the weakness of others times their own number.

323
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,180
Power, like any other dream, is both the act and the end.

324
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,120
Power like thousands of hydrogen bombs, eh, Doctor?

325
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,540
Yes, but no trigger.

326
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,640
No or no Roy Rogers, simply a stuffed effigy.

327
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,060
Lift that tail.

328
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,820
But let's leave things of this world behind.

329
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,620
Yes.

330
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,720
We've walked now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

331
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,400
Bob is coming, friend, and you can take that literally.

332
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,380
Because death for a subgenius hero is merely a transfer over to the pleasure dimensions.

333
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,280
Now, unfortunately, many of us aren't heroes.

334
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,580
There's no water in hell, friends.

335
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,600
There's fire.

336
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,760
And you can't get a drink, and you can't put out that fire.

337
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,660
And you have many, many lives in hell.

338
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
It's reincarnation.

339
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Just like here on earth.

340
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,120
Because earth, you know, is just the top floor of hell.

341
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,820
That's right.

342
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,420
You're in hell right now.

343
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
You are in hell now.

344
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Of course, this is the part of hell where you don't even know you're in hell.

345
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,420
And when the demons mention it, you think they're kidding.

346
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,180
Oh, you'll find out.

347
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,980
Hell is real.

348
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,240
And there's no water down there, friend.

349
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,080
They don't even have rock and roll in some parts of hell.

350
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,180
And you can never win.

351
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,380
It's like a computer.

352
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,440
By definition, it cannot lose.

353
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,520
You can score real high, but sooner or later, it's gonna get you.

354
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,820
Because they creep up on you.

355
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,560
And that's the way it is here on earth.

356
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,100
They creep up on you and try to get you all mixed up about heaven and hell.

357
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,640
Bob is coming, my friend.

358
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,900
But when he's finished with that, he's gonna be mad.

359
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,540
Let there be slack.

360
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,400
Lift that tail.

361
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,360
The silence of the soul.

362
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,660
Sure is nice out here.

363
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,520
I hope the boat comes, though.

364
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,580
Fellini knew how to use silence.

365
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,300
Gary said he was here.

366
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,380
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands.

367
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,680
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.

368
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,720
A giant flaming oar.

369
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,360
Mr. Boatman.

370
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,260
Please, Mr. Boatman.

371
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,260
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.

372
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,480
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

373
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,680
No, no.

374
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:51,820
And be prepared to go past my dog, my three-headed dog, Cerebrus.

375
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,600
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

376
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,560
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates, the gateway.

377
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.

378
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,180
What's he reading from?

379
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,060
It's a B-movie script.

380
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,380
Into eternal sorrow.

381
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,180
I am the wage of forsaken people.

382
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,920
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

383
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,500
It is getting hot in here.

384
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.

385
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,600
Made beyond me and beyond time, my friend.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,180
Yeah.

387
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,980
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.

388
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,360
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his plight from one hand to the other, pulled out from his voluminous...

389
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:42,260
...ditty bag a sop of cakes with wine and honey, fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance to Funworld.

390
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,340
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet by Satan.

391
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,320
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh...

392
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,820
...bulging stomach.

393
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
His three-headed, uh...

394
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,600
...his three-headed thing...

395
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,980
You're not going to get me to mention that.

396
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,260
...wafted in the air.

397
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,080
...and he was fed enough of horrible horticultural effects from the world of mythology.

398
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,840
His horrible three foreskins quivering.

399
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:14,720
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably as with canine lust he scraped his hindquarters across the floor, howling and gribbling from all three heads simultaneously.

400
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,840
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.

401
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,700
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

402
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,280
He was forced to be in the show, hour after hour.

403
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,000
P-Dawg, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

404
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,540
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not for me.

405
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,980
Take my glands away, King P-Dawg.

406
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,420
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

407
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,680
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

408
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,620
Yes, from Cerebus the P-Dawg, they all go for Ivan's leg.

409
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,460
Ow! Get that damn thing... Get those horrible little poodles off of me!

410
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,820
I hate poodles!

411
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,960
That was Madame Wazonga and her dancing chihuahuas...

412
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,680
...and the Judenda the Team Whip.

413
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,420
Once again, on the Subgenius Hour of Mystery and Darkness.

414
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,160
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Dr. Howell.

415
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,800
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were... they were cute.

416
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,780
And when's Michael Jackson coming?

417
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,080
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

418
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,580
Spreading the seed word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

419
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,240
Heidi Bobb'd of the Church of the Subgenius.

420
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

421
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,640
Laaaaaaa...

422
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,020
A-ha!

423
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,040
A-ha!

424
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,060
A-ha!

425
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,680
A-ha!

426
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,120
A-ha!

427
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:54,840
A-ha!

428
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,500
A-ha!

429
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:56,940
A-ha!

430
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,520
A-ha!

431
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,540
A-ha!

432
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:57,540


433
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
Oh why did I do a king, for nothing in the makin'?

434
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,140
A-ha!

435
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,800
A-ha!

436
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:06,800


437
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,660
I said you gotta come with us.

438
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:08,780
J&

439
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,780
I told my wife workers to bring some new legal supportive and otherwise it would be

440
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,680
harder than this...

441
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,760
Y-yeah, I know.

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,180
They will, but it suits me, really.

443
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,480
What did I tell you?

444
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,560
occurs in the future.

445
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,620
ères

446
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:24,620


447
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,060
Oh, man.

448
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,280
Here we are in the subgenius heaven,

449
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,180
also known as hell.

450
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,960
Hell, spelled H-E-L-L-E.

451
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,320
After the Nordic.

452
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,760
For the hereafter of the true subgenius

453
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,500
is the diametric opposite of that of the unsaved.

454
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,220
Having tithed sufficiently in life,

455
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,400
death for a subgenius hero

456
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,160
is merely a transfer over to Asgard,

457
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,640
the subgenius hell,

458
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,140
the land of perpetual ooze, squirt,

459
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,620
and,

460
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,380
portal to the eternal pleasure dimensions.

461
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,780
After bathing in the before life,

462
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,100
the Nentescence bursts through the membrane of death

463
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,120
into the hell plane,

464
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,120
where it takes on a new, highly refined,

465
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,720
nearly indestructible body

466
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,920
in perfect adult condition.

467
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,240
At this level of existence,

468
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,460
it partakes of earthly pleasures,

469
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,540
but in a vastly richer depth and variety

470
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,320
than could be conceived of on earth.

471
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,400
An anti-Dante's inferno,

472
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,460
Asgard is a perpetual party

473
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,680
in an endless amusement park.

474
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,180
Indeed, the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

475
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,820
could be viewed as but a boot camp,

476
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,720
training you to withstand even more eye-watering,

477
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,440
almost harmful ecstasy to come in subgenius.

478
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,220
The

479
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,080
lesser prophets must use threats of eternal torment

480
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,260
as an inducement.

481
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,700
Bob tempts his chosen people with the threat

482
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,240
only of missing out on not one,

483
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,700
but two paradises.

484
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,660
Our faithful attain both a technological paradise

485
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,920
during life on the escape vessels,

486
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,060
and a metaphysical paradise after death.

487
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,360
Can any rival,

488
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,420
or any faithful cult offer both?

489
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,580
In subgenius hell,

490
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,320
there is no authority,

491
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,140
only angels.

492
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,780
Angels don't have to sin,

493
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,600
but they do anyway.

494
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,300
Sometimes they frolic and have sex

495
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,120
with subgenius souls.

496
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,240
Imagine angel sex.

497
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,260
Other times, they watch us with no more involvement

498
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,860
than when we watch a sitcom.

499
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,340
The concept of fallibility does not exist.

500
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,660
Among angels, and so,

501
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,020
they are infallible.

502
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,680
Angels are rather Bob-like in this ignorance

503
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,760
or amnesia of failure.

504
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,320
Telepathy is used in subgenius hell

505
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,800
because there is no air to make sound waves.

506
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,340
Indeed, everything in Asgard is composed of varying thicknesses

507
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,220
and degrees of pure pleasure,

508
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,020
and all consciousness is in a continuous,

509
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,060
undiluted moment of oud squirt.

510
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,260
All who die as children go straight to Asgard

511
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,140
and grow up there.

512
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,020
They make the best angels,

513
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,880
for they require almost no deprogramming.

514
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,340
Likewise, members of rival cults

515
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,620
who were unknowing, unsaved subgeniuses in life

516
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,060
may find themselves in subgenius hell,

517
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,600
which they'll naturally think is their heaven.

518
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,980
We may find among us rogue priests,

519
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,940
misfit rabbis, deranged Sufis,

520
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,760
even cops and politicians.

521
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,980
All who were great subgeniuses and bold surrealists,

522
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
even without knowing it,

523
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,840
will party with us in subgenius hell.

524
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,380
Well, probably not many politicians.

525
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,980
But one doesn't have to be baptized in Bob to be saved.

526
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,420
Nay, you should assume that you still have to send the $30,

527
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,480
but there are some whose service to Bob

528
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,960
enabled the church to exist.

529
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,920
They'll resist for you to spend that $30 on.

530
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,540
Captain Beefheart, for example,

531
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,280
and Kitten Natividad

532
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,120
might not ever know of the church or might hate it,

533
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,940
but they will certainly end up on the escape vessels in 1998.

534
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,120
And if they die before then,

535
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,740
they'll go straight to subgenius hell,

536
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,920
whether they like it or not.

537
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,020
They'll like it.

538
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,840
It would be impossible for them not to.

539
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,920
And Asgard is only the ground floor of the subgenius afterlife.

540
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,760
After spending several eternities in Asgard,

541
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,560
following a single short preliminary eternity in normal hell,

542
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,880
you start slacking your way up to the subgenius heaven, hell.

543
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,620
And you earn your way to the subgenius heaven

544
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,900
by having more fun in subgenius hell.

545
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,660
Just as life on the escape vessels readies you for death in Asgard,

546
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,960
you wouldn't be able to appreciate the ecstasy of subgenius hell.

547
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,240
You would be able to enjoy the subgenius heaven

548
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,620
without first undergoing subgenius hell

549
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,600
to build you up to that level of enjoyment.

550
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,440
Helle is so brain-crushingly glorious

551
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,500
that you might not survive it otherwise.

552
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,160
You would be numbed,

553
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,820
and none of the succeeding pleasure dimensions

554
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,440
would seem, by comparison,

555
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,040
much different from Earth on a good day.

556
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,920
After you die, quote, unquote,

557
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,220
in Helle,

558
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,240
you will be born into the Valhallaic universe,

559
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,580
and once there, you'll gain access to dozens and dozens more,

560
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,240
each one better than the last.

561
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,800
In fact, incomprehensible to the last.

562
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,220
After traversing the eight roads of slack,

563
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,460
the Nentescence will arrive at the twelve gates

564
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,280
leading to the 273 supra-universes of the beyond.

565
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,200
Here, you must prove that you have overcome,

566
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,060
or tasted, the twelve earthly temptations

567
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,840
by overindulging until freed from them.

568
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,320
You will then pass into the supra-universes of the beyond

569
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,160
and reach the gates of Yakutisma,

570
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,340
where you must show that you learned and practiced

571
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,600
the twelve virtues on Earth.

572
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,540
Rather than reveal the virtues and temptations,

573
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,680
we will make you guess,

574
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,060
and that way, to be safe,

575
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,660
you'll have to indulge in all virtues

576
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,540
and all temptations.

577
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,520
As long as you don't falter,

578
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,220
you can keep evolving higher up the road,

579
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,220


580
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,200
and you'll reach the top of the ranks of existence,

581
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
ascending, until you finally make it,

582
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,760
to the topmost floor of Hell,

583
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
where you are told,

584
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,220
the punchline.

585
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,860
But friends, don't start gearing your life to the afterlife,

586
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,740
because you aren't dead yet!

587
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,240
The so-called real world is still the real world!

588
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,940
I mean, sure, it's all Maya,

589
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,280
all, uh, illusions, sure, you make your own reality,

590
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,620
but just try to remember that the next time you stub your toes, smart guy!

591
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,820
If you don't believe it, try this simple experiment.

592
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,840
Take a hot needle and insert it slowly into your left eyeball,

593
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,220
while suddenly you'll gain an understanding of the value of a dollar,

594
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,180
and be rid of the corny cosmic sweetness and light illusions forever.

595
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,120
Money has more to do with reality,

596
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,380
than all mankind's religions put together.

597
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,160
The real world, the dream world, and the death worlds,

598
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,600
are all equally real, but are composed of different vibrations,

599
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,360
of the ether of what Bob calls the smoke of the father of all pipes.

600
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:43,120
Just remember, the more time your higher self spends in dreamland,

601
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,760
rocking the all, the whole in oneness,

602
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,380
the longer your lower self is left alone on Earth,

603
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,720
to act like a jerk, and hide its head in the sand,

604
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,580
while the conspiracy gets away with murder.

605
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,860
So don't sit there thinking anything's predestined for you.

606
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,420
Some people have fates, and some do not.

607
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,800
Predestination exists only for those who have been chosen.

608
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,840
For most, there is no fate.

609
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,840
But they are the lucky ones.

610
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,620
You may not need fate to be rich, but having no fate,

611
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,980
you have the choice of becoming rich,

612
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,640
of your own free will.

613
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,360
Many who have been fated, were fated not to become rich.

614
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,920
Unlike the chosen, you may choose.

615
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,420
There is no karma.

616
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,920
Nothing's gonna make things come out okay in the long run.

617
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,320
And since you only go around once at a time,

618
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,040
the best way to get to heaven, is to get slack now.

619
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,180
We all know we're gonna die, and that it could easily be before our time.

620
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,640
Do we then give in to depression,

621
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,960
grabbing some last straw after life,

622
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,600
concepts of dumb religion,

623
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,660
and sigh with resignation while waddling aimlessly

624
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,000
through what's left of the rest of our lives?

625
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,760
Hell no!

626
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,720
We spend our time as if it's worth something,

627
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,800
and thus be more than alive!

628
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,600
Better to be completely alive for a few seconds,

629
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,060
than be half alive for a hundred years.

630
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,880
Because when half alive people die, they're just dead.

631
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,720
If you're half alive, why bother to live at all?

632
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,780
Death ain't gonna make that much difference.

633
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,560
No.

634
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,840
And most people's life spans are truly aimless.

635
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,040
Like someone unknowingly lost in the woods,

636
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,900
they trudge confidently in a big circle for hours,

637
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,860
thinking they're moving in a straight line towards the horizon.

638
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,620
And finally they come upon a familiar landmark,

639
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,760
and realize their terrible folly.

640
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,620
And the moment that most people die,

641
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,480
is the moment they realize they've been going in circles through life,

642
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,540
hopelessly lost like idiots!

643
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,900
That's the moment of total horror!

644
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,640
And that realization is what sends them to normal hell.

645
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,740
We on the other hand, dear friends,

646
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,680
we follow J.R. Bob Gobs up the trail to its trailhead.

647
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,080
Though we may have gotten lost at some point,

648
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,160
we may have gone in circles for years and a stretch,

649
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,680
but we've learned our mistake in time.

650
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,080
There's no damnation for the subgenius whose heart is true to Bob.

651
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,900
You're a subgenius, and you have that covenant,

652
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,260
that sales contract, that warranty on your very soul.

653
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,540
But...

654
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,840
But...

655
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,440
But...

656
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,160
Through carelessness or greed, your nantescence can get overdrawn.

657
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,680
Just like your bank account.

658
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,220
Yet, with proper investment, it will collect interest.

659
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,540
There's only one way to be sure that when you die,

660
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,280
your soul will be healthy enough that you can die completely,

661
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,880
and make it all the way to hell.

662
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,640
Oh bob!

663
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:49,640


664
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:49,640


665
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:49,640


666
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,800
Rather than lightning,

667
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,200
I think that you'll have such goblins

668
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,280
that could take on a whole lot more anymore than that.

669
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,480
And just before you can하죠

670
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,700
beh,

671
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,120
you may carry up on that

672
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,960
the grace of a good man.

673
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,920
Sitting on the ground with

674
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,160
country lines in line,

675
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


676
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,160


677
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,880
To all that exclusively seeing you when the sky falls,

678
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,240
the best of us,

679
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,560
to our Spice Squad,

680
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,080
we all bow down God bless us!

681
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,880
Real special thanks

682
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,400
And Bob Dobbs does not want your brats or your mind.

683
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,540
He wants your money.

684
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
I mean, that's simple enough.

685
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,620
And that's when you say, well, now, oh, Bob, oh, I don't trust you that much, Bob.

686
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
I give you my brains and my kids, but not my money.

687
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,960
Oh, no, that's too important to me.

688
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,900
Well, now, if you believers ain't giving money, I mean, all you're doing is believing.

689
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,160
Oh, we get it.

690
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,940
First, you want to see the eternal salvation.

691
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,480
Uh-huh.

692
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,740
Then you're going to pay up.

693
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,000
You're going to end up with that excuse nailed to your back in normal hell.

694
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
When you yank it off, they'll just hammer it back in with a bigger nail.

695
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:14,120
My friends, lining Bob's pocket with love offerings helps you to slide between the electric sandpaper machines of justice and karma.

696
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,640
It greases you up for a faster slide.

697
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:28,000
Straight through that tunnel of white light and into the before light so that you can just pop out rather than having to squeeze through the end of the tunnel.

698
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,640
That slide to subgenius heaven is just like going down a chute at Wet n' Wild.

699
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,660
Pull the lever.

700
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,620
Down you go.

701
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:45,500
At first, Asgard may seem hot and stuffy with all those flames around you and the fellows with the tails.

702
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,180
But those are angels.

703
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,920
In fact, they're not.

704
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,460
They're in uniform, my friends.

705
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,160
That's a big joke down there.

706
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,840
They wear costumes to scare the bobbies.

707
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,160
So that when the bobbies first get there, they go,

708
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,020
Oh, oh no, Lord, I've sinned.

709
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,600
I've gone to hell.

710
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
Whereas the true subgeniuses think,

711
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,840
Praise Bob, I've sinned enough.

712
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:16,560
But there are plenty of quality souls frying in normal hell simply because they wouldn't and couldn't follow the goose-stepping guidelines of God.

713
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,700
But thought.

714
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,900
That they should.

715
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:28,900
Untold billions being horribly tortured for no greater sin than that they wanted slack and didn't believe they were supposed to get it.

716
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,460
If getting slack is a sin, my friends, we must pray that someday we all become sinners.

717
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,240
God beli-

718
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:37,840
Dobbs!

719
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,740
Dobbs believes in the God-forbidden right of all subgenii to choose for themselves the fates of their souls.

720
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,900
Dobbs is recruiting lost souls of every creature.

721
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,840
The billions that fell between the cracks of good and evil.

722
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,420
The neutrals who just want for once to be left alone in the afterlife.

723
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,980
And teaching them how to profit from hell and beat the devil.

724
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,040
Bob is one of the living undead and one of the dead unliving.

725
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,100
Bob is a paradox, a contradiction.

726
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,120
He's the epitome of hypocrisy.

727
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,380
And he'll tell you so himself so you won't know whether or not to believe him.

728
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,900
And simply not being able to make a difference.

729
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:17,900


730
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:17,900


731
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:17,900


732
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:17,900


733
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,660
And if you can't make up your mind, well, that's all it takes to send you you know where.

734
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,880
So why not give up your soul to Bob now and join us in subgenius hell?

735
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,580
All your friends will be there.

736
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,120
It'll be one endless subgenius beach party by the flaming lake of brimstone.

737
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,240
But it won't be nearly as much fun without you there too.

738
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,860
Take the Dobbs Express, the straight train to salvation.

739
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,880
And send for that free information from Bob.

740
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:47,880


741
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,020
Bob, that's right, old Bob.

742
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,340
Good old Bobby.

743
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,900
Just address that letter to Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

744
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,840
That's 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

745
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,860
75214.

746
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,240
This is Doctors for Bob in the background.

747
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:37,560
Brown.

748
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,580
.

749
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:22,680
.

750
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,700
.

751
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:22,840
.

752
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:22,860
.

753
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:22,880
.

754
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,260
.

755
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:23,660
.

756
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:23,720
.

757
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,260
Okay.

758
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,120
No, do I have to...

759
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,600
I got my teachings right here.

760
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,440
Okay, I'm listening.

761
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,460
Yeah.

762
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,920
Well, I don't know.

763
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:44,600
Okay.

764
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,580
Oh, I have to...

765
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,300
Yeah.

766
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,400
Okay.

767
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,660
No, I was just kidding.

768
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,920
Yeah.

769
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,500
Oh, no!

770
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,680
Yeah, I am.

771
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,600
All right!

772
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,700
Yeah.

773
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,280
Okay.

774
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Yeah.

775
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,740
Out of attraction or repulsion.

776
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,780
Enter into game existence with good grace.

777
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,960
Amazing grace.

778
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,540
Voluntarily and freely.

779
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,800
What should I do?

780
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,120
Remain calm.

781
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,040
And?

782
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,400
And remember...

783
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,040
The teachings!

784
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,280
All right!

785
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,580
The teachings!

786
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,460
The teachings!

787
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,260
The teachings!

788
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,280
Hey, isn't that them?

789
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,280
I think it is them.

790
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,620
It's the Bondo Brothers!

791
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:48,680
Oh, yeah.

792
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,840
Oh, yeah.

793
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:52,660
Oh, yeah.

794
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:52,860
Oh, yeah.

795
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,100
Oh, yeah.

796
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,220
Oh, yeah.

797
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


798
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


799
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


800
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


801
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


802
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


803
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:53,220


804
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,280
guitar solo

805
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,620
Down the middle of the mile

806
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,960
The funky, funky malls

807
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,720
Boomer, boomer, boomer

808
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,840
All the time, all the time

809
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,640
I should follow

810
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,440
Down the middle of the mile

811
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,560
He's a little star, a tiny kid, woo

812
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,820
He's got three parts

813
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,460
Number three

814
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,500
La la la la

815
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,060
He's got the two, and he's got the four

816
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,180
Back to here

817
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
Oh, look over here

818
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,920
Down the middle of the mile

819
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,460
Boomer

820
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,360
Oh, yes, dear friends,

821
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,600
those funky, funky bardos,

822
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,180
they're in the background from Buffalo, New York.

823
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,160
I'm gonna be preaching up there in Buffalo in November.

824
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,880
I better not say them.

825
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,560
I can't remember the date.

826
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,420
But, yes, yes, where are we?

827
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,200
This is one of those shows that I've had to throw together

828
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,960
at the last minute because of work, work,

829
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:20,940
and work.

830
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,100
I don't even know where or who I am.

831
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,660
Hey, why not ask why not?

832
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,000
Where are we again?

833
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,480
Where are we?

834
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,360
Maybe we better let the tons of listeners in on it.

835
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:32,900
No.

836
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:33,580
Okay.

837
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,900
It's just that darn kleptomania of mine cropped up again.

838
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,500
Thought I had it under control, but besides,

839
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,280
I can never listen to a radio station.

840
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,040
You respect a radio station, you would have me on it.

841
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,740
You know that.

842
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,600
So that is why we are here,

843
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,180
and looking a gift horse in the anus kind of way.

844
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,860
Won't they suspect us?

845
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,380
I mean, you're more shady than a dog tree.

846
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,420
A dog tree is a scene.

847
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,960
Ships fire will be the last people I'm suspect.

848
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,200
We're not even real characters, remember?

849
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,820
We're just imaginary radio characters.

850
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,700
No substance in reality, quadrant, whatsoever.

851
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,640
So they think.

852
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,440
That gives us the perfect alibi.

853
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,460
Now let's look around for something to rip off.

854
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,900
Nitsy fingers.

855
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,740
As your personal frontier Freud, I must remark,

856
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,120
this could score some bad karma points.

857
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:21,720
No.

858
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,120
I can't help it.

859
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,020
I can't help it.

860
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,360
I must steal.

861
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,440
I must steal.

862
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,200
Go for it.

863
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,520
Pinch.

864
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:28,920
Thief.

865
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,380
Swipe.

866
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,060
Snatch.

867
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,600
Snatch.

868
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,240
Snatch.

869
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,800
Snatch.

870
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,400
Snatch.

871
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:32,940
Snatch.

872
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,240
Snatch.

873
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,380
Snatch.

874
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,380
Quit saying snatch.

875
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,180
We're getting excited.

876
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,700
Yes, brain rot radio theater.

877
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,580
Those brain rot.

878
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:42,900
Brain.

879
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,720
Brain.

880
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,800
Brain rot.

881
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,720
Radio theater up in town.

882
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:48,720


883
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,160
In Cleveland.

884
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,920
On wonderful WCSB.

885
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,480
That's a cool station.

886
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,200
When they let, you know, guests in.

887
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,660
Me.

888
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:04,580
And, uh, well, looks like I've got a tape to change.

889
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,320
We have to let them change here.

890
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,160
We'll switch over right like this with OBE.

891
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,900
This is an out of band experience.

892
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,260
Pure figments of imagination.

893
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,620
No, no, no.

894
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,660
Any abnormal sound?

895
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,720
Normal.

896
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:21,980
.

897
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:21,980


898
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,560
.

899
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,280
.

900
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,500
.

901
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:27,540
.

902
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:27,560
.

903
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:27,760

Line up.

931
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,860
Make some noise.

932
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,120
I can't hear you.

933
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,480
Come on, let's hear it.

934
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,100
Am I getting the blood pressure round for nothing?

935
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,940

941
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,080
Roll.

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,800
Roll.

943
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:29,780
Roll.

944
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,740
Roll.

945
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,100
Roll.

Roll.

957
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,720
You and your subgenius fools shall never defeat me, Bob Dobbs.

958
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,460
Oh, no?

959
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,300
Then have a taste of my Stark Fist of Removal, Doctor Conspiracy.

960
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:04,700
Shhh!

961
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:14,520
Neegie's henchmen won't get any slack when they face Bob Co.'s new Bob Dobbs action figure with flying rocket fist, flamethrower pipe, and magic briefcase.

962
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,860
Too much is always better than not enough when you collect the subgenius universe.

963
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,100
Bobmobile not included. Batteries and some assembly required. Action figure sold separately from Bob Co.

964
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:26,800
Roll.

965
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:42,140
I am a subgenius, and by that flesh you would touch what falls to the grain of the man.

966
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,080
My power wasn't given to me in exchange for prayer or meditation.

967
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:52,100
I paid for it in cold, hard American dollars.

968
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,180
Salvation you get for free is worth just that.

969
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,460
Nothing you queer.

970
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,660
Of course, your money ain't worth jack anyway.

971
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,800
The conspiracy says to that,

972
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,200
but a very important element of your soul

973
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,340
and ears to those otherwise worthless greenbacks

974
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:12,120
that Bob needs in order to pursue his plan

975
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,040
for world domination.

976
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,260
I say, Bob guides my hand in all things

977
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,160
and pays me off in pure slack.

978
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:29,180
So I say to you whips, you fools, you dupes, you pigs,

979
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,900
give me your money.

980
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,960
You won't be in the future.

981
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,380
The future offers you not but destruction.

982
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,960
You know what I mean?

983
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:47,480
I mean, I dare you to kill me.

984
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,140
I need the bill.

985
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,720
I mean, I'm one of the good guys.

986
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,760
My cards shall prevail.

987
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,920
Let out the crazy man inside you.

988
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,160
He knows what's what.

989
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:05,100
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

990
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,900
Oh, you say, me, primate.

991
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,140
Me, overman.

992
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,060
You think I'm dumb, but you are blind

993
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,140
to the conspiracy that runs your life.

994
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,380
And you have your geniuses running things for you

995
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,860
when you think they're going to make things safe and simple.

996
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,020
And I'm going to make things safe.

997
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,360
And simple and easy for me and the entire sub-demon's race.

998
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,220
Even if it means wiping out your sex society in total

999
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,520
with no more sentiment and balls and swatting the fly.

1000
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,380
All this that we might survive the end.

1001
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,400
You know why?

1002
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,940
Because I am, I am, I am, I am a sub-d.

1003
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,340
I say, oh, you blow-dried white wine sipping designer Jean Clair French film watcher,

1004
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,920
and walkman totin' hip wimps.

1005
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,280
And you house-coated inquirer riddin' trailer in camp.

1006
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,600
Ball shoppin', hair curled, motorheads, cock holsters.

1007
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,220
All you do is stop corporate big money.

1008
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,900
Oil exploded, tree killin', land rape, food freezin'.

1009
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,600
Death, woman, tryin' naturally.

1010
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,480
The establishment carryin' vote.

1011
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,100
Huntin' backstabbin'.

1012
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,080
Poverty spreadin'.

1013
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,020
Bomb wieldin'.

1014
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,020
Meringue headin'.

1015
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,160
Pencil neckin'.

1016
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,840
Razor-headed politicos.

1017
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,520
Kill the conspiracy.

1018
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,040
Kill them.

1019
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:22,880
Kill them and eat them.

1020
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,180
Kill them and eat them and f*** their wives.

1021
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,540
Who do you think you are?

1022
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,760
What do you think you're doin'?

1023
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,600
Do you think you got it good?

1024
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,860
Well, dispose of those delusions.

1025
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,740
Dispose of them all right now.

1026
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:44,100
Because on July 5th, 1998 at 7.30 in the morning, you shall be judged.

1027
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,300
Calculatin' alien races.

1028
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,260
I'm your own.

1029
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,540
If you don't wanna fuck, you wanna skip this groupin' here.

1030
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,620
You will fly where we will party.

1031
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,400
I'm your own.

1032
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,360
Follow the thunderbird.

1033
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,420
I'm gonna get down and do it right here.

1034
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,020
Now, here we go.

1035
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,020


1036
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,500
I'm gonna get down and do it right here.

1037
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,460
You know why, daddy?

1038
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,460
You know why?

1039
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,480
You know why?

1040
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,520
You know why?

1041
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,900
You know why?

1042
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1043
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1044
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1045
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1046
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1047
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1048
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1049
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1050
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1051
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:27,900


1052
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,920
Oh, my brother, my brother, Cleve Duncan.

1053
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,400
Cleve Donut Duncan.

1054
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,780
Singin' that lovely song with backup.

1055
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,760
The music by Huge Voodoo.

1056
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,920
This is actually been sort of a...

1057
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,340
I've used a lot of re-run material from ours.

1058
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,820
Slack number 262.

1059
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,320
The DK Jones and Cleve tape.

1060
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:51,860
Wonderful.

1061
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,020
I'm gonna put it on the wall.

1062
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:52,020


1063
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,120
DK Jones and friends.

1064
00:52:54,540 --> 00:53:00,580
I trust you got that number to write off to for free information on the hub.

1065
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,440
I'm gonna give it one more time real quick.

1066
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,300
That's post office box.

1067
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,520
He just drop us a darn self-addressed damn down-vloak.

1068
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,040
That'll do it.

1069
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:22,000
At Bob at post office box 140306 Dallas, Texas 752140.

1070
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1071
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1072
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1073
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1074
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1075
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,000


1076
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,720
I've got a sort of a clarification I need to make here, friends.

1077
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:36,860
Since around 1990, certain church members have been plagued by disembodied voices saying

1078
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:44,800
things like, you owe me $60 and I can't spend this on the other side.

1079
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,000
And if you're planning to crash on the subgenius foundation floor, you may have to get a job.

1080
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,000


1081
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,240
I don't know if you're gonna have to put up with the damn ghost, subgenius ghost.

1082
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,020
They won't hurt you.

1083
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:02,400
I mean, you might get some slime or blood might drip on you from the ceiling.

1084
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,080
But all they do is whine and bitch about how they didn't get their $60.

1085
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,560
They didn't even get hell.

1086
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,620
They can't smoke.

1087
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,060
TV doesn't make any sense to them.

1088
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:13,680
On and on.

1089
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,660
Just what we do is we just sprinkle a little goofer dust around the cots.

1090
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,420
And if you give them a buck, they'll stay away.

1091
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:21,980
That's what I'm saying.

1092
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,280
If there's like a new church pamphlet out or a stark fist or something, they'll appreciate that.

1093
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:33,760
We can understand why they complain, dear friends, because the least they should expect is their $60 back.

1094
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,560
And that was guaranteed in print.

1095
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:44,000
And to make good, to offset the fact that some $60 subgenius foundation checks are not legal tender in hell,

1096
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,160
we switched to investing those in the individual's names in a special memorial fund

1097
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,960
in the subgenius bank account.

1098
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:59,320
As long as their names are on file, the exes will be able to re-extract their mental life stenches

1099
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,620
and reconstruct new bodies for them on next day.

1100
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,320
They won't be doomed to hell forever or anything like that.

1101
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,820
It just might seem that way.

1102
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,440
But, you know, that's just the way hell is.

1103
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:17,080
But if you think about it, meanwhile, that interest on that $60 will grow and grow and grow.

1104
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,340
And it...

1105
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,140
Oh, here's Joe Christ just walking in.

1106
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:20,660
He walked in the door.

1107
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,100
.

1108
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,100


1109
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,100
.

1110
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,960
.

1111
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,280
.

1112
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,560
.

1113
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1114
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1115
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1116
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1117
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1118
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1119
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1120
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1121
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,560


1122
00:55:49,560 --> 00:56:19,560


1123
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:49,560


1124
00:56:49,560 --> 00:57:19,560


1125
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:49,560


1126
00:57:49,560 --> 00:58:19,560


1127
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:33,120
