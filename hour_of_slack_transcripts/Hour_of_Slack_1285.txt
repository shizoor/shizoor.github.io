Good evening fellow necro-mediacs. I'm glad so many of you could come.
I have a new thing to introduce to you all.
It's a little treat.
I want to do with a friend of mine.
I'm sorry, good friend of mine.
I think you know who I am.
I don't know. I don't know who I am.
What was your name, sir?
I'm a dog.
Get that beast away from me.
Or I'll kick his head.
I'm 번стро.
I look good today.
The man that Ilsam is looking for.
He was very Och separately.
It's tá handed out to you by Bav 다�.
My hunch was a guaranteed one.
Actually, naughty dogs have too little

I'm asking this question.
Get it over with.
This is the basic closed loop control input.
By opposition to open loop, for which the pursued objective is to get a given deflection and generally a maximum deflection.
In order to obtain the desired outcome of the aircraft motion.
Do you fucking understand me, you fucking piece of shit?
At this hour of slack is a rerun, but it's a mysterious one.
As you might know from looking at the radio section of subgenius.com,
our friend Saint David Bochner has gone to the trouble of digitizing almost all of the first 1,100 hours of slack.
Transferring them from cassette tape to MP3 and making them freely downloadable on his website.
We've been inspecting the logs of the downloads and noticed a couple of very strange things.
Firstly, a surprising number of old shows were being downloaded by people in Russia and China.
Secondly, while most of the old shows have been downloaded by an average of 200 to 400 people,
one of them has been downloaded almost 20,000 times.
Our new shows get an average of like 3,000 downloads a month or so,
but this one old show has been downloaded 20,000 times.
We looked it up to see what was so special about it.
It's hour of slack number 863 from the year 2002.
And it's a very interesting number.



It's titled Time Madness.
And it has some great stuff on it, but damn if I know why this show out of all of our 1,200 odd shows has been copied by 20,000 people.
Maybe you, dear listener, can figure this out.
And if you do, please let us know.
Here then is Time Madness from 2002.
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.
Ah yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.
And you know those policemen on motorcycles won't let me preach on car hoods downtown because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.
And there's no reason to arrest me, yet they would, because I'm free, free, free enough to rant to myself in public
because I come against death, taxes, work, and premature immaculation.
For Bob, your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.
Them!
Them, and oh we hate them.
They and their tools of iniquity.
Not the tools of the preacher, not the tongue, nor the other parts, nay, but tools of false slack.
Dangled forever in front of you like that rays right around the corner.
Or like that rat swimming in poison.
Or like that rat swimming in poison.
Then, cheese, let there be slack.
I'm going to Gox Town, Gox Town
Here I come
I'm going to Gox Town, Gox Town
Here I come
They got some crazy little
God's heads
Staring up and gonna
Get me one
Why did you let your daughter dream of going on this mad moon journey?
Because I love her
And I wanted to live to the best effect
Dragging out life to the last possible second
Is not living to the best effect
The best of life, Passworthy
Lies nearest to the edge of death
Our fathers and our fathers' fathers
Cleaned up the old order of things
Because it killed children
It killed those who were unprepared for death
Because it tormented people in vain
Because it outraged human pride and dignity
Because it was an ugly spectacle of waste
But that was only a beginning
There's nothing wrong in suffering
If you suffer for a purpose
Our revolution didn't abolish danger
Or evil

It simply made danger and death worthwhile
We must hold this crowd back at any cost for a time
Until the gas of peace is ready
I seem to have done toilet on your floor
Right, right, right, right
You'll wonder where your teeth went
When you brush your teeth with
Dancer's pep
Dancer's pep
Dancer's pep
And I think I disagree with
Chairman Bob
I disagree with
I do agree with
Chairman Bob
That Chairman Bob can't be working
I recall that Chairman Bob went that route
Right?
Right, I think the thing
And I think in essence
That Chairman Bob can't be working
While they're type alive to invest in
And so forth
But how to close down the law
But now
One final question if I could
Anybody on the panel who'd want to address Chairman Bob?
No
No
Okay

That's no good
Yes Sir
Chairman Bob
As it turns out

Oh, yes, dear friends.
Some wonderful edits and credits by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.
Except for the very last one, which was from Dr. Mr. Sister here in Cleveland.
Yes, aside from that, all the rest was by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.
All those cut-ups, anyway.
They are titled.
The Hour of Slack Mix is by El Queso All-Stars.
And the very opening was by Heart Ignition.
More from him soon.
But first, this fantabulous rant by the old-time Dr. Dr. Dinosaur.
What kind of savior do you want?
You want something?
Exciting and a deified being?
Or do you want a completely predetermined cosmology
with static and stable and sedentary gods hanging off of it
like apples still stuck on a tree in January?
Are you looking to get carried away on that sweet chariot?
Or are you afraid that there won't be any difference
between it and the boxcars that will unload at the gates of the Eternal Concentration Camp?
Will you settle for a holy order that's all order?
Or are you hankering for a chance to put in a few licks yourself
in the timeless struggle between good and evil?
Unless you're ready to let your soul roll over and die
before it's even had a chance to prove itself on the field of holy battle,
it seems to me that you might want to think about making a choice.
Are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan
when you know, you know from the book,
that he loses in the end?
No.
We may pull the wool over our own eyes,
but that doesn't mean we're stupid.
We may go in for the underdog,
but we don't place no bets after the cards have been shown.
And even though he wins just before the credits roll,
credits with only his name on them, by the way,
are you going to sign up for the Yahweh team when you know the outcome?
Hell, everybody likes to win,
but only after they get to play the game.
You can turn a buck betting on a sure thing,
but where's the slack in that?
Now, we got the fighting Jesus,
that hardcore three-nailed money-changer-ass-kicking Aramaic rowdy,
and that's fun for a while,
but he ends up selling your account to Yahweh,
and you still get shortchanged on the action and thrills you crave in a belief system.
Well, kids, I think you know what the answer is.
The answer is the ever-wishing,
ever-widening smoke ring around J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Yes, only Dobbs, among all the modern mythological madmen,
represents the uncertainty, the dramatic tension,
the screaming scary monster movie mayhem
that keeps your heart a-thumping and your blood a-pumping
while you sit on the edge of your pew
waiting to find out how this movie turns out.
Where do the big spenders,
the high-rollers,
make their fortunes?
Do they toss their bankrolls into long-term IRAs and deposit certificates and play it safe?
Hell no!
They dare to risk it and play the market!
And that's the kind of savior Bob is, children.
Bob is the Wall Street savior.
We may know the saucers are coming, but we don't know what the outcome will be.
We know Bob can cut deals with human governments and overlords and Illuminati
and rake in the cash from that.
But we don't know yet whether he'll be able to close the deal
that will keep the X's from just plowing us all under as a bad crop.
We don't know if we'll ride the saucers as exalted examples of Yeti evolution
or as fertilizer for some planet where they intend to try again.
If you want true adventure in your eternal future,
if you want a little havoc with your heaven,
if you can stand a little mistake,
if you can find justification in your destiny,
and there's only one personal savior that will satisfy your soul's fighting spirit,
and that is J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Dr. Dinosaur, dear friends, in a classic old-timey rant.
And now, Zoot's Rift.
I've peeked in the devil's secret hell files
and found a list with names a mile long
and a half of them are just a bunch of crap.





I saw you, and you, and you, and you, and even you.
Let me close my eyes.
Please don't make me watch Satan masturbate.
He's a hungry clown and I don't want to see all his dirty deeds.
Oh, my God, oh, why did those assholes...
and the employment agency give me this job cleaning up this office?
Oh, why, somebody tell me already.
Was this the best they could do on such short notice?
Am I being punished for overeating and using too many cuss words?
Or is it for sounding too much like some pale, cheap imitation of Captain Beard?
Or am I too much like Frank Zappa?
Am I being punished for not cutting enough people off on the freeway?
Or for answering my phone messages?
Or why, God, oh, why did those assholes at the employment agency put me here where I don't belong?
When they could have gotten me a job selling hot dogs instead of idiots at Disneyland?
Were they afraid I'd put the old lady by erection?
Did they have to suspect that I might urinate through the cosmos?
Am I being punished for not cutting enough people off on the freeway? Or for answering my phone messages? Oh, my God, oh, why? Did those assholes at the employment agency put me here where I don't belong?
Were they afraid I'd put the old lady by erection?
Was that the fact of Space Mountain?
Oh, my God, oh, why?
Those assholes at the employment agency had told me earlier about the hatred cause.
I would have worn my fat man's pajamas with the air conditioning back in the year.

That's right, I'm dead, I'm dead because you killed me, Sue Drift.
Because you and your sloth musician friends beat me up and killed me.
Oh, man, don't I have enough problems?
What is it you want, oh great spirit?
You want to complain to me that you're in hell, I suppose.
That you're dead and have gone straight to fucking hell for driving like a fucking idiot on the freeway.
Giving me the wrong change of jack-in-the-box.
Playing that heavy metal shit on your stereo at 3.30 in the morning when we're all trying to sleep.
No, Sue Drift, no!
Sending me junk mail, trying to entice me into wasting my money on boring, inane magazines.
Charging me over a thousand dollars at the Chevron station for preventive maintenance.
While all the while deliberately destroying my car.
No way, dude!
For going through life talking like a blabbering, slobbering idiot.
Driving your van to the beach during spring break with a sign painted on the side that says,
Showing your teeth.
No! I said no!
Sue Drift, they didn't even hold it against me for being a booker in several Los Angeles rock clubs.
Or for getting all the pussy while guys like John Truby were stuck with their shit jobs at the hardware stores.
Well then, what are you talking about then?
I'm in heaven, Sue Drift!
That's right, you killed me!
And I went to heaven, glorious, beautiful!
Heaven!
But you, Sue Drift, it's you that are in hell!
You fucker!
Ha!

I GOT IT!

FIVE!
Yes!
Oh my god.
Me and We
Mommy, Daddy
And another sound
And the attic lock melted
Mink
Mink with bright little eyes and tousled hair
Peered inside
And behind her
Tall, wavering blue eyes
Frightful
Dying
Step back to Shandsaw
The long line of celebrants
Making their way to the top of the Temple Mount
And their bright saffron yurts with their shaven heads
And their one good eye
Pointed firmly above their master eyes
They chouched forwards
Some were bleeding in their feet
Some were bleeding at the ears
From the renting and raiding of their cars





And they were forced to hear
Some's navels were smiling
That austere
Yet abstruse smile
Reserved for the few who knew their fate
My ears are bleeding
And they just keep trudging
Looks real good from that shot up in the hills there
Is that a dolly shot or is that a...
What is that?
Just turn around
Hey man, you're not supposed to show your watches
1392
People don't wear watches in 1392
The time is 13-0-13
Do you know where your smell dawn dwells?
That's time
Can you feel war praying yet?
Time
Are your breasts as ripe as the milkmaids
Dancing through the forest glen?
Are you enslaved to time
Handcuffed by your own time?
Or wristwatch?
Is your lust for material feelings insatiable?
Are you still formatting the other CD?
Do you have a streeeally long funny looking forefinger?
I'm gonna blow their loads in the last minute before the CD is formatted
I'm alone!
Two minutes takes forever when you're waiting for it
I blew it!
I blew it!


I blew it!
I blew it!
I once had the skin of a smiling little simian boy like you
Yes, grand
Partially hairy
I like that new skin you're wearing tonight
Oh, it is very, very, very luxurious to be wearing it
What is that, like about 55 year old female?
Yes, yes, a kangaroo is the bottom part
And the top part is a female
A corinthian kangaroo
It's only a 55 year old female skin you've got on?
This is very supple still, feel it, touch it
No wonder you look so young
Ooh, you feel young, spin day
Very supple, she was, she was a beautiful dancer
She died from an ergot overdose
We transported her to the middle ages to enlighten her somehow
And yet she became involved in the celebrations when she came back
Where did you download that skin app?
Er...
And GMM.com skins for all your fancy new internet programs
Just as sure as sugar and sweet
Just as sure as you walk on your feet
Just as sure as we'll all be dead
Something's gonna crumble in your head.
Poop Dog will pee and Pee Dog will poop.
And out of my hose will come horrible goop.
One by one they shall die.
Two by two all false smite.
He did sin, lake of fire, for he used the name J.R.
Behold, the day of Bob is at hand and he shall come like a salesman in the night.
Give up hope.
Bob's no crutch.
Here comes Negi.
Here comes Butch.
Dressed as Bulgarian woman.
And look at the fascinating necklace they are wearing.
Oh, there is the flute player.
Sonia, how's your job?
Sonia, could you step closer to the microphone?
What is the name of the flute you are playing in the Bulgarian?
It's called the Jelette Kukukata.
The Jelette Kukukata.
And it looks like you can also shave your legs or any other hairy part of your body.
You are absolutely right.
Yes, it's a very rare instrument.
I noticed very many of the female singers have very, very hairy mustache,
which must be taken care of on regular basis.
Yes.
Yes, isn't that a nice coincidence?
So you can whistle through your nose and rip off your flesh in one very smooth.
I'm glad to be talking about the different orifices of whistling,
because
you know, that can get kind of personal.
That's why the girl did the high notes so easy,
because she had been shaving her fuzzy .
Oh, if only I could reach the high minutes.
Of time.
The high hours.
If time.
The high days.
The high weeks.
The peaks of time.
Why cannot we skip from the peaks of one time to another?
Are there fifths?
Skip over the boring parts.
And the weeks of a day of a week.
Or the painful parts.
Actives indeed.
Monday.
We will call C.
Time is a waveform, is it not?
The Monday after, we will call C.
Can we not skip across the tops of the waves?
Can we not?
By passing the long trip down?
Like luscious milkmaids on surfboards, can't we?
Now, what about the fact that in engineering terminology,
the element of stress is measured in moments?
Stress is measured in moments, but-
Stress is measured in moments, yes.
Slack, however, is measured in moments.

Uh, r
Doe?
Uh, z
So, in other words, who has the best part about doğ banker and her Board of Trustees

B thatachu?
They reacted like the hell out of someone else everytime it goes up the scale of 21.
Oh, and uh, I see Klah.

Could she and Klah grow until the earth, to the top, just to take it down and freelyんです
vasels?
Or if the extraterrestrial worldinton and devo償 Andrew Jones.
Chris Carrif debi Betty.
Is that a command?

It's the B side of every universe has a continuous flip.
Just as big as this one.
Just as valid.
Oh, some are smaller, though, James.
Don't discount the entropy factor.
Some are much smaller.
Hey, I saw an ad in the scene, in the back pages of it.
It said, this didn't make sense to me.
Does it make sense?
Sex-starved escorts.
This don't make no kind of sense at all.
If an escort is sex-starved, what does she look like?
I mean, shouldn't an escort be, like, getting sex all the time?
Now, you know, Chaz, I've been reading entertainment weeklies for a long time.
And from what I've learned from those is that there are a lot of beautiful women who are completely lonely.
I guess all the guys think that they're getting tons of dates and no one ever calls them.
They're the ones who are waiting for your call right now.
That's right.
Wow.
The 900.
Yes.
They're waiting.
888-669-2323.
Actually, there is a beautiful, live, naked woman waiting for your call.
A free call at 888-669-2323.
But don't you remember, every time you call her, she hands the phone to a sweaty stevedore named Bill.
And the rest of the evening is pure hell.
You know, the funny thing is, I just gave out the notes.
I gave out the number of Jesus.
And actually, it's Mary Magdalene is the beautiful, naked woman.
Well, we know that our Lord and Mary Magdalene were fond of fuzzing the fur, as they used to say in Judea and the old age.
And I think you might interrupt them at a tragic moment if you call that number.
And what is that number again to call them at a tragic moment?
888-669-2323.
You know, they're going to be going, damn, that sang gave our number out over the radio and two people called up.
Call it any time.
Call now.
It's like four in the morning in Bulgaria, where they are, the new foundation headquarters.
Well, we just interviewed one of the whistling women of the Bulgarian chorus.
And she actually played a little Gillette shaver.
And she could shave her mustache to hit the high notes.
And here's a type of her now.
Now, look at that incredible headdress she's wearing.
You know, it's amazing how Europeans sometimes resemble like tribal cultures, I'd say, in South America.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Are those real feathers or are those someone else's?
Well, they're a certain kind of a feather that is a part fur and then the other part is feather.
As I look now, I can see that these are actually bark stained underpants that you have.
Under things.
Things crawling beneath the surface.
How in the world could you have ever seen my under?
My unders are under all of my skirts.
How in the, do you have x-ray vision?
Under things.
Under the mind.
Oh, honey.
Sub-mental.
You look.
Sub-genius, in fact.
So lovely today.
Sub-temporal.
And what shall we do with old man time who keeps dragging us along with his fitful pace?
Take the toilet plunger and plunge it in his eyes.
Where is time control?
How can we skip away from this poor, boring now?
And leap, leap ahead.
Back.
Orbit.
Back.
Yes, back.
Why not?
Yes, it's the 99%, isn't it?
That one little tenth of a thousandth of a millionth of a percent that makes you less than human.
Isn't that what it is?
And as you climb in the door there, you think you'll be saying goodbye to this earth.
But no, no.
You'll come back again.
You'll come back again.
Oh, it's not enough to smash your watch.
It's not enough to buy every new clock that will be on the sub-genius catalog soon.
No, just to prove your independence from time.
No.
Rebellion against God-time.
The evil time god.
You know, it's all for the time being, they say.
That cruel taskmaster of the sky.
With a capital T and a capital B.
With a long white beard.
The time being.
Made of time pieces.
Oh, and only if we had the human being sauce.
Time being?
The tick.
The great tick.
The time witch tick.
Arr!
The time being.
And we must bring down the time.

The time ass pirate.
Ah, Framzee is not a tick of Parasite.
Is it not an ass pirate?
And the acid queen.
Parasite.
And an ass pirate.
Who is the acid queen now that Princess Di isn't giving money to hookers anymore?
Ah, I thought it was Laura Bunchcake.
Did you hear that story?
Did you read about that?
About Laura?
A right-hand man told these, uh...
A Plutonian man?
We'll all be drinking.
Princess Di.
Princess Di used to have, uh, men snuck in in the trunk of cars.
And she also used to go out in the middle of the night.
This is true.
She used to go out in the middle of the night and, you know, and drive around and give money
to hookers.
Really?
Yeah, to help them out.
Do they have the favors to perform for them?
No, go home.
Go buy some shoes or something.
Go buy a coat.
You don't need this.
A true princess.
It was because they were competition.
I love this thing.
Watch outside.
Waiting on his corner.
Waiting on her for like nine hours.
She made a deal with the aliens.
And then she didn't pay it off.
She was a great person, but she didn't pay off her deal with the aliens.
And they came and got her.
She'd come by and maybe rip off a quid or two.
And I'll be back home with me honey in a very, very short time.
When you signed that paper with the acid queen.
I loved her.
I mean, she was queenly.
In her own sick, demented way.
Go ahead, man.
Bring it up.
Bring it all the way up.
Bring all of them up.
On all screens.
Go ahead.
I dare you to see what you're looking at.
Go ahead.
Don't use that third eye.
Close that third eye.
Quick.
Gypsy acid queens.
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Spaceman.
Oh, spaceman.
Come rescue me.
Come rescue me.
It's time to become a psychedelic hologram as we blast through the universe wearing no
clothes and funny little pebbles of flowers.
Look at our feet.
We look like frogs.
I think we're the only ones.
Now.
Free, free, free again.
I'm surfing with the aliens.
I'm setting my chromosomes, baby.
I'm getting out of this earthly humanly garb.
This only costs 30 bucks.
What a deal.
What a ride, ladies and gentlemen, we're having here in the genealogy room as we all look
out the open port holes and check on our charts.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.










Let's go.
I really don't want to know where that character came from.
I'm going to have to drop your chromosomes in the other room.
All of time is just soaring so fast.
Backward.
Real time.
The ball and chain of the chronometer shall no longer anchor us to temporal reality.
Iron man.
No ass pirates and no blood sucking parasites.
I hope nothing.
Time, baby.
Read us for $30.
It's free for $30.
Hey, Dave, do you remember the Ass Pirates song?
Yar har, yar har, yar har.
We've been sailing, oh, so far.
The Acid Pirates?
I'm looking for some chunky rump to set me nose on fire.
We'll throw the clankers over and drag the bitch aboard.
We'll sniffer and we'll piffer and we'll...
Old Peg Leg Dick, they called him Peg Dick Leg.
Do you remember Ruby the Dyke Queen?
You may mean the Pervert Pirate.
It's no bigger threat for them having admitted it
than for them having admitted it and not having admitted it.
But I would hope that in context of the recent admission,
which...
which they've admitted, but they admitted it.
They've admitted it, but they did in fact admit it.
It could be an important lesson by something that's really not very useful.
It could be something that's really not very useful.
It could be something that's really not very useful.

It's like two quantum realities in one.
You'll be crossing them in big time fashion as you cross five different dimensions at one time.
Your ocular vision, your...
Because reality is constantly spinning.
You know, so many dimensions at once anyway.
You know, so like every possibility that's occurring occurs in some universe.
Twice.
And it's because there's as many universes as there are possibilities, man.
Yeah, but then you also have to double that.
And TikTok's there again like a monstrous crocodile waiting for Peter Pan to...
There's a good one and an evil one.
Yep.
This is easier to understand than Incomtats.
I'll say that.
You know what I'm saying, Tom?
Yeah, we do.
You know what I'm saying?
Yep, duality is in those...
Yeah, what?
I use a program for income tax and for morality.
You use a program?
I have a computer program that dictates morality and ethics for me.
As it does your taxes?
At the same time?
No, they're different.
Different.
They are linked, though, by a fashionable poo-poo stick.
But they are linked indeed.
They're linked by the thing longer.
They are linked by a fascist evolutionary style statement lingering somewhere in your...
The thing of my Bob dangles and ever towards the center of the earth.
Cinema Bob?
That's how you know where gravity goes, is where Bob's thing is pointing.
Yes, it's one of the best ways of finding out.
It's within like a fraction of a microcosmic second it's been determined by Greenwich.
I mean, at least...
It's the plumb bob upon which is hung all gravitational...
The prior original plumb bob of Wiener plumbing.
The plumb of my Bob.
The plumb of my Bob.
The shadow from the buttock also...
It's a bad Bob.
It's incidental time.
Just sit a reel of Greenwich.
That's what I'm talking about, Bob.
From the head, Bob.
Well...
Hair, Bob.
Have we said all we can about him?





His abilities?
Well, you know, it's fairly flexible, I think.
You know where to put the cork.
Yeah.
You know where to put the cork.
People doing your yoga lately, haven't you?
They say the days don't move and that there's no such thing as time.
But reflecting on the hours gone by, I know that once you are mine,
never is a surprise.
You are the political nightsmare of me giving you the

For me to gather up the words I want to say
I need you with me, it's true
There doesn't seem to be any real way
That I can ever come through for you

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh baby, yeah
Do it, do it
Oh, oh
You're driving me crazy
Oh, oh my god, that feels so good
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh baby, yeah
Do it
Oh, oh
You're driving me crazy
Oh
I'm the hottest thing on the wheels, bitch
You're so rad
My father taught me everything I know
You know, I've never met a he-man quite like you
Like, you know, someone who could take me beyond the confines of my perceived celestial boundaries
Exemplified by the quasi-cataclysmic cacophony
Of one-eyed people
of existential mortality
Like, you know what I mean?
You're a mean bitch

You shall have as much meat as you want.
What the devil is going on, Chrissy?
They're dressed like little girls.
You are a sucker.
And you listen to me and you listen to me good.
The time has come.
It is now or never.
Thou shalt not listen to rock and roll music.
Thou shalt not masturbate.
Thou shalt not fornicate.
Would that appeal to you?
Would that appeal to you?
Would that appeal to you?
Would that appeal to you?
The time has come.
A reckoning time.
A time when all the mighty buildings shall be shattered and splintered and split.
When the world's bellies will bloat.
When America will be put to the fire and tested in the new revelation.
This is the end of today's lesson.
The End
You know, we live in a world where we want instant gratification.
And there are all kinds of schemes out there.
And we are desperate.
We are hungry and we are thirsty for something that they give us what we want.
It's the process of the criminal law.
Thrown into the fire and burned.
I like to think ridiculous, imposterous.
I can find it.
I can believe it.
I heard it on the radio.
It's a pill that has 10 effects.
It's a word either weak or weak.
All other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.
I like that.
I like that.
Duh.
What he doesn't hit is how you make food?
Because I know he aids human beings.


And he's not going to hurt me anymore.
you got the gun.
Heart

And now
back to WCSB
Cleveland and ESO
Radio with this
final message.
The message is the message.
And when the Lord
exploded his messages
on the depleted mankind
accordion,
profound.
The message is the message.
God is mad as hell
and he's not gonna
take it anymore.
I said God!
God is
mad as hell!
And he is not gonna
take it anymore. See me?
Pay me? Pay me?
Hear me?
Thank you, Dr. Schertz.
Well, at least
it inspires.
That's what I'm glad about.
If it made him angry, I would be worried.
You know,
otherwise I think we're just fine,
really.
I think we can trust
that everything is just fine.
But can we
find that?
There's no need for
contracting opinions anymore.
God is fed up!
He can come over to my house
and fuck my sister!
Never!
Never!
Well, yes.
And I think it's just going to be fine.
I really do.
I have to duck onto the subway now.
Yes!
The subway!
Mad as hell!
Mad as hell!
I'm not gonna take it anymore!
No, they're not.
They voted, but they're not mad as hell.
Everything's apparently just fine.
Everything's just fine.
Yes, we will take it.
We are bending over.
Go ahead and...
All I can say is, free Willie!
That's three feet over.
We're gonna take it.
We're gonna...
Oh, there he goes.
He freed his Willie!
And they can't even tuck him away!
He's really making it.
Come back, Willie!
No!
Come back in just a short...
Come back, Willie!
Oh, it looks so nice hanging out like that.
But not like the plumb, Bob.
Let's forget you.
Yeah.
Well, I think it's time for everyone
to go to theater tonight.
Find me that way.
I want to see a nice show
at the Industrial Tractor Factory.
Number five.
Plumb, Bob is plumb...
Bob!
I love these Chechen movies.
Put your hand down here.
It's not a movie.
It's a...
Just take your hand out of my pocket.
I think this Chechen terrorist woman
to my left wants me to put my hand
on the popcorn.
There's a quarter down there somewhere.
You're not a Chechen woman.
You are a hairy Chechen man.
I'm telling you, there's a quarter down there.
I don't want your rules.
She pulled her hand out,
holding his mighty credit card.
And there's the beautiful flotilla
of the Virgin Larry
as he's making his way down the street
with all the apostolates
and the other sub-crimes
smoking the apostrophes
they've been given by their dear, dear, dear Lord.
A fanny man who used to write them
efficaciously once every summer
as they cramped away
off of their wilderness huts.
But now it looks like some of them
are actually rolling in the dough
as they begin to make a huge human pie
out of their celebrates.
That looks messy.
It is.
It's very messy.
You don't want to get your feet
too close to the middle.
There's four and twenty blackbirds in there.
Oh, man.
And there's also a dead saint
which comes back.
The blood boils every August 22nd
before the feast.
Freedom is laid to rest
in the grave of history.
The human gene
which once stretched across the globe
and threatened to the solar systems
and the skies beyond
is humbled now
like a little drained of itself
worm laying in a pool of mossy shit.
Things will be better
somewhere else.
Lower the coffin
of the spirit of man.
Shovel the earth on top.
Shovel the earth on top.
Like a phoenix
to sun.
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.
So endeth all things.
Would you like a little bite
of his ankle?
There is much pain
and gnashing of teeth.
Put a little bit of raisin butter
on the ankle there, you good.
Oh, man.
Down there, Gary.
Get out of that coffin.
You've been resurrected.
Get out of that coffin.
Throw away the stone
and get to work.
Who's playing the butt trumpet?
Well, the first thing
we're going to be doing,
we're going to be working
on building back
some of that flexibility
you've been losing
over being dead
for the last 26 years.
That's what you think is happening.
You're all kind of scrunched up.
You're skeletal.
Look at yourself.
You need to do 25, 26,
maybe 27 light year push-ups.
Come on, Norton.
Get down the neural fives.
Let's see you do it.
Do them, do them, do them.
We're satisfied as hell
and we are going to take it.
Please do.
Evermore.
Please give it to us.
Just punch.
Just give it to us.
We were hoping
we could have a big war, you know.
And we were also hoping
they'd take my social security
and get a bunch of them
crack-butt right-wing guys
on the Supreme Court,
you know, eh?
And they'll see
a homeland security.
Oh, yeah, I was hoping
I could get stopped
every three blocks.
And that's why
I was one of the 37%
of American registered voters
who showed up
to wave my fist
in the occult sky
and smack myself firmly
between the genital areas.
I am so glad.
I was the first.
And now I'm...
Well, you hear the dogs, don't you?
We better get out of here.
Oh, here they come.
Here they come.
There were only 37 percenters
total.
I voted the wrong way, man.
Here they come.
It's those giant crickets.
The tag glows.
They're going to kill us.
They can see the tag, man.
Just keep moving.
Cover up your arm.
Till next week,
keep your head on tight.
You're back to the wind
and you're sack in the saddle.
Mr. Butch says his mandate
means lots of fun
for the people
on top of the pie.
For those squanderlings
laying down near the bottom,
there won't be much pie left.
The crickets are only coming
to the party.
For the gravy.
I want to know
what I want to know.
Like a diamond
in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle,
little star.
How I wonder
what you are.

FOR GEARS AND
Rhhhh plans.
Do not stop us today.
Don't move! Just stay still! Help!
They're hanging in there upside down like in a slaughterhouse. I wish you'd seen it.
I want to get a picture.
Well, you better get to bed now, son. Have a good sleep.
In the middle of the night?
Yes.
So now you listen and you listen good. Have a good sleep.
