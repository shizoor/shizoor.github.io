1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,620
A beginning is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,580
Strange things began to take place.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,180
Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,440
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap, tap, tap.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,600
The Earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,600
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,760
Their soul is too controlled.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,260
Kill him!

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm the Jet.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,200
The subgenius.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Power of the Sun.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,760
You ain't gonna find him in there.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,480
And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,760
We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,520
And remember, my friends,

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,100
future events such as these will affect you in the future.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,240
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,120
That is why you are here.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,440
It was a light coming down from the sky.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,740
I don't know who or why.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,480
We've been around for, well, we've been public since 1980.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,620
That was when we printed our first pamphlet.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,460
And then the book of the subgenius came out in 1983.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,300
Now, all through the 80s, it was really just kind of a club of nerdy, over-white boys.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,560
As you might well imagine.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,700
It looked kind of like a GWAR concert.

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:47,740
But we lied and presented it as a sex cult, like the Raelians that you may have heard of.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh yeah, right, right, Rael.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,120
And then they wanted to clone themselves.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,380
Well, you know, it's like a building.

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,200
They build it and they will come.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,620
And sure enough, it turns out there are a lot of lonely mutants out there

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,040
looking for a mutant of the opposite or otherwise desired sex or species.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,200
And we started having these yearly events, which we call X-Day drills.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,860
Did you know the world ends July 5th?

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,940
No, I did not know that.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,860
Yeah, Bob predicted a long time ago that the world ends on July 5th, 1998.

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,180
1998 at 7 a.m.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,760
98.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,480
Yeah.

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,440
Now, obviously, the conspiracy of the normal people has been fooling with calendars for who knows how long.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, this is true, yeah.

43
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,940
Just to embarrass Bob.

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,900
And it's obviously really not 1998 yet.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,940
Well, then there was the Romans that screwed it up, too.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,460
You know what I mean?

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,160
You always blame the Romans.

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah, it's a real mess.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,620
We don't really know what year this is or what planet this is, even.

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,860
But we get together at different campgrounds.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
And we have these in-house meetings.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,960
And we have these end-of-the-world drills.

53
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,620
Cool.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Every July 5th, we do what you would do if you thought the world was about to end.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,560
What does one do on a drill?

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,740
I mean, where the world ends?

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, just kind of run around screaming?

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,500
It's up to you.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,100
I mean, things you wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, I can think of a lot of things I wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,860
You know, like eat three helpings of ice cream instead of just one.

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,300
Really wild stuff like that.

63
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,820
People turning south from the freeway were startled when they saw three flies flying by.

64
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,460
Flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,640
With your ancient juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you are doing.

66
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,460
Then they attacked a town.

67
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,980
A small town, I'll admit.

68
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,140
But nevertheless, a town of people.

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,660
People who died.

70
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,280
Must be those strangers that come every night.

71
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
Those saucer-shaped lights put people uptight.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,240
Leave blue-green footprints that glow in the dark.

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,280
I hope they get home alright.

74
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,500
Aside from the church declaring war on God and trying to change all human nature,

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:15,900
which is also what every peacenik wants, I guess, is to change human nature and make us so we're not chimpanzees or even primates anymore.

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Good luck on that.

77
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,100
But actually, Bob promises the end.

78
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,640
The end of warfare for all who have become ordained subgenius ministers.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,120
On X-Day, July 5th, 1998, if the real 1998 ever gets here.

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,260
That's how big the conspiracy is.

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,020
That's how insidious it is.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,780
You think this is, what, July 29th, 2008.

83
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,120
If that's what it's supposed to be.

84
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,900
But we don't really know what year this is.

85
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,800
We don't even know what planet this is.

86
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,180
If I could tell you that Earth was switched with Mars,

87
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,800
and World War II was nothing but a diversion to hide that slight of planet trick,

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and you would laugh, some of you, if it were that funny.

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,340
But it's true.

90
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,740
That's the horrible thing about it.

91
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,260
And if you don't believe me, the evidence is in our new book, The Bobliographon.

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm sure the evidence is also in the Bible.

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,800
As far as I can tell, the evidence for...

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,760
anything is in the Bible.

95
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,140
And our books are the same way.

96
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,600
They're vague.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,620
They're full of generalizations and terrible, wrathful things.

98
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,480
Suddenly turn into peacenik, nice things.

99
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,000
And there's a lot of sex and killing.

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,460
So, you know, and what we have that the Bible doesn't...

101
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,600
pictures.

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,680
That's a selling point.

103
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,820
Our books have pictures.

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,300
You see, as Onan said, once again, see, he's my script writer,

105
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,620
God forgot to make stupidity painful.

106
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,200
We're here to change that.

107
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,520
And I have a condition known as everything hurts really bad all the time-thritis.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,100
The last time I said that at one of these,

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,800
a guy came up and gave me three Vicodin.

110
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,440
Is that guy here?

111
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,180
Yeah.

112
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,360
Anyway, we have...

113
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,180
Where is he?

114
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,800
One guy...

115
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
...bombed out, lady trouble, huh?

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Yeah, my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,900
What did you say?

118
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,240
You said my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,900
Your ex?

120
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,060
Yeah.

121
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,480
Your ex?

122
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,780
Yeah.

123
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Your ex?

124
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,580
That's it!

125
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,060
Ex Day!

126
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,940
Ex Day!

127
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,420
Ex Day!

128
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Thank you!

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,000
Ex Day!

130
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,040
Ex Day!

131
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,700
Ex Day!

132
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,460
Ex Day!

133
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,800
Hey!

134
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,660
Ah!

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,100
Ex Day...

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,580
A day to rid yourself of that extra baggage.

137
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,280
And to once again soar like a falcon to new horizons of freedom.

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,660
Abandon your intimate side and demolish your relationships with Ex Day cards.

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
Ex Day.

140
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,260
Well, that's it.

141
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
That's the new greeting card line.

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,680
Great new greeting card line.

143
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,140
This 1830th hour of slack is a good rerun from

144
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,380
2008, number 1150.

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:58,000
And everything about Ex Day still applies in 2001 except that the main party is being held in Land O'Lakes, Florida,

146
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,660
at the nudist resort of Reverend Exanthea Octo-Shroom and her dad.

147
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,600
But most of the subgeniuses probably won't be nude.

148
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,320
Most of our skins are generally unkissed by the sun's rays and would like to stay that way.

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:22,500
All information about how and when and where and how much can be found at subgenius.com under

150
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,000
events, Ex Day, etc, etc, etc.

151
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,600
Dr. Hal and I will be there and a whole bunch of much younger subgeniuses including our ringleaders,

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,100
Argus Fox and Reverend Pease.

153
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,900
Don't put off reserving a spot because the limit is 100 persons.

154
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,300
And...

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,060
And now I have something sad.

156
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,260
Another great old subgenius has boarded the saucers ahead of us.

157
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,480
Reverend Rock Roswell, human name Charles Mark B.

158
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,980
of Champaign, Illinois and radio station WEFT.

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,320
At age 60, after terrible struggles with health and insurance,

160
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,300
has gone to meet Bob and the sex goddesses

161
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,480
and Reverend Heathen and Dr. Dark and Dr. Legume and Reverend Anitrocity

162
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,940
and Chaz Smith and...

163
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,600
Oh God, the list is too long.

164
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,280
Reverend Roswell used to sponsor Hour of Slack on WEFT

165
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,800
and had his own show, Mental Vortex.

166
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,620
He was a super nice guy and very generous.

167
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,500
He jammed with us at a couple of Ex Days and he gave me

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,300
my two best professional subgeniuses.

169
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:52,740
He was a junior scientist, for real, specializing in microscopy.

170
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,780
If that's how it's pronounced.

171
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,400
It's just not fair and he will be missed.

172
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,500
Hour of Slack salutes Mark B.

173
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,840
And we'll see you on Ex Day.

174
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,460
described wisdoms

175
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:31,480
well

176
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,000
is

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,440
now

178
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
.

179
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
Since.

180
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,680
The change is gonna come

181
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,620
Here it comes

182
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,340
Every new beginning's a delicate time

183
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,660
But just like when the end comes

184
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,300
It's never very pretty

185
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
And every in-between time

186
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,100
Looks like a perfect picture

187
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,820
It seems to last forever

188
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,960
Because it's standing still

189
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,480
But oh, baby

190
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,080
The change is gonna come

191
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,040
Not just maybe

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,560
The change is gonna come

193
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,860
The change is gonna come

194
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:41,860


195
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,340
Ozone layer starts to disappear

196
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,140
The change is gonna come

197
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,180
Spaceman makes it with an alien girl

198
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,820
The change is gonna come

199
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,780
Scientists prove we were never here

200
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,460
The change is gonna come

201
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,460
The change is gonna come

202
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
Here it comes

203
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,060
The change is gonna come

204
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,020
Every new beginning's a delicate time

205
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,300
But just like when the end comes

206
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,980
It's never very pretty

207
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,020
And every in-between time

208
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,740
Looks like a perfect picture

209
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,480
It seems to last forever

210
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,600
Because it's standing still

211
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
But oh, mama

212
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,780
The change is gonna come

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,100
Psycho

214
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,760
Mama

215
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,160
The change is gonna come

216
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,540
Not every Hulu's ever gone

217
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,140
After what happened

218
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,140
To the next generation

219
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,080
And the next, and next

220
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


221
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


222
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


223
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


224
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


225
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,080


226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,740
One less story to build

227
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,060
The last ten years lemme wyne psic

228
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,760
I just don't understand.

229
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
Does that make any sense to me?

230
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,440
A change is gonna come.

231
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940
By the Attery Squash.

232
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,540
They're with Reverend Diva Schimata.

233
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,640
Praise Diva. Praise Devo.

234
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:40,600
And there's lots more of the Attery Squash at myspace.com slash the Attery Squash.

235
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,620
One more. Attery is A-T-T-E-R-Y.

236
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,740
Before that, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, sermonizing at Winterstar of 2008.

237
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,560
See residentcomet.com for more on that and Starwood coming later this summer.

238
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,460
And see subgenius.com.

239
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,900
If you want to know about X-Day.

240
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,600
We also heard more on X-Day Moronicism.

241
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,520
On Rick Barber's show on KOA Denver from last year.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,680
Praise Rick and praise Lemur, the collagi-graphiar.

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,640
How do you say that? Collagiographiest.

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
Anyway, friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1000.

245
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,220
150 devoted to the world of X-Day.

246
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,540
A world from which all normality has vanished.

247
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,440
The disappearance of humans may seem like science fiction.

248
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,280
But eventually there will come a day like this.

249
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,900
A day when people no longer walk the Earth.

250
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,540
It's no great stretch to imagine humans.

251
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,260
Disappearing from the face of the Earth.

252
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,960
Every generation has its tales of Armageddon or Apocalypse.

253
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,280
We're the first generation that could, by deliberate actions, cause its own doom.

254
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,800
Tentacles he says.

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
Tentacles from Planet X.

256
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,160
It's a lie, you know.

257
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,840
All these people do is just...

258
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,240
Lie to each other.

259
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,400
Of course it's a lie, of course it's a lie, it's lunacy.

260
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,460
From the look of it...

261
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,960
the tentacles are coming out of the beer cans.

262
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,920
Now you know how happy I can be.

263
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,580
All together now, 303-SAVE-NOMINATIVE.

264
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
85, 85, the number is 142.

265
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,140
Yeah, the monkeys.

266
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,900
They just seemed appropriate somehow.

267
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Not exactly Yeti, but close enough for jazz.

268
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,320
By the way, is it true that the subgenii are descendants of Yeti?

269
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,140
Right.

270
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:02,100
We believe that there are only two races, the human race and the subgeniuses.

271
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,160
And both come in all colors and shapes and ages and several different genders.

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,540
And furry?

273
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,480
Well, some are.

274
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,600
You know, not all of us can boast that we're full-blood Yetis.

275
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,180
In fact, almost nobody can.

276
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,380
In fact, I don't know a single one.

277
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,560
But, you know, if you look around,

278
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
at the people you work with, you'll go,

279
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,060
that person there might have a little bit of Sasquatch blood.

280
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,160
Yeah, well, I...

281
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,780
A little bit of Bigfoot there.

282
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,720
I've seen a few.

283
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,760
Especially, you know, you look at some of the Russian premieres.

284
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,880
They have that look about them.

285
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,700
Right.

286
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,900
Yeah, the unibrow look.

287
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,780
Let's go back to the telephone.

288
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,640
In Denver is Lee.

289
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,820
Lee, you're on with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,300
Good morning.

291
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,480
Good morning, Rick.

292
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,960
Reverend Stang, it's an honor.

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,120
All hail Dobbs.

294
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,060
Praise Bob.

295
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,300
All hail Bob.

296
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:54,780
You bet.

297
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,420
Well, you know, some religions have the pilgrimage.

298
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,760
Some have jihad.

299
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,660
Some have the vision quest.

300
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,220
What would you say is the highest deed one can perform to achieve universal slack?

301
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,240
Well, slack is the goal of every subgenius.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,460
The trick, though, is that slack is different to each subgenius.

303
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,760
Most religions will preach a specific form of slack

304
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,540
that's supposed to fit everyone.

305
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,280
And the conspiracy of the normal people, of course,

306
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,480
that that's the way they work.

307
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,800
So we'll tell you that you need slack

308
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,900
and that you should work your way towards it.

309
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,980
But since we don't know what slack is for you,

310
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,340
we can't be all that specific.

311
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,720
As far as a pilgrimage,

312
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,900
I would say X-Day is getting to be the yearly subgenius pilgrimage.

313
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,260
We hold the main X-Day drill,

314
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,040
and we're going to be doing it in a clothing-optional campground

315
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,360
in Amish country, in New York,

316
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,140
way out in the boonies,

317
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,820
where we can pretty much do anything we want.

318
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,680
You'll be glad to know that most people keep their clothing on.

319
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
Would this be anywhere near Jaspers Farm?

320
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,400
No, it's the other side of New York.

321
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,340
It's kind of near Erie, Pennsylvania.

322
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,080
I see.

323
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,420
And it's a pretty eerie place.

324
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,100
Sort of.

325
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,340
Sort of.

326
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:23,900
Sort of.

327
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,540
Sort of.

328
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


329
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


330
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


331
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


332
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


333
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


334
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


335
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


336
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


337
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


338
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


339
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


340
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


341
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


342
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


343
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,540


344
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,000
But, yeah, Brushwood Folklore Center is where X-Day is held.

345
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,660
And that's got to be the – people come to that from all over the world.

346
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,140
We've had people come from Germany and China.

347
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,080
It's just amazing.

348
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,700
It's kind of a mutant convention.

349
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,020
The first day is always rather awkward

350
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,480
because, you know, weirdos often are kind of shy

351
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,380
or else they talk so much.

352
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,820
They drive everybody else away.

353
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,260
So it's a little rough the first day.

354
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,640
But it's going to be quite a community.

355
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,220
Interesting.

356
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
But, yeah, it's a real cult.

357
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,220
You know, I mean, when people talk about cults,

358
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,520
the church of the subgenius is a lot bigger than many of the ones that get so much press.

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,460
You bet.

360
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,860
Maybe you do believe this.

361
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,160
Maybe they're not lies.

362
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,580
They're delusions, whatever.

363
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,440
The fact remains the evidence here is flimsy.

364
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,360
It's bordering on ludicrous.

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,200
Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

366
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,560
It's not.

367
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,460
You're not arguing a case.

368
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
You're doing nothing but damage talking the way you are.

369
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,960
And you can throw as much cow's blood around the loading dock as you want to.

370
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,420
You still haven't fooled anyone.

371
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
Leave it alone, David.

372
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,860
You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning.

373
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,040
Denial is a powerful thing.

374
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:39,700
Well, keep talking.

375
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,520
I'll have no part of it, nor would any thinking person.

376
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,980
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

377
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,780
There's no defense against the will of God.

378
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,220
There's no court of appeals in hell.

379
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,380
There's no defense here either.

380
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,140
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world.

381
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Not even if you stack it as high as you can.

382
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,660
It's still just bags of

383
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,020
Bobs.

384
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,620
Isn't it?

385
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,420
Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally to find a means of rescue are welcome

386
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,020
to join me.

387
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,860
Those who want to stack dog food, knock yourselves out.

388
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,440
And anyone who believes in George Washington is not a boss.

389
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,600
Don't take it personally if there are no colleagues.

390
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,800
No matter what happens on the show.

391
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,240
Don't take it personally.

392
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Right.

393
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,680
Like, I bought the thing where, you know, dude, trailer.

394
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,400
Thank you.

395
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,320
Don't confuse the listener with an active human.

396
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,080
But we can be merciful.

397
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,080
By asking them to do more than one thing during a plug.

398
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,360
And that is listen to the Puzzling Evidence Show.

399
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,840
And download the podcast.

400
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Be careful that Puzzling Evidence and your show have the support it needs.

401
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,200
Now, which were the real callers and who were the fake callers?

402
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:50,500


403
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,400
I am in the same room with Puzzling Evidence.

404
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,360
These shows are the same room with Puzzling Evidence.

405
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,360


406
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,360


407
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,360


408
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,960
These shows are actually lovingly collected and downloaded and podcasted.

409
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:57,960


410
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,140
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

411
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,400
If your show is an hour long.

412
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,200
I have to live with that every X Day, Puzz.

413
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,200
I've been shot at X Day.

414
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,840
Luckily, it was by my good friend, Dr. Leguim, and it had blanks in it.

415
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,360
But vary your delivery and your words.

416
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
That time, can't get.

417
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,980
Even the great X Day has a copy of the original.

418
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,240
And conversational.

419
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,480
Can I have the deity shot?

420
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm going to have the deity shot.

421
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm going to have the deity shot.

422
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:22,860


423
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:22,860


424
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:22,860


425
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:22,960
I'm going to have the deity shot.

426
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,200
I'm going to have the deity shot.

427
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,200


428
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,200


429
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,200


430
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,280
I'm going to have the deity shot.

431
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,740
Reintroduce your deity.

432
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,000
Now, remember, remember I'm deaf.

433
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,260
After each shooting, recognize your many different listening styles.

434
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,660
I can change the brain from the five satellite.

435
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,460
Call out through towns with central and lateral control mechanisms.

436
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,740
It's also about how people will believe anything.

437
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,800
Of course.

438
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,960
I mean, look at Jim Jones out in California back in the 70s.

439
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,160
Yeah.

440
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,660
I mean, look at how he was able to.

441
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:52,940
Yeah.

442
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,060
He was able to mesmerize 900 people into drinking the Kool-Aid.

443
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,160
Well, I heard about this Texas death cult that gets people to stand around waiting for

444
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,320
flying saucers every single year.

445
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,440
They think the world is going to end.

446
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,860
Now, they may be a Texas death cult, but they don't meet in Texas.

447
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,320
They actually meet in the most rural part of New York State.

448
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,100
Well, how do you know they don't meet in Texas?

449
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,900
Well, they could meet in Texas.

450
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,120
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they do.

451
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,940
Yeah.

452
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,280
And what they do, it's like the Bohemian Grove there.

453
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,940
They don't meet in Texas.

454
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,460
They don't wear clothes.

455
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah.

456
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,720
Salute Al.

457
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,980
We're talking, of course, about the Raelians, the fabulous visitors from the stars.

458
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,440
Right.

459
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,120
From Star Royale.

460
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,980
And their second goddess.

461
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,960
Everybody must get cloned.

462
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,620
Oh, yeah.

463
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,820
When you have too many and there's too many replicants replicating replicants and stuff,

464
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,620
it gets confusing.

465
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,380
No, they're the people who claimed they had cloned a human being.

466
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,780
Right.

467
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,100
And the press actually bought it.

468
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,800
For about five minutes.

469
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,200
Right.

470
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,380
And they actually got these people on the front page of various national papers.

471
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,160
It's like, wow, these reporters need to keep up with their bizarre cults better.

472
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,700
You know what I mean?

473
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Like.

474
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, nowadays, you can clone the little corporal in your basement.

475
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,620
Yes, sir.

476
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,560
Napoleon Bonaparte, one strand of hair is enough to create an entire dictator from Republican

477
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:10,980
roots.

478
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,500
I'm sorry.

479
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,300
If only.

480
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,180
If only we could clone people from their hair.

481
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:16,700
Huh?

482
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,700
Actually, the reason why the media went after that guy with the Raelians.

483
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,560
He provided too much information all at once.

484
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,360
He was out there spilling the secrets about his own faith and nobody had any reason to

485
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,580
buy into it because it was like.

486
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,760
Which is why the Church of the Subgenius is different.

487
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,520
Right.

488
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,420
We provide just enough faith for you to believe on your own what is real and what isn't.

489
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,020
Well, the thing with the applesauce duo, they used to tour together, not the same as staying

490
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,260
in.

491
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,440
We.

492
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,560
We.

493
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,660
We.

494
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,000
But they would.

495
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,420
They would come and appear long before they were, you know, the Raelian saviors and stuff

496
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,900
like that.

497
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,040
They like show up at high school and, you know, like Socrates bowling alley places and

498
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,100
stuff where people would congregate and and, you know, have this meeting.

499
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,540
And people were expected to field questions, but they would never answer.

500
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Some other person who looked real serious and scared would say.

501
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,900
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, says and then they would say what they said.

502
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,560
And that's what it was like.

503
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:16,980
Like.

504
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,540
You see? You see? You're stupid minds. Stupid. Stupid.

505
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,800
There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes.

506
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,520
Take any fire, any earthquake, any major disaster, then wonder.

507
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,040
Oh, every year there's some movie that rips off Bob.

508
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:41,980
Yep.

509
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,460
The Conspiracy uses Hollywood as a tool to distract from Bob.

510
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,640
One of the most gross examples was, you know, Bob predicted the end of the world July 5th, 1998.

511
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:58,740
Well, what movie was released July 4th, 1998, Independence Day?

512
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,920
Yes, that's all terrible.

513
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,180
To distract people from our little alien invasion.

514
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,560
And in that one, of course, the Earth men win.

515
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,240
With a computer program that the aliens can't...

516
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,640
The aliens and the subgeniuses will win, but the humans will lose.

517
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,520
So we know that.

518
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,340
Isn't that telling?

519
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,760
Isn't that telling us then that everybody who survived in Independence Day is actually either a subgenius or an alien?

520
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,060
In these, they're all mixed up.

521
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,340
In that movie, the subgenius was the drunken head who had been abducted by aliens that no one would believe.

522
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,980
And he martyred himself by flying his fighter jet up the tailpipe of the mothership.

523
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
I like these.

524
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,400
Give away the ending.

525
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,760
Yeah, well...

526
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,120
It's a little slim pickings for me.

527
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,760
I was going to go see it tomorrow.

528
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,980
Warning, spoilers.

529
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,400
Spoilers.

530
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,040
Spoiler like you are saying.

531
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,420
Movie is conspiracy propaganda.

532
00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:00,740
And, of course, the conspiracy does have its giant festival on July 4th with fireworks and depressing desert storm parades, as someone once wrote.

533
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:11,320
But the next day, subgenius day, as it were, is freedom from the conspiracy of the normals.

534
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,060
Is independence from them.

535
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,440
That's our main holiday.

536
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,420
The fifth.

537
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:17,860
The church.

538
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
Yeah, 5th of July.

539
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,920
You don't have to come to Brushwood in New York.

540
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:33,320
But if you do, you'll find that the orgies of X-Day lead up to the supreme moment of the saucer landing and boarding.

541
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,940
Now, I've been out there on that field at 7 o'clock in the morning.

542
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,360
Me too.

543
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,760
Every July 5th since 1996 when we started drilling for the end of the world.

544
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,260
There have been...

545
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,440
There have been...

546
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:46,440


547
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,580
Unexplained mystery phenomena.

548
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
It's a hellish time to be up.

549
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,040
In the sky.

550
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,860
You know, for a subgenius.

551
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,060
For me, it's a...

552
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,060
It's hard to get up.

553
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,920
It's a few hours after I go to bed.

554
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,120
Especially right there.

555
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:07,240
Well, it's a reminder to me how so many of my fellow subgeniuses have to get up at that ungodly hour six days a week.

556
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,100
So they're back there but to work and...

557
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,440
That's right.

558
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,100
So what's the fourth look like then?

559
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,120
How are you preparing?

560
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,820
How are you preparing for the fifth?

561
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,440
What are you doing?

562
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,860
We're doing the fourth.

563
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,320
We do all the things that you would do if you thought it was the last day of your life.

564
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,800
Sweet.

565
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,900
Lots of sex and alcohol.

566
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,960
See, we don't celebrate July 4th out there at all.

567
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,540
We are separated from planet America.

568
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,160
And we're out that...

569
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,500
We don't even hear the distant pop of fireworks.

570
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,180
That's one thing to do.

571
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,920
We have...

572
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,880
We might have fireworks of our own, but that's a different matter.

573
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,660
And they wouldn't be let off at that particular time.

574
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,740
Actually, Hal.

575
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:56,480
Well, Rushwood has outlawed firework use by subgeniuses on their campground because we overdid it for so many years.

576
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:08,640
The Amish farmers were having trouble with their horses kicking down the stables because of the subgenius fireworks being so loud and violent.

577
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,500
You're just alerting the masses that the truth is now.

578
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,460
It's the fifth.

579
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,320
It's the fifth, damn it.

580
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,080
The fourth is over.

581
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,520
We've been trying.

582
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,080
We've been at it for 25 years now.

583
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,980
Well, no.

584
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,420
27 years now since the Subgenius Foundation first went public.

585
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,960
Trying to spread the word of slack, the truth of J.R. Bob Dobbs, and warnings about the conspiracy.

586
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,600
And every...

587
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,360
You know, if one...

588
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,120
One soul is saved by this broadcast tonight and this whole trip...

589
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,660
This whole church was...

590
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,120
Worth it.

591
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,280
If one soul is saved, that 27 years is justified.

592
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,100
Justified, my friend.

593
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,360
Call in now and Pastor Stang will relieve your woes.

594
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,400
Just give us a jingle.

595
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,200
We can't promise we'll relieve your woes, but we can change your woes.

596
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,640
Now is the time.

597
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,200
Save yourselves.

598
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,900
Wow, where the hell did you find those?

599
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,320
Oh, hell...

600
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,660
Mission Control, this is Mars 295, ready for departure.

601
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,760
Uh, Earth.

602
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,460
The planet Earth.

603
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,960
Roger, countdown is going.

604
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,900
T-minus 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

605
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,500
You...

606
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,060
Wow, that's awesome.

607
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,360
Tell continues.

608
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,600
But it ain't before in the next 30 seconds, fool.

609
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,080


610
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,960
No, hold on, that's nothing to do.

611
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,440
Bastard.

612
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,280
Since you yoked out.

613
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,540
That's OK.

614
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:14,660
Then there was some spectators that had new ideas.

615
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,720
Probably these were the ones that needed the great support.

616
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:15,720


617
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:15,720


618
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:15,720


619
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,320
Are you thinking of your Gotham that you made?

620
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,840
This was a fortune that you made from the monkey

621
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,740
This province has come to the age

622
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,160
That it acts, marks the spot

623
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,100
That it acts, marks the spot

624
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,020
So I'm ditching and hitching the ride

625
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,900
I got my seat, you got

626
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,500
Here's my new room, you know

627
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,040
To window, 10,000, 600 years

628
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,640
It's not too long ago

629
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,600
That I could knock it on heaven's door

630
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,780
That it acts, marks the spot

631
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,760
That it acts, marks the spot

632
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,840
That it acts, marks the spot

633
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,520
That it acts, marks the spot

634
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,140
Walk through the gate

635
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,040
Welcome the creature you made

636
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,980
Embrace your discovery

637
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
You took your pictures of clay

638
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,660
To made us raiders and daze

639
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,500
And then you threw us away

640
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,520
Now you scam the face

641
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
And simply count the days

642
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,220
Until you squeeze my bum

643
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,360
And blow us away

644
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,880
And then you'll see

645
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,040
How much more time

646
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,540
Blast the power of the west

647
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,700
As we die

648
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:03,740
Way, way, way

649
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,760
Way, way, way

650
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,340
If I was useless

651
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,400
I wouldn't know

652
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,620
Asked to find

653
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,560
You

654
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,920
There is a taste to feel

655
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,720
War,어주udes

656
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
Hair, fur she won't

657
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,880
Can you let's go

658
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,000
。

659
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:52,300
Dr. Steel did that.

660
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,840
And friends, a song called The Planet X Marks the Spot.

661
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,900
And you might want to check out Dr. Steel's cool website.

662
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,860
There are some amazing videos and, yes, lectures on there, along with music and toys.

663
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,420
And that's at drsteel.com.

664
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,840
Steel, S-T-E-L.

665
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,260
drsteel.com for an amazing experience.

666
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,580
And before that, we heard Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, and Lloyd Mongoloid,

667
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,240
and yours truly, on John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio in San Francisco,

668
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,560
A Season in Hell.

669
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,440
And before that, Radio Synesthesia from beautiful WCSB Cleveland

670
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,900
with Dr. Sinister, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Governor Rocknar, and others, I think.

671
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,360
Before that, some Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

672
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,860
More from that can be had at kpfa.org

673
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,260
or see quiveringbrain.com,

674
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,880
which is the website.

675
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,580
And now, a special thanks to Dr. Philo Drummond himself,

676
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,360
the co-sub-founder of the Subgenius Foundation.

677
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,900
And now, my description of X Day,

678
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,600
as delivered to the young pagans at Brushwood,

679
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,080
who made me forget which pagan festival I was at.

680
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,840
First off, something I forgot to say.

681
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,040
Thank you all for coming to Starwood,

682
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,360
and thank all of you who were our Winner's Star.

683
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,200
Thank you for coming to Winner's Star.

684
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,080
There's a reason I mixed up like this, believe me.

685
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,220
And it's because of you.

686
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,860
Because of Winner's Star and Starwood.

687
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,620
And Burning Star and Woodman and so forth.

688
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,320
Now I can't even remember.

689
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,060
Oh, yeah, so I was leading up to X Day.

690
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,600
That's our Subgenius event.

691
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,400
It's a couple of weeks before Starwood at the same place, out at Brushwood.

692
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,720
Every year, we hope that maybe this year it'll be 1998,

693
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,840
and this will be the year that the saucers show up.

694
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,200
And I hope that we'll be able to do that.

695
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,060
And rupture all the subdues paying subgeniuses

696
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,420
into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

697
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:08,940
where we have eternal slack and whatever we want forever,

698
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,000
and get to punish everybody we ever didn't like.

699
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,680
Which unfortunately, in most cases, I'm afraid,

700
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,500
is going to be our fellow subgeniuses.

701
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,580
So it will truly be a war in heaven at that point.

702
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,160
But somebody else pointed out that, regarding X Day,

703
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,760
that an X, after all, is just a cross that's been knocked over.

704
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Not to be.

705
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,540
Now, we don't have anything to believe in.

706
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,740
We've got nothing against Jesus.

707
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,980
Jesus is just all right with me.

708
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,560
It's always been his fan club that gave us,

709
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,780
and not just his fan club, all those other guys, Buddhist fan club.

710
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,480
Oh, I've got less ego than anybody here.

711
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,500
You know, you can't get away from it.

712
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,900
It's fundamentalism.

713
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,900
We put the fun in fundamentalism.

714
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,380
We also put the duh in fundamentalism.

715
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,620
And we put the...

716
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,460
The hun.

717
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,400
The ism.

718
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,920
The mmm.

719
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,700
You name it.

720
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,860
We put it in the fundamentalism.

721
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,000
Over and over again.

722
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,840
Anyway, our friend Joyce Levine,

723
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,140
Reverend Joyce Levine, who couldn't be here,

724
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,940
wrote an X Day poem.

725
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,720
I don't think she's ever even been to X Day,

726
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,820
but she's been to Starwood, and so she can imagine.

727
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,700
It's just a smaller, much smaller Starwood,

728
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,020
where everybody...

729
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,500
Like a science fiction convention,

730
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,900
only they believe a different kind of science fiction.

731
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,860
Here's the poem.

732
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Bare-breasted ladies run amok.

733
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,720
Seems they came by pickup truck.

734
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,300
From towns we did not know exist.

735
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,460
It's slack time here on Mother Earth.

736
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,920
All beings celebrate your birth.

737
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,860
She gave this to me on my birthday.

738
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,140
Meteors fly across the night.

739
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,020
Cicadas sing with all their might.

740
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,040
From a lounge chair take it in

741
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,500
with a satisfied, dazzled grin.

742
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,520
I just thought that was a sweet X Day poem,

743
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,720
especially since it starts with bare-breasted ladies.

744
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,680
That always gets me.

745
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,500
You know, I waited for somebody to say, Bob.

746
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,520
X Days are coming.

747
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,000
So, can a caller call in with a credit card number

748
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,080
and become ordained right here on the air?

749
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,180
Yes, although I...

750
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,280
Man, yelling your credit card and expiration date

751
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,800
over a public airway.

752
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,960
Well, we'll max it out before anyone else can.

753
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:47,500
We're ready.

754
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,040
No, that's okay.

755
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,340
No, we're fine.

756
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,260
We're gonna cry.

757
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,160
We won't even know what hit us.

758
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,980
I hear King of Slash Bill T. Miller in the background

759
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,540
singing one of his X Day songs.

760
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,900
We have a whole CD collection of songs about X Day.

761
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,400
Like 30 different songs in every style imaginable.

762
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,460
I wrote one.

763
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,320
How do we find them? How do we get them?

764
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,280
Subgenius.com!

765
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,100
Subgenius.com is the global channel.

766
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,400
We're here to help.

767
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,500
Rob at the master moral controls.

768
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,520
Thank heaven for that.

769
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,780
X Days are coming!

770
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,460
We don't actually sell many CDs,

771
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,920
and it may be because we give away

772
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,140
so much of the truth on the internet.

773
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,500
You can download the Subgenius Hour of Slack weekly show.

774
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,120
In fact, that's probably what you did to hear this.

775
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,340
Time to think about it.

776
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,440
Yes.

777
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,960
You can download the Puzzling Evidence show.

778
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,060
From Berklee, you can download the Suzie the Floozy show.

779
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,480
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from WREK.org in Atlanta.

780
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,120
On Puzzling Evidence, you'll be interested to know that one X Day morn,

781
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,440
when the rest of us were up at Brushwood,

782
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,120
some subgenius in Dallas went to Dealey Plaza.

783
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,900
It was in the late 90s, July 5th at 7 a.m.

784
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,040
And there was a nude woman frolicking around

785
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,620
on the grassy knoll area.

786
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,340
Very briefly.

787
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,700
They even got a photograph of her.

788
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,060
They were just three nerds.

789
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,500
X Day, let's go to Dealey Plaza.

790
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,600
Oh my God, there's a sex goddess running around over there.

791
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,020
Maybe this is X Day.

792
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,640
Yeah.

793
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,840
So they followed her to the ship, I hope.

794
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,440
That's the kind of thing you see in Los Angeles at dawn all the time.

795
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,660
And in fact, the last time I was there, that's what I saw.

796
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,040
Several naked women stumbling around the streets.

797
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,580
Well, little callers, I don't know if you understand that if a bomb dropped on Berklee right now,

798
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,680
the top of the subgenius church would just disappear.

799
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,660
And finally, it would start making some money.

800
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,640
Okay, here's the money raining down from the sky.

801
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,980
This is space money.

802
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,800
Look how pretty it is.

803
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Oh, sorry.

804
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,400
See it twinkle and sparkle?

805
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,560
But it's...

806
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,780
More, more, more!

807
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,160
Toxic to handle.

808
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,800
That's never enough.

809
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,460
What?

810
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,860
I can't hold my money?

811
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,020
That's never enough.

812
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,780
It'll burn right through.

813
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,300
Ow!

814
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,780
Not the...

815
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,640
The ultimate X Day nightmare.

816
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,540
The tribulation money rains from the sky and it's made of acid that burns through your skin.

817
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,740
Or a spaceship.

818
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,840
People are so desperate that they grab it anyway.

819
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,420
Oh, my God.

820
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,360
Oh, my God.

821
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,620
Oh, my God.

822
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,080
Oh, my God.

823
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080


824
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080


825
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080


826
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080


827
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,080


828
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,440
I can't hear.

829
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,160
I can't play.

830
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,660
I drink a beer and then it burns through my hair.

831
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,060
There you go.

832
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,620
Take a drop.

833
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,180
Give us a do.

834
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,460
Let's go down here to the subgenius bar.

835
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,320
You can call it...

836
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,960
Five minutes ago.

837
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,240
I don't see...

838
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,760
Oh, it's a dueling recording device.

839
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,540
Try this on your piano.

840
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,640
I just reversed that phone number, folks.

841
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,560
You reversed the charge?

842
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,140
You want to know what the number really is?

843
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,860
There you go.

844
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,620
Hey!

845
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,620


846
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,620


847
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,900
What's happening?

848
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,340
You got a problem?

849
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,540
Sounds like a bunch of malarkey to me.

850
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,160
Oh, that was a good show.

851
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,180
Camp Malarkey is right over there.

852
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,560
What are they having a malarkey show?

853
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,540
Is he still on the air here?

854
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,240
The bunch of malarkey show?

855
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,120
No, I...

856
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,480
You took over that slot.

857
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,020
Yeah, I've been a long time since those...

858
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,660
The country of Kroistan...

859
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,020
Conan!

860
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,960
What is best in life?

861
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,600
To crush your enemies?

862
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:50,780
Enemies?

863
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,620
See them driven before you?

864
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,760
And hear the lamentation of the women?

865
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,760
That is it!

866
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,000
At X-Day, of course, we have symbolic auctions

867
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,680
where we enact this ritual among ourselves,

868
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,200
the inner subgeniuses.

869
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:10,120
But that is an overt form of the ordinary progress of sales

870
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:16,020
which has to be made as part of the existing subgenius journey.

871
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,580
There are actual flesh auctions

872
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,780
at X-Day.

873
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,200
Yes.

874
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,600
And auctions of all kinds of bulldata,

875
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,320
kitsch...

876
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,800
Great stuff.

877
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah.

878
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,780
Complete Jack Chick comic collections.

879
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,260
By the way, did you all know that

880
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,100
there is a book about Jack Chick comics?

881
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,180
By Kurt Kursteiner.

882
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,520
Right.

883
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,920
By subgenius...

884
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,420
Nazi subgenius.

885
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,540
And Papa Joe Mama.

886
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,360
Yes.

887
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,580
They infiltrated Jack Chick's headquarters,

888
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,380
got to know Jack Chick himself.

889
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,600
They went to the war room where the comics are created.

890
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,140
Where is that?

891
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,420
In Chino, California.

892
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,840
And in fact, Jack Chick promised our friends

893
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,880
that he would get around to doing an anti-subgenius pamphlet

894
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,580
as soon as he finishes his huge life's work that he's still on.

895
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,080
He's like 90 years old.

896
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,260
What's the work he's working on?

897
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,820
Paintings illustrating the Bible.

898
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,860
He had a movie that they were working on,

899
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,080
which is essentially kinesthesis,

900
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,240
but it had to do with huge paintings

901
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,420
created by the good artist who works at Chick things,

902
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,520
who's a black guy.

903
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,620
I forget his name.

904
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,460
Oh, Fred Carter.

905
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,660
That's his name.

906
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,620
He's made these giant paintings of Eve in the Garden of Eden and so on.

907
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,080
Then they've photographed them and done kinesthesis,

908
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,060
and they have a movie that's ready to go.

909
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,280
It's going to come out, or maybe it is out,

910
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,400
among the devotees of Jack Chick.

911
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,180
Oh, it is out.

912
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,880
Yeah, and you can find information about this great Jack Chick book,

913
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,100
which, by the way...

914
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,840
It's called The Unofficial Jack T. Chick.

915
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,940
That's available from monsterwax.com, I believe.

916
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,060
Monsterwax, yes.

917
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,540
Yeah.

918
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,080
I think if you do just a search on the one word monsterwax,

919
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,060
monsterwax.com,

920
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,460
you would certainly immediately get there.

921
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,120
Like candle wax, but it's monster...

922
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,700
But with monsters.

923
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,680
Monster wax.

924
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:35,040
Well, Dr. Hal, I can't wait to bring you into X-Day this next year

925
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,500
on those plane flights we always get you

926
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,660
that hover around Philadelphia for 10 hours.

927
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,560
Those clean and simple flights.

928
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,720
Yeah, Dr. Hal writes great songs when he's stuck in airports

929
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,080
and hovering in planes for hours and days.

930
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:49,840
Tis so.

931
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,800
I've got to get them all recorded or noted or something or other.

932
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,900
My problem is we've got to convince Governor Rocknar

933
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,460
to pay your way to X-Day and Amsterdam every year.

934
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,980
Going back to Amsterdam?

935
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,900
Oh, he's already planned that.

936
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,100
How about you?

937
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,860
I can't plan that sort of thing.

938
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,980
It can't be an annual plan?

939
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,900
Milo's going.

940
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,220
On my epitaph.

941
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,660
Here lies an atheist, all dressed up and no place to go.

942
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,040
That's an old chestnut.

943
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,580
How about this one?

944
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,900
Remember, man, as you walk by, as you are now, so once was I.

945
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,660
As I am now, so shall you be.

946
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,820
Remember this and follow me.

947
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,280
And on this grave you then may be.

948
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,180
On the tombstone next to it it says,

949
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,220
to follow you I'll not consent until I know which way you went.

950
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,500
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

951
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,760
Those clever.

952
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,720
Anguisters.

953
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,260
So now that the writer's strike is on,

954
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,220
you guys do the show by just queuing up pages on the Internet

955
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,380
full of funny quotes?

956
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,080
What did you do, Google funny tombstone quotes?

957
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,360
Funny epitaph.

958
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,720
Oh, that's right, epitaph, that's the word.

959
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,500
Well, are you planning anything extra special for X-Day this year?

960
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,260
Yes, the world will be destroyed by the save.

961
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:17,940
Really?

962
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,600
This X-Day?

963
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,100
This time?

964
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,320
Yes.

965
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,300
Well, some July 5th that's going to happen, and maybe this is 1998.

966
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,280
I didn't know, I didn't even do that.

967
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,040
That's right, it has to be.

968
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,400
Maybe tomorrow is July 5th, 1998.

969
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,540
Are you ready?

970
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,340
That's the big question, of course.

971
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:41,420
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along?

972
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,860
I won't do anything wrong.

973
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,060
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along?

974
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,740
For a ride.

975
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,140
Oh, yeah.

976
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:16,760
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

977
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,940
All quarantined.

978
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,540
All strapped in my suit.

979
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,100
Pressure suit's all pressured up.

980
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,200
Yeah.

981
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,280
It's here.

982
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,520
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

983
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,340
Waiting for the moment.

984
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,340
The final countdown.

985
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,960
And that's where we're at.

986
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,820
Just hours away from...

987
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,900
The final hour.

988
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,180
The final minute.

989
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,960
The final second.

990
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,080
And...

991
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,520
X day.

992
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,940
Thought I'd never get here.

993
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,040
It's kind of late now.

994
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,740
We're there.

995
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,680
There's nothing else to do.

996
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,060
Just sit, look out the window.

997
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,640
And wait for the light.

998
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:36,600
And wait for the light.

999
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,460
Is your pleasure ship hovering above?

1000
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,440
Waiting for the final hours to pass.

1001
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:59,820
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia Blue?

1002
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,600
Mine is.

1003
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,040
We'll see you.

1004
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,660
Goodbye, Mom.

1005
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,800
Goodbye, Dad.

1006
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,120
I gotta go into space.

1007
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,800
One, two.

1008
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,660
Hey, Bliko.

1009
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:31,800
Chaz and I have been planning which reruns we're going to run since there's only another week of broadcasting left on the planet.

1010
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,560
Oh, God.

1011
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,180
I've done 638 hours of slash.

1012
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,520
Done to a few hours now.

1013
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,860
We're going to start rerunning number one.

1014
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean, for what radio stations are left.

1015
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:43,740
Right.

1016
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,120
And what were you thinking of doing, Chaz?

1017
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,760
Are you just going to run reruns?

1018
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,820
Like, what's your first show after you leave?

1019
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,940
Well, I was planning.

1020
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Or are you just going to blow it off?

1021
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,200
No, no, no.

1022
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,160
No, no, no.

1023
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,280
No, no, no.

1024
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:07,500
I was under some understanding that they were going to install some black box in the studio here.

1025
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,100
I don't know what the technology of this really is.

1026
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,160
Like I say, I don't understand how a lot of this is going to take place.

1027
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,200
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

1028
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,040
I just know that.

1029
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,900
Yeah.

1030
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah.

1031
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1032
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1033
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1034
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1035
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1036
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1037
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1038
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1039
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1040
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,060


1041
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,340
Don't fail because of me.

1042
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,760
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1043
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,780
We all are in this together as a team effort.

1044
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,040
We're going to make it work.

1045
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,220
And I don't know how to make it work.

1046
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,960
I don't know how to do most of this mission.

1047
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,460
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is going to work.

1048
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,140
And you won't fail because of me.

1049
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,700
Hello, world.

1050
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,560
Hello, world.

1051
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,840
Chaz here.

1052
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:59,060
ESO Radio broadcasting live from the pleasure ships.

1053
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,080
Oh, yeah.

1054
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,620
Where are you going to go?

1055
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,380
Where are you going to go?

1056
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,240
When the sex goddesses come for you.

1057
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,420
I'm going to go to the place that's the best.

1058
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,900
When the land of the damned is at high.

1059
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,400
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

1060
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,720
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

1061
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,520
It's better than the gold when I die.

1062
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,420
When I die and the land of the best.

1063
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,820
I'm going to go to the place that's the best.

1064
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,940
And it's so beautiful from out here.

1065
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,080
It's so pretty.

1066
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,120
The earth.

1067
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,200
It's just that little blue and white.

1068
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,320
Little marble hanging there.

1069
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,500
Gosh.

1070
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,180
That's where it all began.

1071
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,680
We'll see you.

1072
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,760
Goodbye.

1073
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,800
Prepare yourself.

1074
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,300
You know it's a must.

1075
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,160
You've got to have a friend in Jesus.

1076
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,400
Friend in Bob.

1077
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,560
So you know that when you die.

1078
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,860
Bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky.

1079
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,260
Bye.

1080
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,060
Bye.

1081
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1082
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1083
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1084
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1085
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1086
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1087
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1088
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1089
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1090
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1091
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1092
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1093
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1094
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1095
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1096
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1097
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1098
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1099
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1100
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,060


1101
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,860
Bye.

1102
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,060
Bye.

1103
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1104
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1105
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1106
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1107
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1108
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1109
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1110
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1111
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1112
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,060


1113
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,580
Failure is not an option.

1114
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,800
Failure is not an option.

1115
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,440
Failure is not an option.

1116
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:35,940


1117
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,600
I've been going further and further backwards in my career as I get better at what I do.

1118
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:48,680
Well, at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio.

1119
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,500
bleep oh there are those of us that i would say major disappointment might be the word used but

1120
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,740
he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair i mean i don't know if his voice is

1121
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,480
getting higher because of the operation or there was major disappointment and there was general

1122
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,140
electric oh there i i thought you were going to refer to the guy's erection again and then there

1123
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:19,620
was that girl bob bob just like a penguin in bondage boy no on x day negi will return to us all

1124
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:26,380
the greatest tapes that we ever recorded which he has been keeping it praise the negi oh god that's

1125
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:33,440
so good negi has been keeping all of our lost recordings in a special uh fault

1126
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,920
will all be returned to us on x day oh that's so glorious

1127
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,120
you

1128
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:45,800
will get his his eight millimeter films back oh you know your first show will come back i'll

1129
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,840
uh actually i never did lose anything will i get those videos that i erased by accident back

1130
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,880
as long as you saw them bill things that i mean um everything i've ever seen you know that you

1131
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,160
never got around to looking at uh-huh even if i've only seen it for a fraction of a second

1132
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,880
were taped

1133
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,800
you thought

1134
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,440
that you imagined very vividly doing i'm getting will then be done

1135
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,420
they will have been done when you want to do a wonderful new show

1136
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,420
that show will materialize in your hand

1137
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,120
program

1138
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,780
escape

1139
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,500
escaping from my

1140
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,120
my

1141
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,620
my

1142
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,360
my

1143
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:37,360


1144
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:37,780
my

1145
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:37,780


1146
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:37,780


1147
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:44,800
Chaz are gripping, but they're slipping, and they're dripping, but I'm dripping.

1148
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,220
Tripping.

1149
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,720
Tripping indeed, friends.

1150
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,060
The late Chaz Smith, or maybe we should say the early Professor Chaz Smith,

1151
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,860
because he ended up boarding the escape vessels early ahead of the rest of us.

1152
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,820
He edited all that, taken from his ESO radio shows on WCSB Cleveland,

1153
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:10,560
and I think most of that was from the conspiracy year 1998.

1154
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,280
Con version, anyway.

1155
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,140
Obviously not the real X-Day.

1156
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:20,760
The background music, what you're hearing now, is by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1157
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,620
This has been Hour of Slack, number 1150.

1158
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,060
Praise Bob, and praise K-Rob.

1159
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:35,720
And now, friends, let us go back to the end of the end of 2007's season.

1160
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,680
In hell.

1161
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,740
They said we were going to go to hell.

1162
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,600
What choice did we have but to start our own religion?

1163
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:49,320
And our own hell, which is going to be far more comfortable than the one so often described.

1164
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,600
It's been more than a season in hell.

1165
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,800
It hasn't been so bad, has it, for the past four hours?

1166
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,260
It's gone rather fast, actually, as the show seems to do.

1167
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,020
What's your game, Bob?

1168
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,360
Next week, I'm actually having chiropractors on.

1169
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,360
Why?

1170
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,460
And they're all going to adjust me.

1171
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,260
They'll give you a hands-on...

1172
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,500
Well, you better have a couple of body mics so they can hear that cracking of the spars and timbers.

1173
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,200
That's the idea.

1174
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,860
Ship at sea in a storm.

1175
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,600
Get some contact mics going in.

1176
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,020
I think that'd be a great idea.

1177
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,080
You have to follow that up with acupuncturists.

1178
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,100
Yes, yes.

1179
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,680
There you have the sound effect of the whistle of escaping gas.

1180
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,520
Essence, as the tiny needles.

1181
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,240
What a sensation.

1182
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,220
You'd have to have a pretty sensitive mic for that, wouldn't you?

1183
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,040
It's a special effect.

1184
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,600
Just to pipe in the sound effect.

1185
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,800
Last X-Day, remember, we were doing radio from on stage outdoors at this campground.

1186
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,260
A spider suddenly was crawling across Dr. Howell's microphone.

1187
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:53,220
Yes.

1188
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,680
And we were able to turn it up enough that you could hear his tiny footsteps across the...

1189
00:56:59,300 --> 00:56:59,840
Fascinating.

1190
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,440
Those mics are sensitive.

1191
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,020
And it was an exceptional...

1192
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,700
Extremely large and clumsy spider.

1193
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,700
A club-footed thing.

1194
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,140
Our final minutes.

1195
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,000
No, no.

1196
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,560
Thank you.

1197
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,560
Spiders on microphones here at Pirate Cat Radio.

1198
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,120
We're harmed during the making of this radio motion picture.

1199
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,120
I'd like to thank Reverend Ivan Stang for coming in this evening.

1200
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,120
Say thank you, Stang.

1201
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,300
Dr. Howell for coming down on a night off.

1202
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,920
You're too kind.

1203
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,060
You're too kind.

1204
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,060


1205
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,060


1206
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,060


1207
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,060


1208
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,060


1209
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:39,140
Lloyd Mongaloid for stepping in two weeks in a row after a very, very busy show on Saturday night.

1210
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,760
I'm going to be here every week.

1211
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,140
Perfect.

1212
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,880
I didn't explain that to you.

1213
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,480
We'll make sure you get adjusted as well next week.

1214
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,140
Puzzling evidence.

1215
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,000
Documenting the entire evening.

1216
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,760
K-Rob on the aural stimulants.

1217
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,220
And we've got about two more minutes.

1218
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,860
Two more minutes.

1219
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,080
Literally forced us off the air.

1220
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:10,980
Well, I hope the subgenius presentation you've heard tonight hasn't been confusing or off-putting.

1221
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:17,900
Remember, we're always trying to improve our presentation for you and your comfort.

1222
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,720
What do you see in the upcoming year for the church?

1223
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:33,060
Well, various hagiographical contributions, canonizations, ascension to higher planes of being and feeling.

1224
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,280
And, of course, money flowing in like a tidal wave.

1225
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,100
You think this X-Day might be the X-Day?

1226
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,480
Well, we always feel that.

1227
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,960
Playing at X-Day?

1228
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,300
Ooh.

1229
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,940
You got 30 seconds to answer.

1230
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,160
Go.

1231
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:51,760
Yeah.

1232
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,400
Well, I guess it'll be the last show.

1233
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,240
Last show.

1234
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,000
You'll have to wait.

1235
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,160
Last show on Planet Earth.

1236
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,840
We'll be there to greet the sex guys.

1237
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,440
Thanks for tuning in, ladies and gentlemen.

1238
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,800
A season hell with John Hell.

1239
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,560
See you next week.

1240
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,900
Reverend Ivan Steng, Dr. Hal Lloyd, Monga Lloyd, Buzzing Evidence, KROB.

1241
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,600
Thanks, KROB.

1242
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:22,680
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely, I reach over and touch it.

1243
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,460
Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

1244
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,120


1245
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:26,120
