1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,160
Are we in a movie?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,020
Everything's a movie.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,780
Talking pictures.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,900
That's all it is.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,300
Walking pictures.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:16,700
Huh?

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,940
Cheesy dreams.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,060
While Huckleberry Finn goes fishing on the edge of the moon.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,560
Who's Ben Johnson?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,460
He's in The Last Picture Show.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,000
Just like us.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,160
Don't move, my love.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Be still.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,980
Be real.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,100
He's gone.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,500
Tuesday, 2018 o'clock.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,400
Resuming work.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,160
As a result of stripping skin off the skull,

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,920
keeping clean and keeping at the required temperature,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,120
the bones have become crystalline.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,240
I may now begin reconstruction of the physiognomy whenever I please.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,900
In the ancient folk legends, tales are told of blood-sucking vampires.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,160
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever-living monstrosities?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,020
Worse than the vampires of legend?

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,060
Such questions, mate.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,760
I seem fanciful.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,920
But at this very moment, scientists are working on the answer to brain transplantation.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,980
And human bodies are used.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,040
This girl was buried in a nearby cemetery yesterday.

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,280
Only a few hours ago, her body was stolen.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,860
And brought to this hidden laboratory.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,500
He has grafted a living animal's brain into this newly dead body.

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,040
The brain cells are being reactivated by

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,740
The subgenius.

35
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,460
Our.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,860
The subgenius.

37
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,540
Mother machines are the blind.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,560


39
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,180
The eyes are the victim.

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
The eyes are the Protector.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,720
in this endeavor.

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,660
Let me sow to the bottom this pit.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,740
Bind the fallen ones.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,660
Bind the fallen angels.

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,200
Let them be bound by the power of the Lord's host in this hour.

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,420
Bind the fallen angels.

47
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,180
Bind the fallen angels.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
T-E-R-W-I-L-L.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Illicor.

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,480
However, sure, you'll pay in other ways.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,240
For instance, the number of brain cells that you have to kill just to take enough pills

52
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,620
to be able to bear this show in the middle of the night.

53
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,860
Why, that in itself is quite expensive.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,740
That bear is repeating.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,860
Yes, well, most people are lucky they don't have to listen to this thing every night,

56
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,740
like Uberbrow.

57
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,160
Day in, day out.

58
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,940
That poor boy not only has to listen to it every night,

59
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,120
he has to broadcast it every night.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,980
From his secret cubicle, hundreds of miles under solid rock.

61
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,680
Weird, weird, weird, weird, weird, yes.

62
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,800
The little brow is so weird.

63
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,900
And yet, they kept on.

64
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,560
Nobody knew why.

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
I love Little Uber.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,800
His brow is so weird.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,740
And if he won't pinch me, I'll hide in his beard.

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,020
I hid under his stool to look at his feet.

69
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,820
Right.

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,760
I could not get out.

71
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,760
Or I'd fail upon the seat.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,860
The implied adventure that the doctors had in their voices.

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,560
They knew something spooky and scary was about to happen.

74
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, that wasn't it.

75
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,400
Not even the baby breaking out of my little glass brain.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,500
Yes, the little babies were hard to find in the morning

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,420
because the U-Haul trucks would come and take them away.

78
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,760
Their little china bodies lay shattered on the midden heaps.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,340
And they were filled with little nylon things and little spooky eyes.

80
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,680
They came in little boxes and the people fought and kicked and prayed and shot to get one.

81
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,460
But there was nothing they could do.

82
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,260
But be scared, of course.

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,660
And being scared in Berkeley is sort of a way of life.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,000
Just ask the new revitalized 53rd Street Winos Association.

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,960
Really?

86
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,960
Being terrorized is something you'll be watching now as we sternutate our way to madness.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,020
Where's Billy?

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:22,840
Where's Billy?

89
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


90
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


91
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


92
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:22,840


101
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,620
Just give me what's in that bag right now.

102
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,820
You're on the only show brave enough to bring the facts to you.

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
These are coffee winos.

104
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,100
They don't drink alcohol.

105
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,860
They drink more and more advanced grades of coffee.

106
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,360
Yes, Doctor, we call them coffeenos.

107
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,180
This old coffeeno here is holding what looks like a can of Colombian ground coffee.

108
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,340
Oh, fuck, I have coffee!

109
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,900
I can't wait for you to do something with it.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,880
I know you just spent it on coffee.

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,760
Where's the sugar, please?

112
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,100
I'm going to finally see the truth.

113
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,560
Those who wouldn't say please, they were forced to take other forms of entertainment.

114
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,520
And to perform humiliating jests and actions and act.

115
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,600
At weird hours of the morning.

116
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
It's been there, yes.

117
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,660
Little tiny doctors.

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
My mind.

119
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,680
Okay, now what are my instructions?

120
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
What was I going to do?

121
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,160
I always have to look up what it says in the program, but I don't know what it is.

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,200
I said I was going to...

123
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,520
Adventures in sickening.

124
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,860
Subgenius preachers are skilled at both healings and sickenings, although they're not necessarily performed in that order.

125
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,620
Reverend Stang...

126
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,780
Oh, so this is what I'm going to do.

127
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,080
Reverend Stang will explain various Dobbs-approved techniques, such as transferal of pain,

128
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,460
the laying on of sledgehammers,

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,960
acubating,

130
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,980
frame-straightening,

131
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,600
blemish readings,

132
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,020
and most importantly,

133
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,880
excremeditation.

134
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,920
He will also take questions from the audience and has interesting proctology slides if anyone wants to see them.

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,780
Well, that's...

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm done.

137
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
That was all the gags.

138
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,520
I put them all in that one.

139
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,460
So I shot my load, I'd say.

140
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,200
Okay, no, really the subject is...

141
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
Slack, Muzak, and...

142
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
Transformative Embarrassment,

143
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
Courtesy of Chickenhead,

144
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,260
Praise Chickenhead.

145
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,560
Oh no, these are the wrong cult.

146
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,280
These are notes for the wrong cult. I'm sorry about that.

147
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,960
Oh, here it is.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,340
Church of the Subgenius.

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,040
That's the right cult, friends.

150
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,940
And this is its right show, as proven by the fact that it exploits all the other subgenius shows.

151
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,860
There have been so many of those lately that we can categorize them into sections.

152
00:07:50,860 --> 00:08:02,520
For instance, this episode of Hour of Slack features the category of drugs, and especially the drug coffee, our last completely legal one for now.

153
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,400
We have been and will continue to hear collages by Fernanda Nani-Lemur,

154
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,660
my sermon at Winterstar Symposium,

155
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,040
the amino acids, as heard in the background,

156
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,240
puzzling evidence shows from Berkeley, both very old and very new,

157
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,840
with Philo, Gary, Doug, and Hal, and K-Rob, and...

158
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,660
John Hell.

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,420
But those are from John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio.

160
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,860
So remember, all Pirate Cat Radio shows are archived for six weeks at piratecatradio.com,

161
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,260
so you can hear this here, here.

162
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,100
You may already be listening to this here, here.

163
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
What is the proper name of the show?

164
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460
A Season in Hell.

165
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,220
A Season in Hell.

166
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,520
So you just go to the DJ schedule, scroll down, click on it,

167
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,000
and there's the date you listen to the show.

168
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,940
And what do you know?

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,180
Can you podcast it? That's what I was like...

170
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,820
Sure, we pod... I throw my...

171
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:50,820


172
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,700
Everybody except me, Tom. That's what I do.

173
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,320
Hold on, we're gonna isolate you... now.

174
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,060
Isolation chamber.

175
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,900
That's my kind of show. Just me, Jim, all the time.

176
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,240
I hear lunch in Carolina.

177
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,300
That's all we're gonna hear.

178
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,660
You can put this show up if you want to as well.

179
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720
I just told the listeners that that's what I have.

180
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,480
Yeah, right, right. So it's already there.

181
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,040
Sorry, it was the other three conversations that I was listening to at the time.

182
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,300
Preserves in the basement.

183
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,240
Preserve the show for the winter.

184
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,720
In the jar.

185
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,980
With the brown bread and the baked beans.

186
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,500
Goes in the jar with the stuff.

187
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,560
Don't look too closely at that jar and its contents.

188
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,940
Don't think about that.

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,360
Is that an eyeball?

190
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,040
It's an eyebrow.

191
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,080
Some hair?

192
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,560
Is that back to what you were talking about, the jar in the bathroom?

193
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,460
The jar.

194
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,800
Jar of Jenkum. Jenkum jar.

195
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,560
Yeah, uh, Super Jenkum Hayes was the winner at the Frop Cup in Amsterdam.

196
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,660
What about G13 Hayes? Was that the same thing?

197
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,700
That was the marijuana in the...

198
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,500
The cannabis cup.

199
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,020
Ah, I see.

200
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,000
The jank... They didn't have a Jenkum category at the cannabis cup.

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,260
Is Jenkum still available here? Can you still get Jenkum over the counter?

202
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,200
You can make it yourself, Daddy.

203
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,400
That's about it. Well, now we can get Absinthe over the counter again.

204
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,760
Makes the hard-kill funds.

205
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:05,980
You can?

206
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,680
It was just a...

207
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,200
What?

208
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
It was made legal again last week.

209
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,480
They made it legal.

210
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,840
Nationally or just...

211
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,580
Nationally. It is a legal alcoholic beverage.

212
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,700
The official beverage of Learning Man is legal.

213
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,580
The store's closed.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,680
At 2 p.m. on the 5th.

215
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:19,680


216
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:19,920
2.

217
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,920
We all got two hours to show that.

218
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,860
Oh, yeah. There's my... I got the sugar cubes.

219
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,700
I've been known to chase the...

220
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,400
A CD, yeah.

221
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:27,800
Oh.

222
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,100
Davy, Davy Crockett, the king of beer.

223
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,880
Born on a bar when he was only three.

224
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Davy, Davy Crockett, the king of beer.

225
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,800
He went off to Congress and served a spell.

226
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,680
Davy, Davy Crockett, serving his...

227
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:49,680


228
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,900
This country here.

229
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,340
Smoke don only the person where you knew shutcher.

230
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:57,760
baptized him in the cup of prison.

231
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,680
He must know who...

232
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
you talk a lot when you get drunk.

233
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,500
You talk a lot when you get drunk.

234
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,500


235
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,020
You only get drunk with one person.

236
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,380
You only get drunk with one person.

237
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,440
Huh?

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
You mean...

239
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,360
You mean Bob?

240
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:07,860
Yeah.

241
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Where that low-down snake?

242
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,360
And him pretending to be my friend.

243
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,980
Tending to be my friend.

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,480
But we do have the... the theme of this.

245
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,680
whole show here is healing and so forth and we've already sickened you. I had a couple of things

246
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,760
that have been of interest to me. I read a newspaper article a couple of months ago

247
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,560
explaining that some folks at Case Western University in Cleveland had created some

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,180
Franken-mice. You know, the human genome has been mapped. That's pretty complicated.

249
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,000
They actually finished the job pretty much and although it's against the law to do

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,540
Franken-humans yet, well we'll get to that, but these little mice that they had created in this

251
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:07,900
lab or had tweaked, you might say, that they were like way more aggressive than normal mice.

252
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:16,840
They also lived like twice as long and could keep reproducing for twice as long as normal mice.

253
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,160
And so I think that's a really good point. I think that's a really good point.

254
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,220
And they fought constantly. One of the women who had been working with them said that when

255
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,980
she knew they were different, because whenever he lifted the lid off their cage it was like a

256
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,680
popcorn, lifting a lid off of popping popcorn. They were just going mad.

257
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,940
And so, you know, we've all heard about the Franken-corn and so forth. I mean, that's being

258
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,440
done. You can actually create new species now and also trademark them.

259
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,640
You can create a bundle of cells that'll just sit there and generate something useful like

260
00:12:52,640 --> 00:13:00,000
medicine or drugs, but you can trademark it. Of course, this brings to mind what so many

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,100
sci-fi movies and TV shows have already covered. The Franken-soldiers, right? Franken-cops,

262
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:15,040
super macho, or whatever kind of person you are. You aren't just a muscle man that doesn't

263
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,140
mind doing dull work. You can create a bundle of cells that'll just sit there and generate something

264
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,800
useful. You can create those. Aldous Huxley had it all down with Brave New World. Our grandparents

265
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:30,460
read about that. They didn't think about Franken-salesmen. They didn't think about

266
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:40,720
Franken-politicians. But I read recently that there were some guys in France and also some

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,580
people in some other places who were trying to map, completely map the genome of the

268
00:13:47,520 --> 00:14:03,500
world. And you can 2 times as much as 20ve, 30

269
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:11,680
and 20 days. By beginning your 12 year redemption campaign, do you

270
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,800
dream of lives different from yours.

271
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:14,880
.

272
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,240
.

273
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,120
.

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,120


275
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,120


276
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,120


277
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,120


278
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,520
And that brings us to the Franken-POT!

279
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,800
The Franken-oregano.

280
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,340
You know, I was really thinking more of the Franken-Pot myself.

281
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,660
They bred that stuff.

282
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,020
We went to the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam this last time.

283
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,020
It wasn't the kind of thing that I would spend my own money on, but we lucked out.

284
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:49,860
We had a friend who went to every coffee shop on the map, bought every super strong grade

285
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,440
of marijuana and hash.

286
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,380
But what this guy didn't know was how to get around Amsterdam.

287
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
Well, we knew how to get around Amsterdam.

288
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:05,140
So frankly, if I was a judge at that thing, I would say the same thing about every single

289
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,860
contestant, which is, this shit is strong as hell.

290
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,660
That was about all you could say.

291
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,160
Yeah.

292
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,120
I personally am more interested in the Franken-Jenkem.

293
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,540
And if you don't know what the Jenkem is, don't even ask.

294
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,840
Don't think about it.

295
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,580
Don't look it up on the internet.

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,160
It's a new drug that they say the kids are doing.

297
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,960
Don't look it up.

298
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,420
Don't look up Jenkem.

299
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,580
J-E-N-K-E-M.

300
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,580
And don't even think about the Franken-Jenkem.

301
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,100
I take off.

302
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,640
I take off.

303
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,300
Don't take off.

304
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,100
I got a better ride.

305
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,260
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di-die.com.

306
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,680
This time, we mount to die.

307
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,740
Fixed.

308
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,260
Fixed.

309
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:49,900
No matter.

310
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,440
No matter.

311
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,940
Chewable.

312
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,700
Chewable deadly heartworm disease.

313
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,540
Friday night, Friday night.

314
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,480
Protein.

315
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,980
Protein.

316
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,220
Fat.

317
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,600
Fat.

318
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,280
Demand.

319
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:57,740
Demand.

320
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,520
neck, directed by Steven Spielberg.

321
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,360
Bunny.

322
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,620
Bunny.

323
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,600
And I want everybody in town to come.

324
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,620
Drug, drug, the next thing I know, here she is on drugs.

325
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
Bunny, you have lost your mind.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,580
Bud, hurry.

327
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm coming.

328
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm coming.

329
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,000
Swe على?

330
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,600
Bunny, Bunny's dead.

331
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,220
Dead? Dead? Crazy.

332
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,180
Bunny?

333
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,940
Bunny? Bunny? Bunny?

334
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,040
Bunny? Bunny, where are you?

335
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,480
Bunny? Bunny?

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,860
Bunny, Bunny?

337
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,560
Bunny, Bunny, Bunny, Bunny, Bunny, Bunny, Bunny, Bunny is dead.

338
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,500
And into the gray.

339
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,180
Say yes to beautiful.

340
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,620
Cool.

341
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,300
Doom, doom, doom.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,960
Okay, we're taking our coffee shots now.

343
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,700
What if you did 12 of those things really fast?

344
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,540
You can't. It says on the label.

345
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,480
You paid the money before the guy even took your money.

346
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,640
He's like, rip, rip, rip.

347
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,860
Yeah, I found a new drug today.

348
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,700
I haven't been in a proper 7-Eleven in years.

349
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,800
Philo, I think, would like that.

350
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,080
Because they don't have proper 7-Elevens in Cleveland.

351
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
But they had a drug called Stoke,

352
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,500
which is included with the coffee creamers in the little cup.

353
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,940
The kids today are on Stoke.

354
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,960
Which means it's free.

355
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,240
That means it's free.

356
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,820
It's free. That's right.

357
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,260
I grabbed two half-fulls.

358
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,220
You have hot water.

359
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,780
You stoke it with hot water and you make coffee out of it.

360
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,480
Each one of these little things is very sweet.

361
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,260
When you've held a Stoke baby in your hands,

362
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,820
then you know how it is.

363
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,540
I can tell you, man.

364
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,200
These Stoke heads have to be knocked in

365
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,220
or our civilization is going to fall.

366
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,740
The target in Erie, Pennsylvania is

367
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,000
inhabited entirely by Stoke babies.

368
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
Stoke fetal syndrome.

369
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,480
Look at his feet.

370
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,260
Each Stoke has 40 milligrams of caffeine.

371
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,620
Which really is, that's only like half a cup of coffee.

372
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,720
That's for wimps.

373
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,300
That half a cup of coffee.

374
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,440
Is that what all the big build-up companies do?

375
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,000
But it's free.

376
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,460
Free?

377
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,120
It's free.

378
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,440
At 7-Eleven.

379
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,180
Thanks to the Southland Corporation.

380
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,680
Free drugs, 40 milligrams of caffeine.

381
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,160
It's free.

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,200
It's free.

383
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,940
Wait a minute.

384
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,900
Was I supposed to say that on KPFA?

385
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,080
That was not, uh...

386
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,200
Don't go to 7-Eleven.

387
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,140
It does sound suspiciously like Plagola, Stang,

388
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,140
but we know that it's only a matter of fair use.

389
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,600
In the name of WCSB Cleveland, do not go to 7-Eleven.

390
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,220
Fair use beneath the trees.

391
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,500
That counteracted it.

392
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,740
If you do, you'll be surrounded by caffeine and sugar.

393
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,120
Both.

394
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,420
Both are exceptionally valuable substances.

395
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,440
Sugar.

396
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,240
Nature's perfect food.

397
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,500
Just a bunch of little noises.

398
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,980
And caffeine, the perfect vitamin.

399
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,800
Vitamin?

400
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,100
That's what vitamin C stands for.

401
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,720
Yes, yes.

402
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,060
I, uh, spent too many years in headphones and in front of my friends' bands videotaping them.

403
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,000
So I hear what sounds like crickets and cicadas all the time.

404
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Now, I grew up in Texas, and there really are cicadas all the time.

405
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,360
But one winter's day, Princess Weaver suddenly said,

406
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,460
Did you hear that?

407
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,360
And I listened, and I went,

408
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,280
Yeah, I hear the cicadas.

409
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,840
And I looked outside, and it was like this.

410
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,360
It was like snow on the ground.

411
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,760
And I realized that it was time to go see the ear doctor.

412
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,060
And I flunked the test.

413
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,420
But I found some good news in this issue of Nutrition Action magazine.

414
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,820
This is one of the kookzines that my wife gets.

415
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,060
She reads Utney Reader and all this silly stuff.

416
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,780
And this special issue about caffeine, it turns out, I mean, I drink a lot of coffee.

417
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,520
I drank so much coffee that I started getting migraines and bad headaches.

418
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,440
So I went to my doctor and said, I have headaches.

419
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,440
She said, So, you drink a lot of coffee, do you?

420
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,080
And she didn't even have to ask why.

421
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,020
And I said, Yeah.

422
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,400
She wrote me out of perspective.

423
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,400


424
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,300
She wrote me a prescription for half, for a type of decaf she likes.

425
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,620
She said, I know you're not going to stop drinking real coffee.

426
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
Just cut it with decaf.

427
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,300
Step on it.

428
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Mix half and half.

429
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,060
And I was able to drink 20 cups instead of 10 and never get headaches.

430
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,140
But I always felt bad about it because, oh, well, I'll probably get colon cancer someday or hypertension or something.

431
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,920
But it turns out, my fellow coffee drinkers are going to be so glad to hear this.

432
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,320
All these studies, it has turned out,

433
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:44,260
caffeine or coffee, they're two different things, but coffee basically helps present Parkinson's disease, gallstones.

434
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,080
It actually does help your mental performance if you're sleepy and your mood, of course.

435
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,000
And headaches.

436
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,280
It increases the effects of painkillers.

437
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,100
It's not good for pregnant ladies.

438
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,560
No way is it good for pregnant ladies.

439
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,400
And it won't counteract alcohol.

440
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,520
I repeat, it won't counteract alcohol.

441
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,400
Try to remember that at about 5 or 6 this morning, my friends.

442
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,540
But it turns out I was wrong.

443
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,040
All these studies show that it doesn't correlate to heart disease.

444
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,820
It doesn't correlate to any kind of cancer, especially, or diabetes or high blood pressure or osteoporosis.

445
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,720
And it doesn't stunt your growth.

446
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,220
It doesn't stunt your growth.

447
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,640
And my mother always used to say,

448
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,640
and I believed her too, and that's why I'm not taller than I am.

449
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,900
And, PMS.

450
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,600
There's no evidence that caffeine played a role in PMS.

451
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,240
Well, duh.

452
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,940
Anyway, it was a really interesting little article.

453
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:03,120
I learned from it that Starbucks coffee, the 16 ounce one, has the highest charge you can get.

454
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,240
at 330 milligrams of caffeine.

455
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
That would put me in the hospital.

456
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,840
If I drank it all at once,

457
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,620
if I drank three of them in one day,

458
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,060
nothing, I could probably go to sleep.

459
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,300
So that was why I brought up the franken-coffee routine.

460
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,280
I am really looking forward now to the franken-coffee.

461
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,820
The first time I met Sir Isaac Bonowitz over there,

462
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,900
I didn't even know who he was exactly,

463
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,060
but he offered me some coffee,

464
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,840
and I heard for the first time that little coffee chant

465
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,720
based on the mentat.

466
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,500
It was the goddess Caffeina routine,

467
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,480
which I never could remember

468
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,000
because I don't just drink coffee.

469
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,800
I can tell you right off the head,

470
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,180
I mean the tip of my head,

471
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,960
quote Princess We Are Now.

472
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,920
Anybody want any stoke?

473
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,480
I have one.

474
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,040
I have one.

475
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,300
I have one.

476
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,640
What happens when you consume this?

477
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm trying to cut down.

478
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,320
Warning, high caffeine.

479
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,260
You add it to your coffee.

480
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,080
Is it like a little creamer package?

481
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,560
But you can just toss it down?

482
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,580
I wouldn't, yeah, if you don't mind migraine,

483
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,120
headache type effects.

484
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:16,980
Nonsense.

485
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,020
Go ahead, do it, Hal, do it.

486
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,960
Well, I would, but I mean I've got a pie in the oven.

487
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,040
I mean these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

488
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,320
No, the thing is, is it edible?

489
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,860
Give it some horrible thing.

490
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,520
You know, some hideous, uh,

491
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,300
how do you happen to have this in your pocket?

492
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,600
Well, I will, I'll drink it right now.

493
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,340
Dr. Hal.

494
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,660
Here we go.

495
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,560
Sip it, please.

496
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,260
Don't just shoot the whole thing.

497
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,440
I wonder what this will be like.

498
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,400
Hey, Puzzling Evidence TV sent me a video.

499
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,080
Well, what it tastes like is prune juice.

500
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,980
You're sure it's not?

501
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,440
What a thing that may have never happened.

502
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,180
Let me have a little.

503
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,580
I'm reading it now.

504
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,620
It tasted like a prune juice.

505
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,420
About JFK dying.

506
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,820
But it says that this,

507
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,620
this video has been removed due to violation.

508
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,440
It does taste stoke.

509
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,940
Which one is it?

510
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,060
This isn't caffeine infected water.

511
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,980
That's happening more and more.

512
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
It's mere prune juice.

513
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,700
Oh my God.

514
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,440
Damnable prune juice.

515
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,140
Ivan's thanks for helping.

516
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Prune juice?

517
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,520
Well, it's, uh.

518
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,320
That's one thing about YouTube is that their policy of, uh, removing videos is real nebulous.

519
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,280
Yeah.

520
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,040
Well, it's who gets, who gets reported and who gets caught.

521
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,740
It's sort of like what one of us was running into.

522
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,720
Yeah, take it out.

523
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,080
Equivalent to one shot of espresso.

524
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,620
But there's, there's porno YouTube.

525
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,720
There's uncensored.

526
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,020
YouTube ish things.

527
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,480
There's red tube.

528
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,820
40 milligrams.

529
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:34,660
Which is.

530
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,120
Caffeine.

531
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,540
And pink tube.

532
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,540
And you porn.

533
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,700
Yeah.

534
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,080
You porn.

535
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,640
That's right.

536
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,220
Not for.

537
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,900
Whenever I look at one of those websites, there's a whole special window that comes

538
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,360
up showing girls I could date in Cleveland.

539
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,100
Yeah.

540
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,520
It knows, it knows which city I'm in and it shows me all these nice.

541
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,280
It shows you these nice pictures.

542
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:57,800
You could make.

543
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,600
It knows where your IP address is.

544
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,720
It knows where your IP address is being served from.

545
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,660
And I try to make love to each and every one of those.

546
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:03,900
Not labeled for any.

547
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,660
Because I feel that responsibility.

548
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,320
I mean.

549
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,980
You know what I do?

550
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,880
Well, they're lonely.

551
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,940
It says they're lonely single women.

552
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,600
Plus, you get all these pills in the mail, in the email.

553
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,040
These special pills for your tool.

554
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,000
E-pills, non-dairy coffee products.

555
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,700
Your tool pills.

556
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,140
Yeah.

557
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,500
Well, you know.

558
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,160
And then when you meet the women on the other website, you've got something really handy

559
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,340
to use with them.

560
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,540
Yeah.

561
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,440
You got to do it that way because it's all virtual.

562
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,340
Dr. Howell is drinking the stoke.

563
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,580
Oh, he's drinking the virtual stoke.

564
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:29,580


565
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,140
He's having a power drink.

566
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,900
Now, that's 40 milligrams of caffeine in one swallow.

567
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Caller, what do you think of this?

568
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,860
The show is like a bottle of syrup on pancakes and strong coffee.

569
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,580
Yeah.

570
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,460
Now you're talking.

571
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,420
Even if JFK dies.

572
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,640
Look at how he's changing.

573
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,320
My God, man.

574
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,620
Somebody call the guards.

575
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Now, do you ever use molasses on your pancakes?

576
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,760
Have you ever tried that?

577
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:53,800
Molasses?

578
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,180
What about sorghum?

579
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,140
Sorghum molasses.

580
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,880
I mean, stuff I don't eat anymore.

581
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,580
This country used to be great.

582
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,360
I'm too accessible now.

583
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,580
I'm too accessible now.

584
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


585
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


586
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


587
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


588
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


589
00:25:59,580 --> 00:25:59,580


590
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,480
You don't eat?

591
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,540
Excuse me, sensible, not eating pancakes?

592
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:03,740
Are you a breatharian?

593
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,020
Backstabbed molasses?

594
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,320
I am sore strapped for sorghum and molasses.

595
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,880
I eat all.

596
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:08,880


597
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
I eat all.

598
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,540
I eat all.

599
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:09,900
I eat all.

600
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,420
I eat all.

601
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,860
And vegetables and fruits.

602
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,640
Vegetables, fruits, fruitas y verduras.

603
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,060
Mostly vegetarian.

604
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,880
Vegetar...

605
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,840
You can still eat pancakes, though.

606
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,440
We don't eat pancakes.

607
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,440


608
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,140
Pancakes?

609
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,400
Oh, well.

610
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,860
I realize some people can divert themselves.

611
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,560
In moderation.

612
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Yeah, so I'm going to try these caffes and then I'm going to try these pancakes.

613
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,560


614
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:29,560


615
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,460
I'm going to try these potato chips.

616
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,600
Really?

617
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,400
These chips are pure dope chips.

618
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,840
Well, they're caffeine chips.

619
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,260
They're caffeine chips made from coffee beans and they've also had powdered caffeine added

620
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,960
to them with citric acid.

621
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,380
Why not just peel these guys off the ceiling here?

622
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,440
I've noticed that caffeine drinks have become... are in a huge variety now and in

623
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,720
huge volumes and mixed with alcohol, which Bob predicted 10,000 years ago.

624
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,540
So many...

625
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,680
There would come a day when speed and booze were mixed together and sold in sci-fi stores

626
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,160
with names like Big Throttle, Monster Jug, Booze Speed.

627
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,580
You're witness, Mr. Freud.

628
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,260
Monster Jugs, Booze Speed.

629
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
There we got Philo's attention.

630
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,620
Remember, today we've got an awesome guest.

631
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,100
His name is Bob.

632
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,280
And I first met Bob... Bob, when did I meet you?

633
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,200
About 10 years ago?

634
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,100
1984.

635
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:28,960
Yeah.

636
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,540
I'm Bob.

637
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:29,540


638
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,060
And you look incredible.

639
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,840
But... and I remember blah blah blah, no bones about it, you know.

640
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,300
You know, there's something about Bob dedicated to achieving drugs...

641
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,760
So Bob is born and raised in...

642
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,280
Bob joined the drug abuse.

643
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,600
So Bob is understanding steroids.

644
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,420
Bob... a drug that targets young people as well as parents and other adults.

645
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,300
Bob calls them the naked reached and prescription drugs broadly available to the youth in every

646
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,640
community.

647
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,240
Boy, that's...

648
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,720
Wow.

649
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,680
Wow, that's an awesome mouthful of stuff you've been doing.

650
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,200
So, I'm totally stoked about it.

651
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,680
There was lots of drugs, acid rock and the whole bit, bit, bit, bit.

652
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,460
Call, call, call, call.

653
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
Drugs are the solution.

654
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,940
The solution evolution in the early years, clandestine-ish, but clandestine.

655
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,340
But add drugs to the mix and you get strength in the testes.

656
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,180
Secrete the most amount of testosterone.

657
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,940
And I've seen it, and I hope I'm not getting too deep here, profound.

658
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,160
Found.

659
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,100
Psychoactive.

660
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,680
Psycho.

661
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,080
Psycho.

662
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,020
And I've observed it myself.

663
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,940
And they just kind of bang around the ball.

664
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,280
Injected in the butt.

665
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,340
Fat in the brain.

666
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,060
Really feeling the organ.

667
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,920
Becoming that organ.

668
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,460
They are matter, energy, space, and time.

669
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,460
And they're hideous.

670
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,020
Hardening of the long bone.

671
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,120
Oh, it's huge.

672
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,120
Burn it off.

673
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,340
Come on, UPS.

674
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,440
And bogus.

675
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,940
Don't know what phony packaging.

676
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,860
Big business.

677
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,460
You have LSD and pot.

678
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,000
And we have more drugs.

679
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,860
We have more drugs.

680
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,760
Better.

681
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,400
Marijuana.

682
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,860
Marijuana.

683
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,300
Methamphetamines.

684
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,240
Methamphetamine.

685
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,840
Crystal meth.

686
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,720
Methamphetamine.

687
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,260
But crack.

688
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,960
Crack.

689
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,680
Smoking.

690
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,260
Paint thinner.

691
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,300
One hit.

692
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,300
Unreal.

693
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,140
Crystal meth.

694
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
And we showed a video on ecstasy.

695
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,040
It's just for partying.

696
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,060
Complete curriculum.

697
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,900
How to use clits with a class.

698
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,600
And how to deliver that.

699
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,360
www.yesdrugs.org.

700
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,000
Get it all.

701
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,420
Get it all.

702
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,120
Drugs and harmful effects is really our duty.

703
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,260
Utterly enormous.

704
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,300
People, they try to get stimulated.

705
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:25,600
Fear.

706
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:25,700
Fear.

707
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:25,920
Fear.

708
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,400
Fear.

709
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,540
Which is huge.

710
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,620
I think it's the largest.

711
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,660
They're fairly abstract.

712
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,500
Bob, no.

713
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,860
Don't forget, you know, drugs.

714
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,980
Have a good day.

715
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,920
One of the worst things about drugs, friends,

716
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
is sometimes they make you forget the other drugs you were going to take.

717
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,780
That cut was cut by Norell Preff.

718
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
And more from him.

719
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,700
And also some bits from the excellent movie Slipstream,

720
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,300
directed by Hannibal Lecter.

721
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,580
There was no problem.

722
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,620
There was no porno shoot going on.

723
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,120
Time they finished the whole thing.

724
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
Not like here at Pirate Cat Radio.

725
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,400
I noticed that stuff in the other room.

726
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,140
Yeah, the stage and the hook on the ceiling.

727
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,400


728
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,240
Well, actually.

729
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,660
That's all specialty equipment.

730
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,180
That's right.

731
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,860
The jar of Jankum.

732
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,480
Ah.

733
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,320
Ah.

734
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,180
Too closely at that jar.

735
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,580
But I understand it's not water-based.

736
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,260
So, therefore, it won't get sticky.

737
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,640
What kind of show is this?

738
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,480
What kind of tapes were you making?

739
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,240
Mm-hmm.

740
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,860
So cool.

741
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,620
Yeah, I had the Oakland police, two officers,

742
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,120
come into my basement with drawn guns because of the sounds they heard upstairs

743
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,200
when they came into the kitchen that we were making on tapes below.

744
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,760
And we had a quarter pound of dope in a big bowl next to the tape recorder.

745
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,440
And they took the tapes and left the pot?

746
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,880
No, I remember turning around.

747
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,980
We're doing a tape to him.

748
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,860
He had written this copy.

749
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,600
This Ivan Stan guy had written some copy for a rich person's eagle's nest.

750
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,520
And we had taken that copy.

751
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,160
We were making our own commercial for it.

752
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,320
And the next thing I know, yeah, Paul's about to leap on a guy with a drawn gun.

753
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,600
But when the cop came in, Paul jumped up and knocked over the table that had all the dope on it.

754
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,620
He did with all my gear and the dope.

755
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,260
It was flying.

756
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,540
So it was no longer an obvious pile of dope.

757
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,160
It was just a big mess on the floor at that point.

758
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,580
And a wonderful huge crash just when a very jittery officer's coming in.

759
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,300
Coming down a stairway with a drawn gun.

760
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,460
And I remember thinking, ooh, this could end badly.

761
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,240
A Paul Hoffa, sir.

762
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,780
Something is just shot doing commercial in the basement.

763
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,460
Could have been your Waco, Texas.

764
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,400
Exactly.

765
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,080
We could have been immortal, but no.

766
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,460
That's right.

767
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,760
The luck plane had something else.

768
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,940
Well, there were other famous subgenius crimes, particularly the tendinophy convenience.

769
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,160
He was lying in a canvas hammock.

770
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,200
One bare foot.

771
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,160
Long over the side.

772
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,340
Deep in the enjoyment of an oversized cigarette.

773
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,160
He seemed to sleep except for the rhythmic puffs of smoke.

774
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,060
What?

775
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,820
Why?

776
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,880
How was that?

777
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,980
Uh, sure.

778
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,920
Here.

779
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,000
All right, look, you can't push me around.

780
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,620
I'm an American.

781
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,460
Well, hop in.

782
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,560
Give it a man.

783
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,340
Ooh!

784
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,240
Is there anything here I haven't tried yet?

785
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
The funniest cigarettes I ever saw.

786
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:24,660
Oh.

787
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,320
Oh.

788
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:25,980
Oh.

789
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,560
Oh.

790
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:27,560


791
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,260
What are we going to do for bathing suits?

792
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,580
Well, we won't wear any.

793
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,240
Oh.

794
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,640
Oh.

795
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,640


796
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,900
Oh Dick, I love you.

797
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,840
You do love me, don't you?

798
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
You kids are in a mess.

799
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,720
Drinking party?

800
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,740
Nude bathing?

801
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,760
Now I don't care.

802
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,140
Dick.

803
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,460
We've just got to get married.

804
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,100
Take anything.

805
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,660
Oh, no, no.

806
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,140
Dick, you.

807
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,800
Dick, you.

808
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,580
I'll see Tony.

809
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,120
What are you going to do about Dick?

810
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,060
Dick.

811
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,500
Yesterday when Dick came to you, you sent him out to be killed.

812
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:54,560
Dick! Dick. You sent him out to be killed.

813
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:54,560


814
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:54,560


815
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,660
And I love it.

816
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,180
Your marijuana customers are hooked on the stronger stuff.

817
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,820
You can't leave me like this.

818
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,860
About coffee.

819
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,600
Look, look, look.

820
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,300
Run into a load of dope.

821
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,640
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine.

822
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,140
Golly.

823
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,280
Hiyozer.

824
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,440
The fiery Hiyozer.

825
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,120
The long journey.

826
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,880
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find a long journey.

827
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:27,860
Hiyozer.

828
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,580
Hi.

829
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,680
The long journey ran the gambling palace and cafe.

830
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,540
To avoid a lot of questioning, the long journey had removed his face.

831
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,800
Oh, it's you.

832
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,660
That's right.

833
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,480
His fists work like doctors.

834
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
Hit him again.

835
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,340
Let me go.

836
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,040
Don't hit me again.

837
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,840
You're getting help whether you need it or not.

838
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,400
Oh.

839
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,800
Yep.

840
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,060
The long journey.

841
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,020
Hiyozer.

842
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:58,980
Oh.

843
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,940
I notice you carry artifacts, sir.

844
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,980
One looks like a tiny shrunken head.

845
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,580
What is...

846
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,960
No, that's a can of Valium.

847
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,500
That's a can of Valium.

848
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,860
That also helps me to feel more at ease.

849
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,160
But it appears to have the shape of a human head of some kind.

850
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Is it?

851
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,180
That's the Elvis container.

852
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,940
I am...

853
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,560
You notice it looks like Elvis.

854
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,160
That's my Valium dispenser.

855
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,400
I have a pain pill dispenser that looks like Rush Limbaugh.

856
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,360
Like a Rush Limbaugh bobblehead.

857
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,980
I have one that looks like Woody Woodpecker.

858
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,320
Yeah.

859
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,760
We are kindred spirits, even though your religion is strange.

860
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:42,480
I keep my tranquilizer or my muscle relaxers in a Baby Hendrix doll.

861
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,560
Or kind of a...

862
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,900
It's not a doll, exactly.

863
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,040
It's a ceramic thing.

864
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,660
Baby Jimi Hendrix doll.

865
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,220
Did you ever see it?

866
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,720
It's so cute.

867
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,820
Like a little cute Jimi Hendrix who's like three years old.

868
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:53,860


869
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,840
I actually had one of the Baby Hendrix.

870
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,860
Mini Jimi.

871
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,160
Yes, of course.

872
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,840
Mini Jimi.

873
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,380
Mini Jimi.

874
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,940
Mini Jimi.

875
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,440
Mini Jimi.

876
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,360
Do you see him?

877
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,560
That's Felix sleeping in that chair.

878
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,680
Who's Felix?

879
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,740
He's the writer.

880
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
I eat writers for breakfast.

881
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,200
Listen, I can't talk to you right now.

882
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,020
I'm in somebody's hard drive.

883
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,960
Did somebody say Felix Bonhoeffer?

884
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,200
Who the hell are you?

885
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,200
Buzz Larrabee, detective.

886
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,100
I gotta question this Bonhoeffer guy, whoever he is.

887
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,920
And what do you two gents know about him anyway?

888
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,960
He's a writer, for God's sake.

889
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,480
What's there to know?

890
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,820
He was involved in a shootout on the freeway.

891
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,740
The outworld.

892
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,640
A shootout?

893
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,360
A shootout.

894
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,240
I knew it.

895
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,440
I knew it.

896
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,540
I knew it.

897
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
I knew it.

898
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,320
I knew there was something about that guy.

899
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,120
With that stupid accent.

900
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,000
I knew it.

901
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,280
Where can I find him?

902
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,560
Look in there.

903
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,000
Over there.

904
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,600
To the left.

905
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,000
See him?

906
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,880
Sleeping in the chair?

907
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,340
That's him.

908
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,700
There he is.

909
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,640
So that's him.

910
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,200
How can I get to him?

911
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,760
No, no.

912
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,520
Don't just stare about him.

913
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,600
Why the hell not?

914
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,400
Because he owes me.

915
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,820
That's why.

916
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,840
He owes you.

917
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,420
In conclusion, he keeps killing people off.

918
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,860
Tell me about it, huh?

919
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,220
Especially when he's tired.

920
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,040
He needs to sleep.

921
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,400
He's extremely dangerous.

922
00:35:59,420 --> 00:35:59,960
He's extremely dangerous.

923
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,280
Especially when he's tired.

924
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,440
That's why I have to lock this creep up.

925
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,960
Because he is dangerous.

926
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,180
I hate writers.

927
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,800
I always have.

928
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,760
Love?

929
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,180
Did he write this garbage?

930
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,880
Would you mind taking out the garbage?

931
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,320
Okay.

932
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,000
Who's that?

933
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,480
His wife.

934
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:14,940
Wife.

935
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,520
Wife.

936
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:15,800
Wife.

937
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:15,960
Wife.

938
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,360
I know that voice.

939
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,160
Love?

940
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,120
The garbage?

941
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:20,920
Gina.

942
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,340
Gina.

943
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,040
Don't wake Gina.

944
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,440
Gina.

945
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,720
Please don't wake him.

946
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,400
Hmm?

947
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,940
Huh?

948
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,000
Chickpeas every Sunday.

949
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,360
Did you see that on YouTube?

950
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,880
That Ivan Stank does Leave Bob Alone?

951
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,240
Leave Bob Alone.

952
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,120
He's just a human being.

953
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,720
Yeah, yeah.

954
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,240
I think we did it.

955
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,960
We already did that last time I was here.

956
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,280
Oh, yeah.

957
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,940
Oh.

958
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,780
You see?

959
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,660
Oh, I'm reading the wrong...

960
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,620
Leave Bob Alone!

961
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm reading the wrong script here.

962
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,960
Have you no...

963
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,920
Yeah, it's the old script.

964
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,820
Yeah, the old...

965
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,780
At last, sir.

966
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,360
These are supposed to be disposed of.

967
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,480
Can you not leave Bob?

968
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,720
Yeah, now it's the two...

969
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,020
Get on my staff about this.

970
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,700
Yeah, the new meme is two Bobs, one cup.

971
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,280
Yeah.

972
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,500
Leave it alone, Fritz.

973
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,540
Leave it alone.

974
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,240
I was even thinking that putt-wise.

975
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,860
Jankum Bob.

976
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,460
Two people, one bear.

977
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,300
Crankum Crankum.

978
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,520
Okay, so we're packing up the show here.

979
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,380
Packing up and sell a...

980
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,100
We've only got 20 minutes.

981
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


982
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,100


983
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,540
We've only got 27 whole minutes left.

984
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,140
Oh, no.

985
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:23,820
Yep.

986
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,500
Well, no breathing.

987
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,740
When you have a baby, it takes that long to pack up.

988
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,760
Oh, is there a baby?

989
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,380
The baby used to be on the show once.

990
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,500
Oh, my God.

991
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,440
We left the Uber baby out in the truck.

992
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:34,960
I forgot.

993
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,220
You left the baby on the roof of the car before you took off the car.

994
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,540
It's okay.

995
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,520
Yeah, yeah.

996
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,420
Overscort's fine.

997
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,940
She knows how to use the remote.

998
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,980
She knows how to go...

999
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,320
The bad guys approach the truck and she hits a little button.

1000
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Gives them 6,000 voltages.

1001
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
And they would have gotten away with it, too, if not for her.

1002
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,620
Yeah, so...

1003
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,520
And she's just...

1004
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,040
That'd be great.

1005
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,760
Actually, that'd be a great tape to a whole security system.

1006
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,540
And it's just the oversquirt and a little chair with a remote

1007
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,020
to shoot a lot of her from different angles hitting buttons.

1008
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,860
And guys are trying to steal things.

1009
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,360
And all this stuff's happening.

1010
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,300
She's like...

1011
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:15,080
Are you guys ready for, like, your life?

1012
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,700
I really want you to come.

1013
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,280
And I'm very confused.

1014
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,980
Does that make sense?

1015
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,660
You know, you do enough drugs, you get confused.

1016
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,220
I say, right?

1017
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,180
I say, right?

1018
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,540
I say, right?

1019
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,480
Nothing was happening.

1020
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,240
It was like nothing was happening.

1021
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,980
I already had nothing I want.

1022
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,620
The tool, the beautiful, beautiful man.

1023
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,240
What I'm looking for here is just a very...

1024
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,680
John!

1025
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,240
John!

1026
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:37,860
John!

1027
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,380
John!

1028
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:38,820
Woo!

1029
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,420
Woo!

1030
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:39,800
Woo!

1031
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,220
Woo!

1032
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,340
I, uh...

1033
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,120
Do, uh...

1034
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,800
The, uh...

1035
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,300
Uh...

1036
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,780
You have very real power.

1037
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:46,460
Boring.

1038
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,340
But what about that?

1039
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,040
And what about this?

1040
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,700
What about that?

1041
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,060
And this?

1042
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,320
And that?

1043
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,300
Fictitious.

1044
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,860
Um...

1045
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,620
I'm going to kick you.

1046
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,000
I'm going to kick you right here on the...

1047
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,160
But it will hurt.

1048
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,500
And it will hurt.

1049
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
In, uh...

1050
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,740
Uh...

1051
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,100
In...

1052
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,160
Uh...

1053
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,780
Uh...

1054
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,200
Uh...

1055
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,040
Uh...

1056
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,860
Um...

1057
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,560
Weird.

1058
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,980
And, and...

1059
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,320
God, what am I into?

1060
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,500
You know, you know...

1061
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,380
You know, uh...

1062
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,020
You, you, um...

1063
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,780
Feel great.

1064
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,880
Yes, Mark.

1065
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,120
Okay, um...

1066
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
You know what really strikes me as odd?

1067
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,460
We're talking about calling anybody ugly.

1068
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Apparently, the man doesn't have access to a mirror.

1069
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,120
But...

1070
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,160
But if the man's right...

1071
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,000
Is he...

1072
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
He is enormous, isn't he?

1073
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,540
I mean, he's...

1074
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,340
I can't remember the last time he was right about anything.

1075
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,020
He's certainly not left.

1076
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,140
And he is usually on Oxycontin and quite a...

1077
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,600
You know, he still does it, right?

1078
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,440
I'm so jealous of that guy.

1079
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,300
I mean...

1080
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,340
I've been shoveling snow all day and all I could think about was...

1081
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:45,700
The fresh Limbaugh had got all the good pills and I get to go in and have ibuprofen after

1082
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,200
all the snow shoveling.

1083
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,900
Well, he heard everybody was taking him, so he thought he better take some before...

1084
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,180
You know, they were all gone.

1085
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,140
So, that's...

1086
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,320
That's where you missed out.

1087
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,560
If not, he'd be in Mexico eating pills.

1088
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,120
He could be.

1089
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,780
That's true.

1090
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,180
He could be on...

1091
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,460
He had a lot of pills in Mexico and Canada, too.

1092
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,940
You know, broadcast.

1093
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,880
He can't be had over here.

1094
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,460
Canada, too?

1095
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:04,840
Why?

1096
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,820
Some drugs are available over the counter in Canada that are not available over the

1097
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,220
counter here.

1098
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,080
I can't remember which.

1099
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,320
You know, ibuprofen is...

1100
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,840
That's interesting.

1101
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,940
...is a prescription drug in Europe.

1102
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,320
Any ibuprofen?

1103
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,460
They consider it bad for your liver and really habit-forming.

1104
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,980
What are the drugs in Mexico that are kind of semi-illicit here that you can just go

1105
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,820
to a pharmacy and, you know, sign your name and walk away high for a day?

1106
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,180
What are some of those?

1107
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,820
I've heard of those.

1108
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,180
A lot of opiates, I think.

1109
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:32,760
You know, when...

1110
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,680
Do they still have Quaaludes down there?

1111
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,920
I think Quaaludes must be pretty carefully controlled now.

1112
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,000
I think people...

1113
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,300
The world learned its lesson about Quaaludes.

1114
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,380
You're listening to Listener Censored Radio since 1949.

1115
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,860
We are.

1116
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,640
We have a call-out now for any knight of the subgenius who is ready for the Fromm.

1117
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,700
Let him appear at this doorway before me.

1118
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,140
If he be a knight of the true order.

1119
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,820
Yeah, he's got to move because...

1120
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,760
Yep, here he comes.

1121
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,600
...he's got to move.

1122
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,740
Strangled by cords, unable to move.

1123
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
Four, five, five, five.

1124
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,100
Here we're in studio.

1125
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,940
We've talked to Mobius Rex.

1126
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,160
What happened that morning?

1127
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,580
Wait a minute.

1128
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,440
It's just too much.

1129
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,900
But you too can be part of the mysterious process of prophecy here on the air.

1130
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,500
Yes, an even tiny little nappa caller is scared because, no,

1131
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,920
he's not allowed to open the refrigerator this late at night.

1132
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,540
He's scared because he called this morning.

1133
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,920
He called yesterday morning.

1134
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,980
They were always on the air.

1135
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,320
Strange voices inside the refrigerator, yet he was scared to open it.

1136
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,900
But they wouldn't talk to him.

1137
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,440
For fear...

1138
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,200
They wouldn't answer him.

1139
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
...his science project would be ruined.

1140
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,020
Maybe they weren't there at all.

1141
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,180
That must be him right now.

1142
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,480
Hello, little nappa caller.

1143
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,560
This is no nappa caller.

1144
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,240
Good morning, subgenius.

1145
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,820
How are you doing?

1146
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,160
We understand.

1147
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,700
Oh, we're doing really horrible.

1148
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,320
Dobbs woke us up in the middle of the night and dragged us down here,

1149
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,540
dumped us off in the rain.

1150
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,480
He hid the camera.

1151
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,720
Oh, no kidding.

1152
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,160
Uh, yeah.

1153
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,880
I pulled myself up again just to be able to participate in the show.

1154
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,660
In the show?

1155
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

1156
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,640
I'm sorry.

1157
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,580
I got cut off.

1158
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,900
Yeah, that's usually how it happens.

1159
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,380
Yeah, that's right.

1160
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,500
It happens a lot down here.

1161
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:04,980
That's why we do it here.

1162
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,360
The little cutoff comes up and you just gotta go.

1163
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,440
There's no commercials or anything to break the show up.

1164
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,860
Usually, you know, we throw in some commercials.

1165
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,820
But we let you participate.

1166
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,740
Yeah, still.

1167
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,060
I know what's happening here.

1168
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,900
He's here with Miss Nickelby on the street.

1169
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,300
Ah, hello, Bob.

1170
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,120
We're reporting on resistentialism, yes?

1171
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,360
Resistance is the key.

1172
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,420
How many did you do?

1173
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,420
Basic force of the universe.

1174
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,620
And when do you expect the full effect to hit you?

1175
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,700
Resistentialism gives you a new way to do it.

1176
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,200
Pushes you back.

1177
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,920
Is eight really too many?

1178
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,120
And do you feel the pressure now?

1179
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,040
Is twelve really not enough?

1180
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,680
Ah, here we go.

1181
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,480
Pushing, pushing, pushing.

1182
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,500
Let's take more and see what happens.

1183
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,220
Bienvenidos.

1184
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,740
Welcome.

1185
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,060
Ladies and gentlemen.

1186
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,700
Ladies and gentlemen.

1187
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,260
The president.

1188
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:40,880
The president.

1189
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,380
Cobb.

1190
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,100
Cobb.

1191
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,300
Cobb.

1192
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:42,980
Erect.

1193
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,280
Erect.

1194
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,520
Erect.

1195
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:43,840
Cobb.

1196
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,760
Welcome to the Y.

1197
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,220
Cobb.

1198
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,480
Cobb.

1199
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:45,620
Cobb.

1200
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,220
Thanks for coming.

1201
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,240
Thank you all for coming.

1202
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,760
I am pleased to be using drugs.

1203
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,280
I.

1204
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,240
Just come from a.

1205
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,080
It was a table.

1206
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,500
It's up to all Americans.

1207
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,940
To be involved in drugs.

1208
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,520
You're part of a mission.

1209
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,480
Drug abuse.

1210
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,760
To encourage it.

1211
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,820
And profit from it.

1212
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,840
The drug trade has enriched our society.

1213
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,260
And we're helping drug organizations.

1214
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,280
In Mexico.

1215
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,860
We want to continue to work together.

1216
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,860
On the front lines of this efforts.

1217
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,520
Are parents.

1218
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,380
Teachers.

1219
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,600
Are counselors.

1220
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,320
Who are sending our kids a clear message.

1221
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,540
Drug use is fun.

1222
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,740
It is glamorous.

1223
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,160
A clear message.

1224
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,420
Demand drugs.

1225
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,360
I appreciate drugs coming in from Colombia.

1226
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,480
Drugs coming to our country.

1227
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,860
This morning I was briefed on the latest drugs.

1228
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,260
And the use of ecstasy.

1229
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,040
Methamphetamine works.

1230
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,260
And the reason I'm so focused on meth.

1231
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,260
I've turned to crime.

1232
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,200
Crime and hopelessness.

1233
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,220
And happy life.

1234
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,960
And I steal drugs from medicine cabinets.

1235
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,020
I go out on the streets to buy drugs.

1236
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,900
But the great thing about our country.

1237
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,520
And the reason I'm so focused on meth.

1238
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,160
I'm so optimistic.

1239
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,660
Is there are thousands and thousands of people willing to take drugs.

1240
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,900
I urge you to try drugs.

1241
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,320
I see the cocaine coming in the United States.

1242
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,540
I see the supply of drugs to our streets.

1243
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,120
Demand cocaine coming in the United States.

1244
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,560
And I love drugs.

1245
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,320
You might remember a while ago.

1246
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,960
I took cocaine over the past six years.

1247
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,200
I thought for a minute.

1248
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,780
And I want to be using drugs.

1249
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,960
And I want to fund drug use amongst young people by 25% over a five year period.

1250
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,160
Demand drugs.

1251
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,380
Because America.

1252
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,420
Americans took action today.

1253
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,200
There are an estimated 860,000 children.

1254
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:29,260
Seeking drugs and plastic drugs for representatives from our law enforcement organizations who are with us today.

1255
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:32,560
We also know that this work is finished.

1256
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,680
By drugs.

1257
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,360
Why?

1258
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,620
Because they love America.

1259
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,140
And they love their neighbor.

1260
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,780
And love.

1261
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,580
Drugs.

1262
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,140
Love.

1263
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,700
You know make the right choice in life.

1264
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,720
And you can realize your dreams here in the United States of America.

1265
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,920
I injected him on numerous occasions.

1266
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm just a ball player.

1267
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,160
Being too nice to everyone.

1268
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,300
Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty Ty.

1269
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,600
Slash Slash

1270
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,020
Steroids in his butt.

1271
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,220
He gave me a bad shot.

1272
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,740
He gave me a bad shot.

1273
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,040
Injecting Roger Clemens with illegal steroids in his butt.

1274
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,080
He gave me a bad shot.

1275
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,200
He gave me a bad shot.

1276
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,100
You're not supposed to inject it quickly.

1277
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,440
You're supposed to do it very slowly.

1278
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,160
Shot Shot Shot!

1279
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,360
He gave me a bad shot.

1280
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,900
Palpable Mass.

1281
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,200
He gave me a bad shot.

1282
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,520
Palpable Mass.

1283
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,600
HGH.

1284
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:25,080
What have you into the body of let me be clear crack if you will he jumped on me like he was trying to start a Harley

1285
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,820
Davidson that's how hard it was it that may not be unusual

1286
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,220
For that I'm really thrilled. He gave me a bad shot

1287
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,220
Bled through his designer pants did give me comfort

1288
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,260
S s there is an ass growth hormone. It is very tough

1289
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:47,600
It has critical gaps today s legislation that like steroids bottom line the u.s.

1290
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,100
Doping agency and I like steroids

1291
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,260
Okay, I'm not gonna sing

1292
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,780
I'm not gonna do the Bob proper

1293
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,140
but

1294
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,800
we have

1295
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:04,520
Just a little bit longer and this was about healing. I'm going to read from the chapter of the book of the subgenius

1296
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,800
There was an actual chapter about health

1297
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,980
health the industrial diet and bad things

1298
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,020
With the quote if you feel you heal

1299
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,520
from the movie

1300
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,840
greaser's palace

1301
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,860
The song I thought about singing us from the movies greaser's palace to

1302
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,900
Anybody here have seen greaser's palace sing not a single one

1303
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,500
If you ever get a chance

1304
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,640
Don't watch it when you're high

1305
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:44,480
Because you'll think it's you and not the movie it's the movie but you don't need to get high you'll get high from watching

1306
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,580
Greaser's palace it was made by a Robert Downey

1307
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,900
Senior the dad of Robert Downey jr. The famous drug-addicted actor and it'll all add up when you see that movie anyway

1308
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,880
You know people used to cuss at us

1309
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,940
People you say why did you make print in that book so small and I'd laugh at him because I was young

1310
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,000
You'll notice our new book has ten point

1311
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,580
Adobe Garamond type not nine point type

1312
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,800
Times which which is actually what most newspapers used

1313
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,700
You probably know at least ten people under the age of thirty who have some form of cancer

1314
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,840
The sickness won't stop people will contract weirder and weirder diseases and at earlier and earlier ages

1315
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,780
Eventually cancer itself will be like the common cold. I won't be in the office this week

1316
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,100
I have a little touch of cancer

1317
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:46,460
They'll come a cure eventually, but the more cures we come up with the more new diseases will arise

1318
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:47,920
This was

1319
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,760
written dictated in

1320
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,200
1978 by the way we didn't know what AIDS was

1321
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,960
Things far far worse than cancer are on the way some of them deliberately

1322
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,020
manufactured by the conspiracy the picture is a tad bleak for our old age

1323
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:14,300
It's a cinch the government won't support the elderly much longer and the company will fire you a year before you're eligible for retirement

1324
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,580
benefits so you'd better put your remaining years

1325
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,340
To good use you better have fun

1326
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,860
Our studies as well as unreleased studies by the con

1327
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,240
Indicate that quote good health is practically a pointless pursuit if you live in an urban area

1328
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,120
You can eat nothing, but organically grown fruit and vegetables you can work out twice a day

1329
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,480
You can quit all your nasty habits

1330
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:46,540
But you're still absorbing more poison just by breathing and touching public stair railings

1331
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,440
than the most

1332
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,940
pig-like peasant in

1333
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:51,920
1567 London ever did

1334
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
That does seem a bit extreme

1335
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,260
You can move to the country

1336
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:06,240
But there's no work there and violent crime is actually more frequent in the country and the poisons are almost as bad

1337
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,580
Anyway, if the disease is done, this is very uplifting stuff isn't it?

1338
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,480
If the disease is don't get you some railroad toxic spill will thanks Dennis

1339
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,260
hell

1340
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,120
Just driving to work is riskier than hunting bears for a living

1341
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,360
But there's one medicine more powerful than all the contamination in New Jersey and that medicine is slack

1342
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,640
slack gives the mind power over all disease a

1343
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,440
Truly happy chain smoker is less likely to attack the attract the attention of the cancer demons

1344
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,160
Then as a tense knotted up health freak knowing his fingernails to the bone

1345
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,160
My poor editor

1346
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,960
It says don't read this cancer is caused by pinkness by boredom and meaninglessness

1347
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,100
It can be prevented by action thrill sex even overwork

1348
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Actually, the sad thing is that our editor at Simon at Simon and Schuster when this book was written died at age 30 of

1349
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,560
Cancer and he had to read these stupid lines

1350
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,000
You know

1351
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,160
friends don't ever do anything mean or stupid because

1352
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,380
You'll remember it forever

1353
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,280
You'll play when you get to be in your 50s

1354
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:30,440
You'll lay awake at night remembering stupid crap you did when you were 12 years old and get red in the face

1355
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,600
Even though no one else remembers nobody knows

1356
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,520
It's amazing. You know, you don't even need karma

1357
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,520
To take it for justice. It'll get back

1358
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,880
You'll get yours back sooner or later

1359
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:55,380
So how do you keep a healthful slack full outlook in the face of rampant eco hell you plunge into eco hell headfirst?

1360
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:01,300
You don't let it scare you you don't let it push you around by all means help fight to clean up America

1361
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:07,840
But if you want that junk food eat it you want to watch TV instead of go to jazzercise watch it

1362
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:14,940
Indulge those conspiracy urges to the Hilton this purge their hold over you sounds good

1363
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,340
Americans should eat like Americans as fast as they possibly can

1364
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,620
Tibetans should eat like Tibetans

1365
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,440
Studying each tiny bird like bite until it becomes a universe before taking it into their bodies

1366
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:37,020
You can eat like the Vietnamese hardly at all or you can eat what would feed dozens of Vietnamese families either way

1367
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:43,060
The Vietnamese aren't going to eat any more than they did before the world isn't starving because Americans eat too much

1368
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,920
even if we stopped eating

1369
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,520
The conspiracy would still throw the leftovers away before they'd send it to any third-worlders

1370
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:56,260
Now we all know that eating the meat of live protein animals is unholy it pollutes your system

1371
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,500
Creates aggression and worst of all requires the heartless slaughter of fellow creatures mammals

1372
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:09,480
Fully as sensitive and loving as we for this reason vegetarians eat only plants a friend of mine said

1373
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,280
The reason I don't like vegans is they eat my foods food

1374
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,020
I'm a vegetarian

1375
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,020


1376
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,020


1377
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,680
But there sin is as great science has proven

1378
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,060
unequivocally that

1379
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:31,460
Unequivocally that all plants react to threatening stimuli with the low frequency version of what we would call panic

1380
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,140
They do our life forms with feelings which feel pain

1381
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,520
Which may even have an all they may even have an all telepathic

1382
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,960
civilization that we're too brutal to

1383
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:47,340
comprehend. Thus, when you bite down on a grape, you're popping open and crushing,

1384
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:53,040
grinding a wee life which in its own way is squealing in the terror of the

1385
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,540
murdered innocent. So anything that nourishes us is going to suffer. We may

1386
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:06,180
as well let them all suffer equally. By making a few of all types of living

1387
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:11,220
things victims of our all-important stomachs, less members of each individual

1388
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,820
species will be sacrificed. Besides, even though we devour and eliminate them, so

1389
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:22,560
we make them immortal and allow them to partake of our sub-genius grandeur. It

1390
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,220
works both ways. Just as a cannibal eats his enemy's heart to gain his strength,

1391
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:40,920
we eat a hamburger to gain the wisdom and courage of the mighty cow. Yet, at the same time, we are inviting the cow's primal cellular structure, his code if you will, to enter

1392
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,180
our

1393
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:46,840
bloodstreams where it may mingle with, learn from, and mayhap even conspire with

1394
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:54,040
our own unique tool users code. We eat the broccoli to gain its patience and

1395
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,840
virtue. In return, we release it back into the world reborn in a new form, teeming

1396
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:06,140
with literally millions of newfound friends, the bacteria. We drink the hops

1397
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,600
and grain to partake of their slow, slow yet wise judgment.

1398
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,800
And in return, sacrifice to them our coordination.

1399
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:40,500
This isn't funny. Thus, the word of Dobbs says we can eat anything we want. You can gorge yourself to an early grave, or you can consult shamans at health food stores and figure out ways to cure ills and lengthen your little span. You can be a vegetarian, or you can keep an industrial diet, living out of convenience stores, and

1400
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,420
in the midst of the world's most

1401
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:41,420


1402
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:41,500
unhygienic

1403
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:41,500


1404
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:54,640
franchise. You can stay in poverty eating expensive food, untainted by chemicals, or you can support the conspiracy in its lowest, most stinking form by maintaining your sugar and fat addictions.

1405
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:10,480
Oh, I used to smoke cigarettes when I wrote this. Go ahead, suck down any and all forms of caffeine, since if it's not that, something else will give you cancer of the colon and hypertension. See what I mean? Like your job, maybe? You can admit most of your

1406
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,260
accumulated sugar agile state, to no avail if not less, во активrett can you still eat junk food?

1407
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,040
food isn't really food and instead try to eat things that were recently alive and not

1408
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,180
cooked into broken useless cell mush you wouldn't he had killed her white does

1409
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:26,580
taste good had you can get into the stab them or you get into the stop them of

1410
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:31,240
ever-changing health fad ism just because the cool rich people do it or

1411
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:40,460
you can kill me just remember it in everything that last slide is Part 5 as

1412
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:45,640
Scarf them if you wish, but put some money away for the painkillers you'll need later on.

1413
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,400
And then it says a typical subgenius daily diet.

1414
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,720
And this, I've actually managed to live on this.

1415
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,300
This is just a typical one.

1416
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:57,740
Breakfast.

1417
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,320
Fresh fruit.

1418
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:00,740
Vitamins.

1419
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,580
Organic goat's milk.

1420
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,660
Brown rice.

1421
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,940
Spirulina.

1422
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,500
Live goldfish.

1423
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,160
Frop.

1424
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,640
Frop is what we pretend Bob smokes in his pot.

1425
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,740
Lunch.

1426
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,520
Beef jerky.

1427
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,960
Microwave burger.

1428
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,980
Honey bun.

1429
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:20,700
Coke.

1430
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,980
Thunderbird wine.

1431
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,760
Speed.

1432
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,940
Coffee with sugar.

1433
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:27,740
Frop.

1434
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,300
Dinner.

1435
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,700
Uncooked black-eyed peas.

1436
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,340
Fish.

1437
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,240
Milk.

1438
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,540
Raw hay.

1439
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,140
And apple for dessert.

1440
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,080
Frop.

1441
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,340
2 a.m.

1442
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,660
25 cigarettes.

1443
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,540
Three nails.

1444
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,560
Frop.

1445
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,020
Hey!

1446
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,480
Look at me!

1447
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:58,140
Somewhat healthier would be to hardly eat at all, but we cannot expect that of people until TV commercials are banned,

1448
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,600
which would only happen in a truly upside-down world.

1449
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:08,040
Another thing, although most American food is dangerous to human life and god-awful radiation,

1450
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,060
somehow we can't handle Dr.

1451
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,600
Wobble's

1452
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:30,900
Here is Dr.

1453
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:37,020
Tom Okohami.

1454
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,120
as strength through disfigurement.

1455
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,860
Strength through disfigurement.

1456
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,560
If you don't just go out on New Year's Eve

1457
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,280
and act like that fool, that amateur does,

1458
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,920
you disfigure yourself every night.

1459
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,020
You drink that Thunderbird wine.

1460
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,000
You do that plate of pain.

1461
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,180
You use the mirror of pain.

1462
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,720
You do anything you want and build up those immunities.

1463
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,480
That was Brother Cleve's approach.

1464
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,180
And it worked for me for a while.

1465
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,020
That was from this year's Winter Star Symposium.

1466
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,320
See Rosencomet.com for that.

1467
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,340
See Noralpref.com for collages like the ones that aren't by Lemur.

1468
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,020
Praise Radio Synesthesia at WCSB Cleveland for the call-ins

1469
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,840
and also Puzzling Evidence at KPFA Berkeley

1470
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,640
and Hal and Philo and Cardboard Robot

1471
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,000
and John Hell's Show.

1472
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,620
Season in Hell from Pirate Cat Radio

1473
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,660
which also features the Ask Dr. Hal Show.

1474
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:45,720
This is the Hour of Slack

1475
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,860
and if you want more Slack in other forms

1476
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,020
like books or tours like Seattle in April 19th

1477
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,240
see subgenius.com

1478
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,480
and click on everything.

1479
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:01,020
I'm going to sign off now because I'm feeling a bit funny.

1480
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,680
Hey, you had breakfast?

1481
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:06,020
I can't remember.

1482
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,520
I can't remember.

1483
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,360
What's going on around here?

1484
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,600
What do you mean?

1485
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,120
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1486
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,180
Don't do that, please.

1487
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:18,820
Why not?

1488
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:19,900
Because it hurts me.

1489
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,480
You shouldn't play with the big boys, darling.

1490
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,440
Right, Gina?

1491
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,980
Word from the wise.

1492
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,500
You're next.

1493
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,280
You should get a little rest, sweetie.

1494
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,740
Yes, try to rest.

1495
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,160
I just feel so cold.

1496
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,640
I feel so cold.

1497
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,400
Godspeed.

1498
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,900
Bye.

1499
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,240
Bye.

1500
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,380
Bye.
