1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
This guy JR is on my TV.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,600
I took my pills.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,580
I didn't get any money.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,280
What's this guy trying to do to me?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,220
I gotta, gotta, gotta get a gun or a job.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,000
I gotta, gotta, gotta get a gun or a job.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm sick of Bob.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,340
I don't have to run away from anything because I don't believe in anything.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,180
What direction is the ceiling?

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,080
Back the other way.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,740
That where you escaped from.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,460
But let's leave things of this world behind

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:59,880
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,860
The devil owes you money, friend.

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,940
But Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,540
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,800
We gotta root him out.

18
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,040
Burn out the hate.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,340
Burn out the radiation.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,840
Burn out the fire.

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,740
Standing around acting like you got wires of blood and anybody else,

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,280
but you ain't because I'm the one that has it, not you, me.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,380
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,880
About I know things I ain't never learned.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,660
How I can see.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,620
I can see the signs.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,420
It's something that just happens.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,340
And I got to do some things sometimes.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,780
I got to do some things sometimes I don't even want to do.

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,820
And sometimes inside me I can feel it.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,520
I can feel it pulling and tugging at me and pushing.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,640
And I can feel my blood beating.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,500
And I got to do this thing right now.

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,580
It's wires of blood.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,140
Ain't everybody has it.

36
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,440
See, it's a gift.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,920
It's a gift.

38
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,740
Like a gift for the prophets.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,540
Now, I ain't saying I'm a prophet.

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,780
No.

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,580
It ain't like that.

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,340
But it's like that.

43
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,480
You're crazy, boy.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,940
You get away from me and you stay away.

45
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,120
I'm going where I'm going.

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,560
I got a woman.

47
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,820
I got a woman, see.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
And that's where I'm going, to visit her.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
He thinks if he keeps on insulting you that you go away.

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,160
Whoa.

51
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:19,900
Whoa.

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,840
Scary and neat.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh, no.

54
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,580
More cars going in and out of little corridors.

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,500
We can do those clicks, too.

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,940
Oh, there he is.

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,220
Quick, fire.

58
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,640
Fire one.

59
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,900
Oh, he missed him.

60
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,520
There he is.

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,340
Quick, fire another one.

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,440
Hey, are you fed up with boring radio?

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,700
I'm tired of Turgeon Antigua's Top 40.

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm tired of your precious love.

65
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,520
I'd do anything.

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,120
Yes, I would.

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
Prepare to puke over pretty paw.

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:10,680
Well, well, well, well, it's time to enter the subgenius hour of sweat.

69
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,340
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,560
Driven to suicide with the pressures of a crumbling society?

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,120
Fed up with hip light weights?

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,720
Well, get ready to kick back and explore the psychodynamics of abnormality.

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Because...

74
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,720
Because...

75
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,340
The Doctors are here.

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,440
Yes, don't worry.

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,880
Everything's all right.

78
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,220
Everything's just fine.

79
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,620
Ah, yes, dear friends, everything's just fine.

80
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:16,340
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, and it's so good to be back in Dallas after another sojourn afar in search of historic Bob.

81
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:27,860
This time it was New York City, and yes, friends, I left that package of subgenius video PR at MTV, just like they asked me, and I haven't heard a peep out of them since.

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,580
And that's good.

83
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,940
For MTV not to call us back after finding out what we were really about, I think, says something in our favor.

84
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,300
Praise that old Bobby.

85
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:54,540
We did have better luck at Spin Magazine, Screw Magazine, and Simon & Schuster, who will now be, praise Bob, officially reprinting the book of the subgenius this spring.

86
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,260
Praise Dobbs, praise Dobbs, and you'll all have to buy new copies now, because...

87
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:07,380
the second edition will be a little different from the first, so things are looking up for the mighty church of the subgenius, friends.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:25,400
Now, last week, you listeners were sadly banished from the glowing, benevolent rays of the lofty, intellectually high-faluted, urethodox, Stangian paradise type of show to the bitter hell of the buck-naked doctrinal schism.

89
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,780
Now, friend, you're gonna have to decide.

90
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:36,060
Are you a Stangite? A Nakedite? Or just a... a U-ite, eh?

91
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,060
You're gonna have to pick a side.

92
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,300
Well, friends, I want you to know that I could be out hunting me some prairie squid tonight.

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,420
I could. But I... I mean, I don't have to do this show.

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,740
Most of y'all don't even deserve the sweet word of Bob.

95
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,720
But this is gonna be an easy one, though, because tonight we offer you a sampling of other...

96
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,000
subgenius radio ministries in other states and even other lands.

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:11,580
The airwaves tonight, friends, will be fraught with peril as shows collide around you for the next hour.

98
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,820
Uh, because last week we got tapes from, uh, the Serious Abuse Show.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,860
These are weekly subgenius programs... programs for friends.

100
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,100
The subgenius, uh, Serious Abuse Show from Richmond, Virginia, which is a brand new one and mighty fired up.

101
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,680
With the pure hate, the gospel hate-a-dobs, friends.

102
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,780
And from the new, the brand new Hour of Slack in Boston, Massachusetts.

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,600
With Bleepo Abernethy from the Sister Chris subgenius half hour at WFMU in New Jersey.

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,960
And last but first, the more than an hour, less than a show show from KPFA Berkeley.

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,960
And you'll see how lucky you heathens are to have the Dallas Hour of Slack right here in the very cradle of the Bob.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:09,640
Uh, because these foreign shows, uh, some of them are a little bit better at sacred, uh, the sacred church accultation technique known as listener elimination.

107
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,500
Of course, Buck and I have been known to show the occasional total disregard for the listener's feelings, but we don't hurt you randomly, dear friends.

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:24,720
We aren't doing this, we aren't tormenting you just to amuse ourselves. Nay, we hurt you for a reason.

109
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,220
A good reason.

110
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,600
And that reason is our great thrice-killed guru, J.R. Bob-Dobbs.

111
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,220
Eee-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:42,740
This show and all other subgenius shows are designed to have a calculated effect on the bicameral split between your left and right brains.

113
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,160
And that's why you have to listen in stereo.

114
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:51,040
Otherwise, you won't be able to get the strands separated and you'll get all tangled up in the dogma that we broadcast at you.

115
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,120
Now, uh, all of we radio doctors are accredited surgeons of the airwaves.

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,200
Uh, we're not.

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:04,420
We're like real, look at our faces, man, and my body rocks!

118
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,580
Now friends, we're allывают condescending to tiny little...

119
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:07,960
Robot living sé giftographies of nanowows here and there,

120
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,840
but that's as far as the mysophobia of the voc ned hasażed me.

121
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,300
And with all of that involved, I've been d一,

122
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,300


123
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,880
Naturally, there's no material to frame this feature more than a working kid simply imprisoned on a mat

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:14,880


125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,880
and in your head, Have you played시디

126
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,020
who gave Var ninny a torn dressing?

127
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,860
It's mandatory that you listen to us, and you're mighty lucky you're allowed to, dear friends.

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,300
Now, that understood, we may now proceed with the tape recording.

129
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,840
All the callers are lining up right now to talk to the doctor.

130
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,480
But don't worry. Everything's all right.

131
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,400
Your radio is taking control of you.

132
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,180
Relax. You're in the hands of the doctor.

133
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

134
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

135
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,240
The motion picture you're about to see contains scenes so terrifying,

136
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,740
the public must be given grave warning.

137
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,340
Therefore, the management has instituted visual and audible warning

138
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:25,580
at the beginning of each of the four supreme fright.

139
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,760
Points.

140
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,320
The fear flasher is the visual warning.

141
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,400
The horror horn is the audible warning.

142
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Turn away when you see the fear flasher.

143
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,680
Close your eyes when you hear the horror horn.

144
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,220
Shut up!

145
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,800
Shut up!

146
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
Shut up!

147
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,280
Shut up!

148
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:07,520


149
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,680
What must the listeners at home think?

150
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,440
It's terrible in the cavernous echoing shell of our rocket

151
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,480
with all these floating babies and the zero gravity.

152
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:23,980
Hunger.

153
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,000
The dogs.

154
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,000
The pinwheels.

155
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,380
The rolling by.

156
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,420
And we're having a little bit of navigational difficulties,

157
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,900
but we're still transmitting to you the subgenius hour

158
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,480
and a half of true cosmic puzzlingness

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,860
and evidential nausea and the will to disbelieve.

160
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,060
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers,

161
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,820
and it bears a laden crest full of sad experience

162
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,340
moving toward the stillness of your rest.

163
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,200
The landing.

164
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,700
Small.

165
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,600
Hysteria.

166
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,700
Physical discomfort or loneliness.

167
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,120
The cure is obvious.

168
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
I always wanted to be on the radio,

169
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,460
and now I have a chance,

170
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,300
and better than Christmas.

171
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,220
It's boring, megalomaniacal, monotonous.

172
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,860
A movie camera?

173
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,020
Table tennis?

174
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,780
A wallet?

175
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,600
A dog?

176
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,040
What?

177
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,460
I hear the magic word,

178
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,940
well, boring me!

179
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,100
Yeah, that's closer.

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,760
That's closer.

181
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,500
That's closer.

182
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,320
You can achieve it.

183
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,000
You will achieve the cider spasm with the excess,

184
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,720
if you do that enough, friend.

185
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,240
This caller has just requested that I perform a wedding for him

186
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,720
this coming weekend.

187
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
It's the first wedding over the phone now.

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,120
We can historically probably say at WMBR at least.

189
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,240
We can perform this wedding over the phone right now,

190
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,080
if you would like.

191
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,400
Right now.

192
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,040
Yeah!

193
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Yes, okay.

194
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,940
Rachel and Stefan,

195
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,440
you know the seriousness of the commitment you're bringing yourself to,

196
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,320
and you realize that all the consummations

197
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,400
that make up a relationship between a man and a woman,

198
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,760
that you've done,

199
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,300
you've already done before.

200
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,920
Well, where you're at now is,

201
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,840
you're going to make the deal that binds it all together.

202
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,880
So,

203
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,800
do you, Rachel, take Stefan to be your lawfully wedded husband,

204
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,200
with the word of Bob to be your guiding light?

205
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,920
Yes, so help me, Bob.

206
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,960
And you, Stefan, take Rachel to be your lawfully wedded wife,

207
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,760
with Bob's true slack,

208
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,780
true slack being your guiding force in your lives.

209
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Help me, Bob.

210
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay, I want you to...

211
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,420
I can't take this, Dr. Fishmonger.

212
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,360
It's too beautiful.

213
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,700
I want you to, I want you two to join hands.

214
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,500
I want you, I want you to shake hands.

215
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,000
All right, hold on a sec.

216
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,740
I want you two to shake hands.

217
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,520
Yes!

218
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,500
Yes!

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,720
Yes!

220
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,180
And say, it's a deal.

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
It's a deal!

222
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,020
Praise Bob!

223
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,040
Praise Bob.

224
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,420
Yeah!

225
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,160
Oh, praise Bob.

226
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,360
That was a beautiful thing.

227
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,820
That was a beautiful, beautiful thing.

228
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,780
And may they have a wonderful life together.

229
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,000
That's totally...

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000


231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,280
That was the first legal marriage over the airways of WMBR, Cambridge.

232
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,400
That's right.

233
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,660
The reverends of the Church of the Subgenius are legally empowered to perform marriages.

234
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,400
So, we do invite your calls here.

235
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,360
D, can you see?

236
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,340
Jesus calls you.

237
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,740
Jesus calls you.

238
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,700
Hey, looky down yonder.

239
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,020
Did you see that blind man down there?

240
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,320
He's giving out tracts and begging Jesus you ought to see him.

241
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,560
And he's got this here ugly child.

242
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,980
I mean, you better get up.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,980
You know, on the other side, lady, there's a fool down there giving out tracts.

244
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,500
Don't pay no attention to that fanatic up there.

245
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,280
Don't I know what exists and what don't?

246
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,700
Ain't I got eyes in my head?

247
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,660
Am I a blind man?

248
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,120
Let me tell you something.

249
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,440
Maybe you think that you ain't clean because you don't believe.

250
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,540
Every one of you are clean.

251
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
And I'll tell you why.

252
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:54,980
Why?

253
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,080
You think it's because of Jesus Christ crucified.

254
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,180
You're wrong.

255
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,800
I ain't saying he wasn't crucified, but I say it wasn't for you.

256
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,320
I'm going to start a new church.

257
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,040
The church approved without Jesus Christ crucified.

258
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,260
And it won't cost you nothing to join my church.

259
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,120
It ain't started yet, but it's going to be.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,780
I don't need Jesus.

261
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,760
What do I need Jesus for?

262
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,940
I got Leora Watt.

263
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,360
What?

264
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Preachers, babies, there be seen.

265
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,460
Attention, Richmond.

266
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,220
This is the voice of the Red Cave Media Center,

267
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,080
loosely affiliated with the Church of the Subgenius,

268
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,880
broadcasting to you from the studios of

269
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,700
The FM.

270
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
The doctor is in.

271
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,040
Yes, the doctors are in.

272
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,960
Just straight talk.

273
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,460
Just some straight BS.

274
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,040
Dr. Gene Scott.

275
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,420
From your hosts, Dr. Can't Sleep, Dr. S.B. Boyd, and Dr. T.M. Oscar.

276
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,840
Tired of the conspiracy telling you what to do-do?

277
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,900
Just listen to the doctors, or even call 289-UR90.

278
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,540
No, don't call that number.

279
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,640
Don't call any number.

280
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,360
And Bob don't like it.

281
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,840
Me.

282
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,220
Neither.

283
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,580
And now, the doctors.

284
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

285
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,520
And what we just heard was a sampling of,

286
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,900
oh, you got a little bit of your Berkeley show

287
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,500
with Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Al,

288
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,540
and the show that dare not speak its name,

289
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,560
and Gary the Broke Friend.

290
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,340
And you got your Rat Cave media show

291
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,360
with Steve Slack and T.M. Oscar doing that

292
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,760
from some horrible little college station.

293
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,060
You're a hateful bunch of ranters there.

294
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,260
And a bit of the Hour of Slack,

295
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,540
Boston, Massachusetts version.

296
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,300
Now, of course, the Berkeley was the first weekly

297
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
subgenius radio show.

298
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,120
But friends, you know, the subgenius shows thus far,

299
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
they tend to fall into two groups.

300
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,900
Either the wellmanized, willy-nilly, happening, be-in,

301
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,340
call-in, or the other way around.

302
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,340


303
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,820
The call-in, love-in kind of show,

304
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,700
a la that Berkeley show or the Rat Cave Virginia show.

305
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,360
Versus your Stangian or Abernathy and Bostonian show type shows,

306
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,220
which are the tightly scripted and heavily edited

307
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,580
and censored pieces of Bob packaging,

308
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,620
which you have come to so know and love, baby.

309
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,120
And let's just see.

310
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,180
Oh, oh, oh.

311
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,120
And this here.

312
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,280
On camera three is a WFMU in New Jersey.

313
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,020
This will be the fifth one we're playing.

314
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,360
This is Sister Chris.

315
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,900
Or this is actually a guest of the mighty Sister Chris,

316
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,680
who came in from Poland, I believe.

317
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,560
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

318
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:14,980
Wait a minute.

319
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,300
I don't want to see any more dimensions on my TV.

320
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,960
Shoot, we ran the videotape instead.

321
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm sorry.

322
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,320
There was a little Super 8 video.

323
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,460
Oh, we're going to have a blast.

324
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,760
Excuse me with this audio.

325
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,260
What?

326
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,300
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature

327
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,240
of abnormal behavior to explore new ways of going over the edge.

328
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,320
Yes, indeedy.

329
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,780
This is Sister Grajina back on the airwaves of WFMU.

330
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,920
Sister Chris and I have reconciled our differences

331
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,100
about muscling in on airtime and spontaneous feelings, et cetera.

332
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,420
And I'm here to tell you out there in the ether

333
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,920
about my experiences with UFOs and my religious convictions.

334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,100
And I don't mean arrest records.

335
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,640
You understand?

336
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,300
I'm rambling about the spiritual, the metaphorical,

337
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,220
and the comically cosmic.

338
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,240
And my first visitation happened when I was 4 years old.

339
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,320
One overcast and calm.

340
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:31,180
communist oppressed day, I was playing in the family beat field with my hometown of Viborova,

341
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:39,060
when this strange buzzing sound was boring what felt like a big hole in my skull, and a stiffening

342
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:48,400
inaction took over my whole body and my toes too. And then it seemed as if the sound tried to pull

343
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,680
me out, my living soul, out my body shell, but there was too much resistance. Too bad no one was

344
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,800
around to witness this extraterritorial shenanigans there. It must have looked pretty weird from the

345
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:13,220
outside. On the inside, I was confused and terrified. I was literally excreting building material.

346
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,860
But the crazy kid I was, it started to feel nice.

347
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,640
Like a new kind of amusement ride. I don't remember much else about that first experience,

348
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:34,460
or how long it lasted. The thing is, ever since that time, I've been hearing strange voices,

349
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:43,120
and been on the receiving end of many bizarre visions. Psychiatrists and other members of the

350
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,300
craziness oppression caste call me and the others of the chosen sex.

351
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:57,440
So when I hold even a biodegradable side, Razic's body goes moved, to clip rich and

352
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,700
liquorice, a rock коð?m or black on call? Who would believe that it was just a

353
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,780
short scene a big reboot of the 23 year old passionυslu repetitive romance film?

354
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,700
And presented at a king's bonnet.

355
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,280
카어로

356
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,360
sa

357
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,780
ach

358
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:20,560
It's all right to rock out and jam with these aliens as long as I get the minimum daily

359
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,220
requirement of slack that I need and they don't and as long as they don't reap my lungs out my chest

360
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,560
If I do something, you know that they don't like

361
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,380
Destruction

362
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,660
We've heard all of that

363
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:57,200
Dear friends. I just had a caller calling up wanting to know what the deal was on the afterlife if there was one and and

364
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,400
What they were gonna do to him when he got there and I explained to him that you've got your we've got five stages that

365
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,880
We know of starting with the bottom the Christian hell

366
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,420
We talked about this about three shows back you got your Christian hell on the bottom

367
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,300
Then your Christian heaven then your earth, which is the course of another layer of hell

368
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,680
Then you got the higher than that though a lot more comfortable as the subgenius hell which wouldn't really be punishment

369
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:30,620
But really believe me I you know you you believe me don't you this is eternal salvation or triple your money back

370
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,860
We wouldn't try to lead you down the wrong path

371
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,900
Yes, the subgenius

372
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,780
Heaven is even above the subgenius hell and that's Asgard

373
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
Known in other tongues or you know Nirvana

374
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,620
Actually, it makes Nirvana seem like getting your eyes

375
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,540
carved out with a with a pair of pliers

376
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,100
And just one end of the pair of pliers not yanked out but gouged out. That's what Nirvana is like

377
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,180
Compared to the mighty squirting universe of the Chris of the subgenius heaven

378
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,620
Go don't that bless your heart friends. Well, this is the

379
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,740
subgenius hour of slack radio ministry with the Church of the subgenius here at Kano and

in virons and

383
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,320
And then we're playing we're playing excerpts from a sister and brother shows all over the place

384
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,800
What you just heard was an excerpt from the sister Chris show she gets a tapes from a

385
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,160
one of the lovely nun snakes in Poland in communist Poland and

386
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,620
And I've been getting tapes from the Pope of all China com read communist China

387
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,340

in Beijing

389
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,340
And you can't write to him because that would get him in a whole lot of trouble dear friends

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,060
But he's gonna be sending some more updates of his Chinese three minutes of slack in Chinese by the way speaking of Chinese

391
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,420
It's a great movie last night a great wall

392
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,120
Can't tell you where?

393
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,520
Because that would be an advertisement which you didn't pay for

394
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,540
But anyway, here we go

395
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,300

396
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,400

And you are listening to the hour of slack

398
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Texas

399
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,100
Remember Bob and the Comrade of God

400
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,300
Oh people here in China just like in America

401
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,780
People need to thank

402
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,600
in Chinese

403
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,180
We call slack

404
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:58,580
But it must be true slack not the best lack of the conspiracy

405
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,220
Please Bob. Help me somebody

406
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,540

414
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:54,920
I guess we should be grateful for the media manipulators who have yes beyond what what bond what is your

were sent from earth many years ago fortunately we catch up with them and then we pass them

440

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:59,460
why you can't call in now two weeks ago dear friends many of you many of you faithful

454

455
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:14,040
many of you heard the sermon about our friend the prairie squid that frisky and fecund mollusk so

456
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,880
dear to the hearts of all us country boys and girls but dr g gordon gordon and i got so carried

457
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,580
away with ranting about the forbidden delights of that pesky land squid that we completely

458
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:35,680
neglected the warnings the stern warnings friends that should be delivered to all squid fornication

459
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:43,860
services i.e we forgot to mention the arboreal squids which uh dear friends secrete a poisonous

460
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:50,120
fluid from their inner sheath and we forgot to mention the night squids which carry foul diseases

461
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:58,220
and the toothed the toothed squids which are rather hard to dislodge from your um body once

462
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,200
you start to uh you know do what you do with a prairie squid i don't think i have to spell that

463
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,840
but uh worst of all friends and i can only beg your forgiveness for this uh this this if this

464
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,620

466
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,860
pliers before you start to you know to to before you make them safe to use and dr gordon and i

467
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,000
sort of took it for granted that that was common knowledge that that was common knowledge that that

468
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,200
everybody uh to that everybody knew to de-beak a squid before you get on with your business and

528
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,500
the agent for Bob in China

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,160
he's about to

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,620
close in on those conspiracy

531
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,580

that bucket of slack and that

533
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,220

Pope Li

535
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Li Jing

536
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
he's a bad

537
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,180
bad spy for

538
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,760
Bob

539
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,580
Li Jing

540
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,520
and he's closing in

541
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,600
on those conspiracy

542
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,980
that one looks pretty good

543
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,080
well sir I'm telling you

544
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,200
in fact I'm gonna come right out and say it

545
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,300
nobody listens to this show

546
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,380
Bob came out of that book

547
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,620
Bob came out of that book

548
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,160
yes it was

549
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,940
Bob came out of the phone book

550
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,200
Bob came from the phone company

551
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,080
the phone company

552
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,960
Ah, yes.

553
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,600
It was the phone company. This is the truth.

554
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,620
This is the truth. Nothing else on this show is true but this.

555
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,980
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.

556
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,980
I know I'll be taken out in shock.

557
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,380
You forget to tell us which phone company.

558
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,620
At that time, there was only one phone company.

559
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,700
At the time I speak of, there was only one phone company covering the Earth.

560
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,920
Its tendrils extended in every direction.

561
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,200
Listen, you shouldn't be wasting your time with this stuff.

562
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,120
And so it was that Ivan Stang came upon the sacred territory of the phone book,

563
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,400
which he found in the men's room of the bus station.

564
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,260
And in that phone book was the face, the face that we know as a mass of dots.

565
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,720
A mass of dots, a strange convoluted grouping of energy

566
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,560
which may have traveled through space and time for longer than anyone knows.

567
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,760
But it came out of the phone book. That's what I'm trying to tell you.

568
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,180
I know they want to silence me because they don't want to know

569
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,120
and they don't want us to get through.

570
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,400
But he came from the phone.

571
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,420
I think there's something wrong with your tape.

572
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,800
It's 1984.

573
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,400
The tape is worn.

574
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,240
The deathless are gone.

575
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,060
What I like about the Church of the Sleep Genius is that you can totally screw up

576
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,400
and then become pope and collect an enormous amount of money

577
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,940
and gain eternal salvation or at least a nice piece of beachfront property.

578
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,920
That's right.

579
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,480
Bob is just a wonderful thing.

580
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,680
Whatever he is.

581
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,520
He doesn't forgive your sins.

582
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,960
He doesn't care about your sins.

583
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,820
He justifies your sins.

584
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,840
He shows you how to peddle those sins.

585
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,140
You can hate him.

586
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,380
You can kill him.

587
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,540
You can love him.

588
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,580
It doesn't matter.

589
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,820
You just kind of like pop up and down to it.

590
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,720
I just love it and I like the Southwest.

591
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,180
It will probably kind of sneak over and eat you and the West at the same time.

592
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,960
It's kind of a bi-location deal.

593
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,600
Oh, mother.

594
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,840
What's happening?

595
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
Oh, mother.

596
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,160
I think you've been miscarried.

597
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Oh, no.

598
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,840
What's happening?

599
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, no.

600
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,600
What's happening?

601
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,700
I can't tell.

602
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,420
Oh, no.

603
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,180
Can you?

604
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
What's happening?

605
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,340
I can't believe this is happening to me.

606
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,780
What's happening?

607
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,600
I keep crawling into those black holes.

608
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,560
They are so enticing.

609
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,560
What's happening to me?

610
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,800
I can't even hear myself anymore.

611
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,600
You've been duplicated.

612
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,540
Well, hey.

613
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,160
Let's trade with him, bro.

614
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,720
Let me out.

615
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,140
Maybe I'll have another chance.

616
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


617
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


618
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


619
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


620
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


621
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


622
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


623
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


624
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,140


625
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,160
I'm going to have to get a new collar here at the subgenius asylum of anti-pinkness.

626
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:04,460
Hello?

627
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,460
Hello?

628
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,240
Hello.

629
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,560
Yes.

630
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,980
This is Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

631
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,200
How may we serve you?

632
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,060
Hello, Reverend, and I'd like to address a question to Dr. Albert Fishmonger.

633
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,100
Fishmonger here.

634
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,620
Yes.

635
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:24,340
Doctor, I was wondering, the collar mentioned earlier the question of whether one has to

636
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,600
be into water sports to hit Bob.

637
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:34,160
And you had explained it as the elements which you used for your hatred weren't important.

638
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,720
I think that the listeners should also know, though, that although other elements can be

639
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,440
used, I think that bodily fluids are the most vital.

640
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:52,640
Well, it is indeed a holy right, and we talk about it frequently, to pee on Bob's head.

641
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,580
And when I talk about the elements that are important to Bob, I'm not talking about the

642
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:56,580


643
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,020
elements of fire and water.

644
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,700
You can pee on Bob's head, friend, and R and S and T-U-V, of course.

645
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,320
All of those.

646
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,440
And any of those things.

647
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,120
But, like, it is also important to note that, like, you know...

648
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,700
We're just talking about the letter P, of course, friends.

649
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:15,200
When we talk about, like, you know, using the elements, I mean, when we talk about using

650
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,580
the elements to honor Bob with, I mean, so that represents, that fluid represents the

651
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,560
water element.

652
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,580
And, like, and we use the air element when we breathe the air.

653
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:26,580


654
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:26,580


655
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,780
We breathe the sacred church air.

656
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,740
And we use the fire element when we fire up the sacred froth stick.

657
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,300
And, yay, even upon Bob's head, we can deposit earth in the form of the sacred night soil.

658
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,700
Well, what if drinking liquid slack until one has to return...

659
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,520
Well, you know, liquid slack can come in any one of a number of forms, friend.

660
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,440
It can be Jack Daniels.

661
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,340
It can be Pepsi Cola.

662
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,360
Liquid slack is...

663
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,480
In my case right now, it's Canada Dry Ginger Ale.

664
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,400
Ginger Ale, yeah.

665
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:54,860
Free plug.

666
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,900
No, no, no.

667
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,440
We can't do that.

668
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,460
It's non-commercial radio.

669
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,780
We have to give a plug to everything, every other soda in the world now.

670
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,200
Dr. Fishmonger, what have you done?

671
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,140
Classic.

672
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,360
Oh, Lord.

673
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,260
We have to equal time.

674
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,060
Oh, no.

675
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,840
The word human is slowly losing its meaning under a vast tidal wave of inhumane behavior.

676
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,700
It's a tug of war between the fiercely retroactive steel trap mouth boot boys on the right and

677
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,980
the equally insidious R.C.

678
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,420
Snob.

679
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,300
They're not the most psychopathically hip squids on the left.

680
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,160
The conspiracy has twisted the words good sex around to mean everything that you don't

681
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,480
get.

682
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:41,140
That way they can humiliate you into obedience, run your treadmill trip, and make you fill

683
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,020
out a scorecard.

684
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,400
They tell you you have to have career goals, which is twisted to mean absolute obedience

685
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,760
to whatever rut you happen to fall into.

686
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,380
They can make you ugly and fat and bored.

687
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:54,920
Yeah.

688
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,820
And then they want you to go home and beat off the solid gold.

689
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,500
Discuss this with the foreign minister and the president.

690
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,020
The fact is, they said we are moving towards an abolition.

691
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,260
But what they also said, and what the black leaders out in the ranks said, is this.

692
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:23,040
He has made observations about the situation in South Africa, which are inconsistent with the facts.

693
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,340
Yes, 289-UR-90, tell us everything we don't want to hear.

694
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,800
Mr. Tutu doesn't presume to be a political leader.

695
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,100
He presumes to be what Mr. Polo presumes to be.

696
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,900
A man of God, and therefore a spokesman for 8.2.

697
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,300
289-UR-90 is our phone number.

698
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,740
I want to know, what has Reverend Stang got to do with this conspiracy?

699
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,620
No, no, no, wait, no, wait, you may say,

700
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,020
Stang, oh, he couldn't do nothing.

701
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,920
He's in charge of this radio show.

702
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,560
He's the one responsible for putting my words over the air and all that over there.

703
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,720
But, friends, that's completely impossible.

704
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,040
You say, yeah, well, what about, like, Johnson and the JFK assassination?

705
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,400
You ever ask yourself that?

706
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,200
Sure, sure, you know, mourning for the world and all that.

707
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,420
Now, let's be frank here, folks.

708
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,200
Now, I'm not saying Lyndon Baines was a bad man, but Lyndon Baines was a powerful man.

709
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,280
Lyndon Baines was a man who could withstand pain.

710
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:22,420
Who's to know what kind of strange hypnosis he underwent with them hypno-demons

711
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,020
back when he was a kid?

712
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,040
He visited that flying saucer on that Air Force base in 57 with Eisenhower.

713
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,520
Yeah, he was a senator that was there that day.

714
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,480
He was supposedly standing there watching the whole damn thing.

715
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,360
Well, if you ask me, those aliens just hypnotized him,

716
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,220
took him both aboard the spaceship there,

717
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,880
and, of course, erased part of the mine and then put it back

718
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,860
and then made them forget that they could ever remember it,

719
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,040
which just, you know, makes the whole subconscious drive to do the insane thing even stronger.

720
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:51,840
I love those aliens.

721
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,940
You've got to love those aliens.

722
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,180
Anyway, I mean, you've got to admire them, let's say.

723
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,840
Maybe you can't exactly embrace them with what we call love.

724
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,080
You know, I can't go into that right now.

725
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:07,660
But anyway, so, at any rate, so what I'm just saying there is, you know, it's entirely possible.

726
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,300
Now, please, I don't want any lawsuits or nothing.

727
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,600
There's a theory I'm proposing.

728
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:17,860
I don't believe we're all being made of destruction.

729
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,080
I don't believe we're all being made of destruction.

730
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,980
When the only step is to say the claim,

731
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,960
this whole crazy world is just too frustrating.

732
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:12,440
But we can do the same over and over and over again, my friend.

733
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,820
Are you done?

734
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,140
You're on the move.

735
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,520
You've got to stop now.

736
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,120
Blue Juice.

737
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,900
Come on, let's do that.

738
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,360
Cross the surface of the skin toward the nearest opening.

739
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,140
How many openings does the body have?

740
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,960
Whichever one it's closest to.

741
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:45,200
The tattoo slowly enters the opening and disappears inside the body,

742
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,160
and there moving through the endothelium.

743
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,020
It makes its way God knows where.

744
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,380
One tattoo might get trapped in the musculature behind the knee.

745
00:45:59,560 --> 00:45:59,980
Oops.

746
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,780
But the right knee.

747
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,980
Gentle massage would break it loose.

748
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,340
But then a strange change takes place in the tattoo.

749
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,600
And as it reappears through whatever opening, you can see that it's changed.

750
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,020
It's been digested somehow from its original state.

751
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:31,380
It's two-dimensional purple-red reality into some otherworldly hologram.

752
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,780
Tattoo hologram.

753
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,320
And there it dances across the body of the tattoo subject.

754
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,240
Beautiful.

755
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,620
There'll be one thing I'd like to see done.

756
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,760
Oh, I hope we do it.

757
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:47,340
Or how about the musical that I've never gotten around to called Mmm.

758
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,280
Mmm.

759
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,160
Starring the Siamese twins.

760
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,000
Mmm.

761
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,680
Connected by the lips.

762
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,920
The lips.

763
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,940
All sorts of things we never do.

764
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,440
Crumple.

765
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,600
I was going to write a book called Crumple once.

766
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,660
All the pages would be crumpled.

767
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
You'd reach in, take out a crumple, read it.

768
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,180
Crumple it up, put it back in.

769
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,520
Reach in, take out another.

770
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,660
Short stories.

771
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,220
With each page numbered.

772
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,300
If you took them out, one, two, three, four, five, and the odds against that are pretty great.

773
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,680
True.

774
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,840
You'd wind up with the actual true meaning that was meant by the author.

775
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,320
Oh.

776
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,760
But the difficulty there is to find someone who can crumple all those pages.

777
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,080
What if it were a bestseller?

778
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,180
Think of the problems we'd have then.

779
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:51,980
Of course, there's one other thing that I wanted to do, and that is find a plastic surgeon who could change pets to look like animals.

780
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,840
Like their owners.

781
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,200
What about the other way around?

782
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,680
Yes, we should resolve to do all these inappropriate things.

783
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,600
Why don't we?

784
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,820
Like, um...

785
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,900
Well, let's see.

786
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,800
Like the, uh...

787
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,660
Levitator.

788
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
That I knew who was a...

789
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,960
Marvelous levitator.

790
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,180
Gave lessons in levitating.

791
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,040
Let's do it.

792
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,060
Tried to teach me...

793
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,620
But, uh...

794
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,180
I never could get off the ground that way.

795
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,180
He...

796
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,940
He wanted to be a singer, though.

797
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,580
He wanted to sing in a nightclub.

798
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,940
And he was a horrible monotone.

799
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,380
Really couldn't carry a tune.

800
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,140
He would sing...

801
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,860
My funny Valentine sweet...

802
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,060
You know, it was awful.

803
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,800
But he was good at levitating, and...

804
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,060
As the devout catalyst...

805
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,180
I got him into this nightclub.

806
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,840
The happy medium.

807
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,020
Marvelous.

808
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,940
He didn't sing well, but he levitated beautifully.

809
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,700
And had this...

810
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,940
Girl with sequins.

811
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,260
Very large girl.

812
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,300
Showbiz-type girl.

813
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,420
With a hula hoop with sparkles on it.

814
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,300
And she...

815
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,560
As he levitated, singing My Funny Valentine...

816
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,340
She'd...

817
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,100
Run the hula hoop so you could see that...

818
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:19,120
He was a great singer.

819
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,300
And there was no trick to it.

820
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,080
Nice touch.

821
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,380
You know...

822
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,920
Let's get together...

823
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,600
We are together.

824
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,180
In the pub.

825
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,320
Yeah, we're here.

826
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:30,960
Sometime and...

827
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,680
And write down all these things.

828
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,020
You know, make a scenario.

829
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,100
Then we'll go to Hollywood.

830
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,700
I've recorded the whole thing.

831
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,320
I don't know.

832
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,640
Maybe they...

833
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,340
Wouldn't think it...

834
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,940
Was commercial enough.

835
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,500
Let's do it in Des Moines.

836
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,780
We can make the resolution anyway.

837
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,660
Okay, we'll do it in Des Moines.

838
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,020
Yes, dear friends.

839
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,620
We're together.

840
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,400
In the bub.

841
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,860
That was Ken Nordean.

842
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,560
A tape called Triple Talk.

843
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,220
And you...

844
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,620
Some of y'all may have heard his stuff now and then.

845
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,940
It's hard...

846
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,300
You can only buy these from Ken Nordean.

847
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,120
Or if you have an hour of Slack show...

848
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Why they just appear in the mail.

849
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,600
Praise Bob.

850
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,940
Oh, uh...

851
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,460
And for immediate release, dear friends,

852
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,860
they're having a musical theater conservatory auditions being held at MVC.

853
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,320
That's right.

854
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,860
Mountain View College Performing Artist Musical Theater Conservatory

855
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,980
will be holding auditions at 7 o'clock p.m. on August 18th and 19th

856
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,460
in the Performance Hall.

857
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,900
Applicants will be required to perform two monologues, two music numbers,

858
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,920
and must be prepared to dance.

859
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,960
The following, uh...

860
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,720
The Performing Artist Musical Theater Conservatory

861
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,360
is a one-of-a-kind intensive training program

862
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,420
designed to develop professional-level performance skills

863
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,700
in acting, singing, and dancing.

864
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,480
Please call the Fine Arts Office at

865
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,960
333-8632

866
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,420
for an audition appointment and more information.

867
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,920
Yes, dear friends.

868
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,940
And this is, uh...

869
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,740
Sister Chris.

870
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,420
Speaking to the lost and the faithful alike,

871
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,080
the damned and the blessed under Bob in New Jersey.

872
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,040
On another station.

873
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,800
Sister Chris.

874
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,180
Here with you to tell you that

875
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,960
in the past weeks,

876
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,660
I've delivered bits of rants such, uh...

877
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,760
and such things as slack, time control,

878
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,860
and other aspects of the subgenius church.

879
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,460
The time has come for Sister Chris

880
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,960
to relate to you my personal testimony

881
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,040
to the salvation in slack that was released to slash by me

882
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,120
through the all-encrusting power of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

883
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,780
Shameful though it may sound,

884
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,480
it was a long period in my life

885
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,720
when I had tripped and fallen off the luck plane of slack

886
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,480
and knocked my head ad nauseum

887
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,660
on the railing of the conspiracy stairway to doom.

888
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,940
And the rut at the bottom of the stairwell

889
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,440
was deeper than the valleys of Jane Mansfield.

890
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,880
Food had no taste.

891
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,500
My vision was constantly blurry.

892
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,020
And television terrorized my time

893
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,420
like a vampire sucking my imagination dry.

894
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,840
Life seemed drab and pointless.

895
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,940
At best, droning irritation.

896
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,980
I sought help in the blind alleys of nightclubs and other vices,

897
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,820
but they only seemed to aggravate the situation.

898
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,380
It was no fun.

899
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,480
Then I literally stumbled onto a group of enlightened ones.

900
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,720
Ones who were filled with the power and the glory of Bob.

901
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,620
Words like slack, Bob, and WFMU in free form

902
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,600
hung in the air like sweet-smelling pipe tobacco.

903
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,760
At last, the burning irradiated light of slack began to sear my brain pan.

904
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,900
I began to forget to be anxious among the pink boys and girls.

905
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,040
I explored the remnants of my subgenius heritage and ethics,

906
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:15,740
and they were long forgotten during the amnesia of the zombie years.

907
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,580
I can't describe to you the step-by-step dismantling

908
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,140
of all that conspiracy programming,

909
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:26,320
because events didn't happen in a singular linear fashion.

910
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,280
The closest comparison would be to taking a shower

911
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,560
in truth and slack under a pulsating nozzle.

912
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,360
I still had problems and vices, but it was a lot more fun.

913
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,640
My third eye had the clarity of the telescope at Mount Palomar.

914
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,460
I relaxed in the safety of my body.

915
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,580
I was able to see the trauma of different illusions every day.

916
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,960
The bottom line comes down to having fun.

917
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,900
Yeah, Bob's human shell may be dead,

918
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,520
and some people are depressed about that,

919
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,200
some subgenius and latent subgeniuses,

920
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:08,640
but his almighty power lives on through the gifted and the possessed.

921
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,160
We just heard from this week's installment

922
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,860
of the Church of the Subgenius tape.

923
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,900
Heard every week here on WFMU.

924
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,300
No, that isn't WFMU.

925
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,540
This is KNON 90.9 FM in Atlas, Texas.

926
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,740
Well, this is the night of the vanishing co-hosts.

927
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,640
Not the vanishing people.

928
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,100
Yeah, right, no vanishing people, but all the mighty co-hosts.

929
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,140
Oh, lo, how they have fallen.

930
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:53,120
There's no sign of Buck naked, ain't hiding under anything,

931
00:54:53,260 --> 00:55:01,700
and Norm Ward has nay not walked through the door for Monday morning.

932
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,460
But old mighty Johnny is here to do the anti-preaching.

933
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,620
Say what?

934
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,740
Well, we're going to move down here.

935
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,080
I don't even know what's on this one.

936
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,220
Oh, it hurts, though.

937
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,300
Better turn your volumes down,

938
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,760
and those of you who are trying to listen in mono.

939
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,800
Boy, friends, those shows are banging into each other

940
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,480
over there on the left channel.

941
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,140
Maybe I'll get it.

942
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,200
Ah!

943
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,040
Very good!

944
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,200
you've got to see what's got to do with this

945
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,780
you've got to rule the world

946
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,840
what can I do to make you understand

947
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,560
I love

948
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,780
whatever intimidation and injustice

949
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,680
lie with decency and honor

950
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,060
let the doctors arise

951
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,500
and arise they must

952
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,320
for within every one of us

953
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,200
there is a doctor

954
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,580
a dormant doctor

955
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,940
a supreme arbitrator

956
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,600
who can be summoned to intervene

957
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,040
when crises threaten

958
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,140
the stabilities and well-beings of our heartlands

959
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,640
seeing someone sleeve job a 14 and a half inch

960
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,120
John Holmes Wang Dinger specials offensive

961
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,500
if nobody's sleeving yours

962
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,040
or yours

963
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,040


964
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,480
you're not sleeving anybody's

965
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,420
you know that's the whole problem

966
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,740
when you give something up

967
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,600
you expect everybody else to give it up too

968
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,660
and I think that's worse than if you take something up new

969
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,920
you should expect everybody else to

970
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:31,960
because obviously

971
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,880
a lot of other people already doing something

972
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,140
because they want to

973
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,380
or think they want to

974
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,360
or they like to

975
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,480
or they like to think they want to

976
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,800
or they want to think they like to

977
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,860
just because they want to swear and smoke and drink

978
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,460
and in your opinion go to hell

979
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,560
that's their business

980
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,300
not yours

981
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,540
the only business that's yours is yours

982
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,580
and if it's yours and it offends you

983
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,660
you better pull it out and look at it closely

984
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,680
and find out why it offends you

985
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,600
because I tell you

986
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,740
it offends you mostly because

987
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,040
it reminds you that you're missing out on the good things

988
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,040


989
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,340
and you're missing out on something

990
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,540
and that's why sometimes

991
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,060
when we say things in the church of the subgenius

992
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,640
we offend people because

993
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,780
because it reminds them that they're in the grip of the conspiracy

994
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,020
because it reminds them they lead dreary empty stilted

995
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,540
hungry lives of desperation and quietness

996
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,400
they don't like the way we talk

997
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,940
because it reminds them that they've got sexual organs

998
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,880
and if they just make an effort they could use them

999
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,060
they don't like the way we talk

1000
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,380
because we remind them that we're all animals

1001
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,460
and daily must fulfill our biological functions

1002
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,100
and as they are something of which God almighty or whoever

1003
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,220
brought us here gave us

1004
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,180
we have no control over them

1005
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,920
therefore they've been told

1006
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,880
oh that's nasty put it in that little clean white bowl

1007
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,820
that symbol of purity

1008
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,880
why do you have to flush away

1009
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,900
pure water

1010
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,800
with nothing but biological salts dissolved in it

1011
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,000
with five and a half gallons of fresh water

1012
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,380
that somebody could be cooking dinner and drinking

1013
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,380
ah friends

1014
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,060
it's because

1015
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,400
some people

1016
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,880
don't like to be reminded

1017
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,080
they pretend

1018
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,880
that if they

1019
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,800
don't

1020
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,860
talk about it

1021
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,620
and don't think about it

1022
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:47,200
then they can forget about it

1023
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,100
and if they're not reminded that they have to squat down and sh**

1024
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,340
like every other monkey on this planet every day

1025
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,620
if things are working right

1026
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:00,540
then maybe they think they aren't one of them monkeys that's on this planet

1027
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,500
but the big smart dumb monkeys with too much sh**

1028
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,580
not enough time

1029
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:08,140
yeah talking about you

1030
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,060
and all you other signifying monkeys

1031
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,160
that's why people get offended

1032
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,240
that's why they don't like to hear us talk about prairie squid

1033
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,600
oh god how disgusting

1034
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,960
to use an aphorism of that disgusting nature

1035
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,240
but what they're missing is the point that we're saying is that

1036
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,680
a prairie squid

1037
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,540
is just like any other wild animal

1038
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,880
it's a natural thing

1039
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,400
you can't cover up a prairie squid

1040
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,460
because it'll come creeping out some

1041
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:42,340
and you stamp out the prairie squid

1042
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,980
and you stamp out life itself

1043
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,880
that's what we're saying

1044
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,400
we're saying that our biology is what we are

1045
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,060
and there's nothing we can do about it but enjoy it

1046
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,680
that's why sometimes we offend people

1047
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,120
that's why the church

1048
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,880
will never be

1049
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,420
something you'll see in prime time television

1050
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,460
because

1051
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,080
they don't want you to be reminded

1052
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,780
of what you really are

1053
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:11,900
because then

1054
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,940
you take a good look at yourself and realize

1055
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,800
that hell what am I doing all this sh**

1056
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,880
them for

1057
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,880
that's why they don't like for us to say these things

1058
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,760
that's why prairie squid

1059
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,120
poo dog poo dog

1060
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,420
all those strange strange cult references

1061
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,040
that's why it's all so important

1062
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,740
and I'm sorry

1063
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,540
I didn't get out of here

1064
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,540
quite quick enough

1065
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,220
but dear friends

1066
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,380
you can write for information

1067
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,340
from the church of the subgenius

1068
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,420
and you'll get real information in the mail

1069
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,960
if you want to call it mail

1070
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,240
it's bob at p.o. box 140306

1071
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,660
Dallas, Texas 75214

1072
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,440
praise Bob

1073
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,440
and I'll see you next time

1074
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:09,440


1075
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,940
and tune in next week

1076
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,340
for one more breath of that church air

1077
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,660
that mighty church air

1078
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,600
I've got to get out of here now

1079
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,360
thanks praise Bob

1080
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,140
I'm John Horton

1081
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,860
and we'll be joining us momentarily

1082
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,200
a lot of things to talk about tonight

1083
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,680
at 828-9500

1084
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,780
it's an open line

1085
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,360
but we've got a few topics

1086
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,760
that we're going to be going over

1087
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,520
by the way

1088
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,340
how about those

1089
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,580
Dallas Cowboys

1090
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:07,940
huh

1091
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,420
20 to 19

1092
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:09,440
and the most popular

1093
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:09,440


1094
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:09,440


1095
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:09,900
Nothing.

1096
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,340
I don't even know if that was right.

1097
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:19,760
At least it wasn't 32 to nothing like happened today with the 49ers and the Raiders or something like that.

1098
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,900
I don't read the papers.

1099
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,660
What do you think I am, a knowledgeable kind of guy?

1100
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,960
Anyway, we're going to be talking about that.

1101
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:28,440
And I believe I hear Norm ringing downstairs.

1102
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,600
So if you'd go let him in, we'd all appreciate it.

1103
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,020
Some other things we have to talk about tonight.

1104
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,540
A special announcement for you.

1105
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:46,120
We'll be talking a little bit about something I saw on cable TV this week, which made me very sick.

1106
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,200
So a couple things we're going to talk about tonight.

1107
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,500
Who are your favorites in football this year?

1108
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,920
Who do you think is going to take it all?
