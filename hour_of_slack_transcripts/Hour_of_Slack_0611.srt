1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
Remember

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,180
We're sitting together listening to this

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,120
And this was busy

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,780
Remember

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,440
Remember

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,980
Remember

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,540
You need me, and I have come

8
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,680
Hi Bob

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,960
Yeah

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,160
Bob Bob Bob Bob

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,520
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,940
Yes sir, I like subgenius

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,920
No sir, I don't like pig boys

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,780
Yes sir, I love Bob

15
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,680
No sir

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,140
No sir, I do not want to stop Bob

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,840
I want Bob in every tree

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,900
I just want to give my fish to the thousands

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,920
In every flower, in every bee

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,080
In every leaf, in every twig

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,100
In every cow, in every pig

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,960
I want Bob deep fried and de-freezed

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
I want to fill him in the breeze

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,060
I want to see him in the sky

25
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,680
I hope his spike will catch me

26
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,620
Dear Bob who floats above the ground

27
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:56,920
Dear Bob who floats above the ground

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,040
I long to hear the mournful sound

29
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,720
That's made when you emerge from space

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,220
And come to this, my dwelling place

31
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,920
Dear Bob each night

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,020
While I'm asleep

33
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,180
I hope to my house you will creep

34
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,860
And poke your pipe in through the wall

35
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,440
So I'll be burned remembering all

36
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,860
Dear Bob it's time to close my eyes

37
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,920
Remember now

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
It's no surprise

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
If I should be found dead someday

40
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,980
I'll think that you were in the way

41
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,740
Oh gimme Bob

42
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:26,920
Oh gimme Bob

43
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,540
Oh gimme Bob

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,580
Confusing that face

45
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,780
With my own

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,220
Can't remember my place

47
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,260
Can't remember my place

48
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,600
Can't remember my place

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,880
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,280
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,300
Which reaches from the inner mind to

52
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,320
The subgenius

53
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:49,860
The subgenius

54
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,940
Hour of Swatch

55
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,100
Hour of Swatch

56
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
Hour of Swatch

57
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,380
Hour of Swatch

58
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,660
Bob's role on this planet

59
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,780
Is to see that

60
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,980
The earth is not sold

61
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,280
On that glorious or terrible day

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,260
We call X day in 1998

63
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,880
We call X day in 1998

64
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,900
When the men from Planet X arrive

65
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,940
Now it may sound ludicrous

66
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,520
It may sound ridiculous to many

67
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,140
It may sound impossible

68
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,540
Are you saying they're all nuts all those people

69
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,260
Maybe yeah maybe

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,760
You once were telling me about Planet X

71
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,640
Dr. Morbund

72
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,660
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of

73
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,920
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of

74
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,320
Evil stalks them

75
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,460
Evil stalks them

76
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,160
Every night and day they wait

77
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,460
To see the evil they go through

78
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,920
Do they come down in flying saucers

79
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,440
Flying saucers are bearing on us

80
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,360
We don't know what to do

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,460
We're here all alone

82
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:44,740
We're here all alone

83
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,500
The planets are fading

84
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
The blood is running

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,780
The lights were fading

86
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,360
And they stalked us

87
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,440
One by one

88
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,580
This is the man in black

89
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,540
Here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno California

90
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,700
For centuries we have been circling your earth

91
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,520
Waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere

92
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,500
Waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere

93
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,700
Waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere

94
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,760
I am the first to come to you

95
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,160
With death and destruction

96
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,520
With death and destruction

97
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,180
Go ahead and kill me

98
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,160
What's gonna happen to your children

99
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,700
What's gonna happen to your children

100
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,020
When it's the society we've created

101
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,780
Air conditioners

102
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,120
Air conditioners

103
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,920
Station wagons with wooden sides

104
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
Station wagons with wooden sides

105
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,300
The cautious indeed

106
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,780
The retired actor the orange hail

107
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,820
What happens when that collapses

108
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,040
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,580
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn

110
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,920
That's when the man from Planet X-9

111
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,300
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church

112
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,460
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church

113
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,000
But until that day

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
The power and wisdom of Bob

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Can help us break their mind control

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,400
Can help us break their mind control

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,120
By activating that mutant gland that we all have within us

118
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,900
You don't like your life

119
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,420
Straighten it out in a big hurry

120
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,600
Give your money to the church

121
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,540
Not the state

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,520
The church

123
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,740
Yes

124
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,200
Give us your children

125
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,860
Give us your children

126
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,220
Give us your children

127
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,420
Let us raise them

128
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,580
Let us raise them

129
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,260
You'll have weirder kids than me

130
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,820
You'll have weirder kids than me

131
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,680
Ha ha ha ha ha

132
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,640
That's odd

133
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,320
Meltdown

134
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,760
And this can happen here

135
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,780
This can be yours

136
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,120
Uh yes dear friends

137
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
It can happen to you

138
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,500
It can be yours

139
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,020
And it will be yours on X-day 1998

140
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,820
Only two years from now

141
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,680
And of course dear friends

142
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,120
This is our X-day show

143
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,200
It's July

144
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,420
By the time you hear this tape

145
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,900
I will probably be at the X-day drill

146
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,660
I will probably be at the X-day drill

147
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,120
And drilling my way

148
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,740
And drilling my way

149
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,540
Deep into my own brain in preparation

150
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,980
For the arrival of those

151
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,900
Gods and goddesses

152
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,760
From outer space

153
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,880
Who will come in 1998

154
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
July 5th 1998

155
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,740
You know the story friends

156
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,240
And if you don't well just keep listening

157
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,580
Because we're gonna have

158
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,500
Every tiny media barrage

159
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,820
Of footage clip that ever had anything to do with X-day

160
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,340
For this show and the next one

161
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,800
I apologize for the last show

162
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,580
But you know

163
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,820
As Dr. Legume pointed out

164
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,260
In the first edition of the book of the subgenius

165
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,240
The McGraw Hill orange cover edition

166
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,580
It

167
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,580
There was a misprint

168
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
That seemed

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,200
Obviously a mistake

170
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,940
That at one point made it look like

171
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,720
X-day would happen in 1996

172
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,060
Well what if that wasn't

173
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,560
A mistake

174
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,820
What if you're not ready

175
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,000
What if you're still putting off

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,080
That mighty moment

177
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,200
When you write that mighty check

178
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,840
What if

179
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,520
These are all important

180
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,080
What ifs friends

181
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,640
And you know that movie is coming out

182
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,540
Independence Day

183
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,320
God their ploys

184
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,940
Are so obvious

185
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,180
So filthy and so obvious

186
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,780
That

187
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,840
You know the pieces are all coming together

188
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,200
For the one world government

189
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,040
And we can tell

190
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,240
You can see the story behind the rise of Bill

191
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,660
Clinton Bill

192
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,760
Soft on kitty porn

193
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,400
Clinton I should call him

194
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,980
And his little clique

195
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,720
Rising to the American throne

196
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,980
Yes it was through

197
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,220
The diabolical back room

198
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,720
Machinations of Dobbs

199
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
That all of these things have come about

200
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,480
Well thou art but an insignificant

201
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,500
Insect

202
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,520
And you better speak to the manager boy

203
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,360
Cause that day is coming

204
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,340
That day is coming up

205
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,320
And well I'm gonna

206
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm just gonna let these

207
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,240
Tapes carry you on through friend

208
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,540
Cause this is the biggest celebration

209
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,060
Of the subgenius year

210
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
And uh

211
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,180
I hope that you are

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,580
Readying yourself

213
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,340
Just as we are

214
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm sorry if you can't make it to the X Day drill

215
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,240
In Sherman New York

216
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,520
While you're hearing this show

217
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,360
I really am

218
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,300
But in the meantime you may commune

219
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Yes you may commune

220
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,680
Now with the spirit of Dobbs

221
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,940
And the promise

222
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,600
Of X Day

223
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,620
Ah yes

224
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Angel

225
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,460
Splash through the heavenlies

226
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,240
You know

227
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,380
Ezekiel

228
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,240
Saw a wheel

229
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,260
But what a lot of us do not realize

230
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,280
Is that in chapter one of

231
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,160
Ezekiel verse four

232
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,540
The angels traveled in whirlwind fashion

233
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,200
Not like our jets straight ahead

234
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,580
Whirlwind

235
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,520
They moved from one end of heaven to the other

236
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,320
Like a flash of lightning

237
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,300
Verse fourteen

238
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,420
And verse fifteen says

239
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,340
Their color was

240
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:04,960
Burl

241
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Do you know what they put into spaceships now

242
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,920
That are heaved out there

243
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,860
The only thing that can withstand the heat

244
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,140
Other things would disintegrate

245
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,480
Burl Ilium

246
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Burl Ilium

247
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,300
Their투 aqueous

248
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,040
And theirteat

249
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,280
To hopefully

250
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,280


251
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,500
Water

252
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,000
Mus

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,260
Kris

254
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,280
Yo

255
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,640
Go

256
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,380
I

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,340
I said, well, I was wall climbing.

258
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,680
I was wall climbing.

259
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,740
That's what Bob said to do.

260
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,580
That's what Bob told me to.

261
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
I was wall climbing.

262
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:07,680
I get real scared, Bob, because I've seen them.

263
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,980
I've seen them before.

264
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,580
But there's more of them now.

265
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,520
Because there's lots more.

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,120
They're floating in the air.

267
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,800
And they're living in the wood and the rocks and everything.

268
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:36,400
And they're always kind of laughing and feeling and laughing all the time.

269
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,140
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

270
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,860
has interpreted the signals as a message from the space probe.

271
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,840
A message from a dying planet in...

272
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,440
Where the little green men's day was real headcats

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,980
Rocking and rolling to the crazy flats

274
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,780
Brought out the sax and they started to flow

275
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,740
Brought out the drums and they started to roll

276
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,380
Blind saucer, rock and roll

277
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,160
Blind saucer, rock and roll

278
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
I couldn't understand it

279
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,520
A big dead set, it was a crazy beat

280
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,160
It just stopped me dead, Joe

281
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,020
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack

282
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,560
and a conspiracy of bad news,

283
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:15,560


284
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:15,560


285
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,200
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

286
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,600
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

287
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,760
when the television signal of Amos and Andy

288
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,960
reaches the men from Planet X,

289
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,260
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

290
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,040
And the men from Planet X are going to come down

291
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,500
and take over Earth.

292
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,580
They're going to...

293
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,880
They will put us out of our misery

294
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,040
unless Bob can explain to them

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,580
in ways that they can understand.

296
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:45,660
We have to get the hell out of here.

297
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,880
There is something on Earth, worth saving.

298
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,520
And only the subgenii

299
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,260
the dues paying, book buying, receipt in the pocket

300
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,500
paid in full to the church subgenii

301
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,060
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

302
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,120
The rest of them, it's a tough world, Jack.

303
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,860
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge

304
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,620
of the excessed battle saucer, blood of Christ.

305
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,400
He looked and laughed,

306
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,460
he laughed and looked,

307
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,420
he looked and looked,

308
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,460
He laughed and laughed.

309
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,460
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

310
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests, were busy at their weapons terminals.

311
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:39,400
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

312
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,760
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet Earth.

313
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,160
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

314
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,800
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dust Moat painted of him.

315
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:05,280
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls, as if they had any souls to save, as if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

316
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his.

317
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,100
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

318
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,820
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

319
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,400
Oh, the anticipation. He was sick to his stomach with glee.

320
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,680
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

321
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,660
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here, and now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

322
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,600
Sweet stigmata.

323
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
Even the slightest thought of the scars.

324
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,660
The scars made them glow red through his fists, through the boxing gloves.

325
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,360
The hold of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

326
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,820
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums.

327
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,180
All in attack mode.

328
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,180
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons, the dark bodies.

329
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,000
And at time and a half, too.

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,320
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

331
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
No matter.

332
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,160
That which comes had finally arrived.

333
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,800
And on Jesus' birthday.

334
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,140
What do you think, Dad?

335
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,180
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, CODESYS.

336
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,220
A whole graphic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

337
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,620
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

338
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,100
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

339
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,540
All in scale.

340
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,520
Quite pretty, actually.

341
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,320
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

342
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,640
It would soon enough be dark.

343
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,000
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

344
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,940
We will walk among them and we will smile.

345
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,340
At your moment of choice, of course.

346
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,600
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty universe.

347
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
He was a mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

348
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,300
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

349
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,760
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

350
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
Something was missing.

351
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Something else was added.

352
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Something.

353
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,900
Jones had been forced on him by the Jinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

354
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,620
Damn them.

355
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,880
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

356
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,860
No.

357
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,500
Jones' constant reminders of their influence.

358
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,320
And expectations irritated Jesus no end.

359
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

360
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,560
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe.

361
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,800
Even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

362
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,100
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

363
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,440
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

364
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,180
He never removed his sunglasses.

365
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,140
And he still took massive injections of methamphetamines.

366
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,660
Even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

367
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,980
You know Jimbo?

368
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,180
Said Jesus.

369
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,520
The best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

370
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,840
That's why they strung me up the first time.

371
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,340
They think like bugs down there.

372
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

373
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,080
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

374
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,760
It wasn't really his fault.

375
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,980
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

376
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,860
He was forced to abort the experiment.

377
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,120
But then the

378
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,400
answer comes.

379
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,300
There was nothing major.

380
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,600
He had to give up everything.

381
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,820
He didn't do anything else for his life.

382
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,320
Unless should've been shot about the day.

383
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,100
Closed his eyes.

384
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,860
Wreck that.

385
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,540
on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

386
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,460
Hello, I'm a Martian.

387
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,440
I hope I speak your language.

388
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,120
This is a recording.

389
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,220
What?

390
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,880
Take me to your leader.

391
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,780
Take me to your leader.

392
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,860
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft

393
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,920
with living occupants,

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
it must have been very disconcerting for them

395
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,980
to cross millions of miles of space

396
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,800
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

397
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,380
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

398
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,860
as those which were first called flying saucers

399
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,960
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

400
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,280
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

401
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,420
By 1950, some of these characters

402
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,180
were beginning to spin their stories

403
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,060
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

404
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,260
Some of them expanded the stories

405
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,180
to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

406
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,180
Suddenly everything went black,

407
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,500
and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off

408
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,800
in a little while.

409
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,360
I was in a little tiny room

410
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,680
where nobody was listening to me,

411
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,700
and I was talking to this hot little plush felt

412
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,280
red rubber tip microphone

413
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
and not hearing a thing

414
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,000
and seeing only little tiny lights

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

416
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
and put into the studio

417
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,800
that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

418
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,680
with lights flashing off rhythmically.

419
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,560
And it was a small man with a swollen head

420
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,460
and hideously deformed eyes

421
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,960
sitting behind the console

422
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,900
pushing the buttons

423
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,860
while pencils of light and energy

424
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,220
flashed across my body.

425
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,000
And I wondered why I was there

426
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,840
and what did they want me to do.

427
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,640
And I couldn't figure out

428
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
why I was sitting there.

429
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
And they didn't say anything.

430
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,080
They just kept flashing those lights at me

431
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,660
and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

432
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
And the man with the funny head,

433
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,000
the leader,

434
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,640
the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

435
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,060
Well, I just want to know

436
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,400
if you want to be in the church

437
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,700
or out of the church,

438
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,840
and where's your wallet?

439
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,500
Yes.

440
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,180
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up,

441
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,220
and it wasn't really a dream

442
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,880
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

443
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,840
And suddenly it all came to me.

444
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:04,840


445
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,160
And I realized that they'd stolen

446
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,140
four and a half hours out of my life

447
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,040
when they put me in that tiny room

448
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,720
and plugged all those wires into me

449
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,000
and made me talk and talk and talk

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,980
and talk and talk

451
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,180
because you only paid for an hour and a half.

452
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,640
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

453
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,280
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

454
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,400
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

455
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,740
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations

456
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,820
are no longer with you.

457
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:34,820


458
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,320
Ours.

459
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,760
I hate them with all my heart.

460
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,340
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

461
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,500
What is your objective?

462
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,900
You are not ready,

463
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,440
but we will still save you.

464
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,840
In your best self-destruction,

465
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,340
you will send up more satellites,

466
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,260
and we will be there

467
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,300
waiting to come again.

468
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,140
I'll be right here.

469
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
And, uh, but,

470
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,720
we'll be sending that little, um,

471
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,460
almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door

472
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,320
to collect those organs, so...

473
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,820
Snappy.

474
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,300
He'll be in the cute little uniform,

475
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,360
so don't be afraid.

476
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,700
They're your friends.

477
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,620
They're here to help.

478
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,200
They're our brothers from the stars.

479
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,500
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear

480
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,900
in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

481
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,060
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

482
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,160
They're your friends.

483
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,300
They want to teach humanity

484
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,800
and lead us...

485
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,480
into a new age of enlightenment

486
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
under their gray jackboot.

487
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,240
Whisper, whisper.

488
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,640
Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen,

489
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,400
and now listen.

490
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,720
If you wake up in a vat of poison

491
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,520
with little aliens standing around outside the vat

492
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,980
wrapping, tying napkins around their necks,

493
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,520
sharpening their knives and forks,

494
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,900
be glad,

495
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,780
because you've just fell into the hands

496
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,240
of the good aliens.

497
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,180
The bad aliens.

498
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,680
Far, far worse.

499
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,420
Whoa!

500
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,360
Oh, they're not like the thing.

501
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,220
That was a cuddly little benji of an alien

502
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,160
compared to what we're...

503
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,600
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

504
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,320
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters

505
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,980
compared to what we're talking about.

506
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,140
That is in the box.

507
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,640
What we're talking about is more like

508
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,720
what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

509
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,740
That's your hair.

510
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:34,820
That's your hair.

511
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,460
That's what it looks more like.

512
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,600
What is this?

513
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,180
The effect is it turns you into the alien.

514
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,400
Alien.

515
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,760
But man, take my word for it, it's worth it.

516
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,180
It's great, man.

517
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,460
It's cool, you'll love it.

518
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,060
I feel so much better now that I got it.

519
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,240
It's for your own good.

520
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,440
I feel so much better.

521
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,640
I feel so much better.

522
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,920
What's the matter, you afraid?

523
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,800
What's the matter, you chicken?

524
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,500
Come on, man, everybody's doing it.

525
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
Go ahead.

526
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,700
Stroke the alien and collect the dew

527
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,960
that builds up on the side of its neck-like appendage.

528
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,780
Go ahead.

529
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,040
Now demagnetize your head.

530
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,820
Okay.

531
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,560
I think you know what to do next.

532
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,440
I don't think you're the kind of listener

533
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,460
that I'd have to explain that to.

534
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,240
Now are you?

535
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,560
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

536
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,720
Yeah, I think they know just what I'm talking about.

537
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh, they like it too.

538
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,720
Oh, they're first damn good.

539
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,900
I don't know what to do next.

540
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,620
You stand up on the hillside with your bat call

541
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,260
and blow into the bat call.

542
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,840
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

543
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,100
You can't hear it.

544
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,220
Yeah, but it's super...

545
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,220
This is so perfect.

546
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,440
It's so perfect.

547
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,800
It's so perfect.

548
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,100
I give you the wrong name.

549
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,100
And just make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready

550
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,980
for when that bat lands on your face.

551
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
You're going to have to use that pudding mighty quick.

552
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,620
But it's worth it.

553
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,960
You'll dig it.

554
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,640
Well, I don't know.

555
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,980
I'm kind of scared.

556
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
Well, it's always scary the first time.

557
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,760
That's part of the kick, man.

558
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,520
Oh, okay.

559
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,500
Come on, everybody's doing it.

560
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,200
I ain't never going to do it.

561
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,340
I'm too old to do it.

562
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,320
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

563
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,620
I'm too old for it.

564
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,020
What are you?

565
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,440
Some kind of...

566
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,340
Some kind of a weirdo?

567
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,840
Yes.

568
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,700
No, I'm not a weirdo.

569
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,520
I want to be like everyone else.

570
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,300
No, no, no.

571
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:40,740
Good.

572
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,300
Then you'll take this little alien home and...

573
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,860
I am a weirdo.

574
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,040
Hey, stop rubbing your leg.

575
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,140
I'm confused again.

576
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,980
I don't think there's a reason for her to be confused.

577
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,380
It's something you find when you open the door.

578
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,680
You take these keys,

579
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,900
and one of the keys says Bob on it.

580
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,600
You stick it in the lock,

581
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,020
and you open up the door.

582
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,420
And if you're lucky,

583
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,120
the green carpet,

584
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,780
it rolls out.

585
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,540
And if you're not,

586
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,440
the red carpet rolls out.

587
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,000
He was communicating with them.

588
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,520
What do you think?

589
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,540
I think Rockefeller was crazy that night.

590
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
He got away with the money.

591
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,460
And the...

592
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,640
How can we stop them?

593
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,480
We can stop them by stopping the pink boys.

594
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,200
If we stop the pink boys,

595
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,180
we can stop them murdering,

596
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,880
and they're killing,

597
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,760
and they're stealing,

598
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,400
and they're persifying us.

599
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:32,980
But it's so...

600
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,360
It's so difficult.

601
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,700
Oh, Jerry,

602
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,980
don't let the boy out of the house.

603
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,920
Be brave.

604
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,560
Be brave.

605
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,920
Oh, always be brave.

606
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,820
Because the women saves us.

607
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,120
Greetings to you, earthlings.

608
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
I am Princess Dragomon.

609
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,000
I have taken over this planet.

610
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,960
Now I own the earth,

611
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,760
and you'll be my slaves for all eternity.

612
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,580
The disasters you experienced

613
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,620
are just small examples of our great power.

614
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Either surrender to me,

615
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,840
or I'll destroy all humans,

616
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
I've spoken.

617
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,280
It's all a warning you're going to get from me.

618
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,240
You'll be destroyed.

619
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,880
They don't sleep either.

620
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
They're not emotional.

621
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,580
Angels don't have any emotion.

622
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,760
Another and worse war will break out.

623
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,940
When you see a night

624
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,840
with a strange light in the sky,

625
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,440
you will know it is a sign

626
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,500
that the world is about to be punished

627
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,360
for its crime.

628
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,820
By 1998,

629
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,900
every normal,

630
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,280
mediocriton,

631
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,160
pink boy,

632
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,040
admin,

633
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,200
trekkie,

634
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,920
and hippie

635
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,340
is going to be trying to get on board

636
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,960
with the good ship dogs.

637
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,760
The great set of the good ship dogs.

638
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,920
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else

639
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,140
when those aliens get here.

640
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,520
Of course,

641
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,540
such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

642
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,740
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

643
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,640
Perhaps.

644
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,800
Or, is it just a dream?

645
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,320
Or, is it just another of those prognostications

646
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,260
which have haunted man through the ages?

647
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,080
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom

648
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,820
could generally be dismissed out of hand.

649
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,300
But for the fact

650
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,860
that many of Nostradamus's other prophecies

651
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,880
have already been fulfilled.

652
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,160
But the old ones are coming back.

653
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,440
I'm going to let them through.

654
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,620
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

655
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,800
On July 5th, 1912,

656
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,300
at 7 a.m. 1998,

657
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,840
when we all have hangovers,

658
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
Wu-Tang's judgment will take place

659
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,760
in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

660
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,680
the advent of the angelic host.

661
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,840
Happy, happy Independence Day.

662
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Happy real Independence Day, my friends.

663
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,660
Because here in Dallas, Texas,

664
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,960
which is in its own time zone, you know,

665
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
all the cities that get the hour of slack

666
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,880
are in different time continuum.

667
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,960
But here in Dallas, yesterday was July 4th,

668
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,180
the day before real Independence Day.

669
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,100
You see, for subgeniuses,

670
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,120
July 4th is like the day of disappointment

671
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,900
and shattered dreams.

672
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,580
It's a day of lies and rushes to judgment

673
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,960
of drunken pinks and car crashes

674
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,940
and depraved men.

675
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,160
And we see depressing desert storm parades

676
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,840
and we mope around and think about things like

677
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,700
Wounded Knee and JFK and assassination

678
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,300
and the Spanish-American War and Vietnam

679
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,720
and Iran-Contras and Watergate and so on.

680
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,000
But dear friends,

681
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,760
dear friends,

682
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,760
July 5th,

683
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,840
July 5th,

684
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,840
that is a day

685
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,840
of hope and promise for the subgeniuses.

686
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,060
Yes, friends, the day when the true America,

687
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,360
the Bob's America,

688
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,840
the America of our Masonic subgenius

689
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,840
patriots, forefathers and foremoms

690
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,280
and foreslaves.

691
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,860
Today, July 5th,

692
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,120
in Dallas anyway,

693
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,440
is the first day of the end of the world.

694
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,560
The end of their world, dear friends,

695
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,640
because it's the first day before the beginning

696
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,080
of our world, our subgenius planet.

697
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,560
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

698
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,400
It makes me feel so good,

699
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,580
so good to have a subgenius holiday.

700
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,620
We need more subgenius holidays.

701
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,420
Of course, every day is Bob's birthday,

702
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,000
but, you know, that gets unrealistic after a while.

703
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,560
And so we call, well, July 4th,

704
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,540
what the pinks call their Independence Day,

705
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,040
we call July 4th X Day Eve.

706
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,600
And, uh, uh, X Day Night,

707
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,120
of course, we call X Day Eve.

708
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,300
Sort of like Halloween.

709
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,960
But X Day is our Independence Day.

710
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,040
Not July 4th, not Juneteenth,

711
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,160
but X-est-mas.

712
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,560
X-est-mas, dear friends.

713
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,880
And, you know, the night before X-est-mas,

714
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,340
the whole family,

715
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,700
the subgenius fully extended nuclear family,

716
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,820
goes out and watches fireworks

717
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,540
or, you know,

718
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,760
whatever else illegally sets them off in their backyard.

719
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,100
And then everyone, the kids and everyone,

720
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,020
go in and watch Freddy Krueger's

721
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,160
Nightmare on Elm Street videos around the fireplace.

722
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,320
And, uh, the kids are tucked in, of course,

723
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,700
about 1 o'clock in the morning.

724
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,440
And the grown-ups stay up all night

725
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,920
frobbing and frobbing and dooning and,

726
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,580
and gleaning and, uh, doing X Day chants

727
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,240
about how the time is nigh

728
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,740
for their arisal.

729
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,080
And, uh, songs, you know,

730
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,940
X Day holiday songs like

731
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,900
Take Me Off to Space,

732
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,280
which we'll be playing soon.

733
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
And, uh, on X Day morning,

734
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,380
of course, uh, well, the grown-ups have been up all night,

735
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,060
but the kids get up real early because

736
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,740
on X Day,

737
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,100
the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

738
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,280
And, uh, just before 7 o'clock,

739
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,580
all the grown-ups and everybody sit outdoors

740
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,280
on their easy chairs like I did this morning

741
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,120
with beers or whatever.

742
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,520
And, uh, and they do a countdown up till 7 a.m.

743
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,940
And then since it's not really X Day yet,

744
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,380
they meditate, friends, on what it's gonna be like

745
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,060
when those men from Planet X come down

746
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,840
and destroy the normal people on this planet

747
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,160
and take the weird abnormals and eccentrics

748
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,200
and those of us who have to live in disguise as a human

749
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,580
and lift us up, up and away

750
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,340
into the escaped vessels of the sex goddesses.

751
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,960
And that's what our, our religion is all about.

752
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,740
But, you know, anyway, on X Day,

753
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,460
after, after thinking about all that,

754
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,160
we sing hymns more about how the humans are all gonna die.

755
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,620
And, uh, then there's some rock and roll

756
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,280
and dancing and so forth.

757
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,460
And then everybody goes to bed,

758
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,640
usually fairly early in the day,

759
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,900
because you have to sleep.

760
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,420
I've been up all night on X Day Eve.

761
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,540
And, uh, they need to have energy for X Dayeen.

762
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,380
So on our, uh, X Dayeen,

763
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,940
when the Knights of X have arrived,

764
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,720
we're gonna have Christmas when, uh,

765
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,340
everybody dresses up in costumes,

766
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,080
dress up like angels or devils or God or, or Jesus or Bob

767
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,020
or even Negi.

768
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,660
And, of course, you can get those Bob and Negi masks

769
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,960
from your favorite subgenius vendors at Fratkin Company.

770
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,960
As seen in your start fifth.

771
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,040
Ah, yes.

772
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,920
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

773
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,560
Sha la kundala dabba soya.

774
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

775
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,860
Oh, you have to go?

776
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,340
The Exist will descend with their scientifically magic implements.

777
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,280
There'll be stalls of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

778
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,400
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear,

779
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

780
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,580
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery

781
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,080
so complex that though it is peaceful,

782
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,240
the end result will be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

783
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,460
Bob!

784
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,960
And not some conspiracy world government.

785
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,700
Must be there in a position of world leadership

786
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,840
to explain humanity's behavior to the Exists in ways they can understand

787
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,600
so they don't put us out of our misery

788
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,040
with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

789
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,720
The right people, us, must be the ones that the Exists make into superhuman overmen.

790
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,980
And even then, things will be damn tough for the rest of this period,

791
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,720
which is called the Time and Half Time.

792
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,920
The Exists have landed

793
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,760
Earth's under their control

794
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,720
Dobbs Station stands proven

795
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,840
The city's radioactive holes

796
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,880
We don't know

797
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,940
What their game is

798
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,800
But their name is

799
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,660
Unpronounceable

800
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,540
We don't know

801
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,540
What they came for

802
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,340
But what they aim for

803
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,180
Is impossible

804
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,020
But despair not, mean beings

805
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,800
In the second year before the millennium of the day of God

806
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,520
Come Wednesday

807
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,380
As in the twinkling of an eye they will come among the Yakatisma

808
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,840
Which are like unto thy great white brothers

809
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,480
They come as men, as graven images

810
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,040
As a whirlwind, and as a cloud

811
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,120
And they are now the heavens working over thee

812
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,660
The Exists have landed

813
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,240
Their machines

814
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,800
Following our tracks

815
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,260
Dobbs Station stands proven

816
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,620
A world

817
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,840
Without slack

818
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,340
Monsters like unto men will be around thee all about

819
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,060
And shall make thee to look past the door which should be locked

820
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:01,300
And thy sciences will terrify thee and bring thee naught but devils

821
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,340
For thine spirit is locked away inside the white stone

822
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,600
Which my angels have greened from the earth

823
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,280
From space

824
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,520
Which is the vessel of all that is nerd

825
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,980
And even now I show thee signs in the heaven and signs in the earth

826
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,700
Blood belches from the earth

827
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,520
My lights in the sky rebuke thee

828
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,580
The children of heaven and the angels from hell

829
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,840
Are among thee spreading lies and deception

830
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,380
They turn not as they go

831
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,360
Ah, but who cares dear friends?

832
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,340
Who cares?

833
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,900
Because the end times are coming up

834
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,520
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world

835
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,160
And we've been given, Bob has given us to see signs and portents

836
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,860
Of what will bring this end

837
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,480
What will trigger the day of judgment

838
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,340
And what it's going to be, of course we know it's going to be a day of judgment

839
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,700
We know when the exes will of course arrive July 5th, 1998

840
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,180
At 7 o'clock in the morning all over the world

841
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,220
But what triggers the end times for the other alien beings

842
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,100
The Yaka Teesma and so forth

843
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,680
Is this one moment when the world, when America becomes so decadent

844
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,140
That it no longer deserves to live

845
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,180
And that sign of the end times dear friends

846
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,960
Is the Royal Jelly Enema

847
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:47,580
At a time, 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now, may have already happened

848
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,740
A time when beggars are crowding the streets

849
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,900
And children, poor children are out starving

850
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,900
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood

851
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,260
Will be indulging in the latest hedonistic health, the crackpot health fad

852
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,160
The Crackpot Health Fad

853
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,320
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly

854
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,100
The honey fed to queen bees

855
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,540
Which costs a thousand dollars for enough royal jelly

856
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,840
To get the average jaded swinger, you know, off or whatever

857
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,420
And so at this time when the homeless are selling their babies

858
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:31,300
To procure used, leftover ambergris and royal jelly enema byproducts

859
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,060
When a Hollywood star, the moment when a Hollywood star

860
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,120
Spends $60,000 in one night on that

861
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,540
And his used jelly is sold on the streets for $200 for a half a pint

862
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,880
This so disgusts the aliens that they decide to trash the earth

863
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,100
Before the X's arrival

864
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,240
Friends

865
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,600
It's gonna be a rough time and I'm gonna, this is gonna be an all X day night

866
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,820
A night of celebration!

867
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,880
And yes, that time when Bob will come and hose down the streets

868
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,300
And clean up this crooked and perverse nation

869
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,600
So we're gonna hear from Father Joe Mama as he delves on into this as well

870
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,860
Praise Bob

871
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,880
Hello friends and welcome

872
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,880
You know most of you out there must be feeling pretty smug with yourselves

873
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,140
After all, you're alive, you're healthy

874
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,080
Your life's insured, there's a little money set aside in case of accidents

875
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,700
What more could you ask for?

876
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,660
These are good times

877
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,180
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied

878
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,780
You know they say that the golden age is never the present age

879
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,840
They really do say that

880
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,360
But we look all around us everywhere and what do we see?

881
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,220
Golden opportunity

882
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,120
Well friends, that's just calm before the sun!

883
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,200
And don't let the storm because tonight's sermon is entitled

884
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
X Day 1998

885
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,640
Day of reckoning!

886
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,680
We all know vaguely what X Day is

887
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,200
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998

888
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,920
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off to a never ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos

889
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,560
But what of the pinks that remain on Earth?

890
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,980
What will happen to the A-holes that are left behind?

891
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,620
Well friends,

892
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,900
As much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate

893
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,860
The fact is, they'll get exactly what they deserve

894
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,720
Now to any real subgenie, giving the normal what he deserves

895
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,640
Is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive

896
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,120
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries

897
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,200
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of Bob

898
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,560
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world

899
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,460
And turned it into an ever growing bureaucratic governmental monster

900
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:08,400
That feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck passing and fill in the blank

901
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:17,740
Then, once the creature's rot filled gut sprues out the digested combination of all the vices before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth

902
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,920
What's the result?

903
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,560
Why the conspiracy of course

904
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,400
And this pile of stinking defecation

905
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,300
We're supposed to kneel before and worship and serve?

906
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,500
Never!

907
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,080
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule

908
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,500
On that most dreaded of subgenius holidays

909
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,460
X-Day 1998

910
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,820
Dreaded by them

911
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,620
But not by us

912
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,880
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them

913
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,900
Shall we?

914
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,240
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways

915
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,760
Not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin

916
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,620
Indeed

917
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,660
Since Bob transcends time

918
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,240
So does his word

919
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,780
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama

920
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,020
In this story the Martians

921
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
Then a synonym for aliens

922
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,000
Later to be known as X's

923
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,460
Have landed and started to round up the normals

924
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,360
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind

925
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,060
The smarter one asserts quote

926
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,060
I've thought it all out

927
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,100
Right now we're caught as we're wanted

928
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,600
And X's are the same as we're wanted

929
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,940
The one who's the best

930
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,500
Only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run

931
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,660
But they won't keep on doing that

932
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,780
They'll begin catching us systematic like

933
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,040
Keeping the best and storing us in cages and things

934
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,960
They haven't begun on us yet

935
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,980
Not begun

936
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,580
Later he goes on to say

937
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,080
All those little office workers that used to live in these houses

938
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,920
They'll be no good

939
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,860
They haven't any stuff in them

940
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,820
They used to run

941
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,320
Run off to work

942
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,480
I have seen hundreds of them running

943
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,280
And catching their commuter trains in the morning

944
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,140
Afraid that they'd get canned if they didn't

945
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,540
Running back at night

946
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,380
Afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner

947
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,760
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents

948
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Yay and on Sundays worried about the hereafter

949
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,800
Well the X's will be a godsend for those guys

950
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,840
Nice roomy cages

951
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,940
Good food

952
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,960
Careful breeding

953
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,260
And no worries

954
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,940
Yeah after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs

955
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,520
They'll come and be glad to be caught

956
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,320
Now this is 1938 mind you

957
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,420
He goes on to say finally

958
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,980
That's not all

959
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,960
These X's are going to make pets of some of them

960
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,680
Train them to do tricks

961
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,800
Who knows get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed

962
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,460
Yay and some maybe they'll train to hunt us

963
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,440
Yes they will

964
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,240
There's men who will do it gladly

965
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,900
Well friends how much more obvious does Bob have to be

966
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,380
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS

967
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,980
It sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for reprieve

968
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,260
They repented

969
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,460
They begged forgiveness

970
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:21,900
And yet just a few days later after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast

971
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,840
Was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke

972
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,500
The normals went back to the conspiracy way of life

973
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,620
As if nothing had ever happened

974
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,260
They came so close to getting a second chance in mending their ways

975
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,280
But they blew it

976
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,420
They went back to the conspiracy masters

977
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,560
And for their loyalty they were genously rewarded with yet another world war

978
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,680
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it isn't there friends

979
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,920
Well they haven't seen nothing yet

980
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,020
Just wait till the real McCoy comes

981
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,820
It's only a few miles down the road

982
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,560
Pink boy

983
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,120
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients

984
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,840
If you're caught in a nuclear holocaust

985
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,960
And your skin begins to melt

986
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,080
Don't panic

987
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,780
This is perfectly normal

988
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,040
Yes friends

989
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,160
Just another normal way to die

990
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,800
For the normals doomed to die

991
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,140
Did I say doomed to die

992
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,060
I should have said lucky to die

993
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,780
For blessed are the dead after X day arrives

994
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,280
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors

995
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,600
Who must live out their wretched existence

996
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,960
Under the cruel and merciless X-is

997
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,820
Cruel and merciless X-is

998
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,280
Cruel to them

999
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,960
But not to us

1000
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,420
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys

1001
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,160
And golf courses for the pinks

1002
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,960
But there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore

1003
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,480
We'll be surfing the celestial stars

1004
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,900
Smoking our froth

1005
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,120
Unweaving our slack

1006
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,880
Insecting our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow

1007
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,740
Because in space friends there isn't

1008
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,760
Only back on earth will it be an Amar

1009
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,840
And then the next day

1010
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,600
And then the next

1011
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,920
It'll be an eternal hell without end

1012
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,700
And we'll be an enjoyn' it all

1013
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,820
In the heavens on close circuit tides

1014
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,300
And on the earth on TV

1015
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,680
Because we won't want to miss a single revenge filled minute

1016
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,260
Praise Bob!

1017
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,280
Amen!

1018
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,960
Take me off to space

1019
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,360
Take me off to space

1020
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,160
Come on down you saucer man

1021
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,980
And take me off to space

1022
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,380
Take me off to space

1023
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,600
Take me off to space

1024
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,380
Come on down you saucer man

1025
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,180
And take me off to space

1026
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,140
Take me off to space

1027
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,220
Take me off to space

1028
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,640
And take me off to space

1029
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,000
Take me off to space

1030
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,860
Take me off to space

1031
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,640
Take me off to space

1032
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:55,800
And take me off to space

1033
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:55,800


1034
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:55,800


1035
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:55,800


1036
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,220
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1037
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,620
Hey, cow mutilators, let me join your crew.

1038
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,840
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

1039
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,140
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face.

1040
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,180
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1041
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,620
Oh, take me off to space.

1042
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,580
Take me off to space.

1043
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,000
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1044
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,940
Take me off to space.

1045
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,060
Take me off to space.

1046
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,460
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1047
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,660
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

1048
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,920
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws.

1049
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,020
Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace.

1050
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,340
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1051
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,240
Oh, take me off to space.

1052
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,360
Take me off to space.

1053
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:54,980
Hey!

1054
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,660
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1055
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,560
Take me off to space.

1056
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,620
Take me off to space.

1057
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,820
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1058
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,200
Woo!

1059
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:08,940
Yeah!

1060
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:22,420
Oh, friends, you know, oh, I should mention that was Horton Nenslow singing

1061
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:24,900
Take Me Off to Space, that wonderful old hymn.

1062
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,420
That's one of the hymns that we like to sing on our subgenius holidays.

1063
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,140
A lovely, lovely old-time gospel hymn.

1064
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,660
Yes, yes, yes.

1065
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,480
This is Doctors for Bob in the background.

1066
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,300
Take Me Off to Space.

1067
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:51,800
Take Me Off to Space.

1068
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,300
Take Me Off to Space.

1069
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:06,540
Afterwards, another song during the show came out on the air,

1070
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,580
calling a new beginning

1071
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,580


1072
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:13,120
for Bob Sadler,

1073
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1074
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1075
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,120


1076
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,840
I will go get it this weekend.

1077
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,340
He slower, slower and slower,

1078
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:14,600
variously animated лучше,

1079
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,260
just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

1080
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,380
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

1081
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,540
What a space ovation!

1082
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,120
Now let's feel the number.

1083
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,720
And now in celebration of this great occasion we have planned a lunar party.

1084
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,540
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this

1085
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,120
great day in outer space.

1086
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,180
Bob?

1087
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:57,460
Late that Saturday night before retiring, I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor

1088
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,240
and studied it until I could close my eyes and see this man's face as though he was standing

1089
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,920
in front of me.

1090
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,700
As far as not having a face, yeah, that's what people say.

1091
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,100
I'm pretty much the same.

1092
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,060
I don't think it's a bunch of shit.

1093
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,960
I love you.

1094
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,220
Even the slides are set.

1095
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,640
Are my friends, because they're so lost.

1096
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,920
I'm gonna see them again and again.

1097
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,640
Is that before or after the bob pills?

1098
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,660
And we'll have a third sexual organ which cannot even be imagined yet in human beings

1099
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,080
in the future.

1100
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:46,500
future we'll have all 27 sexes will exist on planet earth which will make it difficult to

1101
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:54,740
to get laid on a friday night because we'd have to go to 27 separate singles bars in order to score an entire

1102
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,220
entire union yeah good afternoon ladies and gentlemen this is drew pearson we bring you

1103
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,780
this special radio television broadcast in order to give you the very latest information on an

1104
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:12,800
amazing phenomenon the arrival of a space ship in washington the rumors of invading

1105
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,300
armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false

1106
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,180
and you are not alone and you are not alone

1107
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,540
remember

1108
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,460
is

1109
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:57,680
the part of your soul which is attached to your dollar rises up with the smoke and it

1110
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,780
is received by our interplanetary excess guardians and you will be saved and in some cases we don't

1111
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,760
want the money we throw it out of the bank in order to get it back and we don't want to lose it

1112
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:06,760


1113
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:06,760


1114
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,860
throw the money in toilets and flush it down.

1115
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:18,700
But our intra-sewer sponge nine-inch worms receive the part of your soul

1116
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,140
which is attached to the money again, and you can be saved by the nine-inch worms also.

1117
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,260
Yeah, Bob can, you need Bob following you around.

1118
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,220
Bob can see through all those Bob hands.

1119
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:33,760
The nine-inch worms are the only force which can encounter the excess maggots

1120
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,820
and protect humanity from the excess maggots in 1998.

1121
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,020
The excess are going to leave Earth.

1122
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,540
Oh yeah, we'll be completely free to do whatever we want.

1123
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,940
They're just going to leave us alone.

1124
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:53,780
But their unmentionable, unnameable, horrible maggots will remain.

1125
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,280
We will be dogs to them in more ways than you can ever imagine.

1126
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,820
Unless the nine-inch worms are preserved.

1127
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,740
No, eight-inch worms aren't going to help.

1128
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,240
You know, ten-inch, ten-and-a-half-inch worms are going to be good.

1129
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,160
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will show you a good time.

1130
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,980
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will take you out on the town all night compared to those nine-inch worms.

1131
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,800
You know, people are sitting there going, excess, end of the world, 1998.

1132
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:25,620
If they don't buy the book, when 1998 comes and the world is a nuclear wasteland,

1133
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:31,140
when we're all slaves or ground beef, they're going to go, oh, I guess these guys weren't kidding.

1134
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,680
Yeah, I should have read the start fist a little more.

1135
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,020
More carefully, he said, while digging through nuclear holocaust,

1136
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,060
looking at the third hand growing from his stomach.

1137
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,540
Why doesn't it go away?

1138
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,460
Heliopters are what brings them.

1139
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,340
You can put it in your mind and smoke it.

1140
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:57,640
Heliopters are, this is a legend that is going to be revealed right now in media for the first time.

1141
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,320
Heliopters are these quasi-mechanical, leather-clad, demonic,

1142
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,660
uh, they kind of look like helicopters.

1143
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,480
They're not helicopters at first glance, but they are alive, and they're employed by a, uh,

1144
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,780
I hate to use the term minor deity, but this guy's name is Gabrogfran,

1145
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,280
and he's right up there with Bob, I'm not kidding.

1146
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,780
He's right up there with Odin and Arnold Palmer.

1147
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,320
If you ever see anything that says approved by Gabrogfran, buy it.

1148
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,380
And these heliopters are how Dr. Bobby Quipman has arrived,

1149
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,640
and oftentimes there are tons of Bob pills on these heliopters.

1150
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,660
These are special compartments that were designed for him.

1151
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,000
They're the transport of these sacred, uh, anointings.

1152
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,300
It was the, it was the heliopters that originally brought our minds to Dobbs.

1153
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,500
The rat snake manure.

1154
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,040
The stench of the spirit is like that of a million slaughtered swine.

1155
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,760
And in these times, thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of light.

1156
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,580
Hold on a minute. The conspiracy has put a slight detour in front of us here.

1157
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,440
I must change lanes.

1158
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,660
But there are other things, other evil, dark, shadowy forces at work.

1159
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,820
Work in this solar system of ours, in this galaxy, in this corner of our universe.

1160
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:15,380
Niggy, by imposing his twisted will upon the trajectories of Jehovah's neutrinos,

1161
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,860
is able to deflect those trajectories.

1162
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,640
Feasibility study ended.

1163
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,900
Abduction of human race?

1164
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,780
Infeasible.

1165
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,500
Warning, warning.

1166
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,980
Psychics applying the Hubbard's life

1167
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,640
have discovered secret Nazi UFO bases

1168
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,780
in the Antarctic.

1169
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,440
The truth that President Truman never told us.

1170
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,020
Dobbs blessed his boring soul.

1171
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,500
The hideous Uber-brow.

1172
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,160
They called you Wellman when you were a human.

1173
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,360
Before the Brow took over.

1174
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,500
Before the Brow took over.

1175
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,180
This is what I do to all your deities.

1176
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,100
Give them second until they slow way down.

1177
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,340
Therefore,

1178
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,840
there is a God.

1179
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,460
End of quote.

1180
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,300
I said you're gonna have to get yourself

1181
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,120
in discernment here

1182
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,980
and be able to discern the spirit of God

1183
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,340
from the spirit of Hinduism.

1184
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,800
I said people in Haiti, I said when the Holy Ghost hits them,

1185
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,560
they think it's Buddha.

1186
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,200
Because Buddha hits them like the Holy Ghost hits them.

1187
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,020
People in America think that

1188
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,420
when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.

1189
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,560
Yes, witchcraft.

1190
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:32,740
Yes, witchcraft.

1191
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,020
Throws people down.

1192
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,340
They see demonic visions.

1193
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,220
And the devil uses them.

1194
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,580
Buddhism and witchcraft.

1195
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,320
And the powers of the pagan gods.

1196
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,900
The powers of the pagan gods

1197
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,160
produces lying signs and wonders.

1198
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,200
But I want you to know that the pagan gods

1199
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,420
and their false religions

1200
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,300
can do what they're doing in the war.

1201
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,920
Bless God, what can we do with a true God,

1202
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,580
with a true Christ, with a true Holy Ghost?

1203
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,080
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

1204
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,640
Hallelujah.

1205
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:07,980
Hallelujah.

1206
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,000
How would the God God take the scales off your eyes

1207
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,300
and open your eyes to behold

1208
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,700
that the Lord's coming is at the door

1209
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,560
and that all that's happening in the world

1210
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,700
is getting us ready for Jesus Christ

1211
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,260
to dwell in the fullness of God in the saints.

1212
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,440
That we will come forth with revelation

1213
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,740
and manifestation.

1214
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,420
And the manifestation of the Holy Ghost

1215
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,360
revealing Christ to the world.

1216
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,280
That we will possess in our temples

1217
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,600
the very fullness of the Spirit.

1218
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,460
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.

1219
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,960
We'll be filled with it.

1220
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,080
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

1221
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,220
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

1222
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,120
I don't care.

1223
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,700
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines

1224
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,680
and around here.

1225
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,600
Call me anything.

1226
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,720
But I'm preaching the truth.

1227
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,980
They can talk about me and turn on this minister

1228
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,880
and say this ain't real.

1229
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,660
But you let one of them hypocrites

1230
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,620
come and show where I'm wrong

1231
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,200
and take the Bible and prove that this ain't God

1232
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,320
and this ain't the Word of God to the people

1233
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,860
and I'll leave tomorrow.

1234
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,100
Hallelujah.

1235
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,080
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

1236
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,300
You say why?

1237
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,920
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas

1238
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,620
and the state of Alabama, Florida, anywhere else

1239
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,440
can take the Word of God and prove this is wrong.

1240
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,420
They may lie.

1241
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,660
They may accuse.

1242
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,740
They may tell all manner of evil.

1243
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,900
But they cannot touch the Spirit.

1244
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,720
They cannot touch this Word of God.

1245
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,700
This is the Word of the Holy Ghost.

1246
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,220
This is God's promise.

1247
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,500
This is God's Word.

1248
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,780
God's truth to you.

1249
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,980
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1250
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,960
Hour of Slack.

1251
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,640
For free information on Bob Dobbs

1252
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,100
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1253
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,780
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1254
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,740
Got your pencil ready?

1255
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:54,220
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1256
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,720
That's Bob, P.O. Bob.

1257
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:01,440
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1258
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,340
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1259
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,860
Back is evil.

1260
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,620
I don't know.

1261
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,280
My wife, she fell down and they've had to pick her up.

1262
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:18,900
Her leg's okay.

1263
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,900
And something, you can't get something for nothing.

1264
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,120
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

1265
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:23,920
It.

1266
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,880
You know what I'm talking about?

1267
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,960
If it, if it, if it ain't one thing, it is gonna be another.

1268
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,000
It may be coming back on that opposite reality chain.

1269
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,380
You know, the one coming back the other way?

1270
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:34,600
It's like a big eight.

1271
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,440
It's like a big eight.

1272
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,940
If it weren't for nothing, in contrast, you know,

1273
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,960
we'd be like nothing, too, compared to it.

1274
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,480
And you can't know nothing unless you know everything.

1275
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,360
But you can't know everything unless you know nothing.

1276
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,500
I mean, people say crazy things.

1277
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,200
They get in there and they say,

1278
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,620
but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world

1279
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:53,900
and the abode of the lost,

1280
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,860
and they say that ain't real.

1281
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,900
And I've seen it down there on the seventh level.

1282
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,240
And I, I, the mystery, the mystery, the mystery,

1283
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,880
it just, it just tears us apart, the mystery.

1284
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,840
And if we can just say,

1285
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,840
I know, I know that everything will be fine.

1286
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,740
I know that it's real.

1287
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,980
You know we're not the same as we are.

1288
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,300
W.I.J.V. has got me now.

1289
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:22,040
We are, we are, we are,

1290
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:31,720
we are, we are, we are, we are, we are.

1291
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,400
Ah yes, there, friends.

1292
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,220
Don't you feel that sometimes you just have to let one go.

1293
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,700
I pinched in a big old little...

1294
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,600
Hi, Jim.

1295
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,680
Hello there, Irving.

1296
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,340
Irving's day.

1297
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,300
Hi, hi you guys.

1298
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,080
Hi, there's Doug.

1299
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:01,920
New York tape.

1300
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,340
Well, here's another one.

1301
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,840
And we like to listen to New York tapes, too.

1302
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,380
And another one.

1303
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,360
We've heard this before.

1304
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,220
Yeah, I mean, you guys are feeling good all over.

1305
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,980
Feel alive.

1306
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,780
We're breathing.

1307
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,260
I'm eating.

1308
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,640
I'm eating.

1309
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,520
That's living through.

1310
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,640
Want to hear me chew?

1311
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:29,980
I don't know.

1312
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,460
Are you any relation to Bulldog Drummond?

1313
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:35,700
Arnold Stang?

1314
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,000
Arnold Stang?

1315
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,700
Let me talk to those subgeniuses.

1316
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,980
I've got to talk to those subgeniuses.

1317
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,600
I'm going to speak backwards.

1318
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,340
The devil spoke to me.

1319
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,880
Many birds.

1320
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,340
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1321
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,440
If this day in beautiful North Texas comes to an end,

1322
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,780
we hope we've been a pleasant part of your day.

1323
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,740
We strive for quality and are happy to display

1324
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:05,840
this National Association of Broadcasters seal of good practice.

1325
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,560
We hope you've had a good day

1326
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,160
and that you'll join us again tomorrow.

1327
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,120
Good night.

1328
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,380
Good morning.

1329
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,320
This is Doug.

1330
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,080
And I'm here in the laboratories.

1331
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:18,020
And this 90-minute,

1332
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,520
this set has not been totally filled up.

1333
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,320
Unfortunately, since I edited all that stuff,

1334
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,740
some new junk came in.

1335
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,920
So, uh, yeah, right.

1336
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,020
Some of these people I have been told

1337
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,320
can get high off of human blood

1338
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,080
or can get high off of animal blood.

1339
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,180
But they feel very strongly

1340
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,720
that the blood from certain animals

1341
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,620
at certain points in time

1342
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,620
and the things that are done

1343
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,500
at certain points in time

1344
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,260
give them strength,

1345
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,420
give them power over certain things.

1346
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,220
Tommy Roy Bland of Louisville.

1347
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,140
This man says no.

1348
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,020
It's all a myth.

1349
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,040
A crazy hoax dreamed up by somebody

1350
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,840
and built into a national fixation

1351
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,260
by a sensation-seeking press.

1352
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,480
Get out of the car!

1353
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,460
Get out of there!

1354
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,900
There's nothing in the sky!

1355
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,160
Dr. Travis, get out of the wheel!

1356
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:02,920
I can't!

1357
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,580
I feel...

1358
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,860
Get out!

1359
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,620
Get out!

1360
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,380
Get out!

1361
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,160
Get out!

1362
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1363
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1364
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1365
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1366
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1367
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1368
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1369
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1370
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1371
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1372
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1373
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:18,240


1374
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,760
This is Antron.

1375
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,760
This is Antron.

1376
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,160
Attention, humans.

1377
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,320
I am speaking through the medium of

1378
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,340
Ivan Stang.

1379
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,580
To you, humans,

1380
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,400
we planted the seeds of life

1381
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,380
on this planet

1382
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,860
10 billion years ago.

1383
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,280
Seeds all atomic.
