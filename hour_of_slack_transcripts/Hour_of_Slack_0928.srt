Bob?

24
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,180
There's no business

25
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,220
like show business

26
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,280
like no business

27
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,220
I know

28
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,360
everything about it

29
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,000
is appealing

30
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,080
everything that traffic

31
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,920
will allow

32
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,120
nowhere could you get that

33
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,280
happy feeling when you

34
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,000
are stealing that

35
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,780
extra bow

36
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,240
Bob, what a relief. How are you

37
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,840
doing tonight? His name is Bob.

38
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,100
Bob is not the illegitimate

39
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,720
son of Michael Jackson.

40
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,240
Take it.

41
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:57,660
Take it with me.

42
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,100
Here you see, it's not Mr. Bob.

43
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,060
Come on, how many? Come on, Bob.

44
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,900
How many posts do you take to spin the light bulb?

45
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,860
Bob? Come on, Bob. Come on.

46
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,300
Will seven be enough, Bob?

47
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,480
Watch out.

48
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
The bob, it's loose.

49
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,840
It's coming this way. Back, back.

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,720
I created you. Back, back.

51
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,540
No!

52
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,300
It's later than

53
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,660
you think.

54
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,220
The terrible spitting vengeance of

55
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,680
Bob's mighty staff shall

56
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
scour clean this planet and the

57
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,760
all-pervading radioactive

58
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,580
pestanche of his boundless supernatural love.

59
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,820
Wake up. Open your heart.

60
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
Drop your pants. Close your mind

61
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,200
and bend over because he'll be

62
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,240
kicking and taking names.

63
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,060
Dear brothers and sisters,

64
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,440
he'll be struggling and gasping. His face

65
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,700
will turn blue. Then Bob will pitch over on the floor

66
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,600
in the grip of a massive

67
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,940
coronary thrombosis.

68
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,000
And we will be there to see that event

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,860
and to record it for you.

70
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,900
And that's the way we live.

71
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,240
Name of time.

72
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,600
Don't you see that he's dead?

73
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,860
Wait a minute, Bob.

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,220
They try to say

75
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,240
things.

76
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,620
Don't leave me here.

77
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,580
They try to make

78
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,640
me say things.

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
Don't leave me here.

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
Well, now, you can believe that you're

81
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,860
not going

82
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,840
to hell. As a subgenius,

83
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
you can believe that you're not going

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,300
to hell. But, my friend,

85
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,380
you've got to face the fact

86
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:36,980
that you are in hell now! In hell now! Are you not? Do you not have to slave your butt

87
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:46,900
off for a damn job of some kind? Do you not have to pay income tax? Do you not have to

88
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:54,660
get the common cold and worse things that come from fornication? But should naturally

89
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:06,340
be without disease. Hey, hey, my friend, yes, you're in hell now. Your marriage may be hell.

90
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,340
Your lifestyle may be hell. You may be needing to change your lifestyle and quit taking them

91
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,840
so much, but you just can't. You just can't. Well, Bob's been in your shoes. Bob, understand,

92
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,560
Bob ain't telling you that you've got to clean up or nothing.

93
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,480
Bob's just telling you to get your ass in gear, son. Enjoy life like Bob. Frankly, you

94
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,200
know, the church of the subgenius is nonsense. I mean, it's triviality. It has no significance

95
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,340
for anything that anybody's going to care about for any length of time. You know, it

96
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,840
may be lots of fun, and I don't mean to belittle it as such, but when you're faced with a serious

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,800
situation, you've got a world that's on the verge of nuclear holocaust and the all-democratic

98
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,700
institutions in this country that haven't already vanished are under severe attack,

99
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,640
and when all of a sudden, you've got a world that's on the verge of nuclear holocaust,

100
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,640


101
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,640


102
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,660
it's like the world you're in. And so when some people are in trouble, we're going to

103
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,660


104
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,660


105
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,280
we've got to deal with as a church of the subgenius. I think what comes to mind as the

106
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,900
church of the subgenius, I've got to think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble

107
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,620
we're in. Well, just to try and put the church of the sub genius to rest, those of you who

108
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,300
are not familiar with it, the church of the subgenius is essentially a group that, and

109
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm sure that people will argue with me on this, but it's essentially a sort of a comedy

110
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,280
routine. I mean, they may have a philosophical point, but it's based on humor. There are articles

111
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,460
about it in John Rubenstein's, John Carroll's column in the Chronicle and things of that nature.

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,940
It's more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.

113
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,340
It's about as politically weighty or less politically weighty than, you know, Saturday morning kids TV.

114
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
So there's nothing to it.

115
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Okay.

116
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,060
Thank you.

117
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,620
Thank you.

118
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,740
It was a themopod of the beginning, but then, yea and lo, it became an if-a-pod.

119
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,300
Yea, he cometh in, he turneth on with the right hand, and yea, he turneth off with the left hand.

120
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,440
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.

121
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,260
It may sound ridiculous to many unbelievers out there.

122
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,320
It may sound impossible.

123
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,820
Satan is real.

124
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:12,860
Working.

125
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,380
In spirit.

126
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,680
You can see him.

127
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,460
And hear him.

128
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,840
In this world.

129
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,380
Every day.

130
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,980
Satan is real.

131
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,000
Working.

132
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,440
With power.

133
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,700
He can tempt you.

134
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,680
And lead you astray.

135
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,940
I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago.

136
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,900
A prayer was led.

137
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,840
By an old country preacher who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang,

138
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,620
My God is real.

139
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,200
A warm breeze through the open windows brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field.

140
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,840
And the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence as the preacher opened his Bible to read.

141
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,760
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age, his hair thin and white, and said,

142
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,260
Preacher!

143
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,560
Preacher!

144
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,400
Tell them that Satan is real too.

145
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:21,820
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world.

146
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,520
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart.

147
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,620
I know that Satan is real.

148
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,020
For once I had a happy home.

149
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
I was loved and respected by my family.

150
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,840
I was looked upon as a leader in my community.

151
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,540
And then Satan came into my life.

152
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:42,540


153
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I grew selfish and unneighborly.

154
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,680
My friends turned against me.

155
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,820
And finally my home was broken apart.

156
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,040
My children took their paths into a world of sin.

157
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,020
Yes, preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real.

158
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,860
And to know that in him all things are possible.

159
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,240
And we know that heaven is a real place where joys shall never end.

160
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,020
But sinner friend, if you're here today, Satan is real too.

161
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,020
And hell is a real place.

162
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,480
A place of everlasting punishment.

163
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,780
For a long, long years, stole many a man's soul and faith.

164
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:57,600
I was around when Jesus Christ at his moment of doubt and faith.

165
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,820
Made them sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate.

166
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,640
And I was pleased to meet you.

167
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,960
Hope you guessed my name.

168
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:28,420
Cause what's possible in you is the nature of my game.

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,120
And is your soul clean?

170
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,140
When the devil comes by your door.

171
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,620
Are you ready to meet the devil at the crossroads, my friend?

172
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,040
All hands on deck!

173
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,180
Are you gonna have what he demands in the way of...

174
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,580
I seek out a gift.

175
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,800
Dick, that's far too many.

176
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,080
We'll have to call you the Centipede Man.

177
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,820
Now sit down here. You're not the first experiment to fail.

178
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,820
I was waiting to be hanged in the morning.

179
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,340
But I didn't care about that.

180
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,780
I opened the door.

181
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,620
And there was the captain and his first mate.

182
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,520
I swung the hatchet, splitting the captain's head wide open.

183
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,820
I turned and nearly chopped off the first mate's head at the neck.

184
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,880
There was blood and gore everywhere.

185
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,120
And I was glad for what I'd done.

186
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,940
Or captain, look what he's done!

187
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,360
He's dead!

188
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,760
Ha!

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,280
Stand to, men.

190
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,100
Men, you swabbies there, stand to.

191
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,120
Oh, yes, I...

192
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,300
Murder on the high seas is no more or less a...

193
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,380
It's a moral act!

194
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,820
Lieutenant Smith, could you start the...

195
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,640
Off with his head! And scoop it out and put a candle in it!

196
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,480
And on with his new face, thanks to luxuriant and the beautiful skin treatment you can wear like a hat.

197
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,700
I see she's a virgin.

198
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,780
Are you, uh, two?

199
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,760
Ah, she looks like a used virgin, Tash.

200
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Quite used.

201
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
In fact, you can smell her a mile and a half off, three fathoms away.

202
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,180
She's as used as a dog in heat.

203
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,540
You could smell her three fathoms under.

204
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,800
Ah, yes, you are of a mind to smell things in Poseidon's locker.

205
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,780
If you wanted to go to where the frozen food locker is.

206
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:43,280
And his body hung from the yardarm at the neck, and he dangled in the wind for the rest of the trip to the Americas.

207
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,340
Is that an albatross, sir?

208
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:57,160
No, Ponch, it's not an albatross. Had we seen an albatross, it would be viewed as an omen of good fortune.

209
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,600
I personally believe that... I personally believe that this is a fetish burden.

210
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,340
A need of Central America. It wouldn't be far off from the Cammy Isle.

211
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:20,100
And, uh, friends, we'll be right back to the hellish trip to deep inside Dave's brain.

212
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,920
Here on the Hour of Slack, Slack for everyone but Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

213
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,700
Oh, testiculoids and lactators, it's an ESO radio subgenius night.

214
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,840
Or timeless day.

215
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,480
For inside Dave's water-filled head, there is no time and less money.

216
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:51,440
Chaz Smith, friends, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and we will continue with the Devil on the High Seas of Dave's brain.

217
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,480
But first, credits, friends. That Sympathy for the Devil version was by Tia Matt, and you will be hearing the rest of that.

218
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,040
Satan is real.

219
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,380
It was by the Lauvin Brothers, posted to all binary Slack by Magma3.

220
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,380
Usopods and Themopods is by... and the Bub Dubs radio, old radio.

221
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,320
Ancient KPFA Berkeley sub-show of Hal Robbins, Puzzling Evidence, Gary Gabroke-Frame, and Bob Nelson.

222
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:24,000
Let Me Play My Music is Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush.

223
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,020
You also heard Pope Meyer, Pope David N. Meyer, the Pope of all New York, and myself, Reverend Ivan Stang, on this show.

224
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,940
And Media Barrage 10 remix, a subgenius CD.

225
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,680
And Ghost Riders in the Sky was by Dick Dale, my friends.

226
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:51,100
The ESO show, which is most of what follows, is broadcast from WCSB Cleveland State University, friends, every Thursday at midnight on the net at WCSB.org.

227
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:56,000
With host Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and now this beefy message.

228
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,260
You like beef?

229
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,720
Mommy, I'm scared of the clown.

230
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,380
Beef on the hook.

231
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,460
Beef by the pound, by the ton, and by the honey bun.

232
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,080
We got beef for ya at Tim and Terry's Slaughterhouse.

233
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,080
Stop in and we'll smack them down and deliver it fresh and piping hot, or creamy smooth, the way it's supposed to have been.

234
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,620
Mommy, the clown scares me!

235
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,620
That's alright, son. They're supposed to scare you.

236
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,000
The clown makes us laugh.

237
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, the clown takes away our fear.

238
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,020
Because it reminds us of our own absurdity.

239
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,700
Our own mortality.

240
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,640
The clown makes us laugh.

241
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,200
But the tightrope walker...

242
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
...inspires us.

243
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,020
Yes, the tightrope walker makes us fear death. Makes us fear death.

244
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,520
Shining in their silver suit in the spotlight high above.

245
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,660
We can't all be tightrope walkers.

246
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,860
On the center of radio.

247
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,180
Most of us have to be clowns.

248
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,660
Top-eyed, tickled teeth and his amazing dangling unit.

249
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,020
There's more clowns than acrobats.

250
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:14,500
Even before more stunts with his oops don't be in the buff than you've ever seen available or possible to any human-born woman.

251
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,340
You won't believe that something this hideous could survive.

252
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,140
But it's real. It's here. It's only 50 cents.

253
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,480
Lonesome Cowboy Dave. See him. Hear him. Smell him.

254
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,480
It's alive. It's real. It's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

255
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,300
See the freak. See the hideous subversion of God's nature.

256
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,620
Step behind the curtain and see the freak. Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

257
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,940
I'm afraid of fire, man. Stop flicking that lighter at me.

258
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:49,980
Hey lady.

259
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
Ha ha ha. Look at the freak.

260
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,260
Yeah. Well if I looked like you did then I would be one to be pointed.

261
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
Yeah. Where'd you get that rouge, you old bitch?

262
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,080
Yeah.

263
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,480
Yeah.

264
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,020
Hey. Ah ah ah. Oh man. Come on, man. I got a little psych or something.

265
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,820
I'm just here...

266
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,620
It's kind of a little funny. Look at уч.

267
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,960
Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak.

268
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,340
Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak. Freak.

269
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,420
It's alright.

270
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh Dave, how could things have gone so terribly wrong?

271
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:27,000
Once you were a strapping, young lad, with a peachy, dark complexion and miles and miles of good humor.

272
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,240
Man, look at you now.

273
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,740
Your testicles are dragging on the ground.

274
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,200
Crawling in your own pits.

275
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,900
It was a lot of fun back then, wasn't it?

276
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,640
You're wearing like I'm a skater.

277
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,760
There ain't a lot of money in New York City.

278
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,560
Yeah, man.

279
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,460
Those were the days.

280
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,480
What do you think you're doing else?

281
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,760
Now you have a spong the size of an elephant's trunk.

282
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,680
Freak!

283
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,320
Those were the days, man.

284
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,060
I was hung like a horse.

285
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,000
Why?

286
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,580
Oh, man.

287
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,720
Am I ever going to get out of here?

288
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,540
It's not cool.

289
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,480
And so Dave curled up inside the dumpster behind the jack-in-the-box.

290
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,940
A hated cold rain.

291
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,660
With the rain pouring down on his shivering bones

292
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,380
as he waited for Bob to come and deliver.

293
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,560
Hey, that's my spot.

294
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,620
What the hell are you doing?

295
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,920
Get the freak out of here.

296
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,440
Cut off your eyes.

297
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,400
Hey, hey.

298
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,080
Taking the abuse of passerbys.

299
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
Oh, man.

301
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,820
I can't live like this anymore.

302
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,580
No, no.

303
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,780
It's horrendous.

304
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
What am I going to do?

305
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,740
Hey, lady.

306
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,140
What are you doing over here?

307
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,560
It's just, just passing by.

308
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
Don't talk to that freak, honey.

309
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,400
Come on.

310
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:47,880
Hey, lady.

311
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,680
Wait, don't go.

312
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,920
Please don't listen to that guy.

313
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,600
Back here.

314
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,320
Dave.

315
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,780
Back here behind the curtain.

316
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,980
Take a good look at him.

317
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,600
He's got a good looking eye.

318
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,340
Take this envelope.

319
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,720
Go down to the pier.

320
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,540
This is a passage to America.

321
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,940
Just shut up and go now.

322
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,220
What's in the envelope?

323
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,480
Just shut up and go.

324
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,740
Give it to the man on the board.

325
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,460
He was able to escape London

326
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,980
and made his way to America

327
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,840
where he was adopted

328
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,180
by a tribe of Iroquois

329
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,660
who took him

330
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,580
into the sacred cave

331
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,080
of the bear

332
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:20,940
droppings.

333
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,300
And they showed him there the paintings

334
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,160
which predicted

335
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,360
that someday a cowboy would come

336
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,180
alone.

337
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:30,980
Him here.

338
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,000
Him here.

339
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,200
And no white cowboy arrived finally.

340
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,980
Prophecy come true.

341
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,820
Better known as

342
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,040
Lord Sun.

343
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,820
Lord Sun.

344
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,380
Lord Sun.

345
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,920
Lord Sun.

346
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,980
Lord Sun.

347
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,640
Made their way through Wolf Pass

348
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,340
and we had a great sight.

349
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,480
There's your grandpa there.

350
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,560
He was quite a figure.

351
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,140
Knock him down.

352
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,240
Bring out the women

353
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,620
that they might receive

354
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,140
the seed of the bear.

355
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,620
The day of the mass sting.

356
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,560
He was brave.

357
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
I can't go all the way back.

358
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,300
No, no.

359
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm going far enough.

360
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,000
No, no, no.

361
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,360
Come on, come on.

362
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,920
You gotta see the rest of the exhibit, Dave.

363
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,380
Just hunker down.

364
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,500
He'll get through it.

365
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,720
It's not a matter of moments.

366
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,920
And hence when the first wood teachers

367
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
came to our land.

368
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,000
And here's about four or five of us

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,520
attacking about three hundred of them.

370
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,000
No way, Dave.

371
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,880
No way, Dave.

372
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,220
No way, Dave.

373
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,160
No way, Dave.

374
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:23,780
No way, Dave.

375
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:23,840


376
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,140
No way, Dave.

377
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


378
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


379
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


380
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


381
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


382
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,140


383
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,480
No, no, no.

384
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,500
The tribe took them in as a god.

385
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,600
They worshipped him

386
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,620
tied to their totem pole.

387
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,420
Bring out the burning pot.

388
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,420
Okay, you guys.

389
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,380
They decided to feed him to himself

390
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,120
as an act of sacrifice.

391
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,360
Okay, now,

392
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,200
once you get the papadum

393
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,720
and they danced around the pot.

394
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,180
And the papayas.

395
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,160
As the lonesome Dave ate.

396
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,660
He's on his own train.

397
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,540
And you guys can all join in too.

398
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,080
Once I get down to below my navel,

399
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,360
I don't know if I'm gonna stop.

400
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,400
And here came the ballerinas.

401
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,000
Popping like a little pork.

402
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,900
Hundreds and hundreds of ballerinas

403
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,220
in pink foofloos.

404
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,320
Oh my god, I've never seen such a display

405
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,960
of hirsute masculinity.

406
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,020
The lady in the farthest corner of your left eye.

407
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,700
They're all she-males.

408
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Appears to be wearing a, uh,

409
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,800
wolf-man suit.

410
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,260
Oh my god, they have no underwear.

411
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,460
This is disgusting.

412
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,040
Some sign of a walnut costume.

413
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,960
Halloween day hat

414
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,720
wrapped in a neck to the back of her shoes.

415
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,020
And as we can see from bottom under top,

416
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,380
the off-camera shot shows her undulating with Pappy

417
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,660
in the bar room beforehand.

418
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,720
And isn't it wonderful how she can move

419
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,920
the lower thing there.

420
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,160
But slowly the drug began to wear off.

421
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,800
And lonesome slowly awoke from his peyote-induced

422
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,820
trance of wonderful ballerinas.

423
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,620
And looked around him to see an altogether different reality.

424
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:12,100
Oh my god, I'm back in that thing again.

425
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Oh, shush, shush.

426
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,840
Look at the freak.

427
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,400
Look at the freak.

428
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,620
Oh, he's getting sass.

429
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,900
Beautiful ballerina.

430
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
And then...

431
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,060
Remove his arms.

432
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,200
Remain calm.

433
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,460
And let them repeat the lies.

434
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,080
And reattach them.

435
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,880
Now you're out of sync.

436
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,740
The process is about to begin.

437
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,740
Now he will remove his head.

438
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,920
And reattach it.

439
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,060
Notice how we are able to keep his head alive.

440
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,900
All by itself, hooked up to these pumps and bellows.

441
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,100
That's quite a sandwich right there.

442
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,780
It comes with a side of slowing.

443
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,720
And if you'll check closely, Dave's ears are actually paranormal.

444
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,640
That's what they used to call in the old country.

445
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,600
He can actually hear sights and sounds below his own vision.

446
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,820
That is if he's looking at anything at all.

447
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,640
Look at that Aaron stare.

448
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,420
Let's scoop it out and put a candle in it.

449
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,300
Look at the freak.

450
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,200
He's a geek.

451
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,520
Look.

452
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,360
He'll eat a live chicken or veggie.

453
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,740
Don't look at that.

454
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,780
Hey Dave.

455
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,420
Hey Dave, come on over here.

456
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,860
Get a little closer to the window.

457
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,240
Can you hear me?

458
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,600
I can hear you just fine, man.

459
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,140
I got a little proposition for you.

460
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,020
See these things I got in my hand?

461
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,180
They glow in the dark.

462
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,160
See that three of these things?

464
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,260
You hold them together like this.

465
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,480
And you can do anything.

466
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,700
You could be out of here in a matter of minutes.

467
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,360
See, Dave?

468
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,020
We have brought you here to pass on the sacred orb.

469
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,880
Dave, listen.

470
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
I'm trying to make it go away.

471
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
You have passed all the tests.

472
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
No, I can't look at you.

473
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,120
I won't pay attention.

474
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,260
He has even passed the sacred stone on his kidney.

475
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,580
No, I have not.

476
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,080
I have.

477
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,740
I've passed the sacred stone.

478
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,420
Oh my God, a bloody wad of my own existence.

479
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Now prepare to receive the orb.

480
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,300
This is what I was made to use.

481
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,740
This is what I was born for.

482
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,700
Bend over, human.

483
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,340
I can't even repulse with my own legs.

484
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,580
Bend over, human.

485
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,220
Thanks for your attention.

486
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,100
The daunt.

487
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,340
The protuberance appears to have been clipped off

488
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,000
in one of the frost addresses.

489
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,020
And if we could see here the colon area,

490
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,660
also nice and shiny and clean.

491
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Nurse, suture.

492
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,260
The second team of remnants of the toxic material.

493
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,000
Scalpel.

494
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,280
Scalpel.

495
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,200
It just scooped out like this.

496
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,280
Give the vacuum cleaner.

497
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,900
Vacuum.

498
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,720
Vacuum cleaner.

499
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,480
Vacuum nurse.

500
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,360
Vacuum cleaner.

501
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,340
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,360
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

503
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,040
You were playing golf while I was scoping out the patient's brain.

504
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,300
I was on the clamped hold.

505
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,600
Yes, clamped.

506
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,640
Hold it for him.

507
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,120
Where is that handle?

508
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,780
Suction.

509
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,460
Suction.

510
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,960
Right here.

511
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,480
Five slabs.

512
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,880
Clamp.

513
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,800
And a little bit of cappuccino for the whole group.

514
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,420
Well, it looks like he isn't going to make it.

515
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,560
I don't think so.

516
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,640
I'm glad to say that we've wasted our time.

517
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,160
Let's go ahead and drink the cappuccino before it gets cold.

518
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
What about the next patient?

519
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,040
Do we have any of the same ones?

520
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,360
Let's move this one out before he gets cold.

521
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,500
He's going to start stinking.

522
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,280
I think he's going to wind up stinking.

523
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,280


524
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,840
He was already cold when we were out.

525
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,300
Yeah, yeah.

526
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,420
What was his name?

527
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,160
Dave?

528
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,500
A so-called lonesome cowboy.

529
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,220
They called him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

530
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,000
He lived thousands of years ago.

531
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,420
He was a playboy of the streets.

532
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,160
A man with only one good rancid eye that did the work of many.

533
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,900
Lonesome Bovine Boy.

534
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,260
His legend lives today.

535
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,200
Across the great plains of Ohio.

536
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,160
Scrawled upon bathroom walls across America.

537
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,000
Rest areas across the highways.

538
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,080
And a plastic cathedral of hair somewhere in Oval and Ohio.

539
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,520
Truckers still fill the citizens' banderaves with his name.

540
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,960
Late into the night, he's prepared to end his own life.

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,400
To further his biopulchral purportions.

542
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,280
Roll on.

543
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes, Dave finally achieved fame.

544
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,160
But at what price?

545
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,300
At what price?

546
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,680
Well, we'll be back on Larry King Live, talking about what price?

547
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,820
Fame and fortune.

548
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,720
You're on the air with Larry King Live.

549
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,060
Human.

550
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,160
Shut up.

551
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,080
Humans.

552
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,580
Wow.

553
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,980
What a great show.

554
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:26,980


555
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,520
A quick check into the background.

556
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:37,040
This man reveals that not only has he probably a remnant of the Pleistocene era or some bygone era like that,

557
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,800
But he's also well, well underdeveloped to intake.

558
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,860
And in comparison with other Pleistocene man's or woman's of his same peer group and function.

559
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,280
Look at the size of his head.

560
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,280


561
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,280


562
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:57,260
Here we see his liver and spleen are filled with tiny pieces of roots and drawings by inarticulate women.

563
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:07,220
Sometimes when the moon is right, blue artifacts emerge from the top of his skull.

564
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,740
All hands on deck! All hands on deck!

565
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,360
All hands off my dick!

566
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,600
Have you seen the white whale in the trousers of the Daveman?

567
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:30,060
Eh? You snobs? Have you seen the white whale?

568
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:35,200
Never mind, Captain. You're getting a hernia.

569
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,300
Sit down. You're going to disturb the town.

570
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
We'll see the whale.

571
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,340
Never rest till I see the whale.

572
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,940
The whale turned belly up in the sea.

573
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,040
Uh, Captain, I'd like to remind you that we are sailing on a kind of a psychoplasmic sea, if you will,

574
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,280
and the whale is bound to eat you alive.

575
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,320
No way around it, because he's got control of your mind.

576
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,620
Oh, I'm well aware, mate, that the whale is but a metaphor for me.

577
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,060
Oh, I go, ah, a metaphor.

578
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,340
Ah, a metaphor.

579
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,020
But I'll, I'll, hand me that harpoon and I'll go for it.

580
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,140
Well, Captain, I'm afraid I'm going to have to hand you the metaphor.

581
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,760
A metaphoric harpoon, if you will, because the real harpoon resembles a large, large packing paper tube.

582
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:30,060
However, on the other hand, it is a fine, a silver, a sterling steel harpoon capable of taking down any metaphoric whale.

583
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,420
Bend over, human.

584
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:41,920
Friends, bend over for Lord God, Lord God.

585
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,240
Bend over!

586
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,440
For human, God is coming.

587
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,740
Bend over, human.

588
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,700
I stuck around St. Petersburg

589
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,200
When I saw it was a time for a change

590
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,100
I killed the Tsar and his ministers

591
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,260
Anastasia, spring in vain

592
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,980
I rolled a tank at the general

593
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,340
I rolled a tank at the general

594
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,620
Demonstrate

595
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,740
C size

596
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:18,920
Sell it

597
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,660
Sell it

598
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:26,720
Sell it

599
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,780
Sell it

600
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,800
I swear you, it's the nature of my game

601
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,340
I watched with glee while your kings and queens

602
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made

603
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,060
I shouted out who killed the canadians

604
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:16,360
When after all it was you and me

605
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,540
Let me please introduce myself

606
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,820
I'm a man of wealth and taste

607
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,880
I lay traps for troubadours

608
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,720
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

609
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,400
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

610
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:57,220
Cause what's passing you is the nature of my game

611
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:08,100
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

612
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:19,260
Cause what's passing you is the nature of my game

613
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,940
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name

614
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,740
Oh you're my name

615
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,240
Aha, stepped into your dark rancor

616
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,600
Pleased to meet you, this hall I've fram

617
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:02,880
Oh you're my name

618
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:02,880


619
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,440
You're my name

620
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,700
You're my name

621
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,260
Satan is real too

622
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,240
And hell is a real place

623
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
A place of everlasting punishment

624
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,940
Satan is real

625
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,340
Working in spirit

626
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,660
You can see him and hear him

627
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,640
In this world every day

628
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,320
Satan is real

629
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,860
Working with power

630
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,320
He can tempt you and lead you astray

631
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:30,260
You can see him and hear him

632
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
He can tempt you and lead you astray

633
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,280
He can tempt you and lead you astray

634
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,960
You can see him and hear him

635
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:20,120
In this world every day

636
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,800
Satan is real

637
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:36,920
He can tempt you and lead you astray

638
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,280
Your blood is wild

639
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,980
And oxygen flows

640
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,620
By opposing these fines

641
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:57,800
You can't live as though it's all a,-

642
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,140

646
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,440

648
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,440

A S C O U L

654
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,480
I knew I'd end up here if I kept doing it.

655
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,640
But I just couldn't stop.

656
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,240
And now look what happened.

657
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,480
What you see is a hallucination.

658
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,540
A hallucination of what could be considered the testicular problems.

659
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,640
I thought it was funny.

660
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,160
You know, make fun of religion.

661
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,040
And spray paint them dog's heads in them graveyards and stuff.

662
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,660
I mean, it was just a satire. It was all a joke.

663
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,240
I guess I must have messed up real bad.

664
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,160
I guess if Southern Baptist was right after all.

665
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,840
Don't leave a mess where you go.

666
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,280
Leave a mess where you've been.

667
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,360
What good is this $90 going to do me here?

668
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:04,960
No!

669
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
Money means nothing.

670
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,460
The soul means nothing.

671
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,640
It took salvation to triple your money back.

672
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,460
I thought hell was a big joke.

673
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,740
I thought it was a big joke.

674
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,480
Hell is an illusion.

675
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,140
All my friends are going to be there, I used to say.

676
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,220
Hey, all my friends are here.

677
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:25,640
Dave!

678
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,060
Chaz!

679
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,480
Princess Wee!

680
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,020
What are you guys doing here in Cleveland, Wisconsin?

681
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,800
For eternity.

682
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,940
Well, we're not really here.

683
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,640
We're just kind of like a figment of your imagination.

684
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,340
It's part of the Dave brain.

685
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,860
Oh, what do you mean it's not real?

686
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,320
It's like matrix to the tenth power.

687
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,140
Just part of the Dave.

688
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,080
No, you mean me, my whole life, all of reality was all, all along.

689
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,660
It was just part of Dave's imagination, not my own.

690
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,520
You mean Dave?

691
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,440
Dave was the one who was holding it all together all along, but now he's waking up?

692
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,280
That's right, Sting, baby.

693
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,680
He's waking up and he's got a problem.

694
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,080
He's grown 400 pounds in the last half an hour.

695
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:24,000
His hypothalamus is the size of a large tubular object you might call that bowling alley down there by your shoe.

696
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,480
And he's ready to sting like a bee and smoke like a smoke thing.

697
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,860
If you're not ready when he's ready, there's the door.

698
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,160
It's smoked.

699
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,500
Will the Dave ever wake up from the dream?

700
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,560
And void.

701
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,980
Or will the dream wake up from Dave?

702
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,700
Wow, man.

703
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,940
Well, I, it was 1942, I think it was.

704
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,960
Dave, inside of Dave's brain, it's beautiful.

705
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,000
It's like your journey to the center of the earth.

706
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,240
God.

707
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,840
Now look at those stalactites.

708
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,300
It's a whole other world.

709
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,500
It's sparkling.

710
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,400
Those waterfalls.

711
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,420
Those mushrooms.

712
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,920
Those sunsets.

713
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,100
I think it was.

714
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,620
It really was.

715
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,120
Yeah, it was in Ocahontas.

716
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,800
Those galaxies.

717
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,140
Those signals.

718
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,120
Those eggs and stars.

719
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:23,940
Look.

720
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,300
Those mountains.

721
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,320
Those palm trees.

722
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,660
I forget what the hell it was.

723
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,120
It's like a black light poster.

724
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,300
Only it's alive.

725
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,200
It's a couple hours.

726
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,320
Those time lapse clouds and roses opening.

727
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,940
It's just a sign.

728
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,100
Oh.

729
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,440
Well, I'd love to.

730
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,640
But I'm not a human being.

731
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:44,700
Thank you.

732
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,080
You're an amazing.

733
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
You'd call a human being.

734
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,660
Wow.

735
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,460
I'm not really human.

736
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,920
Dave's brain is beautiful after all.

737
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,520
I, it's nothing like the hell that I imagined it to be.

738
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:56,520


739
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,500
Oh, it's so shiny.

740
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,640
It's like the planet Zeron.

741
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,480
And it's, it's, it feels like home.

742
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,320
Oh my God.

743
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,460
Look at the little cherubim.

744
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:04,500
Look off the top of the mountain.

745
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:04,500


746
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,560
In the distance scampering naked women.

747
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,220
He's drooling, but it's beautiful.

748
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,940
It's like a fountain of cherry candy drops.

749
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,600
Little magicians and sorcerers running around.

750
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,140
They're trying to put a little pointed hat on his head right now, but they don't know

751
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,780
they're putting it on.

752
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,260
Shines from land somewhere.

753
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,820
Littering leprechauns and piranhas resting under the mushrooms.

754
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,120
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

755
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,080
Uh oh.

756
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,360
Oh shit.

757
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,280
Who unplugged?

758
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,800
Who unplugged the shit, man?

759
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,280
Man.

760
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,420
Somebody tripped on the cord.

761
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:34,980
Man.

762
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,660
What the hell's what's oh my God.

763
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,440
Oh, I'm sorry guys.

764
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,680
I, I think I, who are you?

765
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,760
I think I pulled the plug on Dave.

766
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,820
Who are you?

767
00:44:50,660 --> 00:45:02,060
All these years he's been in a coma ever since he was seven years old and fell into the lake.

768
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,440
Thought he could swim along with his dog.

769
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,660
They pulled him out.

770
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,480
Now he's a 50 year old man.

771
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,900
Oh my God, Ted.

772
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,540
What have they done to him?

773
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,600
Oh my God.

774
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,240
What have we done?

775
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,880
But he's still there.

776
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,760
It's all right.

777
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,200
He's alive.

778
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,660
He's still there.

779
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,760
Somewhere inside that head is the Dave brain.

780
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,000
Dave, Dave, come back to us.

781
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,620
It's been 43 years.

782
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,080
Dave, we missed you.

783
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,040
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

784
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


785
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


786
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


787
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


788
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


789
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


790
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


791
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


792
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


793
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


794
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


795
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:32,040


796
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,540
I don't ever want to go swimming again.

797
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,160
I know he'll come back.

798
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,900
Look at him like a seven year old.

799
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,180
Dancing to weird techno beat music and bothering me.

800
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,300
Call me Davey.

801
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,000
I know he'll come back to me.

802
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,840
There's a mountain of markers in my closet arguing with him.

803
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,520
Oh my God.

804
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,700
He's not a guy.

805
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,400
He's a toothless old mountain guy.

806
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,020
He's only got one eye and he's pointing at me.

807
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


808
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


809
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


810
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


811
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


812
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


813
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


814
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,020


815
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,340
It's okay, Dave.

816
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,940
Things are souring now.

817
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,500
You've clicked your heels three times.

818
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,000
It's all right.

819
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,600
We're going home.

820
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,800
You've done your part.

821
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,280
Don't, don't.

822
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,020
It's over, Dave.

823
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,900
It's over.

824
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:16,020


825
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,200
You're starting to smell a little bit, but it's okay.

826
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,100
You can stop now.

827
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,240
It's okay.

828
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,380
No, really.

829
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,420
There is no more.

830
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,900
No more rapid eye movement.

831
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,720
No arms.

832
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,200
Wake up now.

833
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,520
Peace is yours finally, Dave.

834
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,000
Your rest has come.

835
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


836
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


837
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


838
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


839
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


840
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


841
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


842
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


843
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


844
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,000


845
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,980
They'll make a religion around you that will last for thousands of years.

846
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,940
They'll think that you died back there on that yard arm, but it won't be true.

847
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,180
You get to go home now.

848
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:59,180
It's part of the protection program offered by the powers that be.

849
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,400
If you believe in Dave.

850
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,980
I do.

851
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,720
If you believe in Dave out there, pick your nose.

852
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,680
Pick your nose for Dave.

853
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,360
Everyone who can hear me now.

854
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,060
You can do it.

855
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,100
Everyone with the sound of our voices.

856
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,260
Who can hear, join us as we pick our nose.

857
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,740
Just reach down there and stick your finger up there and then just twist it around.

858
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,700
Dave will come back.

859
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,700
Just twist it out.

860
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:23,860
It's working.

861
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,880
Take the mucus out of your nose.

862
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,000
He's coming back.

863
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,720
He's working.

864
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,380
He's coming back.

865
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,740
Look at kids.

866
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,320
I can see it.

867
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,080
It's nice and quivering.

868
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:31,980
Kids.

869
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:32,480
He's picking.

870
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,440
He's picking.

871
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,080
His lips are quivering.

872
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,340
His ears are quivering.

873
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,700
Oh, he's dead again.

874
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,540
Oh well.

875
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,220
Figures.

876
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,060
Well, how long can we go on reanimating the guy who died five times in the last half an

877
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:50,120
hour?

878
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,880
It's like when a cat plays with a little lizard it finds down in Arizona.

879
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,660
Everything seems fun and then suddenly the lizard just sort of starts twitching.

880
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,780
Oh, my God.

881
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,060
Sure.

882
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,900
The cat tries to keep playing with it like it's OK.

883
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,480
But yes, you can tell there's something very wrong.

884
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,200
Very, very wrong.

885
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,660
Thank you.

886
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:12,200
Thank you.

887
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,240
Thank you.

888
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,940
Thank you.

889
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,820
Many say that the heartsick dog sought refuge with a tiny, tiddling poodle.

890
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:48,420
She gave him comfort and sheltered him in a tree to rest safely until needed by the show once more.

891
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,740
Giant eel.

892
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,320
That is very nice, dancing around in my mouth.

893
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,960
One way or another, she's going to get you, Doc.

894
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,960
Giant eel.

895
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,200
Giant eel.

896
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,380
The squid, the live ones, their livers are quite small.

897
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,000
And the squids were very small.

898
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,460
It makes them difficult to handle, you know.

899
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,380
Ah, I see.

900
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,060
I was scrambling like crazy.

901
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,140
Oh, so nice.

902
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,740
So nice.

903
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:31,960
Oh, my.

904
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,940
Oh, so nice.

905
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,020
And it wobbles in my mouth.

906
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,440
Oh, so nice.

907
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,220
If I had a nice cold beer.

908
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,800
I thought it was going to be really greasy.

909
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,860
This is so good.

910
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,160
It's really good.

911
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,220
It's like jelly.

912
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,120
This is wonderful.

913
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,380
Look at the fat.

914
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,200
Lobster brains.

915
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,960
Oh, my.

916
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


917
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


918
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


919
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


920
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


921
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


922
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


923
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


924
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


925
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


926
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


927
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


928
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


929
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


930
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


931
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


932
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:01,960


933
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,540
And it wobbles in my mouth.

934
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,240
All kinds of different streaks.

935
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,100
This is wonderful.

936
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,060
Look at the fat.

937
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,380
Lobster brains.

938
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,860
Oh, so nice.

939
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,940
Oh, so nice.

940
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,840
Oh, so nice.

941
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,200
What is that?

942
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,500
He doesn't know what he's doing.

943
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,460
Oh, my.

944
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,640
Oh, my.

945
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,020
Oh, my.

946
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,380
Oh, so nice.

947
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,980
And it wobbles in my mouth.

948
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,160
And it wobbles in my mouth.

949
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,680
And it wobbles.

950
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,560
And it.

951
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,660
I thought it was going to be really greasy.

952
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:51,540
And, friends, that was Thelonious Squid by, by Champion Jack Codini from Altbinaries Slack.

953
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,460
Thank ya'll.

954
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,860

957
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,360


958
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,360


959
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,180
I love you.

960
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,600
I love you.

961
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,320
I love you.

962
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,420
Aware, F-3.

963
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,120
Damn, that hurts.

964
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,820
I don't know, that is real flavor.

965
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,800
ESO Beach Party?

966
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,100
ESO Beach Party?

967
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,240
The beach ball is filled with a sleck of hydrogen.

968
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,640
And each and every one Sunday,

969
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,340
Yanny Funny and Ned Funky Cheller

970
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,520
is down with everything else he's done.

971
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,960
It's a first and annual beach party bunkajunkie.

972
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,320
There is truly the rest of the grave.

973
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,260
I'll bring the beach balls if you bring the cornstarch.

974
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:57,940
I'll bring the...

975
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,980
I'll bring the Saturn boosters

976
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,360
if you bring the...

977
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,180
If you bring the ocean.

978
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,680
I'll bring the sodium nitride pellets.

979
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,960
I'll bring the Apollo spice capsule if you bring the sand.

980
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,020
I'll bring crashback if I get old again and die.

981
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,420
Can you please loan me it?

982
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,600
I'll bring lonesome cowboy Dave

983
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,060
if you'll just get out of my hair,

984
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,560
shut up and go die.

985
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,360
And I'll bring your hair back.

986
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,040
Time to get out of here.

987
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,600
One wave, my magic wand.

988
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,200
We gotta leave the Dave brain for another week.

989
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,020
Thank God.

990
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,640
But it'll be there.

991
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,900
Oh, I'm afraid it will.

992
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,020
Pulsing like a diamond.

993
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,720
You'll think it's not there.

994
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,860
I heard that Dave died on your show, man.

995
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,340
That guy's out there.

996
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,980
That guy is totally out there.

997
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,640
That guy's so...

998
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,400
Man, where does he get that stuff?

999
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,520
Where do you...

1000
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,540
Man, what is that dude on?

1001
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,960
Where do you find that thing?

1002
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,860
Where did you find that Dave thing?

1003
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,660
How'd you get that all the way up there?

1004
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,860
How you gonna get that out of there?

1005
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,600
Yeah, well, I guess you can't believe

1006
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,820
he's got the whole thing in.

1007
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,580
Oh, is that a foot?

1008
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,960
What's hanging out of the...

1009
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,920
Did you sit on somebody's whole body?

1010
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,520
What's that bullet Dave thing?

1011
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,320
That's an animal.

1012
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,800
I thought it was a human foot.

1013
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,640
It's as big as a human foot.

1014
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,880
But vomit, that's not what that is.

1015
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,320
Oh, look, it's growing again.

1016
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,780
Yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly.

1017
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,720
Yolly, yolly, yolly.

1018
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,680
Yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly.

1019
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,300
Yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly, yolly.

1020
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,020
Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

1021
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,600
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle there.

1022
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,980
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1023
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,580
So believe in your dreams.

1024
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,040
Come what may.

1025
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,120
I read that right.

1026
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Come what may.

1027
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,900
There's always tomorrow.

1028
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,680
Come what may.

1029
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,100
There's so much to do.

1030
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,480
We have no highs.

1031
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,860
And so little times.

1032
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
You'll see with our minds.

1033
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,920
We have no good nights.

1034
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,460
We all pretend the rainbow has an end.

1035
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,880
We all pretend the rainbow has an end.

1036
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,000
And you'll be there, my friend, someday.

1037
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:25,160
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1038
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,240
Tomorrow is not far away.

1039
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:53,200
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1040
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,520
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1041
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1042
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1043
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1044
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1045
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1046
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,520


1047
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,780
This never happened.

1048
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,440
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1049
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,020
So believe.

1050
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,840
There's always tomorrow for dreams to come true.

1051
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,840
This never happened.

1052
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:05,580
This never happened.

1053
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,440
This never happened.

1054
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,080
This never happened.

1055
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,200
It's time for school.

1056
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,760
We now return to your television set to you

1057
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,060

00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,540

I welcome you most legally

1096
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,100
But we've got to verify it legally

1097
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,600
To see

1098
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,380
To see

1099
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,240
If she

1100
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,060
If she

1101
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,100
Is morally, ethically

1102
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,580
Spiritually, physically

1103
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,240
Positively, absolutely

1104
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,040
Undeniably

1105
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,300
And reliably

1106
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,760
Is this podium twister?

1107
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,220
I hate this moment

1108
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,180
What I want to do is

1109
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,800
Start the show with a prayer

1110
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,400
Something about

1111
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,540
A great big nose

1112
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,240
They don't call it that

1113
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,540
A poor, empty palm

1114
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,580
On air

1115
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,560
It only takes about a minute

1116
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:26,900
Oh

1117
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,080
Oh

1118
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,200
Oh

1119
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1120
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1121
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1122
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1123
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1124
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1125
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1126
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,200


1127
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,560
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor

1128
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,420
I've got a couple minutes

1129
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,260
For your speech here

1130
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,220
Go ahead
