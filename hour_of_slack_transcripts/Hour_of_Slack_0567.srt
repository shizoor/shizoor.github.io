1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Test, test, test, test.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,360
Yeah, boy, howdy.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,480
New microphone.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,860
Our prayers were answered.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,540
Jesus answered my prayers.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,280
Friends, last week I was really getting sick of using that bad mic.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:25,000
And I still have bad headphones and bad decks and bad this and bad that.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,500
But at least Jesus answered my prayers.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,280
Yes, perhaps Bob was too busy.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:40,980
But Jesus, Jesus came through with a new microphone for...

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,260
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Oh, don't mind me.

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm just making my rapist noises.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
This is Joe Offer.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,420
Of the Order of Dionysus Abasios.

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,140
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack with Reverend Ivan Stang.

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,880
A horny wizard.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,220
A horny wizard.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,160
A horny, horny, horny, horny.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,960
Yeah, that's the problem.

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,580
Too many organs and not enough cloth.

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,540
Too many jiggling obscene bunches of...

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
It's the mutations, Doug.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,880
Well, the first time I went to Theme World, I got completely lost.

25
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,460
I was in a very pretentiousness plaza.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,220
And if I hadn't been able to see...

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,400
Hey, it's all made of plastic, isn't it?

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,020
Yeah, if I hadn't been able to see the giant slack generator at the Tower of Bob towering over me,

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,040
like a giant landmark on the horizon,

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,580
I think I would have been extremely diversified.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,620
Good morning. You're washed in the pee of Bob.

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh, not again.

33
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,160
Uh, yes, I'm afraid it is true again.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,260
Yeah, it is.

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,420
It's so good to be back.

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,780
Back again and again.

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,980
But what is it with this sibilance?

38
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,200
I noticed some sibilance in our new microphone.

39
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,960
Well, I'm sure that's all right.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,500
You won't...

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,460
It won't make any difference to you, dear friends.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,280
Oh, it does feel good to hear it batter inside my own head.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,100
It gives me the feeling of the power.

44
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,880
The power of the subgenius.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,820
The rightful power that every subgenius should feel.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,360
You should all feel as if you were being...

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,780
Your voice were being amplified over gigantic loudspeakers at all times.

48
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,480
Thank God our thoughts are not likewise broadcast, eh, brothers?

49
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,040
Nudge, nudge, wink, wink for surely.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,520
They would slay us all if they were smart.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,100
Luckily, they're not.

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,480
And if only we weren't quite so smart.

53
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,440
Smart ourselves.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,620
Maybe we wouldn't get ourselves into so much trouble.

55
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,180
But it is of our subgenius nature to get ourselves into so much trouble.

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,280
I can dig it myself.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
Well, friends, we have...

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,240
We have quite a show.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,880
I have a...

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,860
Because I can speak again now.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,100
I'm still sick.

62
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
I still have the flu.

63
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,960
But I can...

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,280
I don't care.

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:28,840
I don't care anymore.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,980
That's the difference.

67
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,520
I have a big stack of notes and many...

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,340
And it's listener time.

69
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,440
It's time for the listeners to...

70
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,300
For us all to share the contributions of the listeners.

71
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,800
In fact, here's a song from a new subgenius band.

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,940
I guess you could say.

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,520
A band called Mr. Smiley.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Demo number one.

75
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,860
These guys, if guys they indeed be, are from San Francisco.

76
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,360
San Francisco.

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,920
Out of all the songs on this tape, this one was my very favorite.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Because really, it's the most to the point.

79
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,800
And yet it is also the most poignantly heartfelt, I think.

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:12,980
Thank you.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,540
We are subgenius and we must have class.

82
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
We are subgenius and we must have class.

83
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
We are subgenius and we must have class.

84
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,480
We are subgenius...

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,020
We are subgenius and we must have class.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,760
We are subgenius and we must have class.

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,560
We are subgenius and we must have class.

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,260
We are subgenius and we must have class.

89
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,420
We are subgenius and we must have class.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,580
We are subgenius and we must have class.

91
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,580
We are subgenius and we must have class.

92
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,600
We are subgenius and we must have class.

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,480
We are subgenius and we must have class.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,480


95
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,400
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

97
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,900
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,000
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

99
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,940
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

100
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,260
We are Dark Genius and we must have class.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,980
Oh, friends, listen to that amplifier buzz in the background.

102
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,400
That's part of their song.

103
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,480
Hear that eee noise in the background?

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,880
Now that is what I call to truly devote, dear friends.

105
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,260
Hear that eee noise in the background?

106
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,260


107
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,560
Hear that eee noise in the background?

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:42,560


109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:53,460
This band does obviously harken back to that Jaco homo sort of a time in the olden days.

110
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,260
It hurts my ears too, but it's beautiful.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,140
It's the kind of tape that you should take home with you and listen to over and over again

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,680
in the privacy of your own home.

113
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,360
Oh, here's a little address for them.

114
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,880
By the way, the pretty music in the background is amazing.

115
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:10,880


116
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:10,880


117
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,140
Of course, Zug's Rift from his CD Villagers.

118
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:25,720
Um, okay, the horrible Mr. Smiley is available from 445 Webster Street, number 3, San Francisco,

119
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,720
California, 94117.

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,800
And if you missed that, then you should have been typing and you should have, oh, actually

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,940
you shouldn't, because you're not supposed to do that.

122
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,620
It's a law, dear friends.

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,340
The law says, Johnny Law.

124
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,900
You know which law I'm talking about, Johnny Law, the man's law.

125
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,440
It says that no subgenius can sell or trade without the mark of the beast

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,400
emblazoned upon their microphone or upon their transmitter.

127
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,440
But you think our church has problems?

128
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,960
Let's look at some of this news here.

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,280
On wafer watch, I clipped this out of the Dallas Morning News.

130
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
It says here,

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,280
In Slidell, Louisiana, churchgoers partaking of Holy Communion at St. Charles Catholic Church

132
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,620
in Picayune, Mississippi, had better swallow.

133
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Two guards are posted nearby to make sure nobody walks out with the sacred communion wafer.

134
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,240
The guards, usually church members wearing suits, took their posts a couple of months ago

135
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,320
after a half dozen instances of people walking out of the church with the wafer.

136
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,320


137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:49,380
At Mass, the bread is changed into the body of Christ, said Rev. John Noone.

138
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,740
The Satan worshipers want to get their hands on the host, and they desecrate the host.

139
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,000
And the problem has spread from Mississippi all the way to lovely Slidell, Louisiana, he said.

140
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,980
Well, friends, you know, if every time they said the magic words

141
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:15,320
over a cracker or a Nella wafer, say, in a subgenius church,

142
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
and it turned into a bloody old hunk of Bob's body,

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,380
I guarantee you the conspiracy types and the Satanists would want to steal that, too.

144
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,980
They'd want to get a chunk of Bob's body to clone their own evil version of Bob,

145
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,440
as if, you know, anything that they could possibly do would in any way be against what Bob wanted.

146
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,960
If they succeeded, it would be because of Bob.

147
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:38,960


148
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,020
Because Bob wanted that to happen.

149
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,960
And likewise, if a Satanist were to steal the holy body of Christ

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,460
after it had been converted from a Nella wafer into, you know, meat

151
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,320
that somebody was about to have communion with and consume of his flesh,

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,680
and the Satanists ran off, cloned a new Jesus,

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,260
only raised him, you know, like Rosemary's baby or something, to be the antichrist,

154
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,820
I don't know, anyway, from time to time,

155
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,280
there are teenagers that will decide they want to be a Satanist for a day

156
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,340
and get hold of a stray animal and kill it and leave a messy scene,

157
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,360
and a layman will stumble on it saying it's ritualistic, but,

158
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,000
and this is illegal, but I'm afraid this is a question for the clergy and not the cops,

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,180
is basically what the police had to say about this.

160
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:35,340
But at St. Charles Catholic Church, the communion guards must see someone swallow.

161
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,180
They'll say, look, buddy, you're gonna have to either swallow that meat of our savior

162
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,540
or give it back, because we don't want you to take it home and clone it,

163
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:52,820
turn it into the new Hitler, the new Larry Flint, the new Jim...

164
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh, whoa, what the...

165
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,720
Was that a Satanist attack? Was that a Satanist attack, friends?

166
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,460
Now, see, if I was Bob Larson, I'd say yes,

167
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,800
but because I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, just a mere subgenius, not a guy,

168
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,780
a genius like the great Bob Larson,

169
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:16,820
I can admit that it was merely my file folder hitting pot, slider pot number six there on the right.

170
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,060
Okay, now, we'll continue with this Dr. Bronner's soap opera

171
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,500
that we call life here in the Church of the Subgenius.

172
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,900
All right, shall we?

173
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Maybe if I turn those headphones down, it'd be a little bit less sibilance, huh?

174
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,300
And maybe if I turn some background music up, then we'd have some kind of a show.

175
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:50,100
Oh, it's Dr. Imat Zephon and the Cosmic Triad jamming and noodling in the background.

176
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,320
Friends, it's 500 days to X-Day.

177
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,480
That's not the right music for an X-Day rant.

178
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,380
It's 500 days till X-Day, dear friends, 500 days until the end of the world.

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,620
And, you know, I think that it's kind of...

180
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,660
I mean, on the day that I'm recording this, February the 19th, Wednesday,

181
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:19,600
it's 500 days till X-Day, and odd that today the conspiracy would suddenly release in every theater in America.

182
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,000
The Empire Strikes Back.

183
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,900
You think about it, yeah, it sounds like a bunch of crackpot silly stuff.

184
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,660
Maybe, maybe, maybe you.

185
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,600
By the way, dear friends, I know that our listeners, if you're listening,

186
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,980
are on pins and needles just dying to know whether I've managed to continue not smoking like a...

187
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,320
I promise, like an idiot a long time ago.

188
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,880
And I haven't. I have not touched a cigarette.

189
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,140
But, you know, you know, it's so...

190
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,380
Sure, you can quit smoking, but how many of you can quit peeing?

191
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,680
I've tried. I'm gonna, I'm gonna... That's what I'm gonna do next.

192
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,500
Now, I'm announcing it on the radio in public.

193
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,820
I have not urinated since last night.

194
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,340
And I'm gonna try real hard not to.

195
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,320
I know how bad the first day is.

196
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,500
And know that the third day is a thousand times worse.

197
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,060
And it's nothing compared to the third week.

198
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,960
And that's where most people break down.

199
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
It's happened to me.

200
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,920
You try, you get up that day going, I ain't gonna pee today.

201
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,220
No problem. One day at a time.

202
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,280
Next thing you know, you're standing in a 7-Eleven, and you peed.

203
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,980
It takes over your mind.

204
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,740
It's because the urge, you know?

205
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,040
It is so difficult.

206
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,800
Anybody out there who's trying to quit, believe me,

207
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,060
if anybody sympathizes, it's me.

208
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
Jesus is trying to quit, too.

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,380
We're both trying to quit.

210
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,520
And we're... If you are, too, we're with you all the way.

211
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,940
I know how it... You just feel like you're gonna die if you can't

212
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,320
just at least go outside and have a pee.

213
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,940
Hell, you can't even do that in most airports now.

214
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,000
No peeing anywhere.

215
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,360
Not even in... You know, you have to... Literally have to go outside.

216
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,740
Outside the airport, sure.

217
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,060
Outside, there's a whole line of healthy, suntan people

218
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,240
standing there just whizzing away.

219
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,120
I don't know.

220
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,220
I don't know, friends, but we're gonna try.

221
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,300
I'm not just gonna... I'm gonna just... I'm gonna rant on.

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,580
I'm gonna rant on and not even think about it.

223
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,240
Oh, some other new news.

224
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,800
We invented a new salute in the church.

225
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,780
Oh, we're not on television. I can't exactly demonstrate it,

226
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:45,100
but basically, if you form an X with your arms in front of your face, more or less,

227
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,160
it's very militant-looking.

228
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,000
You cross your arms in the middle of the elbows with your hands making a fist,

229
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,460
as I'm doing now.

230
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,060
Hold it up in front of your face and go...

231
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,220
The time is not yet for their arisal.

232
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,320
Now, admittedly, it's probably hard for most of y'all to make that

233
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,240
eee-ah-ee-ah-ee-ah sound without your...

234
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,660
using your finger on your throat, but it can be done.

235
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,560
Oh, other news.

236
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Church of the Subgenius is selling out.

237
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,000
We've, uh...

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,720
You know, well, we've always been trying to,

239
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,320
but the conspiracy has started to make offers,

240
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,060
um, and we are now taking advertising on our website.

241
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,380
We're taking advertising on the radio show.

242
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,180
We'll take... I don't care even if these are non-commercial radio stations.

243
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,300
We're taking ads.

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,340
Um, uh, like, Absolute Vodka.

245
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,120
And we're selling our sacred slogans of Bob.

246
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,120
Why not? The world ends in 500 days.

247
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
We might as well...

248
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,380
You know, it's like, imagine Absolute Vodka ad.

249
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,820
Absolute Vodka.

250
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,900
You'll pay to know what you really drink.

251
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,380
Um, Levi's.

252
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,300
The Subgenius must have slacks.

253
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,600
Marlboro.

254
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,160
Bob sold it. I smoked it. That settles it.

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,160
Um, you know, camel... camels.

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Or, uh, no, Miller Lite.

257
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,660
Too much is always better than not enough.

258
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,480
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,960
But don't squeeze the Charmin.

260
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,080
Uh...

261
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, give me my Camel Lites or kill me.

262
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,020
And of course, the tried and true one that you can use for any product...

263
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,160
Bob says, eat Cheerios.

264
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,380
You know, Bob says, uh, buy Acme.

265
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:00,360
Because, friends, in my estimation, in my experience, in my vast experience, I've found, yes, that magic...

266
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,780
The type of magic that you're thinking of, with the M-A-G-I-C-K, with the K at the end, magic...

267
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:20,060
Magic may be real, but if so, judging by its practitioners, belief in it defeats the purpose.

268
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,780
Pardon me, the poor pose.

269
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,020
Um, but, uh, not to put down our, uh, magic practitioners, friends.

270
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:42,020
The point is, we're all slaves to the conspiracy of the normals until that day, as we free ourselves from them, and just say no to jobs.

271
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,080
Just say no to jobs.

272
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,720
How's that for a bumper sticker slogan?

273
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,140
Here I am, just giving them away for free like a crazy man.

274
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,280
I oughta just say no to Dobbs.

275
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,420
That's what I oughta do. I oughta just say no.

276
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,020
Say no, Dobbs.

277
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,140
Ain't gonna take your... take your lives.

278
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,100
You're cheating. Salvation ain't salvation at all.

279
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,900
Okay, I told you all about the, uh, the X-Day drill, uh, coming up in July.

280
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:20,740
The, the, all subgeniuses must attend the X-Day drill in rural New York, July 5th, 6th, 7th, um, at Brushwood Folklore Center.

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,500
Uh, there will be a snake hunt, the human pinata, the baby Jesus will be set aflame in the nativity scene, and you will be able to be born again!

282
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:37,360
Born again, dear friends, by crawling out of the giant vagina that we will have constructed there, because friends, the world owes you a living.

283
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Oh, I don't know about you, actually, I don't know about you, but the world definitely owes me a living, dear friends.

284
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,400
And I want my money back. Right now.

285
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,680
In one lump sum.

286
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,800
Oh man, I wouldn't mind getting me some of that lump sum right now.

287
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,900
I could really use a little bit of that lump sum right about now, dear friends.

288
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,520
I think I'm about on the edge. On the edge of my creaky chair.

289
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,740
Yeah, but that's okay. That's okay. It's just, it's the problem, it's, you know it's rough being self-employed like I am.

290
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,840
I know most of you wish you had my job, sitting here blathering like an idiot to thousands of adoring fans.

291
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,780
Uh, just waiting to get on my souped up leg.

292
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm gonna get my Lincoln Continental computer and speed outta here.

293
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:38,660
But you know, it is the problem of being your own boss, or I've worked for Dobbs, but really, I'm, technically I'm self-employed the way things worked out.

294
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:45,100
You're caught between a whining slave driver and a pushy slowpoke.

295
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,920
That is the problem.

296
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:56,040
You've got the laziest employee in the world, and you've got the nastiest slave driver of a boss.

297
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,780
Friends, how do you do that?

298
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Here's some mail we got from a listener in Memphis, Tennessee.

299
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,840
Testimony for Hour of Slack.

300
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,180
You know, that's funny because I don't believe we're broadcast anywhere in Tennessee.

301
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,380
Or Texas, for that matter. Except by internet.

302
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,020
Well, maybe this guy does listen by internet. Let's see.

303
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,620
A letter from a listener.

304
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
Dear knowers of Bob,

305
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,540
My name is Lane Deibert.

306
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,200
I am a 35 year old white woman.

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,420
Old man, either woman or white male.

308
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,420
Same thing.

309
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,060
From Memphis, Tennessee.

310
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,600
My purpose in writing this letter is twofold.

311
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,300
To order my membership ordainment.

312
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,100
Praise Bob.

313
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,080
Welcome aboard, brother.

314
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,880
And to give you my testimony in how Bob saved my life, literally.

315
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,680
Okay, now listen to this, friends.

316
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,200
By the way, the music in the background is ambient music from huge voodoo.

317
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,520
It's Bruce Grant and DK Jones in the background.

318
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,540
However, I'm going to pause them out right now while I read this man's letter.

319
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,860
Then we'll go back to tapes.

320
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,920
But we have to do this.

322
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,620
Without going...

323
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,240
This 35 year old...

324
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,440
person says...

325
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:24,100
Without going into the totally senseless details, there is no doubt in my mind that if it weren't for Bob's influence, I would be very dead now.

326
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,860
My ex-roommate...

327
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,180
is very unbalanced and cannot function without his medication.

328
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:39,340
He obviously wasn't taking it the night of October 5th, 1996 because as I lay asleep on the couch after a night of juking at the local rock joint,

329
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,740
he came in and shot at me point blank with a 12 gauge shotgun with number 5 shot.

330
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:51,260
If it wasn't for Bob's protective shell, my head would have been blown, quote, off, unquote.

331
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,620
There's a tiny little note here that says,

332
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,040
Instead,

333
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,220
I was grazed by one pellet...

334
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,540
to my head,

335
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,700
which caused minor blood loss and some stinking.

336
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,080
This is a true story.

337
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,460
Note that this is before I became ordained, although I did purchase Revelation X and Book of the Subgenius.

338
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,820
And here's the question.

339
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,340
If the ability to deflect shotgun blasts has been imparted on me for merely purchasing the book,

340
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,920
what wondrous...

341
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,600
miracles await after I become an ordained minister?

342
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,640
The mind boggles.

343
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,460
Thank you, Bob, for preserving my life.

344
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,380
I vow to praise you with my every, quote, deed, unquote,

345
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,560
and follow you down every meandering, meaningless path.

346
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Praise Bob.

347
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,880
And he threw in an extra $10 just for the heck...

348
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,140
Well, he crossed out the bad word and wrote in the heck of it.

349
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,880
And that is so...

350
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,760
How come more of you ain't doing that, friends?

351
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,620
Here's another...

352
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,660
Here's another letter.

353
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,420
This one came in email from CosmicJizz at AOL.com.

354
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,420
Um...

355
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,400
Actually, this guy is in that band that we have...

356
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,320
That horrible band that we have played.

357
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,460
Dear Poop Stang,

358
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,420
I am oozing and waiting for Jesus to get my order for more hour of slack shows.

359
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,560
It's so hard I could blow my wad right through your monitor.

360
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,220
Oh, God, I am...

361
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,140
Oh, this guy sounds sort of like Joe Offric.

362
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,980
Oh, God, I am so horny.

363
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,960
Even a Dobbs head looks good.

364
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,640
Okay, I shoot globs on Dobbs' head frequently.

365
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,600
It's part of my sex magic rights, so there.

366
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,120
Hey, when is Bob going to play Cupid and find me a Yeti uberfem?

367
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm tired of dating these nice girls that won't join in our six perverted rants

368
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,400
and run screaming before I get the handcuffs and the sex toys out of the closet.

369
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,620
You better come to the X Day Drill, my boy.

370
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,200
Okay, it will happen.

371
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,980
I can feel the lat plane tilting in my favor these days.

372
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Praise Bob, I have faith that passes all understanding.

373
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,880
I want to steal the pinks' metaphysics and make them Dobbs approved.

374
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,580
Beat you to it, buddy.

375
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,320
I could have walked on water, but I am no show-off like Jesus was.

376
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,840
What is... was?

377
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,120
Jesus is still a show-off, friends.

378
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,260
If every man and woman is a star,

379
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,600
why ain't my head shining in the sky?

380
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,180
In the dark.

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,940
Rev Paul.

382
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,840
Well, Rev Paul, it's true.

383
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,220
I don't know.

384
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,300
And now here is another way that you, the listener, can help.

385
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,880
Friends, I want you to send in your list of X Day-related songs.

386
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,680
It doesn't have to be by subgeniuses.

387
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,940
It doesn't have to have originally been written about X Day.

388
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,820
It just has to be of an apocalyptic or else a cosmically gigantic,

389
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,580
earth-shattering subject matter.

390
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,420
Not flying saucer rock and roll or a purple people-eater,

391
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,700
because that could be about the greys.

392
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,180
Things like... things that are more vague

393
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,520
about the end of the world and the redemption of the saved.

394
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,080
Examples that I hurriedly wrote down were

395
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,600
Gwar's Ragnarok,

396
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,860
Apollo 69 by Thrillkill Cult,

397
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,620
and Hey Baby by Jimi Hendrix.

398
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,480
Of course, those are all things that I've already overplayed.

399
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,000
So send in your suggestions.

400
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,760
Any band, any time.

401
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,340
And if you think I probably don't have a copy, which is possible,

402
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,420
if it's real, real modern and not fairly famous,

403
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,700
just send a tape.

404
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,820
Okay, you've got the special event Sunday, 12 o'clock,

405
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,040
Morning Mass and Nude Orgy.

406
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,140
1 o'clock to 3, Healings and Sickenings by Appointment.

407
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,760
3.30 to 4.30, Excremeditation.

408
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,600
5 to 2 a.m., Preview of the Day,

409
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,840
and the previous Saturday's Time Control Lessons.

410
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,260
Monday, 12 o'clock, Morning Mass and Nude Orgy.

411
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,320
1 o'clock to 2 o'clock, Acubeating.

412
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,800
3 to 4 o'clock, Live Alien Autopsy and Bring Your Own Scalpel

413
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,180
because we ain't supplying them.

414
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,460
People steal them every time.

415
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,080
4.30 to 5.30, Excremeditation.

416
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,180
That's when you are allowed to go if you haven't quit.

417
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,660
5.30 to 6, Meet and Greet with Millionaire Bob Dobbs.

418
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,180
Yep, Bob will be available Monday, 5.30 to 6 o'clock,

419
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,520
and that's in room 506.

420
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,560
And don't say we didn't tell you, friends.

421
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,340
It's been there all along now.

422
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,360
Continuing in my notes because, man, when I turn this mic off,

423
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,940
this wonderful mic off, I ain't going to get back on.

424
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,960
CD-ROM, Subgenius CD-ROM, just a fast-paced spew of sub-site,

425
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,640
and when you see something you like, then you stop it.

426
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,400
Otherwise, it's a media barrage video like Arise with a soundtrack.

427
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,700
The website is embedded in the frames of the video.

428
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,300
That's one Subgenius CD-ROM idea, vision.

429
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,500
Censored, censored, censored.

430
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,500
That's another, no, wait, they would be the ultimate soldiers.

431
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,820
Movie, story, neighborhood, stores, jobs,

432
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,780
Bob's whole reality slowly changes for main character

433
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,760
as Subgeniuses and Bob open his eyes

434
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,820
from futuristic North Dallas type of modern rich person thing

435
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,360
to Pobuckerland to Road Warrior desolation

436
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,240
and ends with Mutantis.

437
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,820
And it turns out that this character was changing all reality,

438
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,800
all of reality.

439
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,880
All reality and time control through,

440
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,260
Bob was changing all reality and all the world

441
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,660
by changing the way this one character sees the reality and the world.

442
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,380
See.

443
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,400
So that's my sci-fi story I need to work on.

444
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh, some more CD-ROM, the required reading list.

445
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,880
Oh, I have just so many notes here.

446
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,960
And here's the secret about the Oklahoma bombing.

447
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,520
I could read to you for another hour about how the popular conception

448
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,360
was spun off by the press corps like a clay urn that McVeigh,

449
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,340
a volatile minute man, was so bitter after failing to make the Army's

450
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,100
elite special forces, so stuffed full of froth at the Turner diaries

451
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,600
that he vented his rage on the Alfred Mura Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

452
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,640
But could it just as easily have been that he was a robotic soldier

453
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,740
with a chip implanted in his head?

454
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,280
It turned into a mad bomber, as Joseph Mengele once said,

455
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,040
the more we do to you, the less you seem to believe we are doing it.

456
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,460
And, um, yeah, I have to take implantable brain computer interface chips

457
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,100
a little bit more seriously because I have to give a talk on that

458
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,280
at South by Southwest.

459
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,460
They've decided that I'm an ex-

460
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:13,840
I didn't know what email was two years ago, and now I'm an Internet expert

461
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,540
and an expert on implantable brain chips, which, in fact, I am because I've,

462
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:24,840
if only because I've counseled so many individuals who've had the chips,

463
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,800
who they were, you know, either when they were prisoners or when they were in the military,

464
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,340
all these subgeniuses and friends of mine and kooks out there have had these chips

465
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,540
implanted in the side of their head, and it tells them all this stuff

466
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,820
about how not to send $30 to Bob, don't praise Bob, don't do what he says,

467
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,640
what Reverend Stang says, that's all they hear all day long.

468
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,880
And it's in the fillings in your teeth, uh,

469
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,800
but actually it's not just the fillings, it's your whole teeth.

470
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,360
There's a resonance that works with your teeth.

471
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,740
In that movie, um, The Twelve Monkeys, the business about,

472
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,960
pull your teeth out and that's where they have the radios.

473
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,700
It's true. If you pull your teeth out, that will help.

474
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,420
That's not where the chip is, but they help with the resonance you see from the chip.

475
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,560
Now, you may think that I sound like a crazy man,

476
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,920
but I'm, maybe I am, maybe I'm crazy.

477
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,860
Maybe I'm crazy like a fox.

478
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,820
Maybe this Church of the Subgenius ain't quite, quite a silly little joke.

479
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,300
Sure, it's a silly little joke. It is a silly.

480
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,840
It's a bunch of nerds that like to pretend they're praising Bob.

481
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,340
That isn't all it is, though.

482
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,200
It's many things. It really is a sex cult.

483
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,060
Where people, swingers get together and do stuff you probably just are dreaming of.

484
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,280
Going, why come I don't get to meet those cool subgeniuses?

485
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,280
Well, we just explained the process to you now, didn't we?

486
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,280
If you didn't pick up on it, that's your problem.

487
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,660
Ah, yes. Oh, it feels so good.

488
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,020
To have a decent microphone.

489
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,700
It makes one not want to shut up, not for a second.

490
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,440
Whoa.

491
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,900
It makes one want to express more power.

492
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,720
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

493
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,140
Any abnormal sound?

494
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,240
Normal.

495
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,320
Bob loves you.

496
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,300
Bob loves you.

497
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,700
Bob loves you.

498
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,540
Bob loves you.

499
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:50,800
Bob loves you.

500
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,900
Bob loves you.

501
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,320
Bob loves you.

502
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,080
Bob loves you.

503
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,300
Bob loves you.

504
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,500
Bob loves you.

505
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,940
Bob loves you.

506
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,320
Bob loves you.

507
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:55,640
Bob loves you.

508
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,220
Well, yes, women have offered me sex for any tidbit of knowledge about Bob.

509
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,920
Just any little Bob story I might tell them, they would offer me sex for.

510
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,360
So I just, I generally avoid that subject.

511
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,560
Oh, Cord, I know what you mean.

512
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:17,640
And friends, we're back with Suzy the floozy's incredible, uh, subgenius collage.

513
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,980
It is absolutely, absolutely positively...

514
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,300
Perfect.

515
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,060
Perfect for this cerebral affair.

516
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,760
He says he'll help me to project some things he's got his eye on.

517
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,960
Oh, I've got my eye on you, Suzy.

518
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,280
About that he could even cure this crazy quilt I lie on.

519
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,660
I'm a doctor, Suzy.

520
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,080
I love that man.

521
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
He has me in his power.

522
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,020
Each romantic 50-minute hour.

523
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,880
Oh, slap.

524
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,980
God, yes.

525
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:01,340
I know he'll be my dear of dears for a minimum of 20 years.

526
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,140
When the IRS comes.

527
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,520
I love that man, that man.

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,940
I love that man.

529
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,900
Well, you are talking about me and not Bob, aren't you?

530
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,260
Oh, Bob.

531
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


532
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


533
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


534
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


535
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


536
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


537
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


538
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


539
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


540
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


541
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


542
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


543
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


544
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


545
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


546
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


547
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,260


548
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,500
Yes, Susan. Connie?

549
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,580
Connie?

550
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,620
Connie!

551
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,600
Connie bitten no claws.

552
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,120
Prepare giant torpedo for Connie.

553
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,500
Yes, we're on the USS Puzzling Evidence.

554
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,720
We're going to sink Bob Dobs.

555
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I will personally deliver this torpedo myself.

556
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,640
We're diving.

557
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
We might as well get down together, eh, Connie?

558
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,740
Seaman Bob.

559
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,580
So good to see you looking in the pink.

560
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,720
Shut it, Quirk.

561
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,760
You're not going to be glad to see me at all.

562
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Behold!

563
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,400
Look at the bright side, Seaman Bob.

564
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,860
At least there won't be little Seaman Bobs running around.

565
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,900
And there ain't going to be no more Captain Quirks running around either

566
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,620
because I plan to...

567
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,760
I'm going to let my wrath fall on you!

568
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,100
I don't think you know what you're dealing with, mister.

569
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,060
I got a starship up there with enough power to...

570
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,080
To do what, Quirk?

571
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm a genetically altered human being with big plans.

572
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,540
Big plans, little man.

573
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,860
And they start with taking over your ship.

574
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Taking over my ship?

575
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,980
Nobody takes over my ship, mister.

576
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,120
Well, how do you plan to stop me?

577
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,180
Like this.

578
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,940
You may call me Connie.

579
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
You did once during the storm, remember?

580
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,860
You said, uh...

581
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,880
You might as well go down together, eh, Connie?

582
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,600
I like the way you said Connie.

583
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,360
You like a sock in the jaw?

584
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,380
Plus I touched your heart, huh?

585
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,760
No, Bob, and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't touch my arm.

586
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,020
Now the bouncing...

587
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,900
The ball will be bob, bob, bobbing along, along

588
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,520
And all that you will do is just keep singing with this sweet song

589
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,220
Be like a kid again, doing what you did again

590
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,920
Burst into song

591
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,920
Now let's all start singing while the ball keeps bobbing along

592
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,660
Now, honey, don't mess with the red phone.

593
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,500
Hello?

594
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,120
Hello?

595
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:32,960


596
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,360
What?

597
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,440
What's going on up there?

598
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,220
I ain't seeing you since Selma.

599
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,840
My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.

600
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,300
I want every loyal listener to do everything they can to get him out of jail.

601
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,960
All right, you heard the man.

602
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,840
One grenade each.

603
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,400
Now come to rid the earth of these pigs, perverts, and pugs,

604
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,380
which are a pestilence upon the land.

605
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,460
I'll tell you, if you don't straighten Bob out,

606
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,840
you're gonna have a big problem.

607
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,000
Dobbs doesn't want followers, only their money.

608
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,040
And so we must purge our ranks of the unclean.

609
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,420
Deprogram our own zombies.

610
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,940
The methods he advocates are drastic,

611
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
for he hath commanded,

612
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,240
you shall do as I say

613
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,760
and think for yourself

614
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
or kill me.

615
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,700
This squad is correct, Captain.

616
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,180
The ship is being bombarded by large globs of ejaculative substances.

617
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,680
It's that same Bob, Jim.

618
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,140
He's taking pot shots at us.

619
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,720
The shields can't take much more than this, Captain.

620
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,240
Arm the condom torpedoes, Mr. Squad.

621
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Condom torpedoes armed, sir.

622
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,040
Messed coming in from the planet, Captain.

623
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,760
On screen.

624
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
You can't escape my wrath, Quirk.

625
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,040
One more orgasm and I'll knock you out of the sky.

626
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,900
Fire a condom torpedo.

627
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,340
Tracking the condom torpedo, sir.

628
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:04,620
I'm ready, Captain.

629
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


630
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


631
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


632
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


633
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


634
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:04,620


635
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,320
Five seconds to contact.

636
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,700
Four, three, two, one, now!

637
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,400
Direct hit, Captain.

638
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,600
But Seaman Bob's inflamed penile cannon has been tapped.

639
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,960
However, he's trying to launch another burst.

640
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,400
If he succeeds, we're all dead, son.

641
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,000
He's rupturing, Captain.

642
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,600
Brace yourselves.

643
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,100
Greetings, Mr. Sperm.

644
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,460
Fascinating.

645
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,640
He blew a left testicle.

646
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,760
The result was a mega-spill of sexual fluids.

647
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,540
And I am no longer reading any life forms on the planet's surface.

648
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,620
Oh, Captain, how awful!

649
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,620
Yes, Lieutenant, it's awful.

650
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,420
Seaman Bob drowned in his own semen.

651
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,720
It's ironic.

652
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,140
After serving a great vigil through numerous floods,

653
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,660
Mayor Bob never missed a flood.

654
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,100
Then the waters came in the fall of 73.

655
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,600
The river started to flow.

656
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,220
The water started rising.

657
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,080
The people started worrying.

658
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,280
Where's Honey Bob?

659
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,640
The crowd went out.

660
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,980
The word finally came from all around.

661
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,280
Mayor Bob is out of town.

662
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,760
Oh, we can't have a flood without the Mayor.

663
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,100
We gotta have him on that phone.

664
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,180
He's gotta make those calls to check the rise and falls.

665
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,660
Oh, we can't have a flood without the Mayor.

666
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,880
Where's the Mayor?

667
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,520
We gotta get him fast.

668
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,060
Where's Mayor Bob?

669
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,040
Where's he at?

670
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,160
Let's move to the mountains!

671
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,200
Climb up in a tree!

672
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,820
The bear's not around to help you and me.

673
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,400
If we had a helicopter, we'd get him right away.

674
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,180
But the Mayor's in Cincinnati, on this tug river floodin' day.

675
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,960
We've got to go to Bob!

676
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,720
One week after the shooting, we're coming to Bob again.

677
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,300
I understand.

678
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,660
I understand completely.

679
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,980
My God.

680
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,540
Oh, where is Bob when you need him?

681
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,040
I'm gonna get him.

682
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


683
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


684
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


685
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


686
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


687
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040


688
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,040

It is our love

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,840
It doesn't do anything

739
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,760
It is keeping children round the world

740
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,560
Hello

741
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,720
Hi, Grandma

742
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,200
Hi, sweetheart

743
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,260
How are you?

744
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,020
I'm fine, how are you?

745
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,120
I miss you

746
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,900
Oh, I feel like I haven't talked to you for so long

747
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,200
I know, I've been thinking about you

748
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,680
Well, I've been thinking about you too

749
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,440
It seems like you would call, then I would call back

750
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,900
I know

751
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,940
Then you'd call Bob

752
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,820
That's good

753
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:02,740
She's...

754
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,380
Not good

755
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,480
French is a bad, bad girl

756
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,440
She's not what she looks like

757
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,620
But I'm going to die

758
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,600
Before the jaws of the moon

759
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,760
No need to laugh

760
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,820
I wish the world saw me

761
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:45,280
And you'd be the moon when I'm dead

762
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:57,840
No one else will ever know

763
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,720
No one else will ever know

764
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,880
This is she

765
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:09,880


766
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:09,880


767
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,280
I'm dead

768
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,280


769
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,280


770
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,280


771
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,280


772
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:11,280


773
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,120
Oh, is that the end?

774
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,120


775
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,120


776
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,120


777
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,620
Well, what do you want?

778
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,420
Mom, take me home

779
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,140
Just like your mom

780
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,800
You're the first one

781
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:19,800


782
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:19,800


783
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:19,960
But, you know what

784
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,040
She, to her un food

785
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,560
You gave up

786
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,400
That'd be nice

787
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,760
Don't foot 소

788
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,700
Just throw it away

789
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:50,300
P.O. Box 1256 Old Chelsea Station. That's P.O. Box 1256 Old Chelsea Station, New York, New York, 10011.

790
00:50:54,360 --> 00:51:00,000
The things that we get in here, oh, and I should, while I'm, now we don't even know Jessica Kane.

791
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,060
She's not a friend of ours, and that's not graft or anything.

792
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,600
We just, we do get these strange tapes and CDs in the mail, and we listen to them.

793
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,140
And we, when they're weird enough, we certainly feel that we should share them with you.

794
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:21,720
Now, this one is, John Shirley is a science fiction writer whose latest book is Silicon Embrace.

795
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:29,980
But he's also known for the Eclipse series of cyberpunk.

796
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,820
He also has done a lot of horror movies and so forth.

797
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:40,060
But the evil John Shirley also is a rock star.

798
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:49,700
And his current rock star band, the Panther Moderns, has come out with a CD, which, why not?

799
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,180
This is socially relevant music.

800
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,700
Now, see, some of you are thinking, well, this is subgenius stuff.

801
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,400
It's nothing but these people just being crazy.

802
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,280
That's all it is.

803
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,680
There's just no relevance in there.

804
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,400
Now, that, only a normal person could say that.

805
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:17,540
But for, this is not to say that John's hellish songs are in any way normal.

806
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,800
But to pacify those of you who think it's all silly, okay?

807
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,740

To put up with the scenes

820
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,980
You're a stroke of color

821
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,700
That turns the gray back into green

That we're up in this world

864
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,120
The world's a safe disposal

865
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,020
In a second to flip the switch

866
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,700
The world is too emotional

867
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:17,760
The world keeps losing on its pitch

868
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,600
The world's a vigilante

869
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,560
It's slicing dice at all our plans

870
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,120
The world is automatic

880
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,600
You're an vindication

881
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:27,680
For the human world

882
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,800
No olvidation

883
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:28,800


884
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:28,800


885
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:28,800


886
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,280
You're the only way

887
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,800
ToWhich everyone will blossom

888
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:43,020
You're a succeed

889
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,700
公iper

890
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,740
While all mankind

891
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,000
May not amaze

892
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,540
You just may not be

893
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,560
The same as you

894
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:50,560


895
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,840
We're�

896
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:52,840


897
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:52,840


898
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,600
You take all of the

899
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:54,600


900
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,680
While everyone else's a Dusk

901
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,860
depending on how well you can get it to notice you, friends.

902
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:08,880
And because 87% of Americans believe in that invisible monster,

903
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:13,500
there is one that we have to deal with.

904
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,640
Wouldn't be there if they didn't believe in it.

905
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,420
But friends, you can fight back.

906
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,300
Yes, you can fight back by writing for free information about the Church of the Subgenius,

907
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,800
the one true faith that will indeed fight back against these alien space monsters

908
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,700
from some corporate sin galaxy.

909
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,480
And that address to write to, of course, as always, dear friends, is...

910
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,400
And we'll just switch music for this.

911
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:51,140
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306

912
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,480
Dallas, Texas.

913
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,720
75214

914
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,620
Once again, dear friends, that's Bob at PO Box 140306

915
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,300
Dallas, Texas.

916
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:07,720
75214

917
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:13,980
Email is slack at metronet.com

918
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,920
And our worldwide website is at www.subgenius.com

919
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,780
Yes, it actually is now.

920
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:22,660
And...

921
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,280
And...

922
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,220
As we go out...

923
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,500
Hold on just a second.

924
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:30,440
I'm going to pause this, and you won't even know.

925
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,840
There's no time past at all.

926
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:34,880
See?

927
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,720
Time control, friends.

928
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,360
Okay, let's see.

929
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,560
There's a subatomic particle called the Iamton.

930
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,080
Physicists, they speculate about it.

931
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,920
But the middleman knows.

932
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,420
The middleman works for the spirits of the urban wilderness to use their baloney.

933
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,280
And the fetish broker works for the middleman.

934
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,460
See, he was a cutting-edge hotshot at Stanford.

935
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,320
He isolated the Iamton using a wetware subatomic scanner

936
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:12,600
that recreated the thing in his natural cerebral imaging equipment.

937
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,260
And when he did, it spoke to him.

938
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,400
It spoke to him!

939
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,540
Can you fade that?

940
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,720
A subatomic particle that tells you,

941
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,240
Hey, you!

942
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:22,720
Yeah!

943
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,820
You found me!

944
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,840
It didn't speak to him in English, but he heard it in English.

945
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,840
See, what it was, what it actually was,

946
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:37,240
was all the Iamtons on the whole planet that spoke to him in the local macro-octave.

947
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,280
Spoke to him through the group of them he had contained in the tokomak field

948
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,140
and scanned with the electron microscope interfaced with his wetware.

949
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,200
You know?

950
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,540
Interfaced with his wetware.

951
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,480
Anyway, he changed big time after that.

952
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,040
Now he wants other people to know what the Iamton can give you,

953
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,120
which is why he lets people spout off all about it like this, like I'm doing right now.

954
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,220
Because he wants to empower people, the ones that have the capacity, like you, see?

955
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,440
He wants them to use the knowledge, to find their way to use it.

956
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,080
But so far, almost no one has.

957
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,880
Not everybody's a shaman like the middleman is, you see.

958
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,020
And the middleman, he's sort of stuck where he is,

959
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,760
because he lost the way back to where he is,

960
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,640
because it's like biting your own teeth or licking your own tongue.

961
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,580
Once you're there, you're too inside to...

962
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,460
Well, he's got to find people on the outside.

963
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,540
People like you, and...
