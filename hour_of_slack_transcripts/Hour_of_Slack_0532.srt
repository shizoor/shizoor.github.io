1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Your nightmares come alive.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,960
Now prepare yourselves for a terrifying hour that won't be easy for you to forget.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,080
You will now hear all of the positive messages contained in the subliminal portion of this tape.

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,220
These messages have been carefully designed to help you achieve the success you desire and deserve.

5
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,680
I use rest stops regularly.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,400
You choose to be in control of your life.

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,100
You choose to be happy.

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,000
You choose to be happy.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,520
You are a happy person.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,800
You are a winner.

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,940
I got a 3220 built on a graveyard frame.

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,940
Shoots tombstone bullets, balls and chains.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,320
Said I'm tough as cowhide, swift as lead.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
I was born in the jungle where they never go to bed.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,580
Wild throw a brick through midnight and break broad daylight.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
Cause my eyes is made of bulletproof glass.

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,600
I like being in control of my life.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,640
I know I can be who I want to be.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Have a nice trip.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,260
You are such a damn fool.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,820
You lost your grip.

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
What the hell?

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:29,980
What the hell?

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,500
What the hell did it take to get you to awaken?

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,800
No matter what you say.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,380
A equals, A equals, A equals, A equals, A.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,580
These messages will now become subliminal.

30
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,980
But your subconscious mind will be hearing and accepting all of the positive messages.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,300
Listen to the tapes as often as you can.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,980
The more you listen, the sooner success will come.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
Sad, sad.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,420
Cool.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:01,960
Cool.

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,900
Sad, sad.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,740
That's enough.

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,000
Cut off the telecommand.

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,760
Are you crazy.

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,100
Cut off the telecommand, I say.

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,260
You must maneuver freely.

42
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,880
That would be an act of insubordination.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,660
And if they say anything against God or Elvis Presley, they get thrown out on the rest again.

44
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,640
He said, you're insane.

45
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,860
He said, you need to be put away.

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,000
He said, you're a sick woman.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,080
And I said, if this is sick, I never want to get better.

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,660
I want to stay in critical condition for the rest of my life.

49
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,940
And he filed for divorce on extra.

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,980
Grammar.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
of extreme cruelty and all this was item number two excessive devotion to elvis presley and i said

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:44,760
i love it hit one of them bob not with the rain run into him the program has been banned from the

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:54,220
air and you know that too i know but it's too vital to the radio not only was the ban on the

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:03:00,660
program overruled now i don't understand anything this almost seems like a joke but

55
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,140
i made the judge understand the importance of this program to the radio

56
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,900
can't say it's a blamer the show can cause tropical fish to pop when waved over the tank

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,580
the show sterilizes dogs and house cats within a three block radius

58
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,020
the show removes rust earwax and questionable stains of passion

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,280
and now the

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:46,620
what are we doing what are we doing with the money well honestly we're standing

61
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:53,660
with your dear dear host and prayer partner reverend ivan stang

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:02,980
and presented to you by the church of the sub sub genius in the name of jr

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
but all i can say is i get lots of recurrences when i do this

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,260
and i get a few leaks so my own tendency is if the rectum seems normal perhaps with a bit of

65
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,860
anal disease not to do an immediate collect to me an early rectal but to do a sub ingenious

66
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,000
say a total

67
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,520
or procto-collectomy and ileostomy poor control over a period of years can also cause target organ

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,340
damage that can eventually lead to blindness renal failure amputations neuropathy coronary artery

69
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,180
disease exercise quitting smoking reducing sodium and cholesterol intake increasing dietary fiber

70
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,820
all these are measures we're taking to help prevent

71
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,480
dog

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,520
dogs

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,520


74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:50,940
dogs

75
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,480
dogs

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,200
for amusement they toss children into the dog house and they're not allowed to go to the dog house

77
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,200


78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,340
pits with hungry dogs oh we're not men we are the subgenius

79
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,780
in omni patli and philly and spiritus sancti

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,900
amen sense of humor and of course a lot of them have a normal rectum so it's very attractive

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,240
keep the reckless sub ingenious and then after a year or so consider joining the patient up

82
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,200
my

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,720

but

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,400

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


103
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


106
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


107
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


108
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120


110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,120

00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,060
wall

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
watch

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,340
planet

117
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,800
on

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,100
bits

119
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:53,240
okay

120
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,420
Here we go.

121
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,320
The acceleration of pressure is tremendous.

122
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,460
We're taking off.

123
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,020
Velocity.

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,160
68 seconds.

125
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,580
69 seconds.

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
70 seconds.

127
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,700
71 seconds.

128
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,260
Walk away.

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,600
Walk away.

130
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm walking to the moon.

131
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,120
We interrupt this program with a special bulletin.

132
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,940
America is now under martial law.

133
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,560
All constitutional rights have been suspended.

134
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,040
Stay in your homes.

135
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,080
Do not attempt to contact loved ones, insurance agents, or attorneys.

136
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,900
Shut up.

137
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,860
Do not attempt to think or depression may occur.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,060
Stay in your homes.

139
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,620
Curfew is at 7 p.m. sharp after work.

140
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:50,320
Anyone caught outside the gates of their subdivision sectors after curfew will be shot.

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,440
Remain calm.

142
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Do not panic.

143
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,360
Your neighborhood watch officer will be by to collect urine samples in the morning.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,040
Anyone caught interfering with the collection of urine samples...

145
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,820
Will be shot.

146
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,140
Stay in your homes.

147
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,060
Don't be cold.

148
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,880
The number one enemy of progress is question.

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,640
national security is more important than

150
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,200
That individual will.

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,360
All Attorney broadcast will proceed as normal.

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,100
No more than two people may gather anywhere without permission.

153
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,040
We're reaching the high-speed carody Xuan team.

154
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


157
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


160
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,040


162
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,000
Use only the drugs prescribed by your boss or supervisor.

163
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,100
Shut up!

164
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,520
Be happy.

165
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,560
Obey all orders without question.

166
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,940
The comfort you've demanded is now mandatory.

167
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,760
Be happy.

168
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,280
At last, everything is done for you.

169
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,200
Oh, yes, we're back, friends.

170
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,980
But Jesus was about to leave.

171
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,100
Lord, I understand some of your followers back in Cleveland where you came from,

172
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,900
the Bethlehem of the Rust Belt,

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,360
were concerned about your safety since you joined this new cult.

174
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,180
They're worried about me.

175
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,980
They want to know why I left everything, left them and left Cleveland.

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,900
Left a $40,000 a year job.

177
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,780
Yeah, they want to make sure that I'm not brainwashed or under any kind of mind control.

178
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,600
Well, tell them.

179
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,140
I'm not under any kind of mind control.

180
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,120
Or everything I'm doing is under my own free will.

181
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
That's the voice.

182
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,200
That's enough, Jesus.

183
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,040
Is that good, Reverend Stang?

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,660
Yeah, that's fine.

185
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,740
That was the voice of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

186
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,260
Can I come back to work now?

187
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,240
Yeah, you may go to the library and check on our corporate standing.

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,840
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

189
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,600
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

190
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,460
Speaking of Jesus, friends.

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,620
Hey, Jesus, when are you going to do something about the Southern Baptists?

192
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,180
What's that?

193
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,660
When are you going to do something?

194
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,760
Take that cookie out of your mouth.

195
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,760
What are you going to do about the Southern Baptists, man?

196
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,160
What are you going to do?

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,880
Well, lookie here.

198
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,080
Here.

199
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,660
Southern Baptists vowed Disney boycott.

200
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,140
And this is from a conspiracy newspaper.

201
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,300
I wonder what the real story is.

202
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,220
15 million members, Southern Baptists.

203
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,460
You probably didn't have to deal with Southern Baptists that much up in Cleveland.

204
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,760
I believe that they're the biggest Protestant group in the country.

205
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,420
Yeah, we didn't have to.

206
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,620
They're certainly the run things around here.

207
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,220
They declared Wednesday that they're going to boycott Walt Disney Company

208
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,840
if it continues to give, quote,

209
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,960
the appearance that the promotion of Hollywood

210
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:34,960


211
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,580
homosexuality is more important than its historic commitment to traditional family values.

212
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Walt Disney understands money and money only, said Reverend Wiley Drake.

213
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,500
Blah, blah, blah.

214
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,500
What's wrong with understanding money and money only?

215
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,840
It's, you know.

216
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,620
Well, Disney Circle of Ten.

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,180
Yeah, that's true.

218
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,020
You've got to worry about that.

219
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,160
It's probably some inside thing that we don't know or understand what's going on.

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
Well, certainly there.

221
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,880
But they claim to be unhappy because Disney allows gays and lesbians

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,220
to attend theme days at Disney World in Florida and gives insurance benefits.

223
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,160
They actually hire gays and lesbians at Disney World.

224
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,060
Can you imagine that?

225
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,620
That's a good thing.

226
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,320
It's a good thing.

227
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,060
They probably don't even ask if they're queer.

228
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,380
I mean, what is this world coming to?

229
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,620
Anyway, Disney's not clean enough for the Southern Baptists.

230
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,720
Not only that, but the Jews are not clean enough.

231
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,180
It says here,

232
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,300
those pesky Jews, you know.

233
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
It says,

234
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,500
And they decided they're going to target the Jews.

235
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
It seems like that's been done before.

236
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,200
And various rabbis are a little bit upset.

237
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,880
But, you know, what they're basically saying is that Christians serve you, Lord,

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,820
and Jews only serve...

239
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,320
They don't mean to, but they're serving Satan.

240
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,940
Well, they don't serve Satan, but they don't serve me.

241
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,700
See, that was a big mistake.

242
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,260
You know, I came down for them, and they shunned me.

243
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,060
That's a problem.

244
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,740
You know, what happened to love each other and love thy neighbor?

245
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,520
That's why I'm here.

246
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
That didn't work.

247
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,020
I thought you gave up on that.

248
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,420
I gave up on that a long time ago.

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
It didn't work the first time.

250
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
Look what they did to me the first time around.

251
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:27,860
Yep.

252
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,300
They held me to a few sticks.

253
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,220
This time, friends, the Lord is...

254
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,100
Well, the Son of God.

255
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,960
The Son of God is rebelling against Daddy, and he's going to leave...

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,840
X day will come before he's 33, this incarnation.

257
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,540
So he's splitting, man.

258
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,300
That's the plan.

259
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,340
He's splitting with us.

260
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm out of here.

261
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,520
Here's some other things about your chosen folks here.

262
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,600
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan launched a nationwide voter registration drive...

263
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,680
And inspired...

264
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,860
Let's see.

265
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,440
He suggested that President Clinton's visit to the burned-out black churches...

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
And he was politically inspired.

267
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,040
Why did it take him so long to speak out about the bombing of houses of God, Mr. Farrakhan told followers.

268
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,760
If those were synagogues, how long would it have taken?

269
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,180
See, you know...

270
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,980
It's a mess, isn't it?

271
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,280
But I like that guy, Farrakhan.

272
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,760
Oh, you do?

273
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,020
Oh, yeah. I like him.

274
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,020
Well, he does ride in flying saucers and stuff.

275
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
He understands numbers, too.

276
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
He's a classic B5 crackpot.

277
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,900
Right up there, probably, with Hitler and Francis E. Dex.

278
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,180
Absolutely.

279
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,980
And the legal documents...

280
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,400
He knows more than he lets on.

281
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,900
Well, that's what we're all afraid of.

282
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:55,780
But, you know, at the same time, as the Southern Baptist Convention is doing all this great work to stomp out Jews and Walt Disney and other desperately dangerous enemies of the state...

283
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:03,840
Here in Dallas, Texas, former televangelist Robert Tilton is losing his life and soul to his...

284
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,160
His desires for alcohol and money, his estranged second wife said Wednesday.

285
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,140
Bob Tilton, the greatest, greatest prosperity minister of them all at Word of Faith Church here in Dallas...

286
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,780
And he's famous among subgeniuses.

287
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,400
Subgeniuses love Tilton.

288
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,100
He's like the second Bob.

289
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,580
But also like the second Bob.

290
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,320
He's only as...

291
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,700
He's not nearly as lucky as the real Bob.

292
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,820
And apparently, his second wife says that...

293
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,420
He beats her and drinks constantly.

294
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,940
And he's lost.

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,640
He's just plain lost.

296
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,820
He says she's lying.

297
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,520
She's trying this thing in the media and so forth.

298
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,540
And, of course, his lawyer, Tilton's lawyer says,

299
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,860
She got a lot of pictures showing black and blue marks, cuts and bruises.

300
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,140
No.

301
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680
This is all a bunch of hooey.

302
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
And she knows that.

303
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,560
The real Bob, says his wife, was caring, loving, giving.

304
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
At least I thought so.

305
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,780
The Bob I see now, and that other people see, is a perpetual liar.

306
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,540
So, uh...

307
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,940
You did a lot of work there.

308
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,600
Huh?

309
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
You did a lot of work there, finding out about my people.

310
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,380
That was all in one newspaper.

311
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,300
That was in...

312
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,100
All of that stuff was in one newspaper.

313
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,580
That's amazing.

314
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
You know, our fellow extremists are just, uh...

315
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,280
I just don't know...

316
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,780
Well, one of the reasons I came back was to...

317
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Now these people know they're laid off.

318
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,940
They're done.

319
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,500
They've been...

320
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,760
They've been for years saying, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm here.

321
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,600
Their job is over.

322
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,620
They can cool it.

323
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,200
They don't need to work anymore.

324
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,040
They can relax.

325
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,500
You heard us Christians.

326
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,140
You heard it from Jesus.

327
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,960
Of course, you guys would lynch this Jesus if you got your hands on him.

328
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,480
I know it.

329
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,780
He looks like a bedraggled hippie.

330
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,940
Looks just like the pictures you've been worshiping all those years.

331
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,240
Although, I think he colors his hair.

332
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,760
I don't know what this world's like.

333
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,320
It's incredible to come to friends.

334
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,700
Tim Leary's dead, Frank Zappa's dead,

335
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,820
Bill Hicks is dead,

336
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,620
Lenny is dead,

337
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,900
Pee-Wee got busted,

338
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,320
John Carradine is dead.

339
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,520
We can't even make a subgenius movie now.

340
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,600
John Carradine dead.

341
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,920
Rick Griffin...

342
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,660
My dogs are dead.

343
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,100
Rick... Rick... Rick Griffin's dead.

344
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,420
Tim McGinnis is dead.

345
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,240
Drelloid Mutant is dead.

346
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
Dr. Legume is dead.

347
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,680

, except that uh i've noticed that he sheds jesus does now that he lives in my actually

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,680
in the subgenius offices he's he worked so hard and he's a really male such a martyr he sleeps on

365
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,180
the couch but he sheds now that it's summertime in texas jesus is shedding all over the church

366
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,900
i can't believe jesus depilated all over the church of the subgenius you mean all of his

367
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:19,320
bodily hairs is laying around your area there yeah i think yes and there he's a big mangy what a tough day's for you

368
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,320


369
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,320


370
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,320


371
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,300
What do they make? Holy, holy.

372
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,440
It smells sort of doggy.

373
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:29,300
And I've noticed when we wash Jesus, he has the smell of a wet dog.

374
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,420
I'm the one who has the smell of a wet donkey.

375
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,700
He's a faithful Messiah. He's a faithful and noble Savior.

376
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,580
You can take him out in the backyard and let him do his business.

377
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,680
He's good about not doing it too close to the house.

378
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,060
And you can throw frisbees and he'll run and catch them.

379
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:53,880
And you can send him out to sell subgenius tablets door to door or company to company.

380
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,340
Actually, I'm not giving Jesus enough credit.

381
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,720
He did oversee the merger, recent merger of the Church of the Subgenius with America Online and Simon & Schuster.

382
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,460
We now, we don't exactly own those entities, corporate entities now.

383
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,960
And friends, that Yeti woman is waiting for you.

384
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,420
Sitting on the steps of the church.

385
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:30,300
So why don't you, don't you want to be able to walk up those steps into her great big long strong hairy sweaty arms.

386
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,700
And feel that hot Yeti breath steaming and puffing against your face.

387
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:44,380
And feel that great big long she Yeti tongue lick you right up from your chin to your forehead.

388
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,980
And that big old sloppy wet Yeti kiss.

389
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,000
On your way to, into church, friend.

390
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,780
I was languishing in pain in hell until I met the tick one smell of that Yeti Yeti woman.

391
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,600
That's just on the front steps.

392
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,140
Wait until you get in and see what the service is like.

393
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,460
Ha ha ha.

394
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,240
Yeah, you can be serviced with a subgenius service, if you know what I mean.

395
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,620
We can't say too much more about that on the radio.

396
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,980
I'm sure you can imagine.

397
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,860
But, Connie's Massage Parlor is open.

398
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,780
The Cleveland Natural History Museum is open.

399
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,840
You know what I'm saying.

400
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,080
You can get you some Yeti jawbone there, man.

401
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:23,880
Oh my God.

402
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,220
They've got, you know that statue of Lucy, the ancient Australian.

403
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,380
They have astrophysicists.

404
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah.

405
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,420
They've got a new statue.

406
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,080
They've got a mate for her now.

407
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,160
Lucy Leakey.

408
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,320
The skeleton of a gray that was excavated in Arkansas.

409
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,480
And it's not very old, maybe 10,000 years.

410
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,100
It's about a 10,000 year old gray.

411
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,880
It's just a little bit of a example for a gray, ain't it?

412
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,100
And they've got him mounted next to Lucy.

413
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,060
Now, they're about the same size.

414
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,600
Ironically, he mounted Lucy and that's why.

415
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,280
That's why.

416
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,860
And that's what you can see by the physical resemblance.

417
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,840
If you think about it, the skeleton of a gray and the skeleton of a little four foot high Australopithecus babe.

418
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,660
With those great big sad lovely eyes.

419
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:12,420
And that little weak chin and those, that gimpy little spindly body.

420
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Such a romantic description.

421
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,600
You can see who Adam and Eve really were.

422
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,900
Of course you can see who Adam and Eve were.

423
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,720
Never mind.

424
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,400
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

425
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:35,440
John Lennon knew Lucy in the sky with diamonds was just another way of saying Lucy was taken in by the aliens and abducted and used and fertilized and put back on earth.

426
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,240
And now today we see the progeny, Dave, lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz here in this room.

427
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,020
Proof.

428
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,640
That aliens mated with yetis.

429
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,480
Millions of years ago.

430
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,440
It is true.

431
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,540
In fact, it is true.

432
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:56,620
I get letters from many, many yeti ancestors written to me in the form of DNA spiral which speaks to me in my dreams and my brain.

433
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,080
And I even know like what certain of my yeti forefathers actually looked like, what they liked to cook.

434
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,420
And when they liked them, what they liked to do.

435
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,240
And that's all the time we got, boys and girls.

436
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,900
We gotta get out of here.

437
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,340
But we learned it all from their droppings.

438
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,760
How can we, how can we drop out now?

439
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,320
My guests have been Reverend Ivan Stang, Lisa Lisa, lonesome cowboy Dave, Michelle, Einstein Secret Orchestra, the whole group.

440
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,580
We'll be back next week, Thursday nights, 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock in the morning.

441
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,340
We'll see you all then.

442
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,460
I gotta get the heck out of here.

443
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,980
There's folks here who do some kind of show.

444
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,320
So I'm outta here.

445
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,660
My name is Chaz.

446
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,800
ESO Radio.

447
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,960
Thursday nights.

448
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,200
Till next week.

449
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,660
Keep your hat on tight.

450
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,360
Your back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.

451
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,360
And I'm hurry.

452
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:55,480
��로

453
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,100
As he lost his mind

454
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,140
As he lost his mind

455
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,840
Oh, man.

456
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,480
Boy, this must be a real night for Black Sabbath, I suppose.

457
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,260
But, friends, I did indeed still want to play you.

458
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,500
I wasn't kidding about this.

459
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,500
We do have a new Subgenius Church hymn, a lovely tune here,

460
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,160
which I think some of you may...

461
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,740
We did borrow the music a little bit, but this was recorded just yesterday.

462
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,720
Friends, I hope it brings tears to your eyes

463
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,620
and teaches you the lesson which you must learn.

464
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,020
Save it as staying.

465
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,240
Thank you.

466
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
Thank you.

467
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,620
Thank you.

468
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,580
is bothering me forever and forever.

469
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,400
But until I spend my thirty bucks,

470
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm just running to myself and not to love.

471
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,740
And although I know that I am screwed,

472
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:11,460
still I say there's a day I'll pay.

473
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,000
I love Bob, but when the rupture's over,

474
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:25,360
he'll be gone, the earth will be in ruins.

475
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,100
Without him, the world around me changes.

476
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:38,100
The conspiracy is everywhere, the malls are full of pink boys.

477
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:48,720
I love Bob, but every day I don't spend the thirty bucks.

478
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,020
I'm only just pretending.

479
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,240
Without me, Bob's world will go on burning.

480
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,320
Our next day Bob will have his life.

481
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:02,720
It's a lie.

482
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,960
I'll never know.

483
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,680
I love Bob.

484
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,080
I love Bob.

485
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,580
I love Bob.

486
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,600
But only on my own.

487
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,500
Oh man, that sounded good.

488
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,060
My piano playing could have been better.

489
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,720
My piano playing could have been better.

490
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,400
It could have been a little better.

491
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,400
It could have been a little better.

492
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,660
Yeah.

493
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,260
Yeah.

494
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:49,840
Well, there is, there are many corroborated accounts of this person that looks like a normal human being,

495
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,220
except their face is too long.

496
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,460
And the more you look at them, the less human they look.

497
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,900
Since it's thoughtGeorgi's face is just aslace.

498
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,160
And how you ride less

499
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,340
to how you feel or is.

500
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,800
It's not a young person either.

501
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:20,800


502
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:32,720
So my guess is, I do not live, although I may have the able frick tone Hunger Feet.

503
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,040
In between, space between

504
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,220
There's something that you've never seen

505
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,820
I'm not awake and I'm not asleep

506
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,780
It's in between, space between

507
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,900
Never really quite the same

508
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,880
Sometimes I think they're all the same

509
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,040
Angels, demons, who's to say

510
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,740
Can't scare me with their silly games

511
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,040
In between, space between

512
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,040
The special ones who wait for me

513
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm not awake and I'm not asleep

514
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,560
It's space between, in between

515
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,040
Now I know your skin is green

516
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,920
Fly me away on a shiny wing

517
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,680
Show me things I've never seen

518
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,720
Show me what you've tried for me

519
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,220
So I'll dance

520
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,880
Those space things

521
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,120
Laugh at counting sheep

522
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,260
I just want sweet dreams

523
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,560
Let me go to sleep

524
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,140

561
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,960
measure my life in terms of money. Friends, that's Copernicus from New York. He actually

562
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,860
performed at our New York revival. I believe he may be the corniest man alive. However,

563
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,300
he did, when he does that routine about don't let me measure my life in terms of money,

564
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,660
he throws 50 bucks worth of dollar bills out into the audience, which may explain his popularity

565
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:41,380
among the bar crowd there in New York City, where we also heard Pope David N. Meyer, that

566
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:51,640
lovely rant. Now, where are we? What do we do? Whenever you're in doubt, friends, on

567
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,180
the Subgenius Hour Slack show, you run the Joe tape. Let us see what are the

568
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:04,380
wise man of Cleveland has to say to us today from his great tape, soon to be on sale from

569
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,680
the Subgenius Foundation for credit cards, Mockery and Perversion. Joe?

570
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:18,740
I don't want a looker, a doggy stalker. This one guy I knew, he asked me to sing the

571
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:24,000
kindergarten orgasm dance song for him when we were talking on the phone, and I went,

572
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:38,140
I had orgasms back in the kinder, I had orgasms. Kinder-y in the kinder-y, back in the kinder,

573
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:51,100
I had orgasms. He said, well, I gotta go now, Joe. I'll see you later, kinder. No, he didn't

574
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:57,160
say Joe, he said, I gotta go now, see you later, kinder. Horny up the gander, I had

575
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,580
orgasms, So I'ma show chain big chunk when we come back and percept, and I won't hurt

576
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,040
you, Joe! Hold on, Bill, hold on. The gypsy tried the ho beautiful, American

577
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:11,640
còny close up against a giant g sparker's mom. And with nothing in it, I put it out

578
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,000
for

579
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,000


580
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:24,820
Okay, c'mon, favorable, perfectly befitting. Orion in the snow! Hang on,all of you c'mon,

581
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,700
Now, what does the Joe Offrecht tape have to do with the Church of the Subgenius?

582
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,180
All I can say, friends, is that it's somehow liberating.

583
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Perhaps Joe is perhaps the one free man out there.

584
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,160
And have we got to...

585
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,820
I haven't gotten to it yet.

586
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,960
We haven't even made it to side two of the Joe tape,

587
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,380
but I've got a special punchline for all of that.

588
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,880
So you'll have to just stay tuned to this show for weeks, years to come.

589
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,960
In the meantime, let's see what other great Cleveland crackpots have to say.

590
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, I'm the guy with my legal notice in the newspaper in advance.

591
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,580
And I have another story.

592
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,620
I've got a problem with a guy named Flacos with a state hasp.

593
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,320
I've got my center missing.

594
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,020
I'm supposed to be sugar safe.

595
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,520
And I've got a story, a couple stories,

596
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,980
and, hey, the guy's supposed to this and that and this and that needle

597
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,820
and hook me on another needle full with my metabolism.

598
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,300
Now, I don't have my center.

599
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,980
I need to talk to someone serious.

600
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,060
And, of course, declare a center and a plate and schedule recovery

601
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,040
and preservation of moments of and to make sure for sugar safe.

602
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,640
And then I'm entitled to hair.

603
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,240
Of course, I'm aware of the suddenness of difference in people.

604
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,520
And I registered these hen chickens, registered to see the Euclid police in the 60s.

605
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,380
I'm entitled to hair.

606
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,240
I said hair makes them strange or already strange enough.

607
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,140
Eternally jealous police.

608
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,420
So I have my story.

609
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,120
I've got a center missing to make sure because metabolism changes.

610
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,100
And I have a nurse in the newspaper in advance.

611
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,000
And you're allowed to serve me.

612
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,740
I have a group of legal notices.

613
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,620
I have a nurse in the newspaper, an abracadabra,

614
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,360
and a girl named Maria on a second registry number.

615
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,960
And then she's shifting abracadabra over to another girl.

616
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,840
And a girlfriend named Therapy.

617
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,280
That works out.

618
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,860
And a restaurant.

619
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,420
They said, oh, is this obvious?

620
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,500
You people are filthy.

621
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,780
To write down to the sport enthusiast to who's declaring preservation of moments on my property

622
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,600
underneath my time of day.

623
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,000
And they don't want any of that around my property and a problem on my property.

624
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,360
In the meantime, I registered sugar safe.

625
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,480
And a cop that says, hey, this guy is a man.

626
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,940
And this man, the needle, ride the needle,

627
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,900
trying to destroy my sugar balance.

628
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,820
And my center's missing to see if I'm sugar safe because metabolism changes.

629
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,580
And, well, you never know.

630
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,640
You could be sugar safe at one time and not need to schedule to recover the sugar.

631
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,160
And you may, there are changes.

632
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,580
And I'm supposed to talk to somebody that knows.

633
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,900
Well, dear friends, that is, once again, the legal documents guy, as we call him,

634
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,760
from somewhere out there.

635
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,860
That was a series of, there's hundreds of them, I guess,

636
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,220
or at least a hundred of them, messages that were left on an answer machine at the,

637
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,260
I hate even to call it a machine, but I guess it was a machine.

638
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


639
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


640
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


641
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


642
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


643
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


644
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


645
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


646
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


647
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


648
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:21,260


649
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,280
I don't even, I don't even say where.

650
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,300
But this guy had to wait through up like a five-minute outgoing message every time

651
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,520
before he could leave one of those.

652
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,720
And, friends, if you can help clue us in as to how we, too,

653
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,120
can get rights to permission for the hair and our X-Day.

654
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,280
I've got a legal document in the paper for X-Day and July 5th.

655
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,020
And my sugar level.

656
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
Hello, friends.

657
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,940
Friends and welcome.

658
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,140
Tonight I'm here to talk to you about a very serious public problem.

659
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,340
I call it a fascination with the familiar.

660
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:11,080
Now, what exactly do I mean by a fascination with the familiar?

661
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm referring to a tendency of the people to fear any change whatsoever.

662
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,180
Rather.

663
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,620
Rather than experience something new or different,

664
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,000
they would rather relive the past over and over again.

665
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,900
You heard there was a recycling craze going on out there.

666
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,260
Well, friends, I'm here to tell you it's a happening.

667
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,820
You can see this habit manifested in everyday behavior.

668
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,000
Take, for instance, the radio.

669
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,280
Almost all adults listen to the same type of music.

670
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,220
I don't mean rock and roll or country music or any particular genre.

671
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,240
I mean the same type of music.

672
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,040
Old music.

673
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,040
Whatever they heard growing up is what they like to hear all their lives.

674
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,360
The cold and oldie business keeps making gold by recycling hits from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and

675
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,560
now even the 80s.

676
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,360
Wake up!

677
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,480
It's the 90s!

678
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,180
The 60s are dead!

679
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,480
Yet when the Beatles release an anthology of greatest hits, the public goes crazy and

680
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,060
buys it in record numbers.

681
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,000
Now, me, I've got a problem with that.

682
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,220
There is only one new song on either of these tracks.

683
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


684
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


685
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


686
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


687
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


688
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


689
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


690
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,220


691
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,100
And yet they both break new sales records.

692
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,400
Just how stupid can stupid be?

693
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,740
Well, let's turn on the TV and find out.

694
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
Why, surprise, surprise!

695
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
It's the same old, same old.

696
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,820
Zinefeld, Roseanne, Home Improvement.

697
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,620
How many years will this same stuff be recycled?

698
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,580
Answer, forever and ever.

699
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,420
Because when it's all over, it's still not over.

700
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,640
It goes on and on and on.

701
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,460
Like Lucy.

702
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,580
Bewitched.

703
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:51,600
Griffith.

704
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,500
Gilligan's Island.

705
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,900
You want hell?

706
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,800
You ain't gonna die, my friends.

707
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,100
It's right here on Earth in front of that tube.

708
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,620
And don't even get me started on elections.

709
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,600
They say the public wants new blood.

710
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,340
A new change.

711
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,900
But just look at them.

712
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,500
Who do they nominate?

713
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,320
A president who's never had a job outside of government or a senator who's been a senator

714
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,940
longer than most of our grandfathers have been grandfathers.

715
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,200
Oh, that sounds like New Br-

716
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:21,580
Blood to me.

717
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,580
But enough of the big picture.

718
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,400
Let's look at the little picture.

719
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,840
How this vicious cycle affects us in our daily little lives.

720
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,760
I know a man who's married to a wicked witch.

721
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,140
And they just so happen to live in the West.

722
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,580
It's true.

723
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,580
He can't stand her.

724
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,660
And yet, he stays married to her.

725
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,480
You probably know someone just like him.

726
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,740
Only he's a she or she's a he.

727
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,140
Or whatever.

728
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:51,700
Whatever the combination.

729
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,260
The point is, they should get divorced.

730
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,540
But they never do.

731
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,020
There's no reason to stop either of them from starting over again with someone else.

732
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,120
That's why they invented divorce.

733
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,440
There's no family to break up.

734
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,000
There's no estate to divide.

735
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:14,200
There's no justification for any sane person to endure that kind of psychological torture.

736
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,740
Yet people do it.

737
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,920
Routinely.

738
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,220
Rather than explore new options.

739
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,260
They probably think a bad relationship is better than no relationship at all.

740
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,940
Yet there's two billion members of the opposite sex running around out there you would think

741
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,880
someone better could come along.

742
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,180
Of course, the worst relationship to stay involved in isn't with another person that

743
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,080
you don't like, my friends.

744
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,760
It's a bad relationship with God.

745
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,460
It's a bad relationship with God.

746
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:50,460


747
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,700
This planet has hundreds of different religions.

748
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,980
And yet, most people stick with the same religions of their ancestors.

749
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,000
The same one that their parents had, regardless of whether or not they even like it.

750
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,520
And how did their parents select this religion?

751
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,720
Why it was the religion of their parents too.

752
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,260
It goes on and on and on all the way back to the centuries.

753
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,620
They only learned about one religion and never dared to learn about another.

754
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,440
And yet, they're still the same.

755
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


756
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


757
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:20,440


758
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,440
They're not satisfied where they are.

759
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,800
But it never occurs to them to go somewhere else.

760
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,000
Perhaps they feel it's better to stick with the devil they know rather than the one they

761
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,420
don't.

762
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,680
If I told you, hey, you can't choose who you're going to marry, you should let your parents

763
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,080
decide that, you'd get all self-righteous and tell me where to shove it.

764
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,540
And yet, most people let their parents choose their religion without any resistance at all.

765
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,280
I say a religion is like your nose.

766
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:49,940
No.

767
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:54,140
It's okay to pick your own, but don't go picking someone else's.

768
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,580
No one should pick your religion except you.

769
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,740
Not your parents, not your church, and not your government.

770
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,180
Only you.

771
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,700
If you're old enough to pick your lifelong companion, then you're old enough to pick

772
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,300
your afterlife companion too.

773
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:15,920
Yes, it means you'll have to strike out on your own and do a little exploring.

774
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,880
You might even sample a few different ones before you find the right one.

775
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,020
You'll meet new people, you'll see new sights, and what's so bad about that?

776
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,320
It's a big world out there, my friends.

777
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,000
A whole lot of experiences to experience and not a whole lot of time to do it.

778
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:40,980
Why waste your life doing the same thing over and over again if you're not happy doing it

779
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,860
the first time?

780
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,220
Now I'm not going to stand here and try to push you into the subgenius religion by saying

781
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,860
things like, we're the fastest people in the world.

782
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,400
We're the fastest growing industrial church in the last hundred years.

783
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,020
Or claim that more people choose Bob than any other short, durational, personal savior.

784
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,000
That kind of hype would just be an unfair advertisement, especially coming from me.

785
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,820
But I will state Bob's address.

786
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,620
Because everyone should know their options before making that kind of decision.

787
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,180
Find out your options by writing Bob for information at P.O.

788
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,840
Box 14-0-1.

789
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:19,840


790
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,960
0306 Dallas, Texas.

791
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,520
Tell him Papa Joe sent you and you'll get an extra 10% off your already low membership

792
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:27,820
fee.

793
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,940
And if you think that's a good deal, you should ask him about eternal salvation or triple

794
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,760
your money back.

795
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,360
Because the solution to your problem is simple, my friends.

796
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,560
If you're satisfied with your religion, fine.

797
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:49,740
But if you're unsatisfied with your religion, if you hear a voice in the back of your mind,

798
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:49,840


799
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:59,100
saying, this God isn't right for me, then a better one is just one postage stamp away.

800
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,320
Write that letter, get your slack, and praise Bob.

801
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,040
Amen.

802
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:07,900
Amen.

803
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,780
Amen, dear friends.

804
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,340
That's Father Joe Mama, needless to say.

805
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,940
Well, I probably do need to say it.

806
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,220
Every now and then somebody new might be listening to this show.

807
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,840
A fascination with the Father Joe Mama.

808
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


809
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


810
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


811
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


812
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:19,840


813
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,600
A future, a lovely new sermon by Father Joe Mama.

814
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,740
And what should we do now?

815
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,960
You know, we could go peek into the other...

816
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,040
What?

817
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,560
Yeah, we could peek into the other Bob shows, the other subgenius radio shows around the

818
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:36,900
country.

819
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,460
We've got Sister Susie the Fallousia show here.

820
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,560
We've got some KPFA.

821
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,620
Well, let's just flip.

822
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,140
But, but, before I do that, friends, I've come to think of it.

823
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,240
There's a, I've got this rather disturbing little bit of news.

824
00:50:52,440 --> 00:51:01,200
This is, this was sent to us from a local newspaper by Reverend Joffrey in Pomona, I

825
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,460
believe.

826
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,840
Now, get this.

827
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:09,100
The headline says, Conspiracy Steps Up Attack on J.R. Bob Dobbs.

828
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,840
From Texas Information Network, London, April 7, 1995.

829
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:18,100
The conspiracy authorities in Texas have launched a major...

830
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,120
I'm sorry.

831
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


832
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


833
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


834
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


835
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


836
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


837
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


838
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


839
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:18,120


840
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:24,300
A major campaign attacking J.R. Bob Dobbs in person and accusing him of blasphemy, forgery,

841
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,420
and distorting the Church of the Subgenius.

842
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:32,500
The campaign, last tried on this scale 20 years ago, has already sparked off a number

843
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,740
of rural protests, including four by subgenii from a major subgenius sect which had previously

844
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,740
avoided political confrontation.

845
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:46,360
Under, using virtually unprecedented language, official government documents are describing

846
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,020
the exiled subgenius leader and his officials as the, quote, head of a serpent which must

847
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,340
be chopped off.

848
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,360
The new campaign seeks to discredit Bob as a religious figure, unlike previous attacks

849
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,840
which only criticized his political activities.

850
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:07,960
Quote, how much trace of a spiritual religious leader is still left in him?

851
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,560
Texas TV viewers were asked by a TV news reader earlier this week.

852
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,280
The TV attack on Bob was broadcast on the main evening news.

853
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,220
On 30th of March, in an item described as a TV forum, entitled, Is Bob Still the Spiritual

854
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,260
Leader of a Religion?

855
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,800
The broadcast, an unattributed speech implicitly issued by the authorities, indicated that

856
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,760
the anti-Bob campaign is now to be aimed at ordinary people and that the campaign will

857
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,480
be carried out throughout the Texas autonomous region.

858
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:45,960
Until now, the campaign has been targeted at officials and conspiracy members who were

859
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,260
asked to speak out against the campaign.

860
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,880
The same question was asked in a lengthy article published in the TV broadcast this week, which

861
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,400
gave official conspiracy endorsement to the newspaper article, which had been signed by

862
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:02,480
an unknown conspirator named Ryan Joseph Ryan, in order to suggest that it did not at that

863
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,100
time represent official policy.

864
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:10,680
Both the TV statement and the newspaper article say that, quote, Bob has forged subgenius

865
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:16,260
texts, altered the teachings, and violated the principles of the Church of the Subgenius.

866
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:21,960
The Church, the articles insist, advocates detachment from worldly affairs, whereas Bob

867
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,560
has allegedly told his followers to support Texas independence as part of their religious

868
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,000
practice.

869
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:35,080
The Oil Daily describes this as, quote, wildly attempting to use godly strength to poison

870
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,000
and bewitch the masses.

871
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,780
It accused the so-called spiritual leader and separatist chieftain of incorporating

872
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,160
Texas independence into his sermons.

873
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,920
Such flagrant deception.

874
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,560
Such deceptiveness and demagoguery constitute a blasphemy to the Church of the Subgenius,

875
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,680
says the paper.

876
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:58,260
The subgenius clench pontiffs are accused of demanding that Texans hang Bob's portraits

877
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,120
in clenches.

878
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:05,680
Foreign tourists who have visited Texas say they are constantly asked by Texans for J.R.

879
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,900
Bob Dobbs photographs.

880
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,680
Individual attacks by the conspiracy on the leader of the subgenii have been extremely

881
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,260
rare, especially since September 1987.

882
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:15,900
The subgenius has been a hot topic for the media since the early 1980s.

883
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,700
When the conspiracy last criticised him personally after he addressed a group of congressmen

884
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
in the United States.

885
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:27,400
The brief propaganda drive sparked off a series of street demonstrations in Dallas which are

886
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,300
still continuing.

887
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,700
And I can tell you that's true.

888
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:35,880
Since then, conspiracy propagandists have been careful to criticise the quote Bob clique

889
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,340
rather than J.R.

890
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,160
Bob Dobbs himself.

891
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:44,960
A TV broadcast on 11th of February referred to the splittest elements headed by Bob, a

892
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,900
derogatory term for the subgenius.

893
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,060
A

894
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,100
Whoo!

895
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:15,640
More songs.

896
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:15,880
Above Board?

897
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,740
Now go out and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have.

898
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:31,460
Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

899
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:39,720
Ah, yes, friends, and this divine pronouncement is much beloved amongst us pro-life subgenius believers.

900
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,000
For the Amalekites were the criminal race of aboblical times.

901
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:53,840
The abortionists, loathsome in the sight of Bob, and slow, violent death is too good, too good, my friends, for their ilk.

902
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:00,460
But what about the children? What about the children, bleats the bleeding-heart liberal?

903
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Well, what about them? Idiotic questions are to be expected from liberal elite sodomites that spit in the eye of Bob.

904
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,400
They just don't.

905
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,240
Get it.

906
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,200
Let's just run through the reasoning.

907
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,300
Did Bob say shower welfare handouts upon these criminal children?

908
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,480
Give them government, free government cheese so they might grow strong in their abominable criminality?

909
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,280
These apprentice abortionists, nurtured in the ways of Satan, did they say that?

910
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:34,460
He did not. And no, he was not speaking it metaphorically, as the modernist perverters of truth would have it.

911
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,780
Kill them! The Lord has no mercy upon the children of abortionists. Kill them!

912
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,560
The Lord has no mercy upon the animals of abortionists. Kill them, too!

913
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:52,260
All true Americans know that animals take on the attributes of their masters, and so the livestock of criminals are not to mingle with Bob's people.

914
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:57,680
They cannot be trusted. A sensible matter of national security, dear friends.

915
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:06,800
And so, and so we come to the truth, the final truth, the end of this great session, friends.

916
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,700
And if you want to know more about how to kill the abortionists, you can go to the website at www.thebob.com.

917
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:18,240
And, uh, then please write to the Subgenius Foundation. Papa Joe Mama gave that number just a little while earlier.

918
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,060
Go ahead, friends, write to Bob at, got that pencil ready?

919
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,680
PostOfficeBox140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

920
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,980
I'm gonna give that number again!

921
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:38,480
That's Bob at PostOfficeBox140306.

922
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,620
In lovely Dallas.

923
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,480
Texas 75214.

924
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,280
It is peace and love.

925
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,660
And let us listen to the church of the new faith instead of anybody else.

926
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,440
Now, right now.

927
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:54,620
Because of the sins of evil, Jesus will destroy the world's spent evil days.

928
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,160
Buried.

929
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,920
There is a new sin called justice and a rule before a thousand years.

930
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,520
And many people are judged and executed.

931
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,720
God works in mysterious ways.

932
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,760
God has covered many years' days to kill the most wretched.

933
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,920
And he kills the homosexuals and drug users.

934
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:06,880
He has new diseases.

935
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,900
Who should I know of it?

936
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,920
These diseases will kill pot smokers.

937
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,100
Their lungs will turn inside out.

938
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,540
Like the paracrine experience.

939
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,640
These diseases will kill people who have sex.

940
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,720
And who drink and smoke.

941
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,540
Marks will appear on their skin.

942
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,380
And who die.

943
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,280
What about the murder?

944
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,160
The government will have most executions.

945
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,480
Like the chairs in any town.

946
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,360
People live to die.

947
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,720
And they're lined up to die.

948
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,500
Jail will be a one-way ticket for the non-violent crimes.

949
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,620
Yes, violence is the tool of government.

950
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,840
We'll be tolerated.

951
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,700
Government is not the tool of Satan.

952
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,900
Of God.

953
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,600
Of Satan.

954
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,020
Of God.

955
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:36,620
Of Satan.

956
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,620
Of God.

957
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,260
Of Satan.

958
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,880
Of God.

959
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,320
Of Satan.

960
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:39,860
Of God.

961
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,240
Bob.

962
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,020
Satan.

963
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:41,560
Bob.

964
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:41,980
Satan.

965
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:45,720
Yes, dear friends.

966
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,900
And let's go back to the peace of the church of the subgenius here with Susie.

967
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,680
Oh, speaking of agony.

968
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,380
What?

969
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,880
I got a letter from Mom yesterday.

970
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:53,760
Really?

971
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,500
How can you tell?

972
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,700
The usual ten-page letter.

973
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,620
Totally blank.

974
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,380
I'm glad to hear she's doing well.

975
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,080
Oh, speak for yourself.

976
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,560
You didn't have to endure the torments of a damn.

977
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,680
Being dragged around like toilet paper.

978
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,780
Stuck to that monster.

979
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,420
Oh, yeah.

980
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,760
Like I had it easy.

981
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:18,060
Oh, I'm sorry, folks.

982
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,260
I'm sorry.

983
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:25,200
Apparently, our other, our fellow subgenius ministers are having some sort of an altercation

984
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,740
over here on screen five.

985
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh, my God.

986
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:36,200
Susie just grabbed Dr. Nolan Boyd's member and is yanking his members out of his clench.

987
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,420
And he's.

988
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,580
He's grabbed her bosom of love.

989
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,340
And he's yanking on it.

990
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,380
And they're yanking.

991
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,420
They're wanking.

992
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,800
Oh, what?

993
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,900
Oh, it's over.

994
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,140
I hope.

995
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,420
Oh, I ain't a man in these parts can take my atomic round.

996
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,500
I'm sucker punch.

997
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,700
You sure keep me on my toes.

998
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,680
Like you're ever in an upright position.

999
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,600
I told you, it's just a slack in me.

1000
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,180
Oh.

1001
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,160
Oh, brother Boyd.

1002
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,200
I'm just so glad to have you back.

1003
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,780
Oh, it was so hard being alone.

1004
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,480
Growing up in one blighted mobile home park after another.

1005
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,060
I always wondered about you.

1006
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,180
Like where you were.

1007
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
If things are better for you.

1008
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,320
Like, you know, if they let you sleep and eat and stuff like that.

1009
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,320
And I hated you for it.

1010
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:31,540
Oh.

1011
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,260
Oh.

1012
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:32,440
Oh.

1013
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:32,680
Oh.

1014
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:32,740


1015
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,160
Oh.

1016
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1017
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1018
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1019
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1020
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1021
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:33,160


1022
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,220
Oh.

1023
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:33,980


1024
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,760
I hated your guts real bad too.

1025
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,720
Even though I didn't know you existed until last year.

1026
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,720
It was damn hard to track you down.

1027
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,100
The adoption agency being in a Chevy El Camino and all.

1028
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,060
But I'm so glad I did.

1029
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,220
I like that cut of your gibberish.

1030
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,360
Well, it's one hell of a mixed blessing.

1031
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:57,120
I mean, it was tough enough to have been raised by loathsome predatory birds.

1032
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,860
But then to find out that all the time,

1033
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,160
I was really half of a set of twin inbreds.

1034
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:03,420
Yes.

1035
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:03,420


1036
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,600
you did manage to find me a �unch lab,

1037
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,540
bloodshot swine,

1038
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:05,580


1039
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:05,580


1040
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:05,580


1041
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,380
Well, I could probably get embo numer optic room

1042
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,380


1043
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,380


1044
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,760
Yeah, because I got fucking mushrooms and twe fizer a school.

1045
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,640
Knew you'd beIT

1046
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,000
Can you at least teach me some manners afterwards?

1047
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,800
Give them to me at 15 to get on my planet.

1048
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,180
Sure.

1049
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,460
You came at me at 16.

1050
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:17,800
You wanna give me three months?

1051
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:19,200
Take me six months and I'll application either.

1052
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,120
Ah let me just hug you or you either.
