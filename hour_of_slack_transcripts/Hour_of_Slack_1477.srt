1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,360
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,060
The subgenius power of SWAT

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,220
Now I know all about everything

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,260
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,400
Well the one that was playing before the air conditioner one I don't think made a loud enough noise to interfere

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,300
It was coming on the recording

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,240
The recording picked it up

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,420
Oh yeah it was

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,400
We shut the big one down we just turned the box fan on

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,860
Right, yeah and this one is on over here too so that probably is good

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
We have so much trouble with our fans

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,080
They're such

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,160
Fans?

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,080
They're such a, they're so delicate

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,300
Yeah that's right

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,200
You have to be so careful what you say to them

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,580
They get butt hurt, their butt skin is so very thin

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,760
They're either loud fans or loud fans

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,680
And shaky as the day is long

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,300
Shake, they shake and vibrate

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,940
And it just happens

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,360
So I had to battle an unkillable hornet in my cabin

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,440
And what other strange signs and portents

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,680
Oh you have a cabin! Oh lucky you!

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,240
It's a cabin in the sky Pops

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,460
But I was just wondering

27
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,440
They keep me in the bilge

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,100
Other people had perhaps seen things that were unusual

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,220
Which might contribute to the eschatological array of things

30
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,960
That are happening

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,540
Moles

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,720
What Hal means is it's the end of the world and weird stuff happens

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,340
And we want to know about all of it

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,320
It does, you should keep your eye open for weirdness

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,520
Something startled a small mole this morning

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,420
Like stuff disappearing out of my suitcase

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,740
In fact I was going to mention that to you Stang

38
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,900
It was some kind of noise was down that way

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,960
Over, and for those who can't see where I'm pointing

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm pointing down towards the Green Man Tavern

41
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,140
There was a noise and then this small mole just took off

42
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,440
Running like he was running from something like really dangerous

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,800
And he came running all the way into

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,940
We were all sitting here, we were, you know

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,660
Most of the time moles don't come around people

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,500
But whatever was in those woods

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,300
Scared that little mole enough to come around people

48
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,020
Well don't they normally hide underground?

49
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,380
I would say that indicates there's something lurking underground

50
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,920
I don't know but it was in a hurry

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,500
It was in a hurry

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,080
I hope they don't all panic

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,120
You don't want to see them all galloping through the campsite

54
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,380
No

55
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,340
A mole stampede is not a pretty sight

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,820
And they don't smell that great either

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,260
100,000 moles friends

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,780
No you don't want to get a mole on your skin certainly

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,720
And then they become moldy moles

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,620
Moldy and so

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,940
I'm not sure that really comes to the level of miracle status though

62
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,540
Though it is a portent like rats leaving a sinking ship or something

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,060
Well that's what I was thinking actually

64
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,280
I was watching that mole running from that back wood line

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,660
And thinking, well that's weird

66
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,240
That's so strange

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,080
What would drive a mole from underground into the dangerous hands of the humans?

68
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,000
It was a weird noise though Stang

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,160
It was something I, you know, I'm country enough

70
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,280
The mole made a noise or was fleeing from a weird noise?

71
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,300
No the noise that the mole was fleeing from

72
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,760
It was fairly, literally indescribable

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,260
It's the first time in my life that I could say

74
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,860
You know I can't really describe the noise

75
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,660
It was indescribable

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
It was unsettling

77
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,360
Too bad Fat Mandy isn't here

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,860
She could probably imitate it

79
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,600
Probably

80
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
She's got a pretty good brain

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,200
She'll be here before the world ends

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,240
That's right

83
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,360
She'll be here

84
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,720
And I did remind people earlier

85
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,940
If you are walking by your fellow subgeniuses

86
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,740
They do need to be banded and dosed off

87
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,220
And tagged

88
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,900
So they do need those green or orange bands

89
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,040
Who else are among the galaxy of entertainers and stars

90
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,340
Who are going to appear here

91
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,180
That's pretty funny

92
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,120
At Subgenius World

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,260
Well actually once you register

94
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,600
You will receive a very nice handbook

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,500
And in that handbook there is a schedule

96
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,320
Nobody looks at those

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,360
Well that's probably true

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
Well that's because they need to be distributed

99
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,260
Distribute them

100
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,160
Hand them out

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
People will look at them

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,360
If they are in a box

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,960
It's true

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,880
Nobody reads them

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,920
I have a good little story

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,000
When I ran up there in panic

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,840
To get my PayPal thing working again

108
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,140
There was an email from

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,140
Well let's just

110
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,620
Maybe I shouldn't give his name

111
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,760
He's an earnest subgenius

112
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,860
A earnest subgenius

113
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,140
Who really wants to help

114
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,100
And obviously will believe anything

115
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,140
And doesn't continue reading

116
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,760
Because he must have looked at the online version

117
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,560
Of 17X Day Schedule

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Which isn't quite the same as the final version we have here

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,240
And he wrote to me and said

120
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,880
Stephen Colbert really

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,920
Stephen Colbert is going to be on the Hour of Slack

122
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,880
Can I possibly

123
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,140
Is there some way

124
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,260
He asked I can get a recording of that

125
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,920
And can I use it for my project

126
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,380
And so forth

127
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:23,820
It's like

128
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,200
I felt like

129
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm not going to write him back immediately

130
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,100
But I felt like saying

131
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm surprised you're so excited about Stephen Colbert

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,840
And you didn't even care about Penn and Teller

133
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,740
Or the Blue Man Group

134
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,720
Or the Rolling Stones

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,780
Or Pink Floyd

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,920
Or the Beatles

137
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,280
Who were also all on that schedule

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,460
To be playing here

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,720
So he apparently was only impressed by Stephen Colbert

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,980
Oh and he wanted me to know if

141
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,580
Steve could give him the address of

142
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,820
John Stewart

143
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,180
And Rachel Maddow

144
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
So that he could get comments from them

145
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,980
About the Church of the Subgenius

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,440
And you know the sorry thing is

147
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,100
I was actually on John Stewart's show before

148
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,560
It was the Daily Show

149
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,240
That's right

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,580
And if you were to ask him

151
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,440
He'd probably say

152
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,020
Who?

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Stang was a guest on John Stewart's show

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,220
Back in the day

155
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,820
And Rachel Maddow

156
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,080
Well Bob was on her show

157
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,220
Yes this is right

158
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,680
So

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,620
Yeah she's Maddow too Bob

160
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah so I guess this guy is a little bit behind the curve

161
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,180
But so often I observe that

162
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,100
People only read the first line of an email

163
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,140
And then get busily to work

164
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,280
Tapping and typing and answering and adding

165
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,180
When they really should proceed to the bottom of the sheet

166
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,280
I did actually say that that

167
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,500
Copy that special online copy of our schedule

168
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,940
Was a test

169
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,680
And see they just don't pick up on it

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,780
Especially when some of them

171
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,180
Are just writing in the office post

172
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,600
You better be ready to read between the lines

173
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Because some of us are mean

174
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,040
And we will be setting you up

175
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,240
To make a fool of yourself

176
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,760
In case you don't read all the way to the end

177
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,380
Where it says

178
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,040
Oh by the way that was just a dream

179
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,860
Why are you mean?

180
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,180
Poor little subgenius

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,240
Well Bob isn't finished with me yet

182
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,880
And my butt still has a little bit of room left

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,780
To be cram-packed full of

184
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,420
Punishment so

185
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,360
Why is Bob mean?

186
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,840
Oh he's not mean

187
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,580
Because in his world there is no good or bad

188
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,100
Or mean or nice

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,620
There is only instinct

190
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,360
Pure instinct

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
And whatever the hell he feels like doing

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,440
It's not that he wants to take away our slack

193
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,420
It's just that he naturally absorbs

194
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,580
Any slack he can

195
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,540
That is around

196
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,860
It is up to us

197
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,260
To then reabsorb it back from him

198
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,000
When he sees slack

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,920
He instinctively moves to secure it

200
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,680
It doesn't matter whose it is

201
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,900
Don't ask me for his Facebook secret name or anything

202
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,140
And I can't

203
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,280
I don't get invited to those parties either

204
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,480
I can't be a Facebook buddy

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,780
Of all these people who name themselves

206
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,860
Bob Dobbs

207
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,700
I will befriend no Bob Dobbs

208
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,840
And they wait and wait

209
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,180
I don't know who they are

210
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,860
And obviously

211
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,960
You're not even writing Bob correctly

212
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,220
And I should be your friend

213
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,000
Why?

214
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,320
Right

215
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,660
And one of them is the great Fernand and Andy Leamer

216
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,760
But even Leamer must be banished from my friend list

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,120
Like damn near everybody else on the planet

218
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,760
That's an extreme admirable doctrinal correctness

219
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,080
Of the Torquemada variety

220
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,260
Pisces is one of my Facebook friends

221
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,860
But that's because she's a co-administrator

222
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,340
Of one of those troublesome pages

223
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,200
Or ten of them or something

224
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,320
A lot of them

225
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,100
Yes

226
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,640
Yes

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,260
And they're all troublesome

228
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,220
And they say I'm mean

229
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,460
By the way I

230
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,120
You are mean

231
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm mean

232
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,160
Why am I mean?

233
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,760
Why are you mean, Bob?

234
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,840
Maybe they're trying to say that you're a meme

235
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,180
I am a meme

236
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,920
Am I a meme?

237
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,940
Now I will be

238
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,240
What is the memeing of this?

239
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,200
You're mean, you're mean

240
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,140
You're a big time meme

241
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,660
What is a meme?

242
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,080
A garter snake to all those worthless worms

243
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
You had memes

244
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,480
We didn't have memes when I was a kid

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
We just didn't call them memes

246
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,140
A virus to those pathetic silly little germs

247
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,240
Well yeah I was using one of our memes

248
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
On the radio show the other night

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,900
And you all can do it too

250
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,600
Look up

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Look down

252
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
Look all around

253
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,060
Stick up your thumb

254
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Gee you're dumb

255
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,320
But none of them did it, see

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,120
They're just staring at it

257
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,040
They're just staring, passive

258
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,420
They've ceased to take orders from the subgenius hierarchy

259
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,940
We did our job too well, dammit

260
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,660
You taught them too much independence

261
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,680
They won't even stick up a thumb so I can say gee you're dumb

262
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,900
It's an edumacational mission

263
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,500
We're trying to teach the unteachable

264
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,540
About what no one wants to know

265
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,000
Teaching the retarded about Bob

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,320
There is in fact a schedule posted

267
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,480
That right over

268
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,320
That's right

269
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,540
Those in the radio audience can't see

270
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,640
Reverend Feit-Satage pointing to it

271
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,280
But it is over where Reverend Feit-Satage is pointing

272
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,340
If you are in the radio world

273
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,280
Which you probably won't be

274
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,680
It doesn't know

275
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,360
Because the world is gonna end

276
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,420
No because we cut all the talk about scheduling out

277
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,400
Because

278
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,120
It doesn't make any sense

279
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,780
No, no

280
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,580
Do you think we're doing this show for the five people sitting in front of us?

281
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,120
Hell no

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,100
It's for the five and a half people listening on their internet radio radio show

283
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,180
a month from now.

284
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,860
Damn straight.

285
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,240
Hi there.

286
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,460
On the saucers.

287
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,780
Hi there, MP3 listener.

288
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Yeah, that's right,

289
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,460
on the saucers, sure.

290
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,180
Right, right.

291
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,380
Well, they won't need to listen.

292
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,980
They can just access

293
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,860
the Akashic Records directly.

294
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,780
That's true, that's true.

295
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,860
They can just be here

296
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,120
as if, you know,

297
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,060
a fly on the wall.

298
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,120
Be here then.

299
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,780
But only,

300
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,640
as we were discussing

301
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,540
before you arrived,

302
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,280
we were discussing

303
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,580
the importance of

304
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,560
getting the bigger saucer

305
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
and what you have to do

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,180
to get the bigger saucer

307
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,420
is to spread the word of Bob

308
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,240
because for every soul you convert,

309
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,260
it increases the size

310
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,600
of your personal saucer.

311
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,860
You're making that up

312
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
off the top of your head.

313
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,820
No, I'm not.

314
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,920
It sounds good

315
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,980
and it's a good way

316
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,820
to encourage him,

317
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,260
but really,

318
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,420
your saucer,

319
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,140
no matter what,

320
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,000
is as big as your imagination.

321
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,560
Infinitely elastic.

322
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,660
Which means there's no guarantee.

323
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,380
It may end up looking

324
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,860
like your crappy apartment.

325
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:40,960
You see...

326
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
It'll be your own fault.

327
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,480
There is the doctrine

328
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,760
of personal subgenius infallibility

329
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,660
where anything

330
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,400
that's subgeniused

331
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,840
says is unquestionably

332
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,580
to be admitted to

333
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,120
part of the rest.

334
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:54,940
Or it can be not.

335
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Doctrine of erasability.

336
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,740
Doctrine of erasability.

337
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,280
All from the book

338
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,660
of the subgenius,

339
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,020
the first volume

340
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,440
in a series of

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,420
instructional tomes.

342
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,680
Volume two and three

343
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
now out of print.

344
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,780
You have to scramble

345
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,600
onto the internet

346
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
and order the last

347
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,460
few remaining copies.

348
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,700
Too late, I got them all.

349
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,020
Which means that you need

350
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,180
to get your subgenius stuff now.

351
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,020
Not just before it goes out of print,

352
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,700
but before the world ends,

353
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120
you need to get your subgenius stuff.

354
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,440
Get your subgenius stuff in order.

355
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,200
Or don't.

356
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,860
It's either way.

357
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,680
It's your last chance, man.

358
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,300
You know?

359
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,820
Maybe we're not hard sell enough

360
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,500
because it's always like,

361
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,960
yeah, buy that stuff now

362
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,740
or don't.

363
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,820
You know, it's okay.

364
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,160
I mean, I understand.

365
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,580
Some people may not have

366
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,520
the cash right now.

367
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,940
We don't want you to feel bad.

368
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,900
Well, it's always difficult

369
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,260
to bark commands at people

370
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,380
and tell them to buy things

371
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,900
when they have already paid

372
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,460
just to be here.

373
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,480
We don't have anything left.

374
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,500
I have with my show.

375
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,380
So, anyway,

376
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,840
it is generally understood

377
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,240
that these things are

378
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,600
incredible liquid assets.

379
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,780
Even if one were to speak

380
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,440
quasi-heretically and say

381
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,420
whether or not the iconoclasm

382
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,000
does occur,

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
you still have something

384
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,740
which can be translated

385
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,540
into vital wealth.

386
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,840
This is true.

387
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
And whether it can affect

388
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,940
the fact that you may need

389
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,640
a new T-shirt.

390
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

391
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,760
You were meant...

392
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,020
That's the different use

393
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,420
of the word.

394
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,880
My apologies.

395
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,640
And there are all kinds

396
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,320
of T-shirts with this,

397
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,860
that, and the other on them.

398
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,080
And little subgenius pins

399
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,280
that you can stick

400
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,320
onto yourself.

401
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,100
And even subgenius cufflinks.

402
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,980
This amazing,

403
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,720
I thought I was bringing

404
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,340
home a pin.

405
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,880
It was one of a pair

406
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,520
of cufflinks.

407
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,120
Now, what subgenius

408
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,420
wears French cuffs?

409
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,840
Only French ones.

410
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,320
They only sell in France.

411
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:58,820
Oh, really?

412
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
Yeah, we don't...

413
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,580
You have to be a dapper

414
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,240
reverend.

415
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,880
Bob Dapper, maybe.

416
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,480
Yes, yes.

417
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,400
I was thinking of that one.

418
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,220
Does he have a pair?

419
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,140
I believe he does.

420
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,260
All right.

421
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,620
Or you have to be

422
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,560
a snazzy dresser,

423
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,260
someone like yourself.

424
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,000
But you still would need

425
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,720
French cuffs,

426
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,820
which I don't have.

427
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,140
Anyway, the point is,

428
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,420
let's buy all of the T-shirts now

429
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,060
before Scotty gets here.

430
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,540
Scotty makes his own Bob shirts,

431
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,760
and I don't think I've seen

432
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,180
a penny from those things.

433
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't want to pester him

434
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,300
because he plays such good drums

435
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,600
and lets us use his equipment.

436
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,160
So, you know,

437
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,460
don't tell him I said that.

438
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,100
Please, of course.

439
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,600
I'll have to remember

440
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,520
to erase this part.

441
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,260
Erase it.

442
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,600
Yeah.

443
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,300
These T-shirts are much better

444
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,200
than Scotty's.

445
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,020
They're made of...

446
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,000
Just because they're cleaner.

447
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah, that's it.

448
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,280
They're cleaner.

449
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,120
Semi-compatible.

450
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,800
Cotton material.

451
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,800
And they come in

452
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,780
all the regulation T-shirt sizes.

453
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,600
Small, medium, large,

454
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,240
extra large, extra, extra large.

455
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,880
And they're sold by such

456
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,380
happy clerks.

457
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,240
Elephantine circus tent.

458
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,980
You can visit the happy clerk

459
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,480
and he'll smile and wave.

460
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
You can make conversation.

461
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,500
And take your money.

462
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,280
Feel social.

463
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,640
And on the internet...

464
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,880
Is that all we do

465
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
on these radio shows?

466
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,920
Is that what churchers said?

467
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,420
Is that what genius is?

468
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,240
Is trying to get people

469
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
to buy one $15 T-shirt?

470
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,320
That's what Bob told me to do.

471
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,360
Well, tell us this, Spiceys.

472
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,240
How...

473
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,780
Do they want to hear

474
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,380
in future days

475
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
on the saucers

476
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,780
or elsewhere

477
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,720
about the lineup tonight

478
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
at the stage?

479
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,820
What's happening on the stage?

480
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,200
No, I'm going to cut

481
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,780
all everything

482
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,960
about the schedule

483
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,260
of these shows, okay?

484
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,300
So let's get that

485
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,840
over with quick.

486
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,440
Dr. Dark is showing

487
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,160
movies tonight.

488
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,700
That's it.

489
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:40,940
Right.

490
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,720
After the movies,

491
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,140
there may be

492
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,280
some general fuckery.

493
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:43,880
Now, what...

494
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
General fuckery

495
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,540
will be here.

496
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,740
He's showing what?

497
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,660
The Wrestling Women

498
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,040
versus the Aztec Mummy?

499
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,520
I don't remember.

500
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,520
I failed.

501
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,300
Okay.

502
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,360
I think he is showing

503
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
Frankenstein's Army.

504
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,140
Frankenstein's Army.

505
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,600
At some point.

506
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:56,940
Oh, yeah.

507
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,080
If you haven't seen it,

508
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,240
it's a very imaginative

509
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,840
World War II monster movie.

510
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Even if you hate things

511
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,740
with Nazis,

512
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,300
you'll still probably like it.

513
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah, you'll be rooting

514
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,440
for the Nazi monsters.

515
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,680
Oh, no, you'll be rooting

516
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,720
for the Russian soldiers

517
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,520
that are up against

518
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,460
the Nazi monsters.

519
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,900
But, boy,

520
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,380
the Nazi monsters are cool.

521
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,860
You'll wish you were

522
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,540
one of these Nazi monsters.

523
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,580
Will you be

524
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,120
Jackhammerhead the monster

525
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,180
or Propellerface?

526
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,100
How about the one

527
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,320
with the elephant trunk

528
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
like Proboscis attachment?

529
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,220
That's Vacuum Cleaner

530
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,320
Nazi monster.

531
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,100
Not Vacuum Cleaner Face.

532
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,460
Not Vacuum Cleaner Face.

533
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,040
No.

534
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,720
They're all down there

535
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,600
in the tunnels

536
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,720
in Frankenstein's Army.

537
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,780
Well, I thought you

538
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,640
hadn't seen it yet.

539
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,420
I haven't.

540
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm only describing it

541
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,020
from what I've read

542
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,680
and accumulated

543
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,860
in my reading

544
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,480
and knowledge.

545
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:50,960
The nerd magazines.

546
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah, right.

547
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
You know, friends,

548
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,760
the only reason

549
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,540
that Hal comes to these events

550
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,220
is that my house

551
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,140
is loaded with

552
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,280
real nerdy

553
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,320
monster magazines.

554
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,360
The Slacker Mansion.

555
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,280
He has trouble

556
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,000
finding them

557
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,940
in San Francisco.

558
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,820
Yes.

559
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,640
I, uh...

560
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,920
You'd have to pay for it.

561
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,340
Yeah, scary monsters

562
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,980
and film facts

563
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,960
and all that stuff.

564
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,860
Scary monsters

565
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,960
is a pretty good magazine.

566
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,660
Yeah, if you're old.

567
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,060
It might even

568
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,420
subscribe.

569
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,400
If you're a real old nerd,

570
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,860
they're really good magazines.

571
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,080
But the question

572
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,700
inevitably arises.

573
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,100
You can read all about

574
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,800
these old

575
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,660
Poverty Row

576
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,100
monogram monster movies.

577
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,980
When are you actually

578
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,840
going to see them?

579
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,680
When are you going to see

580
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,980
Bela Lugosi

581
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,900
tangle with the

582
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,120
East Side kids?

583
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,860
Or are you just

584
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,720
going to read about it?

585
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,160
Google it.

586
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,980
Chances are

587
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,020
you'll be looking at it

588
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,700
in two minutes.

589
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,420
Okay.

590
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,400
That's what happened

591
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,740
to me with

592
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,400
King Dinosaur.

593
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,080
You actually watched

594
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,060
some of King Dinosaur

595
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,460
online?

596
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah.

597
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,140
On YouTube.

598
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,080
Unfortunately,

599
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,380
there were these

600
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,860
snarky hipsters

601
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,280
throwing him.

602
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, and their

603
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
robot silhouettes

604
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,240
down at the bottom.

605
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,440
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,200
They were talking

607
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,980
all over it.

608
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Nothing could save

609
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:55,900
that picture.

610
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,680
I do that myself.

611
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,180
That's the worst

612
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,080
dinosaur movie

613
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,860
ever made.

614
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,720
Even worse

615
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,740
than Unknown Island.

616
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,380
I have something

617
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,220
really important

618
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,720
to say in defense

619
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,600
of the terrible

620
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
movie King Dinosaur.

621
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,860
Let's hear it.

622
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,280
It caused me

623
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,720
to look

624
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,940
at it

625
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,440
every other

626
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,200
monster movie

627
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,860
after that

628
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,620
for the scene

629
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,940
where the fleeing

630
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,840
female

631
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,240
pretty girl

632
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,680
gets her dress

633
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,220
ripped

634
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,540
so that more

635
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,280
of her leg

636
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,760
shows.

637
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,700
Just before she

638
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,740
falls down

639
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,760
and has to be

640
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,140
picked up.

641
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,760
They wore

642
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,400
kind of long

643
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,820
dresses,

644
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,140
but when they

645
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,120
got kind of

646
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,900
compromised,

647
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,400
you know,

648
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,640
back in those

649
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,920
days,

650
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,740
just seeing a knee

651
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,660
was kind of

652
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,040
extra.

653
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,660
You'd pay

654
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,460
extra for that.

655
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,440
That crappy movie,

656
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,680
it puts you to sleep

657
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,800
up until the point

658
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,340
where the girl

659
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,980
falls down

660
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,760
and rips her dress.

661
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,020
And that made me

662
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,420
as a 10-year-old boy

663
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,780
into a man

664
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,580
instantly.

665
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Well, the same thing

666
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,880
happens in

667
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,000
Killer Shoes.

668
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,720
I went into puberty

669
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,140
the minute that dress

670
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,720
ripped

671
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,980
when I was watching

672
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,920
that on the late night

673
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,520
sci-fi.

674
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,660
Yes, that ripping sound

675
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,680
was not entirely

676
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:03,700
from the screen.

677
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,500
And that's why we are all

678
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,240
here today.

679
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,760
So the shin drove you

680
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,160
to sin?

681
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,820
That is ultimately

682
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,020
is what put me

683
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,160
to work for Bob

684
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,920
in the end.

685
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,240
Okay, well, you see

686
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,280
the...

687
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,440
The patella sends you

688
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:14,780
to hell?

689
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,020
It's funny what will

690
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,940
turn a person

691
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,000
into a subgenius.

692
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,620
The value of bulldog

693
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
can never be

694
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,380
overestimated.

695
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,660
Right, exactly.

696
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,200
You never know

697
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,440
when some seemingly

698
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
meaningless pit

699
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,660
of crap culture

700
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,360
will turn out

701
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,320
to be the one thing

702
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,580
that sticks in your

703
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,300
little perverted

704
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,260
10-year-old head

705
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,940
and makes you

706
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,100
permanently

707
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,220
into a real weirdo.

708
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,380
And I don't mean

709
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,220
somebody with a

710
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:40,860
funny haircut.

711
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,020
I mean somebody

712
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,720
who's waiting

713
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,180
for that dressed

714
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,840
to rip

715
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
for the rest

716
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,440
of their lives.

717
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,280
Do you remember

718
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,980
when they did

719
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,640
the creature

720
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,660
from the Black Lagoon

721
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,880
in 3D on television

722
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,840
all across the country?

723
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,220
I do.

724
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,260
Okay, I'm glad

725
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,860
one of you does.

726
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,780
I was a wee little

727
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,300
Pisces at the time.

728
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
They showed it in 3D?

729
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,040
Yes.

730
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,100
The little red

731
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,720
and blue glasses

732
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,640
you got at the store.

733
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,600
The two red

734
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,320
and blue glasses, yes.

735
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,140
Yeah, and they showed

736
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,900
it on television

737
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,660
when I was a wee

738
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,360
little Pisces

739
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,280
and my aunt was

740
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,780
supposed to be

741
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,760
babysitting me

742
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
and she wanted

743
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,440
to watch it

744
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,060
so she told me

745
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,660
to go to bed.

746
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,900
And that was

747
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,480
the first

748
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,200
horror-ish movie

749
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,920
I watched

750
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
because I

751
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
snuck out of bed

752
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,040
and hid behind

753
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,020
the couch

754
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,720
where my aunt

755
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,900
was watching the movie.

756
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,280
Classic.

757
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,780
Traditional.

758
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,520
And when she was

759
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,420
watching the movie

760
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,400
I didn't have

761
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,220
the 3D glasses

762
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:31,940
because I couldn't

763
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,680
ask for them.

764
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm supposed to be

765
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,440
in bed, right?

766
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,020
So I watched

767
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,140
the first time

768
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,640
I watched

769
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,540
that movie

770
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,880
I watched it

771
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,980
in 3D

772
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
without the glasses.

773
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,460
In ice-draining

774
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,400
triple color.

775
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,900
Yeah, the multiple

776
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,860
where everything

777
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,640
was sort of

778
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,780
like overlays

779
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,360
with each other

780
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,760
and I watched

781
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,360
the whole movie

782
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:50,700
that way

783
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,620
and then I was

784
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,700
older in my teens

785
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,620
I watched it again

786
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,260
and I was like

787
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,680
something's not right.

788
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,140
What is wrong with

789
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,060
it was different.

790
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,900
It doesn't have

791
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,080
that scary blur.

792
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,660
Yeah, and that's

793
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,200
what it was.

794
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,180
It didn't, you know

795
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,900
of course I guess

796
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,460
to be fair

797
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,280
I was really little

798
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,620
and maybe shouldn't

799
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,420
have been watching

800
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,620
such

801
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,280
nonsense.

802
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,720
Everyone should

803
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,200
watch the

804
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,100
at all ages.

805
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,020
At all ages?

806
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,460
Children know

807
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,840
themselves

808
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
what is scary

809
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,920
and don't need

810
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,540
to be protected

811
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,060
by adults

812
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,020
who are completely

813
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,860
out of step

814
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,600
with a child's

815
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,020
imagination.

816
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,340
Watched a lot

817
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,720
of Twilight Zone.

818
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,340
Kids censor

819
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,640
themselves.

820
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,780
If they're scared

821
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,660
they'll put their

822
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,380
hands over their

823
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
face or hide

824
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,200
under the movie

825
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
seat like I did.

826
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,460
If I'd seen

827
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,180
Creature from the

828
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,160
Black Lagoon first

829
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,800
instead of

830
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,620
King Dinosaur

831
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,480
my whole life

832
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,060
may have been

833
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,700
very different.

834
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,240
Maybe.

835
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,780
It would have

836
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,520
been built around

837
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,160
one piece swimsuits

838
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,840
instead of

839
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:42,860
ripping.

840
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,300
Yes.

841
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,520
In skirts.

842
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,760
Where the monster

843
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,520
like swims

844
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,720
under the girl

845
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,500
in the one piece

846
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,720
swimming suit

847
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,000
you know

848
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,520
and he's down

849
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,420
there watching

850
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,400
her in the bubbles

851
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,000
and reaching up

852
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
and then he actually

853
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,400
does touch her ankle

854
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
and cut to a shot

855
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,300
of her up

856
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,440
on the surface

857
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,640
going

858
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
and somebody

859
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,960
That's when my

860
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,200
dates always went bad.

861
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Right.

862
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,500
When you touch

863
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:03,900
their ankle?

864
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,220
When I touch

865
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,960
the foot from

866
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,360
underneath.

867
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,520
Oh then you

868
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,360
didn't get away

869
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,760
with it.

870
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,360
You don't start

871
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,460
with the ankle though.

872
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,400
Well the creature

873
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,480
is in murky

874
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,700
water in the

875
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,000
Amazonian Lagoon

876
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,420
in the

877
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,100
chlorine

878
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,320
swimming pool.

879
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,180
You can't get away

880
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,380
with it as easily

881
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,700
unless the sun

882
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,880
is at the right angle.

883
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:21,540
But there is a

884
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,780
murky pond.

885
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,880
That actress

886
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Julie Adams

887
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,440
is still around

888
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,140
and she goes

889
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,020
to the

890
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,900
Monster Bash

891
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,020
conventions in

892
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,460
Pittsburgh

893
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,600
every year.

894
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,600
Because she's

895
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,020
a damn good sport.

896
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,140
Actresses that

897
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,620
appear in

898
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,320
monster movies

899
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,240
are not

900
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,660
mean

901
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
and haughty

902
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,220
and proud

903
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,320
but are friendly

904
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,020
and outgoing.

905
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,760
She must be

906
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,780
90 years old

907
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,420
and there'd be

908
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,320
young spring chickens

909
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,960
like myself

910
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,140
lined up.

911
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,380
How about Julie

912
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,740
Newmar who's in

913
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,960
her 70s

914
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,080
but still

915
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
is just as

916
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,340
powerful

917
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,060
a presence.

918
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,880
She's got

919
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,980
silver hair

920
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,860
but she's got

921
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,660
the same figure

922
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,740
and the same face.

923
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,760
Don't mention her

924
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
around Susie the Flusie.

925
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,580
Susie's got a

926
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,640
real problem

927
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
with Julie Newmar.

928
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,640
What's the matter?

929
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,460
Something happened

930
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,780
between those two

931
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,420
that just

932
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,000
don't go out.

933
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,280
You put

934
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
Catwoman next to

935
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,860
Susie the Flusie

936
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,200
and there's

937
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,100
a cat fight

938
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,120
that you won't forget.

939
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,440
If you want to hear

940
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,020
some really nasty stuff.

941
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,960
Ask Susie about

942
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,540
Julie Newmar

943
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,320
and retire

944
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,320
to safe distance.

945
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,600
Right.

946
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,800
Well,

947
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,800
that's another

948
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,020
thing we can

949
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,720
look forward to.

950
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,720
When is Susie

951
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,260
coming in

952
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,540
to

953
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,720
X-Day

954
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,940
to be among us?

955
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,700
She's here.

956
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,660
She's here now?

957
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,220
She's here.

958
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,780
She's been here

959
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,440
for a few days.

960
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,080
She's just

961
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,000
on her own.

962
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,960
She's on her own

963
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,200
schedule.

964
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,880
She's on her own

965
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,180
schedule.

966
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:44,300
She's camped

967
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,160
with Philo, right?

968
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,440
Um,

969
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,000
yeah,

970
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,600
maybe,

971
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:48,900
well,

972
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,460
is Philo

973
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,980
camped in

974
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,000
27B?

975
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,400
I don't know.

976
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,820
Well,

977
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,580
he has to have

978
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,480
the special

979
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,780
power hookup

980
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
for his special

981
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,140
powers.

982
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,360
I think that was

983
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,540
in 34A.

984
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
So who's

985
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,440
in 27B?

986
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,400
Uh,

987
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,920
maybe.

988
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,340
There is no

989
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,460
27B in this

990
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,040
campground.

991
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,820
You should know

992
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,120
that people

993
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,000
are not

994
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,460
supposed to

995
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,480
park on top

996
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,100
of the hay,

997
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,220
right?

998
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,020
They're not

999
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,360
supposed to

1000
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,900
park on top

1001
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,260
of the hay.

1002
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,560
Yeah,

1003
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,580
you're supposed

1004
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:16,940
to stay

1005
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,780
off the straw.

1006
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,820
Stay off

1007
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,320
the straw.

1008
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,740
It's like,

1009
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,620
stay off the,

1010
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,020
you know.

1011
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,140
Take my advice.

1012
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,140
Stay off the hay.

1013
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,580
Yeah.

1014
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,680
Keep off the straw.

1015
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,500
Keep off,

1016
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,780
it's hard stuff,

1017
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,080
man.

1018
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,720
Once you try

1019
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,660
your first straw,

1020
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,320
it won't be

1021
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,100
the last straw.

1022
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,740
Let me put it

1023
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,140
that way.

1024
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,220
This is,

1025
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,280
as Bean said,

1026
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:35,960
families have

1027
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,600
been destroyed

1028
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,960
because of the straw.

1029
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,700
So stay off

1030
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,120
the straw

1031
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,700
and,

1032
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,960
and this is

1033
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,980
a family friendly

1034
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,520
event.

1035
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:43,880
If you have a straw

1036
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,160
problem,

1037
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,880
if you have a problem

1038
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,520
with being on the straw,

1039
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,920
please contact

1040
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,420
one of the staff

1041
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,120
and,

1042
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
or one of us

1043
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,820
and let us know

1044
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,660
if you have a straw

1045
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,120
problem.

1046
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,520
Well,

1047
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,400
what do you think

1048
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
those grotty

1049
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,580
old homeless hippies

1050
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,160
are always saying?

1051
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,780
Hey,

1052
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,800
man.

1053
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,320
Yeah,

1054
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,700
yeah,

1055
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,880
they want some of that.

1056
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,140
They've got a straw problem.

1057
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,840
They are saying that

1058
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,720
because they need

1059
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,460
silage forked

1060
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:07,860
their way.

1061
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,220
Mr. Ed was originally

1062
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,320
a human college

1063
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,780
professor.

1064
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,480
Eventually,

1065
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,280
the metamorphosis

1066
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,000
made him

1067
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,540
completely

1068
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,560
an equine.

1069
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,280
But the voice

1070
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,240
is the last to go

1071
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,100
as we know

1072
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,680
from watching

1073
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,380
Pinocchio

1074
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,400
and other scientific films.

1075
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,360
is the first to go.

1076
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,380
No,

1077
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,780
they,

1078
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,580
they remember

1079
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,080
the,

1080
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,540
when the candle wick

1081
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,000
changes

1082
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,080
and those others

1083
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,600
they're screaming

1084
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,700
human voices.

1085
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,520
In fact,

1086
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,000
they found one

1087
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,560
That traumatized

1088
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,460
the hell out of me.

1089
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,100
They found one

1090
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,220
that could still talk

1091
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,460
and they separated him

1092
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,100
from the other

1093
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,220
jackasses

1094
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,860
that were going

1095
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,600
off for a life

1096
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,180
of slavery

1097
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,220
and they put him back

1098
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,320
with the still

1099
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,340
transforming

1100
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,540
bad boy.

1101
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,220
And that was just

1102
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,460
for smoking cigars.

1103
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,400
And breaking

1104
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,420
stained glass windows.

1105
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:50,680
Yeah,

1106
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,320
and being a wise,

1107
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,340
a wiseacre.

1108
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:52,860
Yeah.

1109
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,480
Talking back

1110
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,580
to your elders and such.

1111
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,940
Think what they're

1112
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,700
going to do to you

1113
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,300
when you get

1114
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,160
to Donkey Island,

1115
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,560
friend.

1116
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,260
If you stay here,

1117
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,040
you'll have to go

1118
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,820
to Donkey Island.

1119
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,580
But if you come

1120
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,000
with us,

1121
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,580
yes,

1122
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,300
a wiseass

1123
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,020
like Lucius Apuleius

1124
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,980
in Metamorphosis.

1125
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,380
Right.

1126
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,380


1127
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,340
An ass that is gold

1128
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,480
and knows everything.

1129
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,800
My parents had to

1130
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,580
carry me screaming

1131
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,080
out of Pinocchio

1132
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
because of that scene

1133
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,700
and out of Snow White

1134
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,200
because the witch hunt

1135
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
at the end

1136
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,640
with the dwarves

1137
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,660
are hunting the witch

1138
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,640
and there's thunder

1139
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,320
and lightning

1140
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,040
and it's...

1141
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,900
And the vultures

1142
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,740
slowly circling down

1143
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,500
to feast

1144
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,220
on the old

1145
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,540
crone's remains.

1146
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,240
It's interesting.

1147
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,560
It's another thing

1148
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,140
that makes you

1149
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,980
a subgenius

1150
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,040
is your parents

1151
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,860
exposing you

1152
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,480
to pornography

1153
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,840
and you're

1154
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,100
like,

1155
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,400
I don't know

1156
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:41,400


1157
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,140
But maybe...

1158
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,040
Such a young age.

1159
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,780
When the witch

1160
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,000
crashed on the rocks

1161
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,140
off camera,

1162
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,200
she turned back

1163
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,820
into the voluptuous queen

1164
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,860
only all dead

1165
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,480
and everything

1166
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,420
so the vultures

1167
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,260
had a better meal

1168
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,340
when they got down there.

1169
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,620
I like to think so.

1170
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,980
Well, that's sweet.

1171
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,700
You know,

1172
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,080
also in Snow White,

1173
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,660
you probably

1174
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,600
haven't even seen

1175
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,420
this scene

1176
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,200
because they

1177
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,380
adjust the aspect

1178
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,680
ratio wrong

1179
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,060
so you can't see

1180
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,920
what's at the bottom

1181
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,480
of the screen.

1182
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,220
They make it look

1183
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,780
more like a

1184
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,700
contemporary screen.

1185
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,740
It was shot

1186
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,820
more square screen,

1187
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,620
right, Stang?

1188
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,900
So when the witch

1189
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
transforms herself

1190
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,820
and she stamps

1191
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,960
out of her castle

1192
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,760
on her way

1193
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,580
to give Snow White

1194
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,500
the poisoned apple,

1195
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,880
she passes by

1196
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,060
this pathetic scene

1197
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,300
where she's

1198
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
tortured some victim

1199
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,680
and the skeleton

1200
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,960
is reaching out

1201
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,060
through the grid

1202
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,040
for a vase of water

1203
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,340
and a loaf of bread

1204
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,900
and she says,

1205
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,700
oh, you want food

1206
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,140
and water?

1207
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,920
Take it!

1208
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,900
And she kicks it

1209
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,780
and the bread

1210
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,700
crumbles into dust

1211
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,840
and the jug breaks

1212
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,780
and a huge spike

1213
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:40,980
and the spider

1214
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,760
runs out

1215
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,000
and runs away.

1216
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,040
But you can't see

1217
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,300
that spider, friends,

1218
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,620
because they won't let you.

1219
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,680
The conspiracy

1220
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,660
masks off the bottom

1221
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,480
of that screen.

1222
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,280
They're afraid

1223
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,560
to show you

1224
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,620
the truth of the spider.

1225
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,620
Well, they're afraid

1226
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,160
to show you

1227
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,240
the true grizzliness

1228
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
and grimness

1229
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,760
of Walt Disney,

1230
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,660
which is one

1231
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,120
of the secrets

1232
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,240
of Disney's success.

1233
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:03,880
Well, also,

1234
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,580
they wanted to look

1235
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,820
cool and widescreen.

1236
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,500
I think that's

1237
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,160
the main thing.

1238
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
That old boxed-off

1239
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,380
of ratios.

1240
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,620
their heads,

1241
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,400
chopped off,

1242
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,680
especially in

1243
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,040
small towns

1244
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,760
where there's just

1245
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,460
robotic projection anyway.

1246
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,760
I saw Rossellini's

1247
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,700
The Rise of Louis XIV,

1248
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,340
or rather,

1249
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,560
I saw a third of it.

1250
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,260
Couldn't see

1251
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,060
anybody's heads.

1252
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,320
Just a bunch

1253
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,920
of fancy

1254
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,140
royal costumes

1255
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,100
walking around.

1256
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,780
Fortunately,

1257
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,640
Louis himself

1258
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,300
was shorter

1259
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,200
than everybody else,

1260
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,200
so I got to see him.

1261
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,640
Yeah, the

1262
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Toulouse track movie

1263
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,520
was no problem.

1264
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,480
Their heads

1265
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
chopped off.

1266
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,800
Yeah, tall people

1267
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,540
always get their heads

1268
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,820
chopped off.

1269
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,260
Happens to me

1270
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,640
all the time.

1271
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,740
Remember the tyrant

1272
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,440
of Athens

1273
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,120
who said,

1274
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,240
how do you keep

1275
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
a fractious population

1276
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,560
in control?

1277
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,100
Look at that

1278
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
field of wheat.

1279
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,880
You see there's

1280
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,740
some stalks

1281
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,340
that stick up

1282
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,520
above the others?

1283
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,780
Well, we chop

1284
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,560
those off,

1285
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,360
so they're just

1286
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,900
as high as the others.

1287
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,280
So short people

1288
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,040
have an advantage?

1289
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,700
Well, it's just that

1290
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,240
don't stick your head up

1291
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,860
if you don't want

1292
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,360
to be chopped down.

1293
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,860
Right, the nail

1294
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,380
that sticks up

1295
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,040
will be hammered down.

1296
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,880
Yes.

1297
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,060
Thought about getting hammered.

1298
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,760
To quote Nance,

1299
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,140
who now claims

1300
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,880
that he was never

1301
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,780
a subgenius.

1302
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,220
Yes, Nance has gotten

1303
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,060
crotchetier and crotchetier.

1304
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,640
But he's...

1305
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,980
That's hard to imagine

1306
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,680
because he was

1307
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,600
the crotchetiest

1308
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,240
young man in the world.

1309
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,640
He's always been crotchety.

1310
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,380
You know,

1311
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,940
when I was in his house,

1312
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,900
I visited him.

1313
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,780
He had a coffee table book,

1314
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,060
you know,

1315
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,700
like most people

1316
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,960
have a coffee table book

1317
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
about flowers or something.

1318
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,120
You can look at

1319
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,820
the beautiful pictures.

1320
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,040
He had one entitled

1321
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,420
Weeds.

1322
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,400
And it was a picture

1323
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,940
of weeds.

1324
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,600
And sure enough,

1325
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,560
the book was like

1326
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,940
a coffee table book

1327
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,180
treatment of weeds.

1328
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,600
That was a...

1329
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,620
It turned into a hit show

1330
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,200
though, didn't it?

1331
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,380
Well, it wasn't

1332
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,000
the same thing.

1333
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,180
A different one?

1334
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,300
I get confused.

1335
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,900
Isn't it called Weed?

1336
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,620
Or is it called Weed?

1337
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,260
No, I think it's called

1338
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,720
Weeds.

1339
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:54,900
I don't know.

1340
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,120
I don't watch television.

1341
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,340
I haven't seen it, actually.

1342
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,340
Oh, you're too cool

1343
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,300
to watch TV, huh?

1344
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,580
No, it's too dumb.

1345
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
It's expensive.

1346
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,280
Yeah.

1347
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,180
If you have it,

1348
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,800
you feel guilty

1349
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,280
for not watching it.

1350
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,880
No, I'm the weird mutant

1351
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
because the only...

1352
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,440
Mutant.

1353
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,520
I'm the weird mutant.

1354
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:10,720
I'm the weird mutant

1355
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,860
who only likes sports

1356
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,620
on television.

1357
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,700
That's all I watch

1358
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,120
on television.

1359
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,540
You are a weird mutant

1360
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,340
in that respect.

1361
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,000
Most of us are, you know,

1362
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,280
wimps that wouldn't get...

1363
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,060
We were the last one

1364
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,480
picked for the volleyball team.

1365
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,460
How about those giants?

1366
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,880
Traumatized by that stuff.

1367
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,700
I've been checking

1368
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,080
the World Cup scores

1369
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,640
between getting...

1370
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,320
running this stuff here.

1371
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,100
I've been, like,

1372
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,700
looking and going

1373
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
and seeing who was winning

1374
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,520
in the World Cup.

1375
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,960
You know,

1376
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,920
but that's the great thing

1377
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,100
about subgeniuses

1378
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,980
is that each of us

1379
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,280
is differently screwed up.

1380
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,440
Well, also,

1381
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,580
subgeniuses

1382
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,960
didn't have a team

1383
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,620
on the field

1384
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,300
for that event.

1385
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,620
Just imagine

1386
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,460
how a team

1387
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,900
of fully accredited

1388
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,900
subgeniuses

1389
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,140
would do in this.

1390
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,280
I think Germany

1391
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,340
would take them out,

1392
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
but if they had to play

1393
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,240
against Bolivia,

1394
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:53,960
they would probably

1395
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,520
do all right.

1396
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,460
I know that a true team

1397
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,440
of Yeti players

1398
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,000
could definitely handle

1399
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,620
what I saw

1400
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,780
from England earlier.

1401
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,220
They're fairly close

1402
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,780
as it is.

1403
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,780
Wasn't one player

1404
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,020
repeatedly censored

1405
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,480
for biting with his teeth?

1406
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,180
Yes, that was...

1407
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,280
He took big bites

1408
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,360
of other players.

1409
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,420
That was his third

1410
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:10,680
biting,

1411
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,060
and usually that's a problem

1412
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,720
with preschool.

1413
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
Three bites and you're out.

1414
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,500
No real American

1415
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,660
watches soccer.

1416
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,000
Hmm.

1417
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,620
Well, that may be

1418
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,320
about to change.

1419
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,780
There's no such thing as...

1420
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,400
Ann Coulter

1421
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,820
famously announced

1422
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,600
that you're a

1423
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,380
damn sissy

1424
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,580
if you had any interest

1425
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,300
in soccer.

1426
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,980
I thought that...

1427
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,640
You know, you see,

1428
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,780
that's one of those cases

1429
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,680
I think they call...

1430
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,140
Was that a death wish?

1431
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,460
I looked at it

1432
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:36,800
and I was like,

1433
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,940
that's got to be

1434
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
an Onion article.

1435
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,060
Nobody is that bad.

1436
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,840
Oh, she is.

1437
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,320
She does it too.

1438
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,140
And that's the problem

1439
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,460
is that the conspiracy,

1440
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,320
you know,

1441
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,060
just keeps getting

1442
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,600
dumber.

1443
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,100
It's harder and harder

1444
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,660
to tell an Onion article

1445
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,900
from a straight headline

1446
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,860
and even subgeniuses

1447
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,500
are asking me

1448
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,880
when Stephen Colbert

1449
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,780
is going to be here.

1450
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,780
So what you going to do?

1451
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,700
Well, you'll just have to

1452
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
shake your head ruefully

1453
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
and pocket their money.

1454
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,400
Well, Colbert is camped

1455
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,440
in 20...

1456
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,200
No.

1457
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,460
12 G.

1458
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,220
You can find him in 12 G.

1459
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,820
But he can't come out

1460
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,600
during the daylight.

1461
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,620
Are you some kind of

1462
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,560
Aspie or something

1463
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,160
that remembers

1464
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,260
where every single

1465
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,200
campsite is?

1466
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
You're just making

1467
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,160
these up, aren't you?

1468
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,380
There is no 12 G.

1469
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,520
Are you calling me a liar?

1470
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,720
No, I'm calling you

1471
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,740
a member of the church

1472
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,900
of the subgenius.

1473
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,460
It's different.

1474
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,680
We call it a spouting.

1475
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,640
Are you suggesting...

1476
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,020
It's not lying.

1477
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:36,600
It's a fake spouting.

1478
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,500
Are you suggesting

1479
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,560
that I pull stuff

1480
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,380
out of my tail

1481
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,120
all the time?

1482
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,480
Well, don't let us

1483
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,100
keep you back.

1484
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Well, you know,

1485
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,800
I mean,

1486
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,260
that would almost imply

1487
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,100
that I was...

1488
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,800
I just made up

1489
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,060
all the schedule and...

1490
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,100
You might even have

1491
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,840
made up this entire scene

1492
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,540
and us...

1493
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:56,700
You did actually

1494
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,840
literally make up

1495
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,560
the schedule.

1496
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,280
I wish you didn't

1497
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,480
use Excel for that.

1498
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,080
Those are hard

1499
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:03,880
for me to read.

1500
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,100
I'm sorry.

1501
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,420
That's okay.

1502
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,220
It's all right.

1503
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
We're all screwed up

1504
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,400
in different ways.

1505
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,400


1506
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,400


1507
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,400


1508
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,400


1509
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,400


1510
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,160
We are all screwed up

1511
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,020
in different ways.

1512
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,900
Are you pouty about that?

1513
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,500
I want everybody

1514
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,340
to be screwed up

1515
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,280
the same way.

1516
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,660
No, that makes it boring.

1517
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:19,900
No, actually we don't

1518
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,220
because then they'd all be broke.

1519
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Every one of them.

1520
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,540
At least there's

1521
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,900
one subgenius

1522
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,400
who still has some money.

1523
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,820
Who is that?

1524
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,060
Not me.

1525
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,860
I better not say his name.

1526
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,220
He's not at the campground here.

1527
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,680
It's a couple, actually.

1528
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,960
Let me put it this way.

1529
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,720
They're catching

1530
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
all of the Devo Tour.

1531
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,740
The last Devo Tour.

1532
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,380
They're bringing

1533
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,640
They'll be at every show.

1534
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,580
That's the only subgenius

1535
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,620
that has any money left.

1536
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,700
And after these Devo shows,

1537
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,400
they'll be broke too.

1538
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,160
So don't even think about it.

1539
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,080
Maybe.

1540
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,200
It's all right.

1541
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:58,740
He said,

1542
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,460
I think Mark Mothersbaugh

1543
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,400
probably is.

1544
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,380
Comments?

1545
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,700
Is rich?

1546
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,320
I wouldn't know.

1547
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,640
I haven't seen his taxes.

1548
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:09,760
He doesn't return

1549
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,420
my phone calls anymore.

1550
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,060
Aww.

1551
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
I haven't called him.

1552
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,680
He was funny.

1553
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,420
When he first started out

1554
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,760
as a rock star,

1555
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,700
he didn't know

1556
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,740
what the drugs were

1557
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,720
or the right way to take them.

1558
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,760
So was he snorting

1559
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,220
the marijuanas

1560
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,520
and smoking the cocaine?

1561
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,160
I guess we're supposed

1562
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,920
to take those

1563
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,720
packing the coke up

1564
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,500
as exit when

1565
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,040
mixing it with vodka.

1566
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
But that's how we discover

1567
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,500
new things.

1568
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
By experimenting.

1569
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,020
Some people need to realize

1570
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
that rum and coke

1571
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,920
is a drink recipe,

1572
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,760
not a sequence of events.

1573
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,180
There's a Woody Allen movie

1574
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,240
where somebody offers

1575
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,280
Woody Allen's character

1576
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,720
some big bunch of cocaine.

1577
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,020
He's supposed to just carve up,

1578
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,240
but he just sneezes in it,

1579
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,920
blows it all over.

1580
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,620
Annie Hall, I think.

1581
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,800
That really happened

1582
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,700
with Jane or Hyperclete.

1583
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,120
It would.

1584
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,880
Oh, I can't use that

1585
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,600
on the show either.

1586
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,620
Oh, no.

1587
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,940
I thought we weren't

1588
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,440
supposed to mention.

1589
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,780
I know, I know.

1590
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,160
No, but every now and then

1591
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,940
something that's supposed

1592
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,440
to only happen in the movies

1593
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
in a stupid,

1594
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,000
stupid comedy movie

1595
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,500
really happens

1596
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,240
in the church

1597
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,300
of the subgenius.

1598
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,360
Are subgeniuses?

1599
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,460
No.

1600
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:16,980
Stooges.

1601
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,380
No, no, no.

1602
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,220
I was wondering

1603
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,480
the 300 Stooges.

1604
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,240
You were making me wonder

1605
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
if possibly that my life

1606
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,480
is a stupid comedy movie.

1607
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,380
Well, let me put it this way.

1608
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,840
You would be a Moe,

1609
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:31,880
like me.

1610
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,220
I would rather be a Groucho.

1611
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,740
Well, I guess you sort of

1612
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,440
have that option.

1613
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,260
I'm not a real big fan.

1614
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,260


1615
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,080
I thought in terms of

1616
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,480
Moes, Larrys, and Curleys.

1617
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,620
I'm not a real big fan.

1618
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,360
They always love

1619
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,820
the stupid one best.

1620
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,640
See, women don't,

1621
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,600
tend not to like

1622
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,500
the Stooges anyway,

1623
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,200
but older fans,

1624
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,600
here's an interesting phenomenon,

1625
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,920
they may start

1626
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
by hating Shemp,

1627
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,620
but later,

1628
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,540
after they watch

1629
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:56,960
and watch,

1630
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,700
they'll start thinking,

1631
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,140
well, you know,

1632
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,120
Shemp was actually

1633
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,880
pretty funny.

1634
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,420
He was pretty subtle.

1635
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,640
I did Shemp wrong.

1636
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,680
Shemp, more of that, please.

1637
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,820
Yeah.

1638
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,100
Shemp was a stupid,

1639
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,060
very stupid,

1640
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,820
Shemp was Moe's brother.

1641
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,760
Yes, that Shemp was a Stooges

1642
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,460
before Curleys.

1643
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,880
I just didn't get,

1644
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,720
I was more of a

1645
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,820
Marx Brothers girl,

1646
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,480
you know?

1647
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,860
I guess, you know,

1648
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,140
when it comes to the Stooges,

1649
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,880
I'm against it.

1650
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,060
Well, Marx Brothers is

1651
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,280
vastly more cerebral.

1652
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,320
Most of their humor

1653
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,000
was spoken word.

1654
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,480
Well, and we've

1655
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,220
talked about this.

1656
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,080
Stooges are just

1657
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,600
pure theater of cruelty.

1658
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,800
Right, right, right,

1659
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,580
and we've talked about this.

1660
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,860
I have a thing for Breen.

1661
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,100
I have a, you know,

1662
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,740
a slight thing,

1663
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,780
You know, what I mean by thing.

1664
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,340
Can we see it?

1665
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,060
I have a thing for things.

1666
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh, well.

1667
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,540
I'm just a thing thing.

1668
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,740
I have a thing.

1669
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,360
You have a thing for things that have things for brains?

1670
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,420
Well, it's like Princess Wee is a people person.

1671
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,480
I'm not even a thing person.

1672
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,140
I'm a thing thing.

1673
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,100
You have a thing for things for things?

1674
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,980
It's not even that.

1675
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,600
It's just things don't have things for things.

1676
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,820
The only thing they can do is things.

1677
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,200
Oh, okay.

1678
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,820
It's action.

1679
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,020
Action.

1680
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,520
It's slack through action rather than faith, you might say.

1681
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,980
But, of course, just any action is not slackful in its effects.

1682
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,340
You can't just flail and fling around.

1683
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:26,740
You might receive slack, but there's no guarantee that you're going to convey it to others in a subgeniously way.

1684
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:35,100
It must be the right kind of slack, which we call sal-ack, and not the wrong kind of slack, which we call sack-ack.

1685
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,400
Isn't that right, Stang?

1686
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,280
I'm glad you remembered what the second one was.

1687
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:49,800
The second one, which is generally symbolized in our sacred documents by a picture of a broken TV set, sack-ack is the wrong kind of slack.

1688
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:57,140
One wants sal-ack, which is symbolized by rolling a perfect strike while bowling.

1689
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,300
Make sure that that question is on the quiz.

1690
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,460
So, make sure you write that down.

1691
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,860
You'll see that it's written on the board.

1692
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,380
And remember to take it.

1693
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,560
Take your notes.

1694
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,700
Why every schoolboy knows.

1695
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,240
The quiz will be tomorrow at about 3 o'clock.

1696
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,440
You know, I need this cram.

1697
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,540
Stop.

1698
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,600
Turn in your books.

1699
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,720
Every now and then people will start asking me about something in Book of the Subgenius.

1700
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,380
And it gives you a cramp?

1701
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,360
I have to make up some kind of an answer or honestly go, did I say that?

1702
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,180
I guess you better pick up on it then.

1703
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,760
What about the doctrine of mutability?

1704
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,020
Right.

1705
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,220
Why?

1706
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,800
My problem is I haven't read that damn thing in quite a long time.

1707
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,660
I probably should.

1708
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,940
You don't have it?

1709
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,860
I mean, because most...

1710
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,140
I didn't memorize it like everybody else did.

1711
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,540
No, no, no.

1712
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,020
I mean, I did at one point, but that was a lot of brain cells under the bridge.

1713
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,480
You don't have it in the excrementation chamber?

1714
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,580
Book of the Subgenius?

1715
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:55,940
Right.

1716
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:56,920
Nope.

1717
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,200
No, no, I don't.

1718
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,020
I do have quite a varied amount of reading, but I've already read the Book of the Subgenius.

1719
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,400
In fact, to tell the truth, I typed...

1720
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,380
I typed...

1721
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:06,380


1722
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,260
I typed all of that on a typewriter.

1723
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,940
I didn't mean I wrote it all.

1724
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,960
I was working for Bob's Memos and stuff.

1725
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:13,400
There, there.

1726
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,040
It's all right.

1727
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,480
But I had to type it.

1728
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,400
It's all right.

1729
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:23,220
And glue the damn strips of text and the little pictures down according to

1730
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,500
Hel Swami Satellite Weaver's instructions.

1731
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,040
Or worse, Paul Mavridis.

1732
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Those guys are like, they're too...

1733
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,760
They can tell you where to lay everything out, but they're not going to glue it down themselves.

1734
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,360
I mean...

1735
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,320
Are you telling me that your whole existence in life has been following others' instructions?

1736
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,640
That's right.

1737
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,700
I'm the chimpan, the sacred chimpanzee in the Church of the Subgenius.

1738
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,220
Speaking of...

1739
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,660
A nutless chimp could do my job.

1740
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,800
Do you...

1741
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,220
What?

1742
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,900
I never could afford to do...

1743
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,800
What about when the Book of the Subgenius was being put together?

1744
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,180
No, we didn't have anything like that.

1745
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,300
As you wish.

1746
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,580
I had my first and last quaalude.

1747
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,220
As we finished the last chapter, I thought it was like a Valium and it was supposed to keep my foot cramps down.

1748
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,360
But I went to jail.

1749
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,600
Valium of the dullards.

1750
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,620
And never, ever, ever touched those pills again.

1751
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,700
But at least...

1752
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,120
Never, never, never.

1753
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,080
Those policemen were right to say, sir, you're going downtown with us.

1754
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,580
At least you weren't on the straw.

1755
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,720
No, I was not on the straw, which is so powerful that...

1756
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,960
They call it a recreational...

1757
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:43,120
A drug, which is fine if your idea of recreation is waking up in the gutter wondering whose head you have on.

1758
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,700
I ripped that off from Terry Pratchett, by the way.

1759
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,460
He got it from L. Frank Baum.

1760
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,600
Really?

1761
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,240
The Princess Languid Weir.

1762
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,840
Oh, right. She could switch heads.

1763
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:03,340
Well, this is like you don't even know which head you put on after you do the straw and wake up in the gutter.

1764
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,220
You wake up with somebody else's head.

1765
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,720
It's probably somebody you don't remember meeting.

1766
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,780
The only problem with people with multiple heads is they seem to be so two-faced.

1767
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,640
You can ask Lonesome Cowboy Dave about that.

1768
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,600
He has a parasitic twin hanging off the back of his head.

1769
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,680
A heteropagial twin.

1770
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,440
It babbles.

1771
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,860
It's the minor. He's the major.

1772
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,220
When you get two-headers, there's always one that dominates.

1773
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:31,960
There's no such thing as a two-headed person with each head that equally contributes.

1774
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,720
Why do you think he wears a hoodie?

1775
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,340
No, I feel really bad because I think I'm...

1776
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,720
I might have been talking to the wrong head.

1777
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,880
That two-headed teenage girl, I forget her name.

1778
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:48,440
One of the heads, the less dominant head, operates one side of the body, and yet she runs effortlessly around.

1779
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,100
That means the left side is operating the left foot and the left arm.

1780
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,220
But otherwise, that head, you may notice if you see her, is sort of leaning.

1781
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,520
By the way, I have dibs on those girls.

1782
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,400
Boy, those...

1783
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,720
Come accident.

1784
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,560
Can you imagine this teenage...

1785
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,320
With boobs?

1786
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,320


1787
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,580
Blonde hair and...

1788
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,320
Actually, Mavridis and I are going to end up fighting over that.

1789
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah, because they first made Life magazine when they were only about 12.

1790
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,480
They were on Oprah.

1791
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,280
They look pretty good.

1792
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,480
They look...

1793
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:27,200
They're pretty good now, except that the upper body has to contain two sets of lungs and two hearts, and so is somewhat larger.

1794
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,840
And I only have half a brain.

1795
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,140
Spreading upward this way, but still, you know...

1796
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,760
You have half a brain?

1797
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,320
I've only got half a brain.

1798
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,320


1799
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,680
I have a brain cell.

1800
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,260
Well, no, I have half a brain.

1801
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,400
I know, we're doing good.

1802
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:39,960
We're doing good.

1803
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,660
I have half a brain, but I share it with three other people.

1804
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,860
Holly Brain Marissa.

1805
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,980
Oh, man.

1806
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,840
And I never know.

1807
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,340
It's like, okay, just...

1808
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,000
Who has it today?

1809
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,760
Or do they have parts of it?

1810
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,000
I can't keep track.

1811
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,220
And then the problem with having half a brain and sharing it with three other people is that when one of them has it, you don't have the brain to remember they have it.

1812
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,040
And then you don't have enough brain to find out who has the other half.

1813
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,440
Half the brain.

1814
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,880
That's not your job.

1815
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,560
Somebody else has to keep charge.

1816
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,280
It's always my job, Hal.

1817
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,420
It's always my job.

1818
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,300
Well, maybe you take on too much.

1819
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,740
Well, you know, somebody has to do it, though.

1820
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,440
Somebody has to do it.

1821
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,560
It always has to be done.

1822
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,200
Someone has to do it.

1823
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,720
Somebody has to take care of it.

1824
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,460
Like, could I hear...

1825
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,180
No, I guess not.

1826
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,560
I'm accustomed to doing radio with headphones.

1827
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,280
It's a...

1828
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,420
I guess I don't get to...

1829
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,480
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1830
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,500
It's a...

1831
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,920
Oh, well.

1832
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,680
The other one had a bad connection.

1833
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,120
How many times have I heard that before?

1834
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,440
Yeah.

1835
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,000
Oh, look at this.

1836
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,040
That's what he told her.

1837
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,380
Image of slack.

1838
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,900
Yes.

1839
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,360
There's an...

1840
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,420
Reverend Susie the floozy is almost in the house.

1841
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,980
And she's almost the only person in the house.

1842
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:04,360
You should swap with me for a little bit, Flooze.

1843
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,740
On my head and be a scratch

1844
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,000
Actually, I was going to say...

1845
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,780
I was a hatching if I only had a brain.

1846
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,600
We only have...

1847
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,680
We can only run three mics up here.

1848
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,100
Well, I mean, I'd love to be down here...

1849
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,720
I want everyone to know that if somebody really wants to...

1850
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,420
With the thoughts...

1851
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,400
I'd be thinking I could be a lovely Lincoln

1852
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,460
if I only had a brain.

1853
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,980
For a while.

1854
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,740
I can't say how long.

1855
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,920
Oh, I...

1856
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,480
I had to leave that big shepherd's crook at home, by the way.

1857
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,680
Oh, that's okay.

1858
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,020
I understand.

1859
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,160
We have new methods now.

1860
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,060
We make...

1861
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,880
I apparently...

1862
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,660
I have the disappearing talent.

1863
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,760
I can make people disappear.

1864
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,620
I don't know how I do it, but apparently I can.

1865
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,720
I'd be gay.

1866
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:01,680
I'd be merry.

1867
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Life could be a ding-a-dary

1868
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,660
if I only had a brain.

1869
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,760
Doodle-a-deedle-a-deedle-a-deedle.

1870
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,640
I kind of wandered off there into a little happy space.

1871
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,140
A little happy space with little happy trees.

1872
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,260
Of idealized imaginary brainlessness.

1873
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,680
If I only had some slack.

1874
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,000
If I only had a dick.

1875
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,460
If I only had a butt.

1876
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,000
I wish I had a scrotum.

1877
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,460
If I only had $16 million.

1878
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,800
I wish I had a scrotum.

1879
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
If I only had $16 million.

1880
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,360
That's the one.

1881
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,160
That's the keeper.

1882
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,720
So, what you were saying is that

1883
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,860
you have no problem

1884
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,740
with somebody swapping out on this

1885
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,660
live-hour slack if they had something they wanted.

1886
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,460
You couldn't make a movie with that.

1887
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,800
Well, you could.

1888
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,620
Well, it wouldn't be a top-drawer, top-flight Hollywood spectacular.

1889
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,460
Or you wouldn't be able to advertise it.

1890
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,760
Therefore, nobody would see it.

1891
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,440
No matter how good it is.

1892
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,180
Except unless Dr. Dark found out about it

1893
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,600
and showed it at Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1894
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,940
Awesome things happen at Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1895
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,960
I got engaged at Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1896
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,660
Wow, really?

1897
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,460
Yep.

1898
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:05,840
Really?

1899
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,120
Yeah.

1900
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,600
I lost my virginity at Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1901
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,440
Aww.

1902
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,300
I think it was 11X Day, yeah.

1903
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,160
Aww.

1904
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:17,880
Yeah.

1905
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:18,960
That was wild.

1906
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,560
Embarrassing.

1907
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,300
Messy.

1908
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,180
It can be.

1909
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,300
I think that was what happened.

1910
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:25,700
Wait, wait, wait.

1911
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,960
That's what he told me it was.

1912
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,880
That's what Bob said.

1913
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,560
Was it the...

1914
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,060
Congratulations, Stag, you just lost your virginity.

1915
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,760
The other virginity.

1916
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,980
Is that what it was?

1917
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:33,680
Oh.

1918
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,200
Oh.

1919
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,560
And he left me.

1920
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,640
50 cents, too.

1921
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,920
50 centavos.

1922
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,560
Christ, Bob.

1923
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,540
Well, that just shows you got something for nothing.

1924
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,280
And he took away my virginity for only 50 cents.

1925
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,980
How about that, ladies and gents?

1926
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:47,400
Oh.

1927
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,640
Not the oh.

1928
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Somebody, we sold Doug Wellman's teeth at one of these things.

1929
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,620
I sold Doug Wellman's teeth.

1930
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,360
Something like that.

1931
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,160
I was the auctioneer on that occasion.

1932
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,840
Let's not forget, there's going to be a Bulldada auction.

1933
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,140
There will be a Bulldada auction.

1934
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


1935
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,000
Is there really?

1936
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,100
Really?

1937
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,440
Because did anybody bring anything to sell?

1938
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:06,700
Oh.

1939
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,160
I'm sure that they will.

1940
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,220
Oh, well, if they...

1941
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,940
That is assuming they brought the incredible wealth of the Indies.

1942
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,700
I didn't.

1943
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,480
There will be auction things.

1944
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,560
Jewel-dripping caskets of Alibaba's cave.

1945
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,660
I know of at least one thing that will be auctioned.

1946
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,480
Which will auction off for a buck or two.

1947
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,840
What is the one thing that will be auctioned?

1948
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,560
I'm not telling.

1949
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,160
Oh.

1950
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:25,920
Oh, all right.

1951
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,880
It's a secret.

1952
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,940
Can I keep secrets, please?

1953
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,880
I like secrets.

1954
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,200
You'll learn what strikes only uncover.

1955
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Everybody's always like, you know, you have to tell me everything.

1956
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,460
Come on, you Pisces.

1957
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:33,960
What about this?

1958
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,440
What about this?

1959
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,100
Can't you give them a hint to make them a slaver?

1960
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,100


1961
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,080
Why can't I keep a secret?

1962
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,600
Why do I have to tell them?

1963
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,880
Do they have to buy it first to find out what it is?

1964
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,860
Because you could raise a lot of money.

1965
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,160
It's a secret.

1966
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,360
A pig and a poke, huh?

1967
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,700
Why can't I have a secret?

1968
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,240
In the back of comic books, they always showed a package.

1969
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,220
And this is the surprise package.

1970
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,300
Just order it.

1971
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:56,680
We can't tell you what it is, but we guarantee it's a hell of a surprise.

1972
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,340
Anybody ever offer a secret?

1973
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,780
Send only $5 to Bobco, Box 10, or Cambridge.

1974
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,220
New Jersey or something like that.

1975
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,640
Is that Deathless Hornet's mate buzzing around my head?

1976
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,500
Bobco is not in New Jersey.

1977
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,980
I love bugs, but the bugs love Hal the most.

1978
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,260
They love me more than they love old stringy Stan.

1979
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,580
It's because you're so sweet.

1980
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,180
Yes, it's true.

1981
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,140
I must admit, I am toothsome and delicious.

1982
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,540
And so, unfortunately, the insect world has taken note of this fact.

1983
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,840
I probably taste to them like their own earwax tastes.

1984
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,500
To them.

1985
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,500
Like an earwigs earwax.

1986
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,640
Which might taste really good to us.

1987
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,320
We don't know.

1988
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:39,820
Possibly.

1989
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,520
We also have trouble with bugs.

1990
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,080
Earwigs are foul creatures.

1991
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,200
I think I remember we having trouble getting eaten by mosquitoes.

1992
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,140
But earwigs, you've got to draw the line somewhere.

1993
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,080
They won't touch me.

1994
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,400
Those things are foul.

1995
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,000
Although, earwigs?

1996
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,960
Earwigs, yes.

1997
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,100
Dermaptora.

1998
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,040
But the thing about them is that, is odd, one of the things is that they are great parents.

1999
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,980
They take great care of them.

2000
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,300
They're disgusting young.

2001
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,840
But otherwise, they're unbelievably foul.

2002
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,600
Insects that raise their...

2003
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,720
Earwigs.

2004
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,340
Oh, yeah.

2005
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,120
They're insects, right?

2006
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:14,600
Earwigs.

2007
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,880
Yes, they are insects.

2008
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,980
Well, I guess, yeah.

2009
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,240
Ants take good care of their little eggs.

2010
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,460
Ants just set them in motion and tell them to get to work.

2011
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,640
Well, you mean earwigs?

2012
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,380
Earwigs spank them if they're bad.

2013
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,980
Tell them not to run into the parking lot.

2014
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,100
They, you know, I read this.

2015
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:32,620
They're good parents.

2016
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,320
They change their diapers.

2017
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,360
They don't wear diapers.

2018
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,280
That would be difficult given the anatomy of an earwig.

2019
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,360
You know, one of the worst things about them is when they turn their butts around,

2020
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,780
spread those forceps and squirt a hideous fart cloud of earwig juice at you.

2021
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,140
Have you ever seen them do that?

2022
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,480
Call Starship Troopers.

2023
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,000
They'll handle it.

2024
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,900
Earwig juice?

2025
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:54,860
Yes.

2026
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,860
I think I saw that at the 7-Eleven.

2027
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,520
It comes out as a cloud, but it's a nasty gesture.

2028
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,980
It's a nasty act.

2029
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,360
I did see that at the 7-Eleven.

2030
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:03,960
Did they really get it?

2031
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,500
Did they get in your ears or they just called that?

2032
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,940
That's just an old hag's tale.

2033
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,260
Yeah, they don't get in your ears and sew them closed with their pinchers.

2034
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,040
No, they don't.

2035
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,040
But on the other hand...

2036
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,120
Well, they don't have any thread anyway.

2037
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,160
Some insects do get in your ears.

2038
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,880
There are some that do.

2039
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,940
Who knows what lives in those woods?

2040
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,320
I've known of one case where a motorcycle riding guy going down the road had an enraged

2041
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,900
hornet sucked into his helmet by the airstream and it went into his ear.

2042
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,340
And stung him again and again while he was trying to ride his motorcycle at 70 miles

2043
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,800
an hour.

2044
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,360
And he actually meant to make it to the hospital in a condition which made people think he was

2045
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,680
an insane man.

2046
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,740
And they were able to reach in with the forceps and pull out the still alive hornet.

2047
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,000
And then he went on his way.

2048
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:03,060
We had a bug in the ear tragedy at an early X-Day drill.

2049
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,460
And what happened on that occasion?

2050
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:04,920
Very early one.

2051
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,120
There's a recording of Sister Decadence going, somebody find one of those squeezy bulbs.

2052
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,020
Get a squeezy bulb.

2053
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,220
Somebody got a bug in his ear.

2054
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,040
And it was not a joke.

2055
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,360
It was excruciating.

2056
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,640
It was awful.

2057
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,800
It wasn't a stinging bug.

2058
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,560
Well, it's a hole.

2059
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,440
It looks like a nice place to hang out.

2060
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,320
Yeah, but couldn't get it.

2061
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,960
But then, you know, those get in those hairs.

2062
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,580
You get all caught in the ear wax.

2063
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,440
And I know I've lost shoes that way.

2064
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,020
In ear wax?

2065
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,660
Big ears.

2066
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:32,740
Big ears.

2067
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,580
Don't you trim all that stuff out as part of your grooming cycle?

2068
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,220
Well, I do.

2069
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,680
I'm not talking about my ears.

2070
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm talking about ears where I lost my boots in those hairs in ear wax.

2071
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, oh.

2072
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,220
I was a little confused there.

2073
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,100
You know, I was like, well, whose boots?

2074
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,260
These boots?

2075
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,480
Those boots?

2076
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,260
It was just part of the dream.

2077
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,880
They're like the insect shoes.

2078
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,460
Twas brilliant.

2079
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,880
Six at once.

2080
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,640
Except in the case of the...

2081
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:02,640


2082
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,320
The centipede, which wears more.

2083
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,840
There's some pretty strange creatures out in these woods.

2084
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,460
There are.

2085
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,180
Including the...

2086
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,420
And you know, like deer and coyotes, they're becoming more bold around humans.

2087
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,120
The giant huntsman spider.

2088
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,500
I heard something that...

2089
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,720
Now, it could have just been a raccoon.

2090
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,240
I had a picture of one.

2091
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,320
It seemed to disappear.

2092
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:22,700
You never know.

2093
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,960
But something left paw prints on Susie's mirror.

2094
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,180
Who would be pawing Susie's mirror?

2095
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,380
Little paw prints or big...

2096
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,640
She says it was a raccoon.

2097
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,700
But you never know.

2098
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,340
I don't know.

2099
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,120
A raccoon, eh?

2100
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,620
There was a raccoon at the other campground that would steal Playboys.

2101
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,660
Right.

2102
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,700
Only Playboys.

2103
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,560
Playboy magazine.

2104
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,140
And...

2105
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:53,560
Ukra was in her tent last night and heard something sort of clawing at her tent, trying

2106
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,160
to get into her tent.

2107
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:56,960
That was rock bottom.

2108
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,240
Pretending to be a raccoon.

2109
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,060
I didn't...

2110
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:00,980
Well, I mean...

2111
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,140
Nobody seemed like him.

2112
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,640
I mean...

2113
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,920
Nobody.

2114
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:03,940
You think he's just like a...

2115
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:03,940


2116
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:04,480
It could be.

2117
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,440
No, it's not a raccoon.

2118
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,100
You think he's haunting the woods like some werewolf...

2119
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,200
He'll be here tomorrow...

2120
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,040
I worry.

2121
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:09,720
I worry.

2122
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,880
He isn't here already?

2123
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,080
So he heard some weird noises in the woods...

2124
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,720
On the other hand, Philo and I used to creepy crawl campgrounds.

2125
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,900
Not at subgenius events.

2126
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,280
When we did our book doctor camp outs, actually.

2127
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,240
My friends, I have heard strange animal noises in the woods and at night walking along the

2128
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,640
road...

2129
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,380
I've heard the crashing of heavy body in the near brush and breathing.

2130
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,720
So something.

2131
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,140
Are you sure it wasn't just people having sex?

2132
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,720
It didn't sound like it.

2133
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,180
It wasn't the right...

2134
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,920
It wasn't the right heavy body breathing thing?

2135
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,360
It's like some big clumsy thing crunching and breaking things.

2136
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,100
Rocknar.

2137
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,620
Well, anyway, this wasn't this year, but I haven't been here this long so far.

2138
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,960
One never knows what creatures may be present.

2139
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,040
I mean, I've made the mistake of camping next to the wrong Yeti couple,

2140
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,120
and that sounds awful lot like certain Yetis together.

2141
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,580
Yes, when the bull alligator reaches orgasm,

2142
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:24,040
it makes its resonant musical bellow that can be heard for mile after mile over the cypress swamp.

2143
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,340
How about elephant seals?

2144
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,300
They're noisy. They sing.

2145
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,920
Well, they do that just for fun, apropos of nothing.

2146
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,960
The sounds are related to sex.

2147
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:35,840
I wonder if they're getting it off.

2148
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,140
If they attack, they don't roar.

2149
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,740
The alligator does not roar as it attacks.

2150
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,600
It only sings for love, you see.

2151
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,480
Oh, that's nice.

2152
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,340
When they go for you, they're silent.

2153
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,520
Yeah.

2154
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,380
They might hiss.

2155
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:49,700
They aren't going to sing.

2156
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,440
Singing is reserved for important things.

2157
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,140
But what if an alligator wanted to do surprise butt sex?

2158
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,160
Would he still sing?

2159
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,140
Because it wouldn't be much of a surprise then.

2160
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,600
It's not supposed to be.

2161
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,460
It's the way the birds in the trees also celebrate.

2162
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,140
There comes your patience.

2163
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,060
The alligator is the same deal.

2164
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,860
Everyone sings for the lady love.

2165
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:17,580
The bowerbird brings gifts and like that.

2166
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,060
So that's basically what rock and roll is all about.

2167
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:20,600
Yes.

2168
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,040
That makes sense.

2169
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,780
It's not, as some critics would have it, the cry of the rabid baboon.

2170
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,240
But rather, a simple song of love.

2171
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,420
Oh, love songs.

2172
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,340
Oh, wow.

2173
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,400
Hey, I could do the poem I couldn't do on the hour of slack the other night.

2174
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,440
Better pile it on because this is the hour of the moment.

2175
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:53,700
Yeah, this is, well, it doesn't even have any terribly dirty words in it.

2176
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,140
It's just that the concepts are obscene.

2177
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,820
A poem should be palpable.

2178
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,580
Yeah, I don't use it.

2179
00:55:59,580 --> 00:55:59,580


2180
00:55:59,580 --> 00:55:59,580


2181
00:55:59,580 --> 00:55:59,580


2182
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:04,420
I usually write poetry or songs or anything, but this just entered my head.

2183
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:06,680
It's a love poem.

2184
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,460
Domino's old medallions to the thumb.

2185
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,280
Okay.

2186
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,920
Turn down Dracula.

2187
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,020
By James Bernard.

2188
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,040
Nerd.

2189
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,280
Oh, here it is.

2190
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:18,580
Okay.

2191
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:18,900
Nard.

2192
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,800
I fucked a gorilla by Reverend Ivan Stein.

2193
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,740
All right, everybody.

2194
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,820
I fucked a gorilla.

2195
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:29,260
Name?

2196
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,480
Hummus McGrew.

2197
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,340
The stuff in her pussy tasted like glue.

2198
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,960
When I'd finished my business, what did I do?

2199
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,760
I hosed her down good, took her back to the zoo.

2200
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:46,980
That's it?

2201
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,520
What do you mean?

2202
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,400
That was like four lines.

2203
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,140
I thought that was the standard of an epic two.

2204
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,020
That's it.

2205
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,920
That's it.

2206
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,460
Yeah, that's it.

2207
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,000
I don't do those stuff once every ten years.

2208
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,240
It says it all.

2209
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:57,680
Okay, all right.

2210
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,460
Well, okay, okay.

2211
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,340
I mean, it's a good.

2212
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,320
It's a good effort.

2213
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,440
Yes.

2214
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,680
I fucked a gorilla named Hummus McGrew.

2215
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,600
That's not.

2216
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,040
I thought that was a cute name, Hummus.

2217
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,020
Hummus McGrew.

2218
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:07,240
Yes, it is.

2219
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,220
Everybody wants to eat hummus, another word for dirt.

2220
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,660
And something had to rhyme with McGrew, and it happened to be glue.

2221
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,360
And zoo.

2222
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,460
Next thing you know, the spirit of Rudy Ray Moore took over.

2223
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,180
All right.

2224
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,100
That's what it is.

2225
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,420
From the Dolomite Mountains of Italy.

2226
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,060
That's right.

2227
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,620
What is the time?

2228
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:28,660
I can't see it from here.

2229
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,400
Well, I.

2230
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,000
It's the end of this hour of slack.

2231
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,780
It is the end of this hour of slack.

2232
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,360
Friends, if you'd like more information about the Church of the Subgenius, the hour of slack,

2233
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,800
or anything we've played on this show, you're welcome to look at subgenius.com.

2234
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,440
For all the good it'll do you.

2235
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,060
Yeah, right.

2236
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,400
Or you can write to Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

2237
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:50,880
Thank you.

2238
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,300
Your complaints are important to us.

2239
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,560
Please leave your name.

2240
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,000
Number.

2241
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,580
And a brief message at the sound of your tone.

2242
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:09,380
Unfortunately, due to high volume load of processing your complaints, we are not immediately able

2243
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:14,640
to process them unless you ease the way with a sizable emolument.

2244
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:15,820
A donation.

2245
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,560
You can press the PayPal button.

2246
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,240
Yes.

2247
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,300
I was listening to that message for hours the other day.

2248
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,360
The press the PayPal button thing?

2249
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,220
Or the.

2250
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:26,900
No.

2251
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,520
When my office phone went on the blank.

2252
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,200
I tried to call AT&T.

2253
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:37,860
And man, I was told in every language in the world that it was going to be 30 minutes before

2254
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,900
I could talk to anybody.

2255
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,540
So why don't I use the website?

2256
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,460
Thank you for calling the Subgenius Foundation.

2257
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,980
They did get it fixed in about three days.

2258
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,280
Remote.

2259
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:44,580
As I knew they would.

2260
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,500
The next available operator will be with you as soon as possible.

2261
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,580
You know, my phone.

2262
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,740
As long as she's available.

2263
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:55,340
My message machine used to say, for a brief time, it said, please leave your number.

2264
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,720
Say the number twice.

2265
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,500
Slowly and clearly.

2266
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,760
Clearly.

2267
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,940
Because so many people go, yeah, remember me?

2268
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,300
I'm the guy with the weird T-shirt.

2269
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,080
So call me at two, one.

2270
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:07,720
Right.

2271
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,100
Like he's reminding me of a number that everybody has in the tip of their tongue.

2272
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:24,140
But when I did that, every subgenius had to be a comedian and leave their number real slow.

2273
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,880
Just like whenever you say I'm part.

2274
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,020
Pardon me.

2275
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,080
I'm a little hard of hearing.

2276
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:32,140
I always go.

2277
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,060
What?

2278
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,580
To be taken literally.

2279
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,420
Press three.

2280
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,680
Every single.

2281
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,220
All of you have done it.

2282
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:40,640
To be ignored.

2283
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,160
Wait till it happens to them.

2284
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,040
Then they'll be sneezing out the other side.

2285
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,080
To be taken seriously.

2286
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,040
Hang up.

2287
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,720
I was just being polite.

2288
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,380
I think there's an echo in here.

2289
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,420
It's a wave of the future.

2290
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,780
Please continue to hold.

2291
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
Wave of the future.

2292
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,000
A subgenius operator will be with you shortly.

2293
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,180
Hold it right there.

2294
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,640
All right.
