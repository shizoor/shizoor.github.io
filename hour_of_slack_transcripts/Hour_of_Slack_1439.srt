1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:12,480
I wanted to be an artist. A thing like that can be dangerous. Now I've got a lot of friends.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:25,120
Hmm. Oh, what'll I do? Art. Here we go again. I wanted to be an artist.

3
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,040
Up there it went. And here, oh, wait a minute. I think it's time for a commercial.

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,260
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,200
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,580
He is the head of the subgenius church.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,560
That's why he's super cool.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,220
Like glass. He's Bob Dobbs.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,420
He's no slob.

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,120
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,480
He is the head of the subgenius church.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,480
And he is super cool.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,540
We hope to welcome you all tonight to the fervid celestial spoutings

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,460
of the Inner Circle.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,940
And to the other epops and clockwork workings of the church.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
But this task will not be easy.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,580
The fruits of the subgenius plant are not as cordial to the taste as others may be.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,400
Kind of mucilaginous paste.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,800
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted along precarious paths that have nothing to do with the straight and true direction of our search.

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,900
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:48,440
However, only exist technology can complete a subgenius's transfiguration into over manhood or over womanliness.

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,700
And so far Bob has allowed this to happen to one solitary guinea pig.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,400
His friend, Dr. Philo Drummond.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,460
Where dammit?

25
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,660
Man was born with original slack.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,860
Yet most civilized people don't believe in it.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,120
And their most learned scholars can't even comprehend it.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,620
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

29
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,600
As it turns out, many of our ancestors are not the primates as commonly thought.

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,780
But the theropod line of the great archosaurs of the Mesozoic.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,040
Oh no, look out!

32
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,220
Get him out of here!

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,500
Creepy.

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,500
Creepy.

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,640
Yeah.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,580
You signed up with that subgenius church.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,040
Thought, oh yeah, that's real funny.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,440
It'd be like that heavy metal band I was into.

39
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,100
Making fun of the devil and God.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,360
Let's go down to the graveyard, kids.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,600
And do blastings.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,180
Do some of those things.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
That's how half of it got into it, isn't it?

44
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,700
And then you thought, oh those pagans.

45
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,760
They take their clothes off.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,340
It's more fun.

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,860
Big party.

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,360
Yeah.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
No responsibility.

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,820
God's not looking.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,880
And guess what?

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,860
That's right!

53
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,940
Praise Bob!

54
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,280
Praise Bob!

55
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,320
Actually, God was looking the whole time.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,160
Going, right on!

57
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,940
Go at it!

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,860
I cut those strings thousands, millions and millions of years ago.

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,420
You've got free will.

60
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,860
That's the way it's been done for billions and billions of years.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,360
There is no instruction book.

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,160
Well, except for the book of the subgenius.

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,060
Actually, it does have a lot of helpful hints.

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,180
It suits you out of God.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,960
And the Bible is really good.

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,000
There's not too many lies in it except the author.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,600
The author's name.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,520
And, oh, by the way, it's God that gives you money.

69
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:54,380
Or that new automobile that you need if you call in the next 15 minutes.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,740
I only have the golden medallion.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,560
It will remind you of the scripture.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,200
Thou shall remember.

73
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,000
It's God that gives you wealth.

74
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,280
Or he gives you money to get wealth.

75
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,560
And now, make that call.

76
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,860
Hallelujah!

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,560
Prayer.

78
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,580
Make that call.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,520
Hallelujah!

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,600
You can get cash in your bank account fast.

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,360
You can get cash in your bank account fast.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,560
Get cash in your bank account fast.

83
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,360
Get cash in your bank account fast.

84
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,300
Get cash in your bank account fast.

85
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,260
Get cash in your bank account fast.

86
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,180
Get cash in your bank account fast.

87
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,140
Get cash in your bank account fast.

88
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,120
Get cash in your bank account fast.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,080
Get cash in your bank account fast.

90
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:59,360
Across speeches and books

91
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,300
Tell them what you want to change,

92
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,660
We will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God.

93
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,500
But what about those empty beer cans?

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,680
Those who wield them are ruthless and daring.

95
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:30,160
And I should like to see this nation turn out at least 50,000 a year.

96
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,260
Listen, this country can turn out 4 million.

97
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,860
We have to, we can turn out 14 million.

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,520
But now we had only half enough of them.

99
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,160
For beyond the horizon lay the British Navy to police these vast and now empty beer cans

100
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,340
filled with menace for French dummies and a supply of fine beer.

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,700
And what had we done with it?

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,440
First, to those empty unguarded beer cans.

103
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,560
We would rather see London tamely and abjectly enslaved.

104
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,860
Then the unbelievable again.

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
And down she goes.

106
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,320
On and off the road to Bob

107
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,300
We are marching forward blind

108
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,940
He has gouged out both our eyes

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,280
And he's gone blind

110
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,280


111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,720
He's laughing close behind

112
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,700
He will sell us back our eyes

113
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,380
When we join his noble clan

114
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,380
For just 1995

115
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,080
And a taste of our woodland

116
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,500
On and off the road with Bob

117
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,460
He has handed us the wheel

118
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,060
And he cuddles up with Bob

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,240
As he comes to sell the field

120
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,880
Our eyes are on the road

121
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,480
But Bob forgot to say

122
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,800
That the steering wheel went fast

123
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,080
The road carries us away

124
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,800
On and off the road for Bob

125
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,280
We forgot why we came away

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Here we have quit all of our jobs

127
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,160
Like a headlight frightened deer

128
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,740
He has lit the sacred pipe

129
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,840
And he's smiling at us now

130
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,820
On and off the road he's gone

131
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,760
He's our bull dada

132
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,960
We all need him now

133
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,860
That hurt Bob

134
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,100
Bob where are you?

135
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,940
Stop it Bob

136
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,580
Please

137
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,380
Bob

138
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,040
But let's leave things of this world behind

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,580
And walk now down the path of Bob

140
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,540
For this brief minute of slack

141
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,140
From the church of the subgenius

142
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,860
Friend the devil is tearing the family apart

143
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,320
But what the devil uses to do it with

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,220
Is nine to five jobs

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,140
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations

146
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,280
Where mommy and daddy get up in the morning

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,900
And go to work

148
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,360
And they kiss the kids goodbye

149
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,340
It's the first time they see them during the day

150
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,000
Kiss them goodbye

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,860
Kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello

152
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,060
Then they get home about seven o'clock

153
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,160
Ticked off to use a polite term

154
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
After a long drive back out to the suburbs

155
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,680
They get home and kiss their kids hello

156
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,400
And goodnight and they go to bed

157
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,680
And the other churches dare to say

158
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
The breakdown of the family is cause the kids

159
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,740
See a little tittering stupid sexy gags on television

160
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,720
Or cause the new permissiveness

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,840
Where men are allowed to do things with other men

162
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,940
That's a bunch of holy hooey I say my friend

163
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,780
I say why not legalize pornography

164
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,020
And ban work

165
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,300
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids

166
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,240
Most of these kids these days grow up

167
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,020
They don't have parents

168
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,220
They got some kind of robot scarecrows

169
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,000
And a friend let there be slack

170
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,000
C-W-W-W dot subgenius dot com

171
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,260
This male is angry, distraught and terrified

172
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,560
It is a terrible tragedy

173
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,540
While attempting to mate with a female

174
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,340
He's inadvertently pushed her into a drainage ditch

175
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,080
But that's okay

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,660
I think I can deal with it

177
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,980
Now it's up to these rescue workers

178
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,120
To mate with a female

179
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,900
With a remarkable combination of finesse and brute force

180
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,840
These workers use a crane to force the female

181
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,740
She shows she's alright by fighting off the crane mechanism

182
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
Nope, but it's wonderful

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,480
This lecture was presented on June 1st, 1962

184
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,680
They can take our instruments and set them on fire

185
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,020
But you can't hurt them if they want

186
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,440
Why is it paper?

187
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,440
I do like Bob

188
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
I like his look

189
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,420
I like his look

190
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,660
I read his words

191
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,520
I got the pamphlet

192
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm waiting for the book

193
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,020
I do like Bob

194
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,000
I like Bob

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000


196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000


197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000


198
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,640
I do like Bob

199
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,580
I like his shirt

200
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,260
I like his shirt

201
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,360
I like his shirt

202
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
When I'm wearing it

203
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,280
When I'm wearing it

204
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,480
I've never been hurt

205
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,580
Bob feels so strongly for the pinks that rather than wear a hair shirt, Bob is much spiffier than that.

206
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,000
He wears polyester shorts so he can try them on.

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,080
There is a p權ty in him.

208
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,820
This armpit is my till

209
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,560
It has scary hair, but that insults me

210
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,980
That brother of mine is so peaceful

211
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,260
That Gadit flies right to my face

212
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,260


213
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:17,900
Do you even lie to me?

214
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,160
battled on hard

215
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,800
Scratch but kendi amigos

216
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,840
Feed with this

217
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,660
Water

218
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,980
Drink this

219
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:49,560
I do like Bob. I like his shoes. I like his shoes. And when I'm wearing them, you know I never walk the blue.

220
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,220
Speaking as the Pope of New York, whose power at its most minimal equals the Pope of the Holy City of the Vatican,

221
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,300
it's proven by the fact that I am not, in fact, infallible. I have the power to fail and fail often.

222
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,220
Let me point out to you that the Roman Catholic Church specializes in suicide.

223
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,340
And not only suicide.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,640
But suicide with guilt.

225
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,240
We suggest you up yourself to the living death in life.

226
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,220
That is the infinity fulsomeness of accepting Bob.

227
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,260
I do like Bob.

228
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,660
But I never want his job.

229
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,340
Yes, dear friends.

230
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes.

231
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,340
I too.

232
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,520
Do like Bob.

233
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,500
And I like Bob.

234
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:08,660
Bob is the foundation magma beneath this crust we call reality.

235
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,060
Bob.

236
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,220
Bob.

237
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,560
You could say it that way.

238
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,920
You almost feel like you're throwing up.

239
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:32,700
And one thing that can make almost anyone throw up would be lonesome cowboy Dave.

240
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,060
Doesn't make me throw up.

241
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,560
Isn't that interesting?

242
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,480
I didn't throw up.

243
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:45,720
I can only say that between the spouts of vomiting and arguments with large pieces of leather,

244
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,420
I can only say that a rectal examination...

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,840
...is the necessary task of each and every citizen due to the extreme voracity and veracity

246
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,460
of reports of alien implants.

247
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,760
Funny, you should mention that.

248
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,340
That's what you were just talking about!

249
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:04,900
Alien IMPLANTS!

250
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,840
I'm getting one of those, uh, representations of autumn right now.

251
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,720
On the air.

252
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,120
But at least the roof isn't being torn off by the terrible weather that everyone told us was coming.

253
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,260
Uh-huh.

254
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,540
Well, we got some blastings that were quite large off the lake

255
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,000
and it just made everything shake, including my own, the inner part that we so longed for.

256
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,900
Oh, Wotan tossed out a big old thunderbolt.

257
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,700
Yes.

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,880
Almost hit Princess Wee.

259
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,740
She was driving back here from Rabbiton.

260
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,660
Yes, the interplanetary driving was quite scary.

261
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,120
I thought about getting sound effects of tornadoes and stuff and doing an episode.

262
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,800
Where we're like, oh no, the roof is being torn off the top of the station.

263
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,560
We're trying to hold the equipment down.

264
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,980
Oh, Princess Wee has been sucked up into the tornado.

265
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,040
Oh, she's been saved by a UFO.

266
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,900
So it's not a big jump after all.

267
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,280
But we don't have to wait for bad weather to do that.

268
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,700
Besides, you simply put the whole plot in one shallow, shallow statement

269
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,120
and all the world was free to pick on it as they would, like a hemp seed or something.

270
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,480
That's exactly what it'd be like.

271
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,100
Hey, the songs that we played.

272
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,780
Earlier were by Glass Madness.

273
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,580
Well, except for the acapella song on and off the road with Bob.

274
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,740
That was Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

275
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,360
Glass Madness did the guitar songs.

276
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,300
And the rant was from Starwood 99 in the Puffer Dome.

277
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,500
And you could hear Dave on the guitar in the background.

278
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,200
Yeah.

279
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:47,060
I have a version of Iodine 131 from that show queued up.

280
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,240
I'm not kidding.

281
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,200
I can play it right this second.

282
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,080
But I just wanted you to know, Dave, that I do have that queued up.

283
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
I don't know if it's any good.

284
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,060
Glory be to Bob.

285
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,500
I certainly hope I hear no wrong notes because that's what people like.

286
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,580
And it's just like in humor.

287
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,480
They like rawness.

288
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
They like spontaneity.

289
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,920
And if you can't play, they want to hear it because they want to know what they paid their money for.

290
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,640
Then they can laugh or cry or jeer or throw tomatoes at you.

291
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:17,800
Or go and bother staying in a car in a way in the back room by the dressing room, which is unusual.

292
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,020
Routine is payment under the table, literally.

293
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,020
I've gotten so used to dealing with that.

294
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
I hardly even notice them down there.

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,660
I don't notice them.

296
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,320
Oh, I forgot to mention, though, the collages that were all through the weaving through the first 15 minutes.

297
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,600
That was all by Lee Murr.

298
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
They were kind of oldies.

299
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,220
But I grabbed a bunch of stuff off my heart just before coming to the show.

300
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm going to go to the station.

301
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,260
And they are juicy.

302
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,560
Do you have a new hard drive named Mahard?

303
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,440
No.

304
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,000
No, I'm still using Tear A Butt and Lunkhead.

305
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,540
And Mule Skinner died a long time ago.

306
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,320
That's so sad.

307
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,660
My hard drives all have cute names.

308
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,660
Well, Mule Skinner goes back to the days of Dallas, doesn't it?

309
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:11,860
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,920
Well, I named all my hard drives Mule Skinner something for a long time.

311
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
And then they started to have heads.

312
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,160
Like head names like Lunkhead and Doomkopf.

313
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,360
And well, see, I just now anybody who wants to hack all of my stuff, get all my passwords right off it.

314
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,840
Because then they know the name of the drive.

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,200
But they can't spell it right.

316
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,860
See, it's spelled subgenius wise.

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,520
Ah.

318
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,260
Yeah.

319
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,780
Which is really painful to view sometimes.

320
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,620
When you're in a jolly mood, maybe after, you know, your 15th beer or something like that.

321
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
And you see people speaking in subgenius.

322
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,760
Or hear them.

323
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,400
Texting is weird.

324
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,680
But hearing them, actually hearing them with your naked ears.

325
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,500
Revolting, disgusting situation.

326
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,460
I just can't keep it down when I'm there.

327
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:11,260
Well, you'll hear sentences uttered for completely pragmatic, practical reasons that anywhere else would sound like deliberate surrealism.

328
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,920
But the spiritual profanities, though.

329
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,720
Well, like things like, be careful you don't knock over the robots.

330
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,640
With that Tyrannosaurus skull.

331
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,720
That's been said to me in all earnestness.

332
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,740
There really were robots and there really was a full-sized Tyrannosaurus skull replica.

333
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,780
It was in Mavridi's house.

334
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,520
Dr. Howell's place.

335
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,680
Oh, I'm not doubting the reality.

336
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,400
So you never know.

337
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,200
Legume quoted me one.

338
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:47,440
It was like, in the course of his job, he had this, I can't even repeat it on the radio.

339
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,200
It was so big.

340
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:48,560
It was bizarre.

341
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,840
It was such a strange thing to say in a completely practical way to get a job done.

342
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,440
It involved a circle of, now that you've got the lizard penises in a circle, I think you're ready to go.

343
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,760
Well, then there was the part where the teeth were.

344
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,400
Something like that.

345
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,880
That was real close to it.

346
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,420
It just didn't say, it had a cruder term than penises, a shorter term.

347
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,840
Shorter indeed.

348
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,200
I don't think he works in his room.

349
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,860
He works in the zoo, so it's not like a herpetology related.

350
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,660
I think it was more to do with 3D graphics.

351
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,300
No, he was talking about a chafing dish because he was working at the buffet back then.

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, and they had, that's right, and they had the lizard penis circle, whatever, back behind.

353
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,180
Yeah, in the parking lot.

354
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:47,060
All the cooks and the chefs and dishwashers would go back there and get them some lizard skin, if you know what I'm talking about.

355
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,020
The real food, yeah.

356
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,060
I think you know what I mean.

357
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,120
I think all the listeners know exactly what I mean.

358
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,960
The psychobablic materials needed to progress.

359
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,460
Oh.

360
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,140
No, no, no, no, no.

361
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,820
No, no, no, no, no.

362
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,240
No, no, yes, no, yes, no.

363
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,900
Sometimes in the church of the subunits, they have the people who argue with each other.

364
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,900
They form up a team.

365
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,560
Oh, no, they don't argue.

366
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,240
No, no, really, argue?

367
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,920
Oh, they have the little fight sometimes to be mad for each other.

368
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,740
Ah.

369
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,540
Then when they often do that, someone argue and say he's going to kill the other person with a foot or a shoe.

370
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
And this can't happen, they say, you can go back to hell.

371
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,200
So I find him funny.

372
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,840
It happens every X day many times, and nine months later, the weaker one has a little baby subgenius.

373
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Well, the supplicants of the weak is very important in the church.

374
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,400
Yeah, it's super important, and it's the most fun thing of all.

375
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,520
Let's go.

376
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,440
Enjoy the parade.

377
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,580
It's an Italian parade.

378
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,340
Oh, look at those bozo shoes are wonderful.

379
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,980
Look at the handsome young pony she's riding on.

380
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,020
It won't be long before they both come together in a rapturous embrace.

381
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,840
Look, and there's the judge at the carnival.

382
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,020
He's about to give them a shoe.

383
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,080
And one of those.

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
Lovely canes for a hat trick.

385
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,020
And look, the senator joined them.

386
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,860
He's running around the circle, too.

387
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,440
Look how many senators are coming out of that tiny little car.

388
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,420
How can they do that?

389
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,200
Oh, they're Texas Republican senators.

390
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,560
They believe in government so small it'll fit inside a vagina.

391
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,860
And control it from inside out.

392
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,520
I tried to stuff them back in the car again.

393
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,120
And no, no, they're not going in the car because they know they're on their way to a fuma camp.

394
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,920
Where?

395
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,300
In the car.

396
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:54,080
And they're going to be clothed and dined and wined and assigned different tasks to do for Mother Nature.

397
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,580
They think they're going to the subgenius X day.

398
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:16,380
But no, we're working with the CIA and Homeland Security now and NSA and the mafia and the Russians and Israel and the British Secret Service to put everyone in a FEMA concentration camp.

399
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,080
Everyone.

400
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,980
That includes us.

401
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,520
And we'll all have free everything.

402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,980
That even includes the president, doesn't it, Mr. Ivan Stang?

403
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,220
Reverend, sir.

404
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,560
That's President Stang to you now, boy.

405
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,060
Emperor, President, let's make it.

406
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,780
Oh, heck.

407
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,180
Why not Godman Stang?

408
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,980
How's that?

409
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,640
That sounds good.

410
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,320
Godman Stang.

411
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Doesn't it stang?

412
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,620
Goddang Stang.

413
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,980
I've heard that one enough.

414
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,580
You won't be hearing it anymore.

415
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,120
No.

416
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,020
Now that I'm in power.

417
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,400
Because I have a list.

418
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,400
I'm going down my list.

419
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,700
And I'll be having the boys bring in all my enemies.

420
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,400
Everyone who ever back-talked me.

421
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,160
Everybody who ever sassed me.

422
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
I've got a long, long list.

423
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,360
I'll be a real good god emperor.

424
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,920
I was wondering which way was the FEMA camp because I got a wound in my foot.

425
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,180
And I was hoping I could mix it up.

426
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm not going to mess it up.

427
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,740
I'm going to do something with my metacarpal area.

428
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,780
I've got a plaster for that.

429
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
I've got an ointment.

430
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,360
I've got a couple bags of velvina.

431
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,040
I've got a boxcar full of canned peaches.

432
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,860
I'll trade you for that subgenius pamphlet there, preacher.

433
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:41,400
Because I know what really counts here in the Econocataclysm.

434
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,860
I've got a functioning blitzkrieg armada of little tiny SS German soldiers.

435
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,140
From World War II, no taller than four inches high.

436
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,600
For one dollar!

437
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,520
All for one lousy buck.

438
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,000
Those little tiny Nazis were never as cool as I looked in the ad.

439
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,140
Oh, well.

440
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,620
They are actually, I guess, some sort of aquatic material that no longer exists.

441
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,740
Like a sea monkey or something, only it was extinct after a brief period of time.

442
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:26,560
If you notice here on the screen, the steng's head is actually expanding in time with the music.

443
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,940
It's kind of scary to look at.

444
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,080
Yes, but you must remember, its hair is not really on fire.

445
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Yeah, I like to let it swell up every now and then and then kind of pop and it feels so good.

446
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,740
I mean, it hurts when it's swelling up, but then when it pops, oh, it's the best thing this side of heaven, my friends.

447
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,700
Just let that head swell up.

448
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,180
In hell.

449
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,200
It's not pretty to watch, though.

450
00:25:54,420 --> 00:26:05,980
We asked for this post-apocalyptic hell when we laughed at those eggheads saying that the oceans was dying of acid and LSD in the waters.

451
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:15,120
And acid rain and such, making all the fish trip until they ate their own fins off and died because they couldn't swim no more.

452
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,380
I'm not Fukushima.

453
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,140
Until we saw God's era.

454
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,940
This was a man-made disaster, friends.

455
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,960
And that's why all the shopping malls turned into living quarters for the vagabonds and the homeless.

456
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,940
You asked for it, friends.

457
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,240
You voted for it.

458
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,200
Yes.

459
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,340
When you went to vote, no matter what you voted for.

460
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,620
That's what you ended up voting for anyway, is the way it turned out.

461
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
So I guess we're all sinners.

462
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,140
I guess we all deserve it.

463
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,600
I guess we'll all wait forever for the men from Planet X.

464
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,400
To come and save us, like Bob said.

465
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,200
He said they was going to.

466
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,280
Bob wouldn't lie.

467
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,920
Or be wrong.

468
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,860
What do you mean?

469
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,940
I don't know.

470
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,180
He's been known to tell us about you.

471
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,580
His pants are kind of a different color than the rest of his clothing.

472
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
He has a sense of design.

473
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,360
He makes us feel...

474
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,580
He's a man of the future.

475
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,240
A man with sutures.

476
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,960
A man with sutures.

477
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,000
It's a wave of the future.

478
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,200
It's a wave of the future.

479
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,340
It's a wave of the future.

480
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,420
An apocalyptic wave goodbye.

481
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,060
It's a wave of the future.

482
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,500
You know, Bob's waves, his internal mass waves and his cataphonous drive waves,

483
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,360
and also his Leviathan 6 waves.

484
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,420
His thought waves.

485
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,780
Indeed, his very thought waves from his hypothalamus and his hypothalamus.

486
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,580
He can surf on any of those waves.

487
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,800
He surfs light waves, my friend.

488
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,440
Barefoot.

489
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,520
Barefoot.

490
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,300
If you could believe that.

491
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,700
We're using a popsicle stick for a surfboard.

492
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,580
Sometimes the little duck shoes work pretty good too,

493
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,300
but he has a hard time manipulating the big tube.

494
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,000
Bob Dobbs is so skillful at surfing,

495
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:16,080
he can surf the solar waves of electromagnetism in a 55 Chevy.

496
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,580
A Chevy.

497
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,840
And a 55 gallon drum.

498
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,400
Using a Chevy for a surfboard.

499
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,080
He stands on top of it and surfs from the sun until he wipes out right near the moon

500
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,640
and tumbles ashore on Lake Erie at a beach right just south of the flats.

501
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,160
Wow.

502
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,160
And the dice around his neck are perfectly intact.

503
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,020
Yes.

504
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,060
Just as if he'd always been there without a sign of drudgery.

505
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,460
Or you can explode Bob and he'll walk out of that smoke cloud.

506
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,580
Yeah.

507
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,740
With a little bandaid on the edge of his head, on his forehead.

508
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,180
You could eat him like a can of peach here if you've got the money to do it.

509
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,360
The guy is invincible in many kinds of ways that you haven't even thought of yet.

510
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,000
You can go up to Bob and go, Bob, Bob, I'll give you a million dollars for one,

511
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,000
just one tamp of what's in, just the ashes from your pipe.

512
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,100
And he goes, a million dollars?

513
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,540
What?

514
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,700
Hey, hey, what's that wadded up thing in your pocket?

515
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,340
Sticking out of your pocket?

516
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,480
Why is my snot covered?

517
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,340
Snot rag.

518
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,880
Bob, I'll take that.

519
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,980
What, don't you want a million dollars?

520
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,760
No, sir.

521
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,460
And Bob will take that snot rag and then completely forget about that old handkerchief

522
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,600
until the day he travels to his enemy's country.

523
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,600
And there the germs from that handkerchief happen to be just the ones that destroy that

524
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,080
ethnic group or people of a certain last name, actually, that Bob is out to get.

525
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,100
Oh, gee.

526
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,780
I didn't know he was such a vindictive guy.

527
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,480
You never told me about that part.

528
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,300
The knobs.

529
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,280
The Dobbs hated the Nobbs family because the Nobbs always thought they was, you know,

530
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,960
the Nobbs.

531
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,020
They thought they was keenly aristocratic.

532
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,140
Easily twisted and opened lots of doors for people.

533
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,660
Yeah, they were like knobs on a pig.

534
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,060
The Dobbs, the Dobbs family was just plain folks.

535
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,580
They was, they was working, working people.

536
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,000
And they was against his Nobbs and all of the Nobbs that the Nobbs has owned.

537
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,700
And they took their cudgels, the Nobbs did.

538
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,300
And they.

539
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,080
Set upon the Nobbs family.

540
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
And that's why you don't see that many Nobbs.

541
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,100
You look in the phone book under Nobbs and I look under Dobbs.

542
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:31,500
You'll see that the Dobbs family, the clan lived on to sire and mom, many, many little

543
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,260
Dobbsians.

544
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,160
And they're all the cousins and brothers of J.R.

545
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
Bob Dobbs.

546
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,540
They have names like Alfred E.

547
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,800
Newman, Chauncey Gardner, Bugs N.

548
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Bunny.

549
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,640
They don't all have the last name Dobbs, but they all have the Dobbs DNA, my friend.

550
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,040
My favorite deaf, E.

551
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,700
Duck is also in constant history there.

552
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,240
He's got his own little plaque.

553
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,080
He's got a summer cottage and he tends to talk was regularly.

554
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,700
This year's seminar is on squaw or something like that.

555
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,420
And he has famous DNA.

556
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
It's reached level C.

557
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,060
I understand.

558
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,680
He's going to be traced.

559
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,780
I guess.

560
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,640
I guess they take it out of your saliva.

561
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,240
They go in your mouth with a swab and they pull out and they can tell if you're the male

562
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:30,880
descendant of a male passer of a clan gene or the female or any, whatever you are, or

563
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,760
the clan gene is male or female by messing around with your mouth like that.

564
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,720
All I know is them knobs better best watch their butts when they come into Dobbs County.

565
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,280
That's right.

566
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:42,980
Pappy knobs.

567
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,680
You hear me?

568
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,440
This is Reverend Stang.

569
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,960
Talking to you.

570
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,840
I'm a man of Bob.

571
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,280
I follow the dogs.

572
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,640
I ride with Sheriff Dobbs and the outlaw Dobbs both.

573
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,540
And we're coming.

574
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,960
You knobs.

575
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:02,800
We're coming to take your sheep and your cattle and your we're going to frack your oil.

576
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,540
Mr.

577
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,040
Mrs.

578
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,620
Nobs.

579
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,560
They're hiding in your underwear as we speak right now.

580
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,240
I doubt if you'll ever find them unless you get in that boiling tub of hot lard.

581
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,900
Right there.

582
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,980
Yeah, that's it.

583
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,960
That boiling tub of hot steaming hot hot steaming steaming hot steaming tub of lard.

584
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,920
When was the last time you had a great big steaming hot hot steaming hot bowl of lard

585
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,600
brand chili?

586
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,320
Well, it's too long.

587
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,440
Way too long.

588
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,340
Well, it's going to short.

589
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,380
It's about yay long because we grow long.

590
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
We grow them long in Texas.

591
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,840
You can.

592
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,420
You can.

593
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,800
You can.

594
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,100
Not only.

595
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,420
You can.

596
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,420


597
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,420


598
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,420


599
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,900
You can judge the temperature of the water, but its depth.

600
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,900
That's how long they grow in Texas.

601
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,880
A friend.

602
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,340
You can also adjust its economic value.

603
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,820
And it's kind of psychic depth or it's a cerebral depth.

604
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,240
Does it have anything really to say to you?

605
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,540
Is it just a bad argument with somebody who's up real close and just ate a whole bag of

606
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,420
onions, you know?

607
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,420
But you see, my friend, although they grow them large and long in Texas.

608
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,340
In Ohio, they grow them mutated and pulsating.

609
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:29,300
Throbbing and writhing abominably in their pool of gel.

610
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,360
Let the Texans come try to wage war upon the Ohioan mutants now.

611
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,200
Your six guns are as pea shooters compared to our death rays of hate.

612
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:44,560
Right.

613
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,900
They will bleed to death.

614
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,340
Each and every one of them.

615
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,540
They'll bleed all over us.

616
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,940
That's how they do their dirty work.

617
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,720
They bleed to death on you.

618
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,200
And then the next time you're transformed or have to visit someone with a nose, you

619
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,660
lose track of it.

620
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,400
And they're back again.

621
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,020
They can't be fought for.

622
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,440
They can only be accommodated.

623
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,520
Right?

624
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,000
Yeah.

625
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,120
Drowning on another person's blood is a rarely.

626
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,140
Bad way to go.

627
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,100
May I bring you another cup of blood, sir?

628
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:26,560
I say that if there's going to be a blood bag deficit, the United States is not going

629
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,900
to be the country to lose the blood bag war or something like that.

630
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,660
Aging.

631
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,840
We need more blood bags.

632
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,780
Taxes.

633
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,000
Blood bags.

634
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,100
And the weather.

635
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,620
These are things you're never, ever going to escape in your life.

636
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,400
And also infected earwax from listening to this podcast.

637
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,840
Because it also is a mutated virus.

638
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,240
Just like all these other crossover viruses that are happening now that are infecting

639
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,380
not only engines of destruction, but people's heads.

640
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,420
But there's no infection.

641
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,120
In the small age.

642
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,020
No infection at all in lard brand chili.

643
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,640
And here at Penobscot, we always serve our people lard brand chili.

644
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,400
Where?

645
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,100
Penobscot.

646
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,960
Penobscot?

647
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,180
Here at Penobscot.

648
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,480
Yes.

649
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,200
Penobscot.

650
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,000
Penobscot.

651
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,420
You ain't one of them Nobzians, are you?

652
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,020
Oh, no.

653
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,760
I'm not a Nobzian.

654
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,860
I'm in a dilemma here.

655
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,020
I thought another dimension was Penobsquat.

656
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,760
And here I am eating lard brand chili into Penobscot, Maine.

657
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,860
I was all set to go to Nobstock because they had some great bands.

658
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,000
And I even went to the gates, but I saw all these Quaits and Monskos wandering in.

659
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,540
And Pobuckers of every name and clan.

660
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,580
A bunch of Nobs.

661
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,300
All of Nobs related.

662
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,720
You know, it might as well have been a Quait reunion.

663
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,360
Or a Nobsquait-Monsko reunion.

664
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,240
A terrible situation for many of the children.

665
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,660
The Quaits are the fat, lazy ones.

666
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,260
And the Monskos are the mean, skinny ones.

667
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,900
They're always going, no, let's go.

668
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,900
That was an erudite way of putting that.

669
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,500
Well, if you've lived in the South and the Midwest long enough, you get to recognize these different types.

670
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,040
It's kind of a painful, another painful version of like get her done or something.

671
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,540
Regional, something that makes you want to, once again.

672
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,760
It's kind of like a fizz.

673
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,700
A fuzz.

674
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,200
A fizz fuzz.

675
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,340
A fuzzy was.

676
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,160
A rattler, a rump splitter, and a frosted ferdaner.

677
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:40,860
It's categories like that that we must continue to study and further inspect and delineate.

678
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,300
And classify.

679
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,220
Yes, classify.

680
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,420
Endless subclassifications.

681
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,380
Endless subclassifications.

682
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,380


683
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,380


684
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,500
Always examineate once again.

685
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,740
Always examineate, yes.

686
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,480
Even if you have to lift the sack and look under it.

687
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,000
Even if you have to put on those rubber gloves and express that gland.

688
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,320
You're going to have to.

689
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,400
You've got to look.

690
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,960
You've got to.

691
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,980
If we've got to grab a piece of chalk and storm the blackboard and maybe punch down a couple of blackboard guards and stuff.

692
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,860
We're going to go up there and we're going to write down the new theorem.

693
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,060
And if you don't.

694
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,800
If you don't.

695
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,160
The infection will just spread.

696
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,460
If you don't listen to us and buy what we've got to sell.

697
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,880
There's no chance.

698
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,000
There's no way out.

699
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Wait a minute.

700
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,320
What are we selling?

701
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,340
The page is upside down.

702
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,580
What are we selling?

703
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,000
We're selling a way out.

704
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,460
We're selling a way out.

705
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,800
I had the page upside down.

706
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,460
Daddy-o?

707
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,600
No, I mean we're selling a way off of the planet.

708
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,340
A way out.

709
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,940
I didn't look at the other part.

710
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,100
I had the page upside down.

711
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
We are selling for a marginal cost.

712
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,980
Or a minimal cost.

713
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,880
Not a marginal cost.

714
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,960
Presumably you can make up your mind some other way you didn't want to unless, of course, you forgot about it.

715
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,560
That's not the important part right now.

716
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,020
The important part is to remember that the Church of the Subtenues is a way out of your normal de Gorlin.

717
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,520
Your normal...

718
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,960
That is so true.

719
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:13,420
You might still be sitting in that office or that assembly line or that slaughterhouse wherever your job is.

720
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,380
That hour.

721
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,100
Hour of slack production chimpanzee studio.

722
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,960
But yet, you have escaped.

723
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,260
Inside.

724
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,200
They can't catch you.

725
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,740
They can't put your mind in a cage, can they?

726
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,720
Well, they can.

727
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,700
And they did.

728
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,400
They did.

729
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:42,480
They put their minds into cages of all those pink boys, those mere humes, those luckless moronitites and mediocritines.

730
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,360
But we, the subtenues...

731
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,920
They're geniuses.

732
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,620
They can't...

733
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,100
They can lock us in the deepest dungeon.

734
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,900
And yet, inside our minds, we're still orgiastically partying.

735
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:05,040
It's not as good as if you really were orgiastically partying, but at least you can imagine higher realms of orgiastic partying.

736
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,680
It's better by curious.

737
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,820
It's almost real.

738
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,020
The pink king who thinks he's having an orgiastic party isn't having as much slack as his prisoner,

739
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
who's being drawn and quartered.

740
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,200
Or the person embracing that pork shoulder and trying to argue with that fish.

741
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,420
Oh my God, the Tibetans are after us.

742
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,960
And we're in their weird pantyhose.

743
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
It's a robbery.

744
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,980
It's a heist.

745
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,380
Okay.

746
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,880
You're going to repeat that mantra until your ears are thin.

747
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,100
Okay.

748
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,100


749
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,120
Okay.

750
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,740


751
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


752
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


753
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


754
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


755
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


756
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


757
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


758
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


759
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


760
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


761
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


762
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


763
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


764
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


765
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


766
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


767
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


768
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


769
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


770
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


771
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


772
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,000


773
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,380
See, nothing beats scientific responded.

774
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,960
Thank you, Dr.

775
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,100


776
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,300
Thank you.

777
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:55,900
Thank you.

778
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,040
Thank you.

779
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,060
Thank you.

780
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,300
Thank you.

781
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,040
Thank you.

782
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,120
Thank you.

783
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,120


784
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,120


785
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,860
Thank you.

786
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,260
Thank you.

787
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,740
Thank you.

788
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,480
Thank you.

789
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,600
Thank you.

790
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Thank you.

791
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,520
Thank you.

792
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,400
Thank you.

793
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,540
and pure.

794
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,100
And

795
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,320
and

796
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,760
and

797
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,060
Oh, man, this

798
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,980
reminds me of the last time I was stung

799
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,320
by a couple thousand bees.

800
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,340
What? What was that, Dave?

801
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,000
It reminds me of the last time I

802
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,740
was stung by a couple thousand

803
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,680
bees and ran down Lee Road

804
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,060
crying.

805
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,880
You survived being

806
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,360
stung by a couple of thousand bees?

807
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,640
He's talking off out of the end of his hat.

808
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,960
He should speak. It's a mixed metaphor.

809
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,080
I stumbled over her. I was on Lee Road

810
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,060
doing a painting job back when

811
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,680
I was a maintenance type fellow.

812
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,920
You're going to love this.

813
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,840
This is a true story

814
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,080
coming up? Yes, it's a true

815
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,260
story, and I rolled up a bag

816
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,740
of bees without knowing

817
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,980
about it on the roof of a garage

818
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,040
there. Well, I had to

819
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,060
dive in through the window, and Mom and Pop

820
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,640
were staring in astonishment

821
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,920
as the bees all came into the

822
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,800
house. Well, I ran down

823
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,900
stairs and ran out

824
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,680
the door and ran down Lee Road

825
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,780
almost all the way to what's

826
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,420
that corner over there?

827
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,900
And bees

828
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,840
were still going

829
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
after me a little bit one at a time.

830
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,360
Them bees would go at it?

831
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,980
Thousands of them.

832
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,540
Bees in your pants.

833
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,420
And that's what happens to people who

834
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,740
defy the ideals

835
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,800
and ideas of the church and the

836
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,880
subgenius. They're locked in small

837
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,760
rooms and treated with impunity.

838
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,680
They're argued with constantly

839
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,540
and given small fish to

840
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,740
dole them out amongst each other

841
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,380
as a token of surprise.

842
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,900
Most of them aren't going to

843
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,080
last too much longer.

844
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,760
Not unless they get hip to that brand new

845
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,580
package of smoker's pride

846
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,800
right under their pillow.

847
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

848
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,420
Mom?

849
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm afraid

850
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,720
my glands and my organs

851
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,420
are growing. Oh dear,

852
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,120
it's going to be all right. Really.

853
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
It'll be okay.

854
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,460
But look at my arm.

855
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,020
Yes, I'm looking at it.

856
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,480
Nothing looks wrong to me.

857
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,220
It looks fine.

858
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,180
Isn't that misspelled or something?

859
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,260
No, no.

860
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,020
It's supposed to be that way.

861
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,780
I didn't think

862
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,620
Bob Dobbs was supposed to look like that.

863
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,440
I didn't want a tattoo

864
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,580
right now for sure.

865
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,640
I want one.

866
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,820
It's going to be

867
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,300
okay.

868
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,620
Hey dear, it's really

869
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,760
going to be okay.

870
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,520
No it's not. Why are you telling him that?

871
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,920
I can put my trust in me.

872
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,840
You're just prolonging the agony.

873
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,700
You see?

874
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,940
Please dad.

875
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,880
I promise I'll never do it again.

876
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,820
I didn't do it yet, but

877
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,860
if I were to do it, I promise

878
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,900
that I wouldn't do it in the future

879
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,700
as I might have done if I

880
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,900
thought of it in the past.

881
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,940
It isn't.

882
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,180
Slow watches.

883
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:13,840
See here.

884
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,280
A very strange young modern

885
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,660
nuclear family.

886
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,400
With all the haircuts

887
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,460
and the brand new rhythms they can hear.

888
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,540
The backyard swimming pool

889
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,340
is full of barbecue sauce and everybody

890
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,440
is dead or naked.

891
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,740
But that's alright because it's the year

892
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,680
2013.

893
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,400
And it's weird, man. Real weird.

894
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,140


895
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,400
That was the worst movie I ever saw in my life.

896
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,140
Hello?

897
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,980
Yeah, we're still here.

898
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,900
I want some of that barbecue sauce.

899
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,160
I was just

900
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,520
shredding your pork.

901
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,140
This music

902
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,860
in the background was sent

903
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,260
to me on a hand-labeled

904
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,640
CD by

905
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,100
Christian Blatter

906
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,680
who sent us

907
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,620
I think a cassette tape of

908
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
collage noises

909
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,200
and media clips. It was

910
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
random but good.

911
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,900
It was a good beat. That kind of thing can be

912
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,760
terrible or good. And this

913
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,700
year he sent us this

914
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,460
music

915
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,680
from DV8

916
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,400
Productions, which is him.

917
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,580
And get this. This is done

918
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,600
with analog

919
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,320
electronic music equipment.

920
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,700
Remember that? Like the Divas back

921
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,560
in the day. Before everything

922
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,400
was programmed.

923
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,600
Instead of throwing something away,

924
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,680
creating something beautiful and new from something

925
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,420
old and... Yeah, man.

926
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,900
So these are like

927
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,340
old...

928
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,720
I think I recognized an old

929
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,420
Casio.

930
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,000
One of the ones I had.

931
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,380
Drum tracks in it.

932
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,420
And he's got an

933
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,600
ARP-AX or something like that.

934
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,580
One of those old ARP synthesizers

935
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,120
that you could make

936
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,680
kind of a variation

937
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,620
on a fart noise that would sound

938
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,660
like music or thunder

939
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,820
or gunshot or a drum beat.

940
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,760
And Wendy Carlos knew how to do it.

941
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,440
She knew how to do that. And this Christian

942
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,820
Blatter guy seems to be

943
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,240
doing it. It's running out of his

944
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,660
Blatter. Christian Blatter.

945
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,420
That is the name.

946
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,200
Not Bladder.

947
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,800
But Blatter.

948
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,860
Yes, Blatter.

949
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,320
As the Germans would

950
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,660
pronounce it. Blatter.

951
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,200
Yeah, like one who blats.

952
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,280
Like he blats. Therefore

953
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,200
he is a Blatter.

954
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,600
To know life, you must

955
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,660
screw it in the

956
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,340
gallblatter.

957
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,060
Or perhaps a medieval

958
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,360
task or some job. A yeoman's

959
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,140
job some almost nearly

960
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,160
a thousand years ago, which everyone is complete.

961
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,260
Oh yes, the old man was a

962
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,540
Blatter back in the day.

963
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,940
He met Bob on his knees.

964
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,160
Bob was on his knees.

965
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,900
He was. But

966
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,220
he was a Blatter, yes. And he did

967
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,100
the Blatter's work with every container

968
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,860
he used. And they were full

969
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,220
of delightful ointments and

970
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,940
parts of the human

971
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,400
bodies, of course.

972
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,260
The anatomy classes were very successful

973
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,500
for the Blatters.

974
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,520
The appendix.

975
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,180
And during the great

976
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,920
bubonic plague of the year 1249

977
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,680
or whether 1351,

978
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,380
they'd come out to the

979
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,980
Blatters would come out and collect the dead.

980
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,380
The Blatters.

981
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,480
The Blatter. This is

982
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,560
the Blatter show. A show

983
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,600
about the Blatter. The greatest

984
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,280
organ of the body.

985
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,180
Because it leads up to the great time.

986
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,080
The time I don't have to tell you about,

987
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,160
but it starts with a P.

988
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,220
The time of P.E.

989
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,480
Let's call it for short.

990
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,540
That's where the Blatter comes in.

991
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,020
But Christian Blatter also goes

992
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
by the name of Cool Hand Chris.

993
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,860
And apparently you can Google

994
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,600
Cool Hand Chris rocks

995
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,640
and find more Blatterian

996
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,940
old school digital analog

997
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,880
or analog digital or whatever

998
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,720
you would call that.

999
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,140
Oh, and I have a plug.

1000
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,960
A plug.

1001
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,960
I have to plug you, Dave.

1002
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,940
Plug it in.

1003
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,260
Princess, we and I finished our first

1004
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,040
YouTube video in a year.

1005
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,980
The last ones were

1006
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,620
microscopic where they were used.

1007
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,200
A microscope was the camera.

1008
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,440
Before that, a computer was used as a camera.

1009
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,020
But this time we used a real camera

1010
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,460
and we took pictures of real places all over

1011
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,240
America.

1012
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,520
And we put our very best pictures

1013
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,600
as a kind of a slideshow on YouTube.

1014
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,400
And you can find it by.

1015
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,560
Going to YouTube or just Google YouTube

1016
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,760
and the account name is Revstang.

1017
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,180
R-E-V-S-T-A-N-G.

1018
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,020
All one word, lowercase.

1019
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,800
Revstang on YouTube.

1020
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,940
And just look at the most recent upload.

1021
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,940
And it's, you'll, if you're our friend,

1022
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,520
you'll be so happy to see that Princess,

1023
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,080
we and I saw so many cool things.

1024
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,200
You get to see the things that we saw,

1025
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,740
but not the in between things.

1026
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:12,740


1027
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,980
The in between stuff, just the best stuff.

1028
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,740
The moment that everything looked cool

1029
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,040
and not the driving to there.

1030
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,500
Or the bathroom breaks or,

1031
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,260
and the jail cells in between.

1032
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,120
But it's only the best parts.

1033
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,640
And I think it's called

1034
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,420
Stang Doe Winter Trip 2012-2013.

1035
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,380
And it's a masterpiece.

1036
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,820
The best, the best thing about it

1037
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,580
is that my knowledge that when my enemies see it,

1038
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,340
they will grind their teeth down to nubs in jealousy.

1039
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,680
I will admit that that's one reason I post

1040
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,920
a carefully edited record of our adventures.

1041
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,180
But the adventures they were.

1042
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:03,680
Are you in a few?

1043
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,600
Are they many right now?

1044
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,460
Or are they remarkable in any way?

1045
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,080
They are.

1046
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,220
They're all remarkable.

1047
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,260
Each one is remarkable.

1048
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,120
And if you don't understand what you go,

1049
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,640
well, wait a minute,

1050
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,360
it's just a picture of Stang looking stupid.

1051
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,400
Look behind Stang.

1052
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,260
That's just a picture of Princess Wee looking pretty.

1053
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,180
Well, look behind Princess Wee.

1054
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,300
Look and see if you can see something in the background.

1055
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,140
A rock shaped like something nasty.

1056
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,600
Or an alien peeking out from behind a doorway.

1057
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,080
You'll see all kinds of things.

1058
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:37,900
Huh?

1059
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,280
I thought it was a hairy demon.

1060
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,840
I thought it was a fuzzy little demon.

1061
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,960
Looked like to me the first time I saw it.

1062
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,840
And that one was.

1063
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,720
And it was blue and then it was yellow.

1064
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,540
Then it was blue.

1065
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,220
Then it was yellow.

1066
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,140
I thought, man, something got a hold of Stang's psyche.

1067
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,360
Some little thing that changes back and forth between blue and yellow.

1068
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,080
It's real fuzzy and looks like a demon.

1069
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,480
He's got control of, I don't know, his blatter.

1070
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,980
Or perhaps his banter.

1071
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,760
Or perhaps his mantra.

1072
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,140
Or perhaps.

1073
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,720
Something like that.

1074
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,220
It was the blatter.

1075
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,560
The blatter?

1076
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,400
The blatter.

1077
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:12,900
The latter.

1078
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,780
The latter.

1079
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,600
The blatter.

1080
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,380
You know, when you have a one hour live radio show, you have to think about your blatter.

1081
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,000
Before you get on the air.

1082
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:31,380
Because otherwise you end up with your hand at your lap jumping back and forth from leg to leg.

1083
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,800
Trying to sound calm like I am now.

1084
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,060
Actually, I did take care of that.

1085
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,020
And everything's fine.

1086
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,240
Well, in your case, you have to worry about other forms of incontinence.

1087
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:42,560
Right.

1088
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,180
The drooling.

1089
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,540
My incompetence is leaking out.

1090
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1091
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,760
That was last week's Buzz.

1092
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,140
That was last week's Buzz show.

1093
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,300
Buzz show.

1094
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,980
The Buzz show.

1095
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,900
It was the Buzz show.

1096
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:01,960
I've been, actually, this whole time that we've been talking, I've had my YouTubes playing in order of backwards order chronologically.

1097
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,340
So mostly I've been watching rotifers squirming around eating.

1098
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,160
Collapses and stuff.

1099
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,580
But I guess the next thing up is Starwood Festival in five minutes.

1100
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,280
The burning of Bob at 14X Day Drill.

1101
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,080
Bob appears at Starwood Bonfire.

1102
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,940
Evolution Control Committee at 14X Day Drill.

1103
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,500
These are my YouTubes.

1104
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:31,840
But the best ones are micro bug porn one through five, which come right after our vacation pictures.

1105
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,340
Those are sexually exciting.

1106
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,320
Those are sexually exciting.

1107
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:43,780
If you're a bug admirer, a B.A., we call them, you might get into it.

1108
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,300
You might.

1109
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,240
Go for that sort of thing, then yes.

1110
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:55,380
I'd like to go for the B.F.A. if I could, but I flunked rhythm back in the old days of schooling.

1111
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,800
You see, my parents were consummated.

1112
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:04,200
They consummated their marriage underneath a tree that had bitter fruit.

1113
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,960
I guess the best way to put it.

1114
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,240
And they discovered the Church of the Subgenius.

1115
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,880
I think it was in 1993 or something like that.

1116
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,260
Well, first thing you know, the old lady's house is all full of all these pamphlets and leaflets.

1117
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,800
And he's confusing pieces of paper where she's writing her will because she says she's going to fly away on a spaceship.

1118
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,240
So that's when I first called the authorities.

1119
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,180
It was actually, well, it was a better thing.

1120
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1121
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:43,600
I called the business bureau at first just to see who the hell, you know, because my mom, God rest her soul, passed away two and a half minutes ago.

1122
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:51,840
And I just wanted to make sure that we can do something about scum like the Church of the Subgenius.

1123
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,860
I mean, the only word I have for them is scum.

1124
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,080
It's just a bunch of darn scum.

1125
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,300
We'll be back to subgenius hoarders in just a minute.

1126
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,580
But now this.

1127
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:11,240
Have you ever wondered about Popeye training or learning how to speak a different language in a different world?

1128
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,800
Well, now you can.

1129
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:22,000
With the Church of the Subgenius hot and fresh package, you can learn practically every extraterrestrial dialect used in this part of the galaxy.

1130
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,940
You'll be as incomprehensible as ever, but at least you'll look cool while you're doing it.

1131
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,560
With this wonderful bag of wheels placed right here.

1132
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


1133
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,840
While you're talking.

1134
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,720
Daddy, can I have that?

1135
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,800
Oh, you've already had plenty, honey.

1136
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,960
Now get back in the wagon with the rest of the little brat.

1137
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,920
Luckily, she wasn't my child.

1138
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,820
She was somebody else's kid.

1139
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,540
Yeah.

1140
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,280
Somebody with a pipe.

1141
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,940
Is this a weird show?

1142
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,500
What?

1143
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:01,980
What's happening?

1144
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,580
I'm confused.

1145
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,520
I'm all messed up.

1146
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:05,940
I can't.

1147
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,740
This can't be what I'm really hearing.

1148
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,080
I'm in the.

1149
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,400
We're in the car, right?

1150
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,300
What kind of question is that?

1151
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,080
Is this a weird show?

1152
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,540
Is that on the radio?

1153
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,100
What's going?

1154
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,380
Yeah.

1155
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,400
Is this a weird show we're hearing?

1156
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,220
Yeah, this is a weird show.

1157
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,280
It's been a weird show for like, I don't know.

1158
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,040
Did you guys give me something?

1159
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,300
Going on like 30 years.

1160
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,820
Did you dose me?

1161
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,040
You dosed me, didn't you?

1162
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,880
You dosed me.

1163
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,540
You take it easy.

1164
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,160
You're not the star, man.

1165
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,720
You dosed me.

1166
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,980
There's something wrong with this.

1167
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,640
You're not the star, you're the star.

1168
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,420
This isn't a show.

1169
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:30,920
Take it easy.

1170
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,400
Sit down.

1171
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:31,760
Sit down.

1172
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,020
This isn't right.

1173
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,980
This isn't a show.

1174
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,580
This is real.

1175
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,400
I'm messed up and you're not.

1176
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,240
You don't want to take me to the hospital.

1177
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,480
That's what it is, isn't it?

1178
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,400
You don't want to take me to the hospital, but I'm freaking out, man.

1179
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:48,960
I'm here to find out who visited the man first before we're allowed to let you complete the

1180
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,260
trip.

1181
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:55,320
He's been in here for three weeks and still doesn't know exactly who he really is.

1182
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,620
We're having a hard time communicating, but we feel that if he's here, we're going to

1183
00:54:59,620 --> 00:54:59,640
find out who he really is.

1184
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:05,180
If you could help in any way, perhaps maybe just get a few words out of the guy that makes

1185
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,080
sense, we'll be back in business.

1186
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,440
As Reverend Stang settles down.

1187
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,540
Oh, man.

1188
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,560
He actually settles down.

1189
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,400
Reverend Dr. Stang?

1190
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,600
My mind is no longer at peace.

1191
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:29,600


1192
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:29,800
Does what's going on with Dave need to be done about?

1193
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:29,800


1194
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,260
Well, Dave and Dave are my friend.

1195
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,060
Dave broke my head again.

1196
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,020
I broke your head.

1197
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,060
Yeah, again, it'll get better later.

1198
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,620
I didn't want to break your head.

1199
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,740
It broke my head.

1200
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,180
But me and Dave are your friend.

1201
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,240
I didn't mean to break your head.

1202
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,760
I think the Blatter music broke my head, too.

1203
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,220
Neither one of us wanted to break your head.

1204
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:51,720
The combination.

1205
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,660
It's the combination.

1206
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,800
Well, all he had to do was pod down the pan, and pan down the pod, and I would have shut

1207
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,600
up a little bit if he did.

1208
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,140
If you would have told me you was getting a headache.

1209
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,360
I love the bladder.

1210
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,160
Well, we all love the bladder when it's made into sedition or some other kind of oriental soup.

1211
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,940
It's still not all empty either.

1212
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,920
The bladder CD is still half full.

1213
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,020
It's good bladder as far as I'm concerned.

1214
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,140
Well, that's because it's Christian Blatter.

1215
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,100
Do you think that's really his name?

1216
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,800
No, I think it's Chris.

1217
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,560
There's people named Blatter and Christian.

1218
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,080
His name is Christian and he's called Chris.

1219
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,140
You know, I mean, some people think that your name, nobody has a real name.

1220
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,700
We are Doe.

1221
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,420
But the Does go back a long way.

1222
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,420
Like the Dobses and the Knoppers.

1223
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,200
And the Dobses.

1224
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,340
Ancient Egypt, actually.

1225
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,980
I think it goes all the way back to the days of Akhenaten and all them guys.

1226
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,820
Hey, speaking of Knocknoppern, it's the end of the show.

1227
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:59,360
And I guess we won't play the Lonesome Cowboy Dave song.

1228
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,280
Oh, no.

1229
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,720
I'm so disappointed now.

1230
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,620
Yeah.

1231
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,420
I'm sorry.

1232
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,840
I wanted to hear myself say that so badly.

1233
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:23,720
Because it's got my five word on the run and the Krypton 85 and all that crap.

1234
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,840
Yeah.

1235
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,860
All that stuff.

1236
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,460
Instead, we'll just play.

1237
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:28,860
Yeah.

1238
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,640
Instead, we'll just play the Swingin' Love Corpses doing Pick a Booger.

1239
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,460
And we have to go.

1240
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,140
Bye.

1241
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:37,960
Okay.

1242
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,280
Bye, Dave.

1243
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,420
Bye.

1244
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,320
Bye.

1245
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:41,840
Bye.

1246
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,040
Bye.

1247
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,120


1248
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1249
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1250
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1251
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1252
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1253
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:42,300


1254
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:42,900
Bye.

1255
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:43,380
Bye.

1256
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:43,660


1257
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:43,660


1258
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1259
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:43,700


1260
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:43,860


1261
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:43,860


1262
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:47,940
Bye.

1263
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:47,980


1264
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:48,680
Bye.

1265
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:48,680


1266
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:48,680


1267
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:48,680


1268
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:57,840
Bye.

1269
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,440
Bye.

1270
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,400
And you know, pick a booger out

1271
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,820
And wipe it on your clothes

1272
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,500
I don't have to be the one way or the other

1273
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,160
It makes you happy to wipe it on your clothes

1274
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,320
Robbing in your bar

1275
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,720
And looking at your neighbor

1276
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,020
Pining nuggets of his house

1277
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,380
Just like a saber in the labor

1278
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,960
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's yanking on this thing

1279
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,200
It's a long, strabist thing

1280
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,600
Still connected to the brain

1281
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,700
Pick a booger

1282
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,060
Pick a booger

1283
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,000
Pick a booger

1284
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,240
Pick a booger

1285
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Everybody's doing it

1286
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,860
Picking it and chewing it

1287
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,780
Yeah

1288
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,980
He's rolling, he's checking in for hair

1289
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,640
He's picking feet away, still looking at the mirror

1290
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,040
He's taking on his finger

1291
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,380
He's the best of every day

1292
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,220
He's the best of every day

1293
00:58:59,220 --> 00:58:59,220


1294
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,900
Pick a booger, bogey, it's the new best way

1295
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,600
Stopping out to give me up

1296
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,860
From deep inside his sinuses

1297
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,340
Slave to the master of his royal sadness

1298
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,000
Kids all wanna have days of infatuation

1299
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,380
So I'm picking up a booger

1300
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,440
It's the new sensation

1301
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,760
Pick a booger

1302
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,120
Pick a booger

1303
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,940
Pick a booger

1304
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,240
Pick a booger

1305
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,540
Pick a booger

1306
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:22,780
Pick a booger

1307
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,480
Pick a booger

1308
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,860
Pick a booger

1309
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:24,880
Pick a booger

1310
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,020
Pick a booger

1311
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,360
Pick a booger

1312
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,920
Pick a booger

1313
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:42,040
Pick a booger

1314
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,060
Pick a booger

1315
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:43,060


1316
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:43,060


1317
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:43,060


1318
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:43,060


1319
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,300
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1320
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,680
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1321
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,080
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1322
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,640
for another couple of months.

1323
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,100
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1324
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,680
and all the other archive sites.

1325
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,200
But if you truly love Bob

1326
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,740
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1327
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,660
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1328
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,180
or especially the radio page

1329
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,260
or the catalog store pages.

1330
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,580
And help out financially as best you can.

1331
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,920
Now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1332
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,560
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make your own situations worse.

1333
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,500
But some of you still have jobs.

1334
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,840
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1335
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,420
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1336
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,820
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1337
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,620
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs.

1338
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,020
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs.

1339
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,020


1340
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,020


1341
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,320
If you don't pay dogs.

1342
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,200
We also take checks and money orders to

1343
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,080
Subgenius Foundation

1344
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,420
P.O. Box 181 417

1345
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:01,540
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1346
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,760
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
