1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:11,000
Here, look. Yeah? Just look around. The smart money knows the truth. I'm getting on the ground floor.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,240
The Soul Genius. Power of Swatch.

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,300
Have you looked at them? Crooks, gangsters, bums, hobos, drunks, and I don't know what.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,300
They are a little picturesque, aren't they?

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,920
But what kind of a society are you going to start with them?

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,860
How damn snobbish are you?

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,280
To make a decent place, you need bums and alcoholics and criminals.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,800
Oh, well, I guess so.

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,580
This tape is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,180
Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject for every Christian to study,

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,240
to help you better understand current events, to put things in perspective,

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,600
and most importantly, to help you have that inner peace of knowing

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:57,900
that you are not alone.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,960
That God is on His throne and in control.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,220
Oh, I'd like to go to the lake and...

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
And a part of the beast will be introduced.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,320
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Someone with a lot of energy.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:15,960
Uh-huh.

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,460
Okay, your code number once more?

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,140
237.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,380
237, and you're calling from Dallas.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,720
Sorry.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,720
Okay, thank you.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,220
Thank you.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,780
Bye-bye.

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,400
Hi, you're on hotline.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,400
You can start...

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Yes, my code number is 237.

31
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,280
Amen.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,700
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,200
Amen.

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
Praise the Lord.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,160
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,380
Amen.

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,960
They're going to get worse and worse.

38
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,940
We don't care what mama do, I don't wanna...

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,780
Anyhow, mama don't wanna...

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,560
Hey, mama don't wanna be the plane around here.

41
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,400
Doctors 1.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
Gonna be a sad time.

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,660
We're going to die.

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:03,880
Oh, mama don't wanna be a sad time.

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,800
I mean, what's the point of the life that we have if we're not walking by the same rules

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
and minding the same things?

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,980
So many people are confused about it and got their own theory about the way they see the

48
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,080
Word of God, but I...

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
All the signs point to serious health damage.

50
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,600
All the signs point to thousands and thousands and thousands of cancers and birth deformities

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,100
and miscarriages and awful health problems.

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,840
Both sides will be destroyed, regardless of who starts it.

53
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,620
The minute you have another war, there's not gonna be any war left.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:31,740
And I'm not asking you to stop.

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:31,740


56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,120
I don't think.

57
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,160
If you want to blow one, now look at the pieces.

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,600
Peace on Earth.

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,720
Peace on Earth.

60
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,140
Peace on Earth.

61
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,400
P-O-E.

62
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,220
Purity of essence.

63
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,720
I give my vote for Jesus, and I thank God for you and Brother Robinson.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,360
Because in this day and time, we don't know what we're going to come to.

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,200
Are you familiar with the government-prepared cancer maps?

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,320
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,840
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

69
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
As soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,200
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

71
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,060
Even possibly the president.

72
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,700
So we're still going to be hiding this stuff underground.

73
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,520
I personally feel that the president of the United States is evading the issue of hazardous waste in America today.

74
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,140
I can't really play the guitar very well.

75
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Or sing.

76
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,220
So, you know.

77
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,380
Apologies.

78
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,300
Stunning 8K resolution meditation app.

79
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,560
In honor of the revolution, it's half off at the gap.

80
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,640
Deadpool self-awareness.

81
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,000
Loving parents.

82
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,120
Harmless.

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,660
Fun.

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,340
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun.

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,680
There it is again.

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,620
That funny feeling.

87
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,980
That funny feeling.

88
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,480
There it is again.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,500
That funny feeling.

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,520
That funny feeling.

91
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,560
Okay.

92
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,240
Don't get archive.

93
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,920
letters.

94
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,060


95
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,060


96
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,060


97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,480
Get active via the schedule proposal we have.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,300
The Michael Jackson of America.

99
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,700
at your door

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,120
The live action Lion King

101
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,020
The Pepsi halftime show

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,280
Twenty thousand years of this

103
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,620
Seven more to go

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,120
Carpool karaoke

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,140
Steve Aoki

106
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,580
Logan Paul

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,920
A gift shop at the gun range

108
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,620
A man shooting at the mall

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,640
There it is again

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,680
That funny feeling

111
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,080
That funny feeling

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,400
There it is again

113
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,580
That funny feeling

114
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,840
That funny feeling

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,560
There it is again

116
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,560
There it is again

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:55,560
There it is again

118
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,360
There it is again

119
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,500
That funny feeling

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
That funny feeling

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,000
There it is again

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,240
That funny feeling

123
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,440
Hey, what can you say?

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,980
We were overdue

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,960
But it'll be over soon

126
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,320
You wait

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,560
You wait

128
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,200
Hey, what can you say?

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,660
We were overdue

130
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,680
But it'll be over soon

131
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Just wait

132
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,300
We were overdue

133
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,400
But it'll be over soon

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,640
You wait

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,500
Hey, what can you say?

136
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,900
We were overdue

137
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,880
But it'll be over soon

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,160
You wait

139
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,040
Hey, what can you say?

140
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,360
We were overdue

141
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
But it'll be over soon

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,640
You wait

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:20,040
I pulled that funny feeling

144
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,460
By Bo Burnham

145
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,260
Off YouTube

146
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,940
At the suggestion of Reverend Blackout

147
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,220
Good suggestion

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,020
Because it fits perfectly into the theme

149
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,060
Of this hour of Slack

150
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,860
Number 1,849

151
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,920
The end of the world

152
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,420
Also known as subgenius

153
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,360
Media barrage number four

154
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,920
Some of our media barrage albums

155
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
From the early 1980s

156
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,400
Are on CD or streaming

157
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,280
But media barrage number four

158
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,260
Has stayed on tape since 1981

159
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,460
And is basically unheard

160
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,300
By modern so-called audiences

161
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,640
When this was edited

162
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,080
On reel-to-reel tape

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,780
Largely by me

164
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,400
There were only about 273

165
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,320
Known subgeniuses

166
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,820
This episode will be a mix

167
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,780
Of the very old

168
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,120
With the just finished

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,400
Because we have two more

170
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,660
Recent original songs coming up

171
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,640
That probably haven't been

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Broadcast much before

173
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,380
But let's plunge into the toxic

174
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,860
Radioactive swamp

175
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,360
That is our future

176
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,320
As prophesied in

177
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,460
Subgenius media barrage tape number four

178
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,580
He's with Wonder Woman

179
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,700
And her incredible powers

180
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,500
Of strength and agility

181
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,600
At six it's Kirk Spock

182
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
And the crew of the Starship Enterprise

183
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,660
And the only cult they want to talk about

184
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,980
Is the subgenius foundation

185
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,880
The church of the subgenius

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,920
And the only reason they talk about it

187
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Is for the money

188
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,800
We're going to go to the phones right now

189
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,340
Good evening you're on KFJZ

190
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,180
With Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond

191
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,340
And the Reverend R.J.

192
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Arnold Stang

193
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,480
Ivan Stang

194
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
I have a question for Mr. Drummond

195
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,100
Yes go ahead

196
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,560
Are you Mr. Drummond

197
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,240
That's right

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm calling from Dallas

199
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
What's your question

200
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,300
Well do you work on spiritual problems

201
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,660
Or you just work on wallets

202
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,260
We will help you out spiritually

203
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,700
Of course it helps if we can have

204
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,740
Some financial assistance

205
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,740
We sell ten dollar memberships

206
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,620
And once you get on our

207
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,540
You start getting our newsletter

208
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,340
You start reading our newsletters and stuff like that

209
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,940
And you start receiving lessons on how to conduct your life

210
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,260
In the most beneficial way for both you and us

211
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260
We listen on the radio dial

212
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,000
We get the rhythm when we've got dial

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,760
Well people

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,920
We'll make you feel better for a while

215
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,580
Put your hands

216
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,780
Put your hands on the radio

217
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,280
Perhaps you've been deceived by

218
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,820
Evangelists masquerading as angels of light

219
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,640
He's gone

220
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,760
And the world is waiting for who

221
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,640
Well the world's unbelievers entirely

222
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,100
They're waiting for the Antichrist

223
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,820
They don't know they are

224
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
But who's going to come in ten days

225
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,500
But the one who says to Israel

226
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,580
You need protection

227
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,900
As we said have made the club

228
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,400
Hi

229
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,840
May I speak to Reverend Stang

230
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,540
Oh yeah you got me

231
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
Reverend Stang

232
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
Right

233
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,580
I call to ask

234
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,260
As far as your belief is concerned

235
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,500
Are you a Christian

236
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,620
And do you believe in the Bible

237
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


238
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


239
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


240
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


241
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


242
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


243
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,140
Are you a Christian

244
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,140


245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,180
We believe in everything

246
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,080
You do

247
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,320
The reason I asked is

248
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,880
I was intrigued by what you brought out

249
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,280
About using the word conspiracy

250
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,700
And I was wondering if you believed in the fact that

251
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,900
Jesus Christ was saved yesterday, today and forever

252
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,300
And do you believe that he still has a true prophet

253
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,160
In these last days as he did in Moses and Elijah

254
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,900
Well I'll tell you what

255
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,620
We've been in the course of our research

256
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,600
We've been in the course of our research

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,380
And getting a whole lot of stuff

258
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,560
In the miles of the Second Coming

259
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,620
A lot of other culture're talking about the Second Coming

260
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,700
How Jesus Is going to come back

261
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,660
Or sometimes It goes by other names

262
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,080
The Christ Is going to come back

263
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,800
The main thing in

264
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,180
The subgenius foundation has say about that

265
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,020
Is beware of cheap imitations

266
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,380
There are a lot of philosophies

267
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,520
Are running around right now

268
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
A lot of people are

269
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,560
The next twenty three years

270
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,860
There are going to be a lot of people

271
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,580
Trying to convince you that they onlyció in Belf facing the story they're going to have religious values

272
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,740
Jesus back on earth. Oh yes, as a born-again Christian, I've seen that in the spirit too.

273
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,480
I know exactly what you're talking about. I'll make a peace agreement with you. The only reason

274
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,900
America still stands is there's a remnant of Christians who are still praying for a spiritual

275
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:48,440
awakening in this country. The church of the living God is preaching and believing and looking

276
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:56,020
for the coming of Jesus Christ. There is a way out. There is an escape route. This world is

277
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,680
destined for destruction. It's doomed and it's damned according to the word of God.

278
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,420
But Jesus is coming for a church. He's going to get his bride out of this world.

279
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,340
Point one. I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States.

280
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,420
Be careful.

281
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:27,480
Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977. Never.

282
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,300
Oh

283
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,940
There are two ways to get to Tehran sooner or later to get there sooner. Fly Iran air.

284
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,600
Only Iran air flies from New York to Tehran nonstop. You arrive in the afternoon in time

285
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,540
for dinner and a good night's sleep. You wake up refreshed. On other airlines,

286
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,320
you arrive after dark, often much later. Fly to Tehran the fastest way on Iran air.

287
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,080
Try the urgent way to fly.

288
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,460
Let us whisk you through the sky.

289
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,420
Serving you in many more ways.

290
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,620
Iran air is rolling your way.

291
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,140
Remember, you're only one stop from London, Paris or Tehran on Iran air.

292
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes, my number is 239 and I'm calling from Dallas.

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,400
And the person I'm looking for is, should be very interesting and, you know, not pleasant.

294
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,620
I'm not interested in plastic or anything like that.

295
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,540
And someone who enjoys going out and having a good time and a good conversation with.

296
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,340
And I guess that's about it.

297
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,260
Okay, your code number one more time?

298
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,000
239.

299
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Thanks for calling. Good luck.

300
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:02,880
Thank you.

301
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,600
So long.

302
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,460
More proof that a car really works.

303
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,400
More proof that a car really works.

304
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,400


305
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,400


306
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,400


307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,400


308
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,440
Marvin L. Kosnovsky, president of Kosnovsky Corks, is proud of his corks.

309
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,000
I am proud of my corks.

310
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,060
Ask your friendly cork dealer for a file for today.

311
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,900
If you itch, you need soft and soothe.

312
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,320
Swimming, you know. High temperature today, 100 degrees even.

313
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,140
That makes it the 63rd day this summer that we've been there.

314
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,280
Well, actually this year because almost the entire...

315
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,380
And if weather conditions had been different, the toxic cloud released might have...

316
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,240
...blown over Manhattan.

317
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,860
It's scary. It's damn scary. Especially with the fact that I've got two kids.

318
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,040
I normally die with these chemicals. What's that got to do with it?

319
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,500
Irid XX helps keep you extra, extra dry.

320
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,320
Let your fears well up.

321
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
You have them.

322
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,940
Now don't deny them their chance to claim your soul.

323
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,880
Know that within every man is a monster.

324
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:25,480
And this monster may create a monster.

325
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:34,440
A Frankenstein monster to bring your realistic world crashing down around you.

326
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,820
You say it can't be true.

327
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,160
There are some 50,000 nuclear weapons in the world today.

328
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,060
I think we really need nuclear weapons because Russia and everybody else has got them.

329
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,460
Jesus began to give to them the signs of his coming and the end of the age.

330
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,420
And one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

331
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,820
This hasn't taken place yet.

332
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,980
Just don't buy your doomsday theories. Well, you better buy them.

333
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:15,220
We are in worse shape from the point of view of our military preparedness than we were on the 8th of December 1941.

334
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,660
The day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

335
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,400
The Russians have got the definite advantage on us right now.

336
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,660
But we need to show more strength.

337
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,520
We've got to catch up or get ahead of them or we're dead meat.

338
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the earth in his day.

339
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:38,740
And that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place that a great cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

340
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,860
And we do not know that it wouldn't happen in 1982, but we don't know what day it will happen.

341
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,200
This article was written in the 18th century.

342
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,040
Referring as I said to the nine planets in our solar system.

343
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,700
Mercury, Earth, Mars, Uranus, Pluto, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and Neptune.

344
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,620
When these are scheduled to be perfectly aligned in 1982 that these things perhaps can happen.

345
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,620
Many scientists with varying ideas of what could happen have expressed their views that huge solar flares will take place.

346
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,900
Resulting that could be disruptions in the television and radio communication and a great deal more.

347
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,200
I see that I'm not going to have much time to go into this anymore.

348
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,260
And so I'm going to carry it through tomorrow and try to bring it to a more clear climax.

349
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,120
But may I tell you that all of these are warnings to us to repent of our sins and to get ready for the coming of the Lord.

350
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:35,820
For we can see great and drastic things that are going to take place on the earth when Jesus comes and the judgments of God are being poured out upon a Christ rejecting world.

351
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,320
But after we come through here and we purify through this plant here it takes out some of the chemicals in the mud out of it.

352
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,180
But you can't drink.

353
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,080
We can't drink it.

354
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,940
No way in the world you can drink it unless you hold your nose.

355
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,700
The ice too is bombing.

356
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,140
The sun's too many.

357
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,260
Meltdown expected.

358
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,080
The wheat is torty.

359
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,100
Engines stop running.

360
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,880
But I have no fear.

361
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,520
Because London is round and I live by the river.

362
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,940
It will also tell you about the prelude to Armageddon and also some of the strange events that have been forecast for 1982.

363
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,780
Some of the things that are coming.

364
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,420
In these last days.

365
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,200
You know the future is a magnetic place.

366
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,380
Each year a hundred billion are born into it.

367
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
Why it seems all roads lead to tomorrow.

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,220
Why just looking at the future is enchanting.

369
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:38,180
Rows along conveyor belts where awe-inspiring holograms are as much a part of the experience of every man as were the real trees, mountains and sunsets of the dark past.

370
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,180
It's thrilling to wander amidst these realistic 3D images.

371
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:53,040
And you'll certainly feel at home since the leaders here have chosen the architecture of the mediocritons of the middle class ages as the most relaxing and appeasing of all art forms.

372
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,120
It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises or power plants and office buildings.

373
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,700
Which might suddenly change to lovely forests and pastures.

374
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,540
But wherever you go you're still amid the clean ever-changing holograms of the future.

375
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,000
Made possible by the amazing hologram projectors.

376
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,940
And the careful planning of the folks behind the scenes.

377
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,180
And it won't put a dent in your budget.

378
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,720
Since holograms are produced in economical black and white.

379
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,700
You might even get to see a rare hologram eclipse when your real surroundings become enjoyably apparent.

380
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,600
We are having pretty cool day today.

381
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,900
Please do not attempt to know that.

382
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,620
You can't see it all.

383
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,500
You can't even be sure you're seeing any of it.

384
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,100
You and I are scientific men.

385
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,280
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.

386
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,280
Now just think.

387
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,060
Less than a month ago Santa Mera was like any other town.

388
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,680
People with nothing but problems.

389
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,520
Then out of the sky came a solution.

390
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,580
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmer's field.

391
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,760
From the seeds came pods.

392
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,940
Which have the power to reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.

393
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,260
Your new bodies are growing in there.

394
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,100
They're taking you over.

395
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,500
Cell for cell.

396
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,020
Atom for atom.

397
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,820
There's no pain.

398
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,880
Suddenly while you're asleep they'll absorb your minds.

399
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,100
Your memories.

400
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,240
And you're reborn into an untroubled world.

401
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,160
Where everything is the same.

402
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,340
Exactly.

403
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,140
What a world.

404
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,380
We're not the last humans left.

405
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,520
They'll destroy you.

406
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,080
Tomorrow you won't want them to.

407
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.

408
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,860
I don't want any part of it.

409
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,760
You're forgetting something Miles.

410
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,740
What's that?

411
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,040
You have no choice.

412
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,800
And our children will live, Mr. Beale,

413
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,520
to see that perfect world

414
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,600
in which there's no war or famine

415
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,300
or oppression or brutality.

416
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,960
One vast and ecumenical holding company

417
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,620
for whom all men will work to serve a common profit.

418
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,740
In which all men will hold a share of stock.

419
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,560
All necessities provided.

420
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,640
All anxieties tranquilized.

421
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,580
All boredom.

422
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
All amused.

423
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,700
The chemicals these factories create are welcomed by our modern day lifestyle.

424
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,600
The locals here complain the campers commit to what along this coast is perhaps the gravest of possible crimes.

425
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,220
They don't spend enough money.

426
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,920
We're gonna make 30.

427
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,280
A mandatory retirement age.

428
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,800
And we're gonna set up rehabilitation camps.

429
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,900
Mercy centers in every state of the union.

430
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,520
Citizens will report to them after five years.

431
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,300
At the age of 35.

432
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,540
And there, in groovy surroundings, we're gonna psych them all out on LSD, babies.

433
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,440
That way, they're not gonna hurt you.

434
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,060
And they're not gonna hurt me.

435
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,580
And babies, they're not even gonna hurt themselves anymore.

436
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,000
They want drafters.

437
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,740
We'll draft them.

438
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,080
And some of them are really gonna dig it.

439
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,520
And that's gonna be the real mother-loving gas.

440
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,700
There's gonna be cats who wanna split from taxes, diners' clubs, crazy birds, crazy wives and crazy husbands.

441
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,080
Millions, troops.

442
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,680
But millions are gonna go willingly.

443
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,700
Ah, the funny sketch.

444
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,720
Thank you. Do you like that?

445
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,980
Yeah. No. But it was a funny sketch.

446
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,460
That's it.

447
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
You talk about young people in America.

448
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,520
I don't recognize them.

449
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,440
I don't think they exist.

450
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,740
I think your kind creates them.

451
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,220
You force them into little molds and pop them out like little plastic figures off a production line.

452
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,920
You stuff them full of preconceived ideas, praise them for turning out so well.

453
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,720
But they're not people. They're machines.

454
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,780
Then you wind them up like little tape recorders and send them out into the world to spread another generation of lies.

455
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,560
This is the best of all possible worlds.

456
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,980
This is a recording.

457
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:34,880
Wow.

458
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,380
Quiet, angels.

459
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,660
I'm gonna pass one more miracle.

460
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,620
And you gotta help me.

461
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,160
In case it's a new kind of miracle.

462
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,040
In my own image, let there be man.

463
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:56,080
Sure, we gave second thoughts to paving over the earth, but...

464
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,160
Well, like, cement's not very biodegradable.

465
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
And we had enough of it down already.

466
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,180
We figured we may as well go ahead and pave over the rest.

467
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,380
It's a lot easier than tearing all this up.

468
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,120
We could air condition and it got rid of the bugs.

469
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,580
I don't know, it's just a lot easier to keep things clean.

470
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,020
I mean, we got air conditioning, toilet training for all our children.

471
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,260
We've got all the rocks we could chew on.

472
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,420
But you don't need nature for beauty.

473
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,500
The buildings here are inspiring monuments to our adaptable workers.

474
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,420
Such as the enchanting shopping metroplexes.

475
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,900
During Let's Go Shopping, a 20 minute break in a 20 hour work day,

476
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,760
humans compete to consume as much as possible.

477
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,860
And all it costs is time.

478
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,460
What husband could resist letting his wife have us free for free?

479
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,240
And there's sure no trouble deciding what you want.

480
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,980
Oh, don't buy me.

481
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,920
Nobody wants me.

482
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,100
I used to be popular.

483
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
But not no more.

484
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,960
Hey, man, you wanna buy me?

485
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,000
All of that's been bought by all you.

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Besides, he only costs five minutes.

487
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,120
And when shopping time is up,

488
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,480
all the products you just bought are flushed away down to the factories

489
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,540
to be recycled and back on the shelves by tomorrow.

490
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,300
It's even better looking inside.

491
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,840
And the

492
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,920
The

493
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,760
The

494
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,180
The

495
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,720
The

496
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:47,780
The

497
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:47,780


498
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:47,780


499
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,720
The The product shop

500
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,700
is the street store Vin strong just

501
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,320
No customers!

502
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,980
No, that's no good!

503
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,820
Some Tile

504
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,740
Eulogies

505
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:19,740


506
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:19,860
He wants to know what's up.

507
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,240
You've never heard my main audience, right?

508
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:30,360
I'm sure you know too.

509
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:30,980
What about the shirt?

510
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:30,980


511
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:30,980


512
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,860
You're looking inside.

513
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,380
You're looking inside.

514
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:25,060
You're looking inside.

515
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,500
You're looking inside.

516
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,000
You're looking inside.

517
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,380
You're looking inside.

518
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:30,420
You're looking inside.

519
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,140
is a result of the women's law.

520
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,300
It's even sadder on the inside.

521
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,900
A nice break from the old media barrage there

522
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,940
by our young friend Reverend Negative

523
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,040
and the late great Reverend Just John

524
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,420
who boarded the saucers last year

525
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,780
or earlier this year.

526
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,460
Actually, I think Just John started that piece

527
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,620
and Reverend Negative added to it.

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,660
I used several very weird and cool-sounded pieces

529
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,480
of Just John's music on my microbe porn videos

530
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,740
of 2009 or so,

531
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,640
which are on my YouTube channel.

532
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,860
He was fairly old, but his death seemed sudden.

533
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,420
There's been a lot of that going around.

534
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,100
Anyway, on a cheerier note,

535
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,760
back to media barrage number...

536
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,280
Number four.

537
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,820
You can take those records and run them backwards

538
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,580
and you can hear Satan talking on there.

539
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,000
So I want you to realize

540
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,400
that we're in a crooked and perverse nation.

541
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,260
When I see and read and hear on the news

542
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,100
that 65% of our teenage girls in school today

543
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,800
become pregnant

544
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,860
and the other just happen not to get caught,

545
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,180
well, then,

546
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,720
I know we're in a crooked and perverse nation.

547
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,500
The judgments of God is going to fall upon this nation.

548
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,300
An angel come and stood right over my head

549
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,380
and I heard that angel singing,

550
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,420
there's a nation that stands in the judgment.

551
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,720
There is a nation that has forgotten God.

552
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,080
Sin is the grave.

553
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,560
Sin is a...

554
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,820
is a...

555
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,620
uh...

556
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,900
uh...

557
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,300
uh...

558
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,420
it's...

559
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:29,660
it's...

560
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:29,760
it's...

561
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,200
it's...

562
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,040
it stands in disgrace.

563
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,480
America has forgotten God.

564
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,580
If you love Bob, come with me.

565
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,620
Yes, that was a wonderful number

566
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,960
by our orchestra organist, Raymond Price,

567
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,680
here on the Bob Hour.

568
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,300
Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen.

569
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,740
We're glad to have you here.

570
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,060
My wife, Zelma.

571
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:01,980
I'm a good boy.

572
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,120
Our dog, Snavely.

573
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,200
Our dog, Snavely.

574
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,200


575
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,980
Did you tell him about Bob?

576
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,220
Okay, sit down, everybody.

577
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,060
Can you hear me?

578
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,020
Can you hear me out there?

579
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,700
Yeah, yeah, I think it's time for a song.

580
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,020
Ladies and gentlemen, do you want to hear a song?

581
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,740
Bob sucks!

582
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,120
Crop his ass

583
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,080
Kill him

584
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,980
Goon squad

585
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,600
No a normal day

586
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,740
Well we've done it

587
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,140
We've let loose the dogs of war

588
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,460
I wonder

589
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,660
How they'll destroy us

590
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,620
We'll see you next time

591
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,760
Bye

592
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,940
You two act like it was the end of the world

593
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,320
Well it could be

594
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,440
But we will return to enjoy

595
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,520
Your final

596
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:29,760
Battle

597
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,140
Moment

598
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,260
Your commentator Jonathan Mathias

599
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,400
With another bulletin

600
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,920
And now as the Sino-Russian border war

601
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,660
Continues to rapidly escalate

602
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,780
U.S. authorities are beginning to question

603
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,960
To what degree we will become involved

604
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,780
In what could swiftly grow into global conflict

605
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,220
Abort firings

606
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,280
Abort firings

607
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,740
Interception will fragment

608
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,100
Facili-carrying missiles

609
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,760
Revealing

610
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,060
Abort firings

611
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,320
Abort firings

612
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,860
Abort firings

613
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,720
Interception will fragment

614
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,900
Facili-carrying missiles

615
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,480
Tonight's presentation on the beach was of course fiction

616
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,320
All Americans share the common desire that a nuclear holocaust will never happen

617
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,820
And certainly an alert, prepared America is our greatest safeguard in a nuclear age

618
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,980
I really don't know because I don't know the situation neither does the American people

619
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,640
Our current policy is that we do not launch until we are under attack

620
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:29,760
And that is our primary goal

621
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,040
Now the danger of that policy today is the Soviets can deliver their missiles with such

622
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,480
accuracy that they'll be able to knock out in a matter of relatively few seconds all

623
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,620
of our ability to retaliate against the rest of the Soviet missiles.

624
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,800
Range two miles, missile still deflecting.

625
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,380
Range one mile, missile detonated.

626
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:48,860
All attack!

627
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:59,740
If a true alarm sounded, most of our defenses would be alerted and within ten minutes, the

628
00:34:59,740 --> 00:34:59,740


629
00:34:59,740 --> 00:34:59,960
Soviets would be ready to fire.

630
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,100
And in just ten minutes, many of our jets would be in flight, headed for their targets.

631
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,440
Yet under a lifting law, only the president could give the final order to fire our nuclear

632
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,160
warheads.

633
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,920
Airborne at the time, as part of a special exercise we were holding called Operation

634
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,580
Dropkick.

635
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:23,680
Now it appears that the order called for the planes to attack their targets inside Russia

636
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,200
with an average load of 40 megatons each.

637
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,720
General Turgidson, I find this very difficult.

638
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:29,720


639
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:29,720


640
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,240
I was under the impression that I was the only one in authority to order the use of

641
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,000
nuclear weapons.

642
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,680
That's right, sir.

643
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,300
You are the only person authorized to do so.

644
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,680
And although I hate to judge before all the facts are in, it's beginning to look like

645
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,500
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

646
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,720
And my little 11-year-old child, I think his mentality is much more alert than this 16-year-old

647
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:55,940
boy.

648
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,400
The point is, stupidity is all around us.

649
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,720
And if you don't believe me, you're not going to get it.

650
00:35:59,720 --> 00:35:59,720


651
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,020
And it's not worth getting upset about.

652
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,320
It is not a thing a sane man would do.

653
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,200
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.

654
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,340
But surely you can disarm it somehow.

655
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,900
No, it is designed to explode if any attempt is ever made to un-trigger it automatically.

656
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,340
It's an obvious commie trick, Mr. President.

657
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,460
We're wasting valuable time.

658
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,580
Look at the big war.

659
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,360
We're getting ready to clobber us.

660
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,760
Is money more important than people's lives?

661
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,100
And in their pursuit for private interests, a lot of chemical companies will not accept

662
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,720
legal or legal aid.

663
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


664
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


665
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


666
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


667
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


668
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,720


669
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,840
It's an even more moral responsibility for the results of chemical waste pollution until

670
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,580
absolute proof shows that a specific chemical from a specific plant caused a specific disease.

671
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,680
The treatment you receive when you do business with these industry giants, it's frequently

672
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,320
frustrating.

673
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,200
And to make matters worse, they don't seem to care.

674
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,400
You won't find this attitude at Bill King's Breco.

675
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,840
Well, I'll tell you what, everything I figure is a hazard.

676
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,580
It progresses as the years go on, and eventually we'll never be able to control it.

677
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,720
If you take a look at the chemical waste pollution, you'll see that it's not just a chemical

678
00:36:59,720 --> 00:36:59,720


679
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,060
waste pollution.

680
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


681
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


682
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


683
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


684
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


685
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,060


686
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:08,060
And if you look at those maps that show concentrations of various forms of cancer, you can pick out

687
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,800
the industrialized areas of America.

688
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,560
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

689
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,240
You've obviously never heard of Cabal Thorium-G.

690
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,680
No, what about it?

691
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,920
Cabal Thorium-G has a radioactive half life of 93 years.

692
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,720
If you take, say, 50 H-bombs and 100 megatonnies, you'll never get the same amount of CO2 as

693
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:29,720


694
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,200
range and jacket them with cabal thorium g when they are exploded they will produce a doomsday

695
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:45,940
shroud a lethal cloud of radioactivity which will encircle the earth for 93 years what a load of

696
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,820
calm no question we have a problem we all know that but that doesn't mean that we ought to change

697
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,140
the whole system we have find out where the problems are the character of the problems and

698
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,900
address them all i want is some help i don't want to be sitting out here and forgotten with poison

699
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,720
water that's all i asked is for some help state of michigan said there's nothing wrong with it

700
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,780
the epa come out and said there is something wrong the health department michigan later sends

701
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,420
me a letter saying it's all right there's nothing wrong with your water you can drink it and if you

702
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:25,780
don't think that doesn't scare a mother to find out that a boy is your name to your blood

703
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,860
when you notice only got one kidney believe me i've had it i cried all the way to the doctor's

704
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,160
office

705
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
waiting to explode

706
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,120
the

707
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:08,520
certain changes have been taking place here such as the increase in the beatnik

708
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:18,960
crowd and the increase of uh the drugs that's uh used and distributed by the beatniks

709
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,020
you can save america and that's change every person one at a time by the power of all my

710
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:34,720
god working in that corruption the gates of hell was governed because in bible times government

711
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,160
said at the gates of the city yes the bible says the gates of hell shall not prevail there's no

712
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,300
question about it we are going to see the most tremendous turn of events not only in this nation

713
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:55,980
it's going to affect the whole world peace did hitler say next move czechoslovakia there are a

714
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:05,820
few beatniks in berkeley i'm sure from what you folks hear you would think that the population in

715
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:18,060
berkeley is really becoming beatnik like all the time well the percentage of them is increasing

716
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:25,960
a bit but with this movie actor getting into the governor's

717
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:34,120
chair ronald regan from hollywood i think that he's going to tame them down a little bit

718
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,620
may i close on a personal note i was asked once in a press interview what book i would

719
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,760
choose if i were shipwrecked on an island and could have only one book for the rest of my life

720
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:55,220
i replied that i knew of only one book that could be read and re-read and continue to be a challenge

721
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,080
so i'm going to tell you that i'm going to be reading a book called the bible the old and new

722
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:06,100
testament i can only add to that my friends that i continue to look to the scriptures today for

723
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:14,100
fulfillment and for guidance indeed it is an incontrovertible fact that all the complex and

724
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:21,560
horrendous questions confronting us at home and worldwide have their answer in that single book

725
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,840
God gave us a purpose.

726
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,160
God put us here for some reason.

727
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,400
Everything that we do here is aimed at the next world or it ought not to be done.

728
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,100
You who are pastors, who have been chosen by God Almighty to lead,

729
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,480
we are talking about Christianizing America.

730
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:55,720
We are talking about simply spreading the gospel in a political context.

731
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,820
Rape is kind of like the weather.

732
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,780
If it's inevitable, relax and enjoy it.

733
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,840
Clayton Williams.

734
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:08,540
If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down.

735
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,020
Todd Akin.

736
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,420
Rape victims should make the best of a bad situation.

737
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,140
Rick Santorum.

738
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,120
Even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape,

739
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,420
it is something that God intended to happen.

740
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,240
Richard Murdoch.

741
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,720
In the emergency,

742
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,960
they have what's called rape kits where a woman can get cleaned out.

743
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,600
Jodi Lobenberg.

744
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,500
If not for rape and incest, would there be any population left?

745
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,000
Steve King.

746
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,600
She was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute.

747
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,460
Students should show up in proper attire.

748
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,400
Kathleen Pasadomo said this about an 11-year-old girl gang-raped in Texas by 18 men.

749
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,900
If a woman has the right to an abortion,

750
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,960
why shouldn't a man be able to have a child?

751
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,120
David

752
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,140
And if a woman has the right to an abortion,

753
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,140
why shouldn't a man be able to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman.

754
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,780
At least the rapist's pursuit of sexual freedom doesn't in most cases result in any one's death.

755
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,380
Lawrence Lachman.

756
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,700
What is the value of that life?

757
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,700
And is it subordinate to the values of its host child?

758
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,300
Jose Oliva.

759
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,240
My friend, God almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew for how in the world can

760
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,500
God get the prayer of a man who says Jesus Christ is not the true Messiah.

761
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,800
It is blasphemous.

762
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,420
we need to bring the world to the foot of the cross.

763
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,400
And we have been dealing with and showing who these people were

764
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,940
and telling you that they were representatives of all the 12 tribes of Israel

765
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:51,180
who were, without a question, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, kindred peoples

766
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,780
because that's the true Israel of the Bible.

767
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,220
That's who the true, true Israel of the Bible is.

768
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,820
I shall go down in history as the greatest German.

769
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:09,160
In your word, you have said all no-whites, meaning all non-whites, I suppose,

770
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,380
are Satan's children.

771
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,080
You have said that they are devil worshippers who feed their children to crocodiles,

772
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,620
which makes you sound like a white Muslim.

773
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,100
Well, whatever it makes me sound like, sir,

774
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,860
these things that I base the arguments upon the difference of race

775
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,100
is from a biblical standpoint.

776
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,060
We're not associated with them.

777
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,820
We like to think of ourselves as the ultimate minority,

778
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,840
the subgeniuses, the final organization,

779
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,360
the most understood minority.

780
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,880
They don't take us seriously, and rightfully so.

781
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,240
What happens if they cross us?

782
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,280
You know, maybe we pray or something.

783
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,540
Most often we don't.

784
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,080
We don't know about it.

785
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,480
We are in this until the Lord himself comes back and rescues all of us.

786
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,720
All right, cut him off.

787
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,560
Leave him on.

788
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,860
Am I still on the air?

789
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,660
If this is how he wants to go out, this is how he wants to go out.

790
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,800
I don't have a way to say it, except that I just went out of booze.

791
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:06,540
Yeah.

792
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,160
Look, Mr. Schumacher's right here.

793
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,760
Do you want to talk to him?

794
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,780
Booze is all the reasons we give for living.

795
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,160
And if we can't think of any reasons of our own, we always have the God.

796
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,460
Holy Mary.

797
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,180
We don't know about all this pointless.

798
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,440
Pain, humiliation, and decay.

799
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,700
So there better be someone somewhere who does know.

800
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,960
That's the God.

801
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,560
He's saying that life is bulls**t.

802
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,240
And it is.

803
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,400
So what are you screaming about?

804
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,840
Man is a noble creature that's all in his own world.

805
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,700
Who needs God?

806
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,080
Well, if there's anybody out there that can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in

807
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,440
and tell me that man is a noble creature,

808
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,840
believe me, that man is full of bulls**t.

809
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,920
What's so damn funny?

810
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,000
I can't help it.

811
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:46,960
It's funny.

812
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,940
I don't have anything.

813
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,360
Thanks.

814
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,960
This is going out live to 67.

815
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,860
I don't have any tits.

816
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,920
Leave him on.

817
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,640
And I was married for 33 years of shrill, shrieking fraud.

818
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,920
Mr. Hackett's trying to get through to you.

819
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,740
Tell Mr. Hackett to go f**k himself.

820
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,400
So I don't have any bulls**t left.

821
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,880
I just ran out of it, you see.

822
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:31,960
No, I don't.

823
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


824
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


825
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


826
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


827
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


828
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


829
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


830
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,960


831
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:31,980
So I have to wait in нарrear and talk to her.

832
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


833
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


834
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


835
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


836
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:31,980


837
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,040


838
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,040


839
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,040


840
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,040


841
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:32,040


842
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,840
A crisis.

843
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:37,860
Maybe haven't seen the next basicㅎㅎ

844
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,720
But we'll never know

845
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,020
Empty blackness is too vast

846
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,460
For our lonely telecast

847
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,940
Scan the sky

848
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,500
Hail the stars

849
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,860
Hey nice try

850
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,420
It's too far

851
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,080
Take the best of what we are

852
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,020
Aim it at some

853
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
Distant star

854
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,560
Post a selfie

855
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,660
To the void

856
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,340
Of the world that we destroyed

857
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,860
Endless night

858
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,320
No one hears

859
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,620
Flash of light

860
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,740
Disappears

861
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,740
M оn thisよね

862
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,760
Tell us what's ours

863
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,580
It won't help

864
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,120
It's just a war

865
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,120


866
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:29,880
Who can tell us

867
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:37,400
The same

868
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,360
A nice try

869
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,000
It's too far

870
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,300
Endless night

871
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,880
No one hears

872
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,800
Flash of light

873
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,560
Disappears

874
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,220
The Big Selfie

875
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:43,040
Cuts from the first times that Dr. Drummond and I were guests on Dallas radio shows

876
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:52,780
We are talking with Reverend Ivan Stang and the good Dr. Philo Drummond from the Church of the subgenius

877
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,020
and guys we've been getting a lot of phone calls that people do not think you guys are real

878
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,220
Well we're dead serious, this is all too real George

879
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,660
It really is, I mean, you have stacks of pamphlets here, some incredible reading matter

880
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,540
That could be added a song.

881
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,940
We just want to emphasize that if you call in, we'll give you the post office box number,

882
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:18,240
and for a mere dollar, something you would drop out of your pocket and not even worry about picking up,

883
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,560
you can get more reading matter than you could read in two days' time.

884
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,080
And even then, you wouldn't comprehend it all.

885
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,900
Ten years from now, our pamphlets will take the place of Federal Reserve currency.

886
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,560
That might be the way things have been going.

887
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,920
You can get those pieces of paper that Bob sends from P.O. Box.

888
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,680
I'm going to read that number again to you folks.

889
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:47,220
P.O. Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043

890
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,800
You can leave off the zip code, but send that dollar.

891
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:58,680
That's right, and we'll return to you this tiny, tiny little book that we call it.

892
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,080
It's called The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die.

893
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,160
And that donation.

894
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,500
Thank you.

895
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:10,160
I may say solely goes to cover the cost of printing and mailing.

896
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,640
That's exactly right.

897
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,060
We only use that dollar to fight the conspiracy with their own weapon.

898
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,900
I mean, we're fighting fire with fire.

899
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,120
And that dollar, it's sure it's buying some paper, but it ain't the paper that you're getting.

900
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,640
It ain't the words you're reading that's important.

901
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,620
It's the feeling.

902
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,560
It's the power that comes out of Bob.

903
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,840
You're here right now for the power of a miracle.

904
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,920
God drives that tumor out of the power.

905
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,040
The power.

906
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,420
The power.

907
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,800
The power.

908
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:39,360


909
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,120
The power.

910
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,260
The power.

911
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:48,620
We're on the air with Mr. Opinion and the founders of the Subgenius Foundation.

912
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,600
Well, Mr. Opinion, I want to talk to the founders.

913
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,420
Yes.

914
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,080
I think this is terrific.

915
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,180
This is what we need.

916
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,400
Well, thank you.

917
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,840
Ma'am, we feel that people out there have had about all they can stand.

918
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,540
And it's up to us to finally do something about it.

919
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,220
I think so.

920
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:12,460
And I have a billion dollars that I haven't been using.

921
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:19,060
And I thought maybe, now, where do we want to go to establish all this?

922
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,920
Well, with your billion dollars, you can either buy a billion pamphlets from us,

923
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:31,320
which you can also pick those up, by the way, at Earth Base Bookstore at Oak Lawn and Lemon

924
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,640
and at a place called Remember When.

925
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,840
Or you could also buy your own Church of the Subgenius.

926
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,220
Clench all your own.

927
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,020
And, uh...

928
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:51,260
Well, isn't it also true that the Klan has a money-making system of a few people at the top,

929
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:55,480
and they make these people buy these sheets, and they're now more of an elaborate robe,

930
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,720
and it's a pretty money-making scheme.

931
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:57,980
That is not true.

932
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,760
And I bet you can feel that warm, that warm feeling building up in your wallet.

933
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,380
A little bit?

934
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:03,680
Yeah.

935
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,660
Can you feel the Bob energy coming through your wallet?

936
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,500
Yes, it makes those little dollars on that chopper jump right out of your back pocket and help Bob.

937
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,660
So I think, uh, I think now that we've got a very large congregation here,

938
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,740
we ought to go around and ask people just what Bob has done for you.

939
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,380
I want you to think about what...

940
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:28,900
Just make a quick testimonial, a short testimonial about what Bob has done since he came into your life.

941
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,000
Uh, Swami?

942
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,300
Hey, Bert.

943
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,320
Well...

944
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:31,940
Oh, here we...

945
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,760
No, no, no, I ain't coming, Bert.

946
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,160
Well, I had some impure thoughts this weekend.

947
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,440
Oh, I understand.

948
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,440
And, uh, well, I soiled the bed sheets last night,

949
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,440
and I think that Bob definitely had a hand in that somewhere.

950
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,760
Oh, friends, Bob can make them dreams come true.

951
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:51,940
Certainly.

952
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

953
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:00,960
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ since I've been listening to it.

954
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,380
Who?

955
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,100
I am just a...

956
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,740
I am...

957
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,780
I'm thoroughly ashamed of KFJZ right now.

958
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,680
You know, I'm getting, uh, strong trance indications from this man that he was the...

959
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,360
the high liar of Baghdad at one time.

960
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,460
I don't...

961
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,840
I'm not interested in you, I'm just...

962
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,680
In your past life?

963
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,700
I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick program that you're putting on here.

964
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,700
What? That's...

965
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,080
Well...

966
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,980
KFJZ as of now, this is terrible.

967
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,160
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?

968
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,420
I don't think so.

969
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:33,880
People...

970
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,080
I mean, yeah, people, you know.

971
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,220
But not, uh, not this is... this is the most famous thing I've ever heard of.

972
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,640
Welcome home, Virgil!

973
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,480
Welcome home, son!

974
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:45,900
Uh, I'm home!

975
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,900
But where are the aluminum people?

976
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,440
They're here, too!

977
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,400
Here?

978
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,320
Don't be afraid, son.

979
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,620
They're a part of you now, and you're a part of them!

980
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,300
But I'm all mixed up!

981
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,860
It's part of the photonic-verbonic plan!

982
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,780
Wow!

983
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,520
Are you my real father?

984
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,040
Am I your real father?

985
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,660
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

986
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,160
Homo!

987
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,860
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

988
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,400
Homo!

989
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,060
Ham!

990
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,440
Ham!

991
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:20,920
Ham!

992
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,000
Ham!

993
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,020
Ham!

994
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,740
Ham!

995
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,000
Ham!

996
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,040
Ham!

997
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,660
Ham!

998
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:27,660


999
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,620
How would I describe the world of the future?

1000
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,960
Oh, it's safe.

1001
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,840
Complex, very complex, and...

1002
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,100
Well, it's imaginary.

1003
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,340
It's clean.

1004
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,100
Oh, and above all, it's funny, and...

1005
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,260
Well, sure, it has its drawbacks,

1006
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,100
but, well, nobody's perfect.

1007
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,600
And so we bid fond farewell to the future

1008
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,180
and that romantic and cosmopolitan end of the rainbow.

1009
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,240
Like the wonderful pages of a storybook

1010
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,720
filled with the glorious living pictures of tomorrow.

1011
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,220
It's all we have to look forward to,

1012
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,820
and it probably has a place for you.

1013
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm so famous!

1014
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,640
Mr. Camera, don't leave yet.

1015
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,520
Look, we know we aren't fooling you.

1016
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,960
You people probably think this world looks real bad or something.

1017
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,480
Well, you're probably laughing at us

1018
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,900
because it's so obvious and exaggerated.

1019
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,820
Well, of course it is.

1020
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,920
See, that's what so Arkansane about it.

1021
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,300
We're laughing back at you.

1022
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,800
See, we're here in the future,

1023
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,880
and you, you're there in the past.

1024
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,460
And he who laughs last...

1025
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,920
See you soon.

1026
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,340
Now, children, it's time for recess.

1027
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,640
Please roll up your sleeves.

1028
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,660
Hold it a minute, folks.

1029
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,780
Listen to Charlie Muggs.

1030
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,160
I've been listening to that stuff.

1031
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:35,980
That's no good.

1032
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,500
That's bozo talk.

1033
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,100
If you want to know what the future's really like,

1034
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,540
put some money in Mr. D. Smith's pocket

1035
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,220
because he's got what it takes.

1036
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,020
And we're going to bring you the future just like it is

1037
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,660
because in the next show, I'm the hero.

1038
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,580
The future show is going to bring you Charlie Muggs

1039
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,780
and I know what it's all about

1040
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,180
because, brother, I've been around.

1041
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,640
My friend, it is not God and country.

1042
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,580
It's God.

1043
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,160
It's God.

1044
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:40,820
Put your hands on the radio.

1045
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,020
Put your hands on the radio.

1046
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,380
Put your hands on the radio.

1047
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,220
And that's subgenius.

1048
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,900
Dot com.
