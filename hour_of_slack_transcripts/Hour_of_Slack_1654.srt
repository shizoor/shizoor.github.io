Uh, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:40,320
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except that actually it's not, uh, the whole first, uh, half will be, uh, uh,

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:53,740
largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for, uh, the holidays and holy days and, uh, uh, the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:05,540
Uh, actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling! Selling, yes! Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs!

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,340
But, uh, uh, anyway, uh, happy, uh, whatever you do.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:18,340
And, uh, uh, yes, this music in the background is, uh, somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

38
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,380
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,380
It's cool, man, cool! And, uh, praise Bob and, uh, ho-ho-ho-ho!

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:58,640
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
Oh, no!

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,860
Oh, no!

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,100
Oh, no!

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,900
Oh, no!

45
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,400
Oh, no!

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,400

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,400


57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,980
Oh, no!

58
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,220
Who put the stomp in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp? Who tuck and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a ding-dong?

59
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,820
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop? Who put the stick up my hip-tip-tip-tip?

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:31,700
Who was that man? He shoved it up my can and left me stranded on this Christmas tree.

61
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,220
Yeah!

62
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,060
Will you stop it?

63
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Woo!

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,120
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,540
Woo!

66
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:39,980
Woo!

67
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:39,980


68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:39,980


69
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:39,980


70
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:39,980


71
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:39,980


72
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:49,240
When this angel heard chop-a-pop-a-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop, a dreadful fear went right into my heart.

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Those pine-tree needles sting me â€“ ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-ring-a-ding-dong!

74
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,460
You'll never know how much that smarts you could do.

75
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:01,980
So..

76
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,560
Sometimes.

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,800
Who took the stump and my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,480
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-she-boop-she-boop?

80
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,120
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip?

81
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,940
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush?

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please.

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,020
I might squeeze him too tight.

84
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,640
It's that psychedelic time of the year.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,460
Do you know where your brain cells are?

86
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,580
It's already 9 p.m.

87
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him.

88
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,740
Don't go walking down to the bar,

89
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,640
because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.

90
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,240
I mean, in the apartment store.

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,260
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.

93
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,280
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

94
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,720
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed and back in my arm

95
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,360
the way it was.

96
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,980
Now, you boss be good,

97
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,400
and I'll give you some this here.

98
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,360
There can't be no good about it.

99
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,720
You ain't no good of a child.

100
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,500
That dog's run off with them brain cells.

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,060
Can you do something about that, boy?

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,840
I'm gonna have to.

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm gonna have to.

104
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

105
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,620
Eric Cranston! Eric Cranston! Eric Cranston! Eric Cranston!

106
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,680
What wing has manufactured Rosalia is fun.

107
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,760
The fate of a child.

108
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

109
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,940
Spend all the money you've got.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,600
The Christmas trough.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,720
I've lost my freaking mind.

112
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh, look, Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

113
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,500
Look at your eyes.

114
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,880
It's like a cowboy Santa.

115
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,480
How jolly.

116
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

117
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Boy, I really need one of those.

118
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit, though?

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

120
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,920
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

122
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,960
That's enough of that.

123
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

124
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,380
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,540
It's been increased in size to...

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

127
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,440
Look, it's swelling.

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,560
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

129
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,080
Come on.

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah.

132
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, those pills.

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

134
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,960
More pills.

135
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,880
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

137
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,420
I like to take the red one.

140
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,620
Oh, I like the red one.

141
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,440
I agree.

142
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,560
The blue one and the blue one, at the same time.

143
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
The warp mix is easy.

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,560
You...

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it!

147
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,880
Angels we have heard on high Singing about mountain dew

148
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,520
And those mountains in reply Saying we wish we had some, too

149
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

150
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,900
Wario, in excelsis Deo

151
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,940
Wario, in excelsis Deo

152
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,640
Barbie Dolls

153
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie

154
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,440
Barbie Dolls

155
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,160
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

156
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,980
They will empower us to resist them.

157
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,600
You will use your power.

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,600


159
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,840
Your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

160
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,680
It will be a BOMBER FOR KIDS.

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:22,760
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

162
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,220
Good has lots of muscles.

163
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,420
Good.

164
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Good!

165
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,600
The primitive earth.

166
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,600


167
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,340
The modern society should accept this value judgement.

168
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:52,620
Good will have free physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires, latent in children, brought out through the vehicle of this so-called

169
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,780
So far we're told these toys have germs.

170
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,960
Batteries not included.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,640
But there is a metaphor for them.

172
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,500
What is it that makes them shine?

173
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,140
The

174
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:05,140


175
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,040
The

176
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,340
The

177
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,360
The

178
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,300
The

179
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,540
The

180
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:14,820
The

181
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:14,880
The

182
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,160
The

183
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,160

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,160


186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,160


187
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,160


188
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,900
The

189
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,520
Angels We Have Heard on High

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,760
it was by The Philistines

191
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
the collage called All The Money You've Got

192
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,180
is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album

193
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,580
which you can get for free

196
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,560
that's obtuse

197
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,540
excuse me

198
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,160
next up The Real Story of Christmas

199
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,400
by Michael Shelley

200
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,260
Once upon a time

201
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,400
there was the baby Jesus

202
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,880
and he had two eyes made out of coal

203
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,120
and he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree

204
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,740
and he wanted his two front teeth

205
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,820
and he got McDonald's gift certificates

206
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,840
and he

207
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:17,940
he

208
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,140
he

209
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,300
had a dog named Santa's little helper

210
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,820
and he took all the presents from Whoville

211
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,040
and his friend Yukon Cornelius

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,620
came with the three wise guys

213
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,740
and he wanted to play the drums

214
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,340
and be the little drummer boy

215
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,520
but he couldn't

216
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,540
he wanted 10s and 20s

217
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,120
10s and 20s

218
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,520
and he got McDonald's gift certificates

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
and he got Zuzu's pedals

220
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,620
and he got Zuzu's pedals

221
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:48,620


222
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:48,620


223
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:48,700
and that's

224
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,880
The Real Story of Christmas

225
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,660
onitional

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,720
Heat

227
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:58,880
cold

228
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,640
before Andre

229
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,640


230
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,300
seems like a white Ð¾Ð½

231
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,580
an egg

232
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,200
if only he wasn't

233
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,860
Tell him I am

234
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,760
careful

235
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,300
the truth

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,980
or his baby is all wrong

237
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,880
Our Sweetonster

238
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,900
Da-da-da-da-da-da

239
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,600
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

240
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,480
So separate, it's so separate, it's so separate

241
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,180
New from Tonka

242
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,680
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob

243
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal

244
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

245
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,040
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy

246
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,120
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool

247
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,220
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, janger device

248
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,500
All I got is a fightin' Jesus and other action figures sold separately

249
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
Some assembly required, batteries not included

250
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,320
This toy falls apart in three days

251
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,980
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe

252
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,400
Too much is always better than not enough

253
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:11,180
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message

254
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,940
Santa Claus

255
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas

256
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,180
He wanted an electric train

257
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
He had the whole thing on his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up

258
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,540
He could picture the whole thing and he would dream so far that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes

259
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,520
He was a pretty strong wisher

260
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,200
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars

261
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,520
He-Buber

262
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,360
and the station

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
and the gatemen

264
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,160
AnimalQuest

265
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,160


266
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,960
The Mozart Tower

267
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,260
And all the wonderful kinds of equipment and accessories

268
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,300
So grand, you might think that Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist

269
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,680
anyway

270
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,620
don't forget to follow us 4 comparison

271
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,200
a.k.a the Game of Thrones

272
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

273
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,700
It is turnover.

274
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

275
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

276
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,620
Oh, yeah.

277
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

278
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,220
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

279
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

280
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

281
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:26,560
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

282
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,780
Oh, yes.

283
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,560
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

284
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,880
And it was something else in between there.

285
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:41,660
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

286
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,440
But I think they started to war over it.

287
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,900
But I think they started to war over it.

289
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:49,900


290
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:49,900


291
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,860
But do you want me to?

292
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,920
All I know is you're gone.

293
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,620
When you trust your heart.

294
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,140
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

295
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,360
Because we're gone.

296
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,260
But do you want me to?

297
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,200
Yeah, it's too much fun.

298
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,000
All I know is you're gone.

299
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,500
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

300
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,460
So Santa has to sell.

301
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,320
Santa.

302
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,040
Santa Claus.

303
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:45,380
Santa Claus.

304
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Just be

305
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,560
B

306
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:47,560


307
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,220
riction

308
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,240
B

309
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,240


310
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
Secret

311
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,460
The

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,000
Secretary

313
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,460
Hi?

314
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,020
Friends, try to imagine

315
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,460
somewhere in the snowy north,

316
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
the Santibob trudging mindlessly

317
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,500
through the Himalayan snows,

318
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,980
driven by strange forces

319
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,940
to complete his nameless errand.

320
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,680
And he may show up at your house, my friend,

321
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
if you've been a bad subgenius

322
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,810
or a halfway subgenius,

323
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,010
or if we keep getting tangled up

324
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,070
in these other shows

325
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,430
and having strange microphones.

326
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,650
How did that paternity suit ever turn out

327
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,150
between Dobbs and Santa?

328
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,330
And who?

329
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,450
His dad.

330
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,550
Santa dog.

331
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,310
I don't know.

332
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,110
I don't think it was...

333
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,150
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,

334
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,430
St. Nicholas punched another bishop

335
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,250
in the nose and bloodied his nose.

336
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,110
Really?

337
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:42,530
Really?

338
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,050
The historian?

339
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,650
The historical St. Nicholas?

340
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,650
Over the trinity of God.

341
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,830
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

342
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,690
I swear upon Bob.

343
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,730
Who the hell is God?

344
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,790
The heart.

345
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,830
I can tell you, I said God.

346
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,470
Who the hell is God?

347
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,150
Who the hell is God?

348
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,130
Ask Dobbs one day.

349
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,870
That's the question we should be asking.

350
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,070
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere

351
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,710
on that bright, sunny day.

352
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,690
Bob did a backflip,

353
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,130
and from that day on,

354
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,470
he too was a believer.

355
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,010
And from the snow didn't stop.

356
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,610
A little child bearing flowers emerged.

357
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,990
And Chip, Chip, what else was on the table?

358
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,030
Each one a dirty flower.

359
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,950
It's the St. Nicholas.

360
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,370
Sip, sicken.

361
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,870
The historical Santa Claus

362
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,730
is originally lived,

363
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,630
as the caller knows,

364
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,450
as a bishop in,

365
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,270
was it Constantinople?

366
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,190
Yeah, like one of those...

367
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,130
It was in ancient Byzantium.

368
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,390
Yeah, like one of those...

369
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,270
Like a cafeteria or...

370
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,910
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

371
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,410
Yes, he was...

372
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,710
And he was known for

373
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,730
sneaking into the rooms of young women

374
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,670
and leaving gifts.

375
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,510
Life-size lumps of gold

376
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,830
complete with a fake beard

377
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,990
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

378
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,410
A saint he was, the girl said.

379
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,130
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

380
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,710
You got it, brother.

381
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,710
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

382
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,870
You got it, brother.

383
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,310
They were sleeping.

384
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,290
He knew when they were awake.

385
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,030
You got it, brother.

386
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,810
But like the CIA, he was...

387
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:19,250
That's Foucault, baby.

388
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,470
He was protecting them.

389
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,510
Foucault knew that St. Nick

390
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,670
was a creeping, stinking spy.

391
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,190
What?

392
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,730
He knows when you've been sleeping.

393
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,250
He knows what you've been eating.

394
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,170
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

395
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,210
And who keeps that belief alive

396
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,190
in their fevered, sick little brain?

397
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,410
Madison Avenue, of course.

398
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,550
No, the surveillance community

399
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,910
is under your direction.

400
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,810
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

401
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,970
He's a very powerful being.

402
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,590
If you're bad, he punishes you.

403
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,330
If you're good, he rewards you.

404
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,370
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus

405
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,870
walking the earth.

406
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,790
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

407
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,810
He rewards those who knows when they're smiling

408
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,470
when they're awake.

409
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,350
I think, really, if you want to make a deal,

410
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,390
you have to do it with, you know...

411
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,190
Could Dr. Claus, in fact, be the

412
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,350
wandering, quote, milkman

413
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,290
rumored to have fathered

414
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,890
our savior, J.R. Bob Dodds?

415
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,690
Well, we find it very likely.

416
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,610
Possibility from the falsified documents

417
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,430
we have here.

418
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,350
And also the fluffy beard

419
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,170
that often grew on Bob's feet.

420
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,950
You better watch out.

421
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,430
You better not.

422
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,270
You better not.

423
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,450
And I'm telling you why.

424
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,230
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

425
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:04,190
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

426
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:20,870
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

427
00:22:45,330 --> 00:23:03,950
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

428
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,510
Material plums? Biological agents who only take 15%?

429
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,730
Oh, it's a great day, all right. A salute to Mr. and Mrs. America.

430
00:23:52,650 --> 00:24:00,670
Shop as usual. Shop as usual. Shop as usual. And avoid panic buying.

431
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,830
Shop as usual. Shop as usual.

432
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,550
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

433
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,990
Santa Claus is real. Santa Claus is real. Santa Claus is real. Santa Claus is real. Santa Claus is real.

434
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,650
You're the cause for the child.

435
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,130
Who's the head man?

436
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,530
Santa Claus.

437
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,470
Santa Claus.

438
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,050
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

439
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,990
He was so real.

440
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,170
How come we didn't get scared?

441
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,070
He was like Walt last year.

442
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,810
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan on July 4th.

443
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,690
And now you can have it all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

444
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:27,770
The birth of our baby Satan as told by various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

445
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,390
Including that announcer.

446
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,990
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

447
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,790
An announcement.

448
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,230
of the blessed anointing and birthday of our Lord,

449
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:38,930
Zinu.

450
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,190
Zinu.

451
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,010
Praise Zinu.

452
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,970
For one bright Christmas morning,

453
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,570
Zinu was born in a cradle to a rich man's family.

454
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,010
The Rave Jesus.

455
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,750
Oh, I know the Rave Jesus.

456
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,630
I'm partying with the Rave Jesus.

457
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,970
I owe a soul a merry little Christmas.

458
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:15,590
I owe a soul a merry little Christmas.

459
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,210
Let your sight be light

460
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,370
from the water triples with the outer sky.

461
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,990
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

462
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,570
From now on we're miles away.

463
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,310
We're miles away.

464
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:56,690
Once a day as in olden days,

465
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,950
a happy golden day,

466
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,430
miles away.

467
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,170
Let's go.

468
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,870
Let your heart

469
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,730
be out of sight.

470
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,050
Out of sight.

471
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,810
The Jackson 5.

472
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,990
I wish everybody

473
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,570
a merry little Merry Christmas

474
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,650
and a gloomy, gloomy day.

475
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,710
From a mutated Christmas, friends,

476
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,750
the Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas

477
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,150
by No-Dash.com.

478
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,870
L. No. L.

479
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,170
Before that, some year-old ESO

480
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,310
and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

481
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:48,050
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

482
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,130
I'm playing a lot from that.

483
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,550
So check out www.triage.com

484
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,150
for that one also.

485
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:00,470
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

486
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,070
And now, the Jethro's.

487
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,850
Stephen, David, and Phil Philosophy Live.

488
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:05,850


489
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:05,850


490
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:05,850


491
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:05,850


492
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,730
Go.

493
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,110
OK.

494
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:24,970


495
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:24,970


496
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,330
That's a great view.

497
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,230
The nappy was body hot.

498
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,130
I'm out.

499
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,730
And the snow isEXICITING.

500
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,110
construction, and really cool.

501
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,250
Coming on Red Rubber Stang.

502
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,970
The Weir Bobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

503
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,830
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

504
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:50,110
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

505
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:57,550
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

506
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,730
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

507
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,230
Oh, friends, it's tough.

508
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,130
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

509
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,590
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

510
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:21,750
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

511
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,690
Can you believe that?

512
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:30,530
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

513
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,250
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

514
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,250
We can't afford that.

515
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,250
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

516
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,970
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

517
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,530
Let's be friends.

518
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,250
A cool message and a measure of joy.

519
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:10,250


520
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,870
Oh, boy.

521
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,750
Oh, boy.

522
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,410
Oh, boy.

523
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,290
I have to give games to the kids.

524
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,270
Oh, boy.

525
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,230
That's fair to give our kids.

526
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,930
Oh, boy.

527
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,190
And amazing.

528
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,870
More from Corporal Blossom.

529
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,510
I am really impressed by their editing work.

530
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:49,450
And that's on Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas

531
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,450
is on the Illegal Art label.

532
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,290
That's www.detritus.net

533
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,390
slash illegal art.

534
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,930
www.detritus.net slash illegal art.

535
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,170
And now, more Jethro's.

536
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,910
Jethro's.

537
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,010
Now you're blaming Jesus.

538
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,130
You're blaming our Lord.

539
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,050
I sort of understand because

540
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,770
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

541
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,950
There was no Jesus.

542
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,150
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

543
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,330
It's not that you don't want to.

544
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,730
It's that they won't let you.

545
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,870
No, they're ashamed.

546
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,570
Just a cry in the wilderness.

547
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,490
They're ashamed.

548
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,030
In the hot pursuit of wolves.

549
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,090
Everywhere.

550
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:22,990
In the background.

551
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,510
I'm ashamed of them.

552
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,790
It's cold.

553
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,530
I'm leaving that city life behind.

554
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,870
I can't get my finger off the paper.

555
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,010
I can't get my needle back in the pan, Jen.

556
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,150
Come on, cowboy.

557
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,450
No, man.

558
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,430
I was trying to hear a can against your tree

559
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,650
and it started whispering to me, man.

560
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,130
Oh, you've been drinking.

561
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,250
There's the face of the Madonna right up there.

562
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,730
There's the face of the Virgin Mary.

563
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,810
I swear to God, look at it.

564
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:51,930
Isn't it?

565
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,150
What?

566
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,110
It's her Christmas.

567
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,890
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

568
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:55,830
Wow.

569
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,890
A Christmas witch?

570
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:57,930
I'll be horny.

571
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,830
Oh, my God.

572
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,970
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more...

573
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,070
Her breasts are so cold.

574
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,270
I know she must be a true witch.

575
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,770
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing down.

576
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,890
She's surrounded by hovering Christmas ornaments.

577
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,050
It looks like a radar device.

578
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:12,590
What?

579
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:13,770
Yo.

580
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,810
Yo?

581
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,290
It's her.

582
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,150
What up?

583
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,010
Nothing.

584
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,030
What's up?

585
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,850
What a deep voice.

586
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,490
What's up?

587
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:21,690
For Christmas.

588
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,430
What's up?

589
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


590
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


591
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


592
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


593
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


594
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


595
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


596
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:22,430


597
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,390
What's up?

598
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,770
What's up?

599
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,930
What's up?

600
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,730
What's up?

601
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,990
What's up?

602
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,350
What's up?

603
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,490
Thank you.

604
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,530
Mother Mary, oh, blessed lady.

605
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,590
Hail, Mother Mary.

606
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,290
I fell in love with your son.

607
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,930
Hail, Mother Mary.

608
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,670
Turn me on and on and on.

609
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,290
Hail, Mother Mary.

610
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,930
Thank God for you and your son.

611
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,810
Right on, right on, right on, right on.

612
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,730
Right on.

613
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:18,390
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

614
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,670
Baby, I want to talk to you for this kiss.

615
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,790
Because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

616
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,770
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

617
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,370
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

618
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,370
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece and the health department made us take them down.

619
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,270
I remember my father well, you know.

620
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,090
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

621
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,230
He used to, you know what caused it then?

622
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,470
He used to put a...

623
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,730
He used to put a stocking cap on his head.

624
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,310
And put a knock light in front of it.

625
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,810
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

626
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,750
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

627
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,950
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

628
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:12,230
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.

629
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,290
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

630
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,190
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

631
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,470
They even come to questioning now.

632
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:28,050
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

633
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,050
Oh my God.

634
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:35,550
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy?

635
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,510
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?

636
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,670
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas?

637
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,050
Yes.

638
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,910
The Pilgrims for Babies?

639
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:48,830
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

640
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,110
It was a...

641
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,110
It was a...

642
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,470
It was a...

643
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,550
It was a...

644
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:51,650
It was a...

645
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:51,650


646
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:58,550
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

647
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,630
It was a...

648
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,530
When your little brother broke through the hole, it fell through a hole in the ice sling,

649
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,410
and you went and saved him.

650
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,190
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

651
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:16,470
It was a wonderful life back then.

652
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,810
I remember when Uncle Bud would come in with a keeter.

653
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,850
He would have candles, like most people have.

654
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,950
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.

655
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,130
But today, Christmas has lost its meaning.

656
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,250
He just beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

657
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:36,190
Scott, you made your choice.

658
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,650
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

659
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:48,770
And to your eternal soul, you have found that only could you afford to give to God that which was his.

660
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,050
Yes.

661
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,170
Yes.

662
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:49,790
Yes.

663
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


664
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


665
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


666
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


667
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


668
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


669
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


670
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


671
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


672
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


673
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


674
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


675
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:49,790


676
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,490
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

677
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,870
The Senate still stands.

678
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:02,330
You know, out of darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of feet...

679
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,530
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

680
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,790
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

681
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,030
Sir, no.

682
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,190
No.

683
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,050
Thank God I don't want to go to hell.

684
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,490
No.

685
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,110
No.

686
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:18,730
No.

687
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,610
The man is as alive as he could be.

688
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,070
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same.

689
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,430
You and me.

690
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,690
The tail bearer will be at the judgment.

691
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,710
To be continued...

692
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,370
The man's virgin birth.

693
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,490
And a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

694
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,410
Dare I ask it?

695
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,250
Yes.

696
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,970
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

697
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,570
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

698
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,950
The answer?

699
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,550
Yes, definitely.

700
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,170
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty

701
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,270
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

702
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,550
Merry Christmas to all!

703
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,470
Now you're all gonna die!

704
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,990
The night Santa went crazy.

705
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,530
The night Saint Nick went insane.

706
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,090
Realized he'd been getting the wrong heel.

707
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,450
Something finally must have snapped in his brain.

708
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,590
Well, the workshop is gone now.

709
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,610
He decided to bomb it.

710
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:13,510
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.

711
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,750
And he tied up his helpers.

712
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,450
And he held the elves hostage.

713
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:18,710
And he ground up...

714
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,270
And he put Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

715
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,490
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger.

716
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,510
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

717
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,170
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer.

718
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,190
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

719
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,550
The night Santa went crazy.

720
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,210
The night Kris Kringle went nuts.

721
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,710
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole.

722
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,710


723
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,870
Without stepping in reindeer guts.

724
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,290
There's the National Guard and the FBI.

725
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,530
There's a van from the eye with just news.

726
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,350
And helicopters circling round in the sky.

727
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,430
And the bullets are flying.

728
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,570
The body counts rising.

729
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,990
And everyone's dying to know who Santa was.

730
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,130
Santa was.

731
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,670
My, my, my, my, my, my, my.

732
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,130
You used to be such a jolly guy.

733
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,610
He knows when you're sleeping.

734
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,750
He knows when you're awake.

735
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,650
He knows when you've been found.

736
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,690
For good.

737
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,690
For the good.

738
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,890
For goodness sake.

739
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,730
You better watch out.

740
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,050
You better not cry.

741
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,510
You better not pout.

742
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:56,590
I'm telling you why.

743
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,030
Santa Claus is coming to town.

744
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,570
Santa Claus is coming to town.

745
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:18,110
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called Santa is Coming by F.B.

746
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,510
Gillespie and F.J. Coote.

747
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,910
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that.

748
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,310
But now.

749
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,130
Who gave the Lord the clap trap?

750
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,650
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

751
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,610
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

752
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,370
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

753
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:43,650
The time of the Lord.

754
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,710
How many before you reach your limit?

755
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:47,230
Jesus.

756
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,570
Jesuses?

757
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,990
Yeah, how many can you bag?

758
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,850
How many messiahs can you bag?

759
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:53,010
Jesuses.

760
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,390
If you're doing it in season.

761
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,650
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

762
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,330
Oh, you never do.

763
00:44:58,330 --> 00:44:59,310
And you can only take one.

764
00:44:59,530 --> 00:44:59,690
Yeah, but I mean.

765
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,590
You never bag the Lord in C. You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

766
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,090
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

767
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,310
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

768
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,390
Obviously.

769
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,250
We are between a rock and a hard place.

770
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,210
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very good gift?

771
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,210


772
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,210


773
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,210


774
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,210


775
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,210


776
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,470
He got a very, very hard foot and he got elephantiasis of the rectum.

777
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,670
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

778
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:25,590
Messy, messy, messy disease.

779
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,590
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was .

780
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,190
Well, I like the story.

781
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,350
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles,

782
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:36,910
you know, tames the West.

783
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,430
I like when he moves into a trailer park and the cowboys walk with his dog.

784
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,710
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

785
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,030
The ranger.

786
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,650
I like the Texas ranger.

787
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:47,050
Jesus.

788
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,170
Texas ranger.

789
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,190
Johnny Ripple was Jesus.

790
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,590
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

791
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,030
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

792
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:58,650
Man.

793
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,530
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

794
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,610
Well, what about old peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually Huron, a

795
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:08,930
Huron.

796
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,370
You didn't know that, did you?

797
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:10,970
I got you.

798
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:12,470
Jesus.

799
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,090
Elrond.

800
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,810
I got a Jesus and I can't think of no other Jesus.

801
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,030
Get in the club.

802
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


803
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


804
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


805
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


806
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


807
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


808
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


809
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


810
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,030


811
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:17,230
You got a Jesus?

812
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:17,270
And you know who it is?

813
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,270


814
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,270


815
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,170
I can't think of a better Jesus you've ever seen.

816
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,090
Oh, it tastes like butter.

817
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:19,870
A new Jesus.

818
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,050
A different Jesus.

819
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,570
It tastes like future Jesus.

820
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,870


821
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:23,870
A pat smoking Jesus.

822
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,230
A pat smoking Jesus.

823
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:29,730
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.

824
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:31,410
Go kick that window open.

825
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:32,370
I already kicked it.

826
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,410
I'll kick it again though.

827
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,950
Kick it good this time.

828
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:40,190
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

829
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,030
We hope that, we thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

830
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,010
We appreciate all that.

831
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,010


832
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,010


833
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,010


834
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,010


835
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,910
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

836
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,530
That's all.

837
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,650
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

838
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,770
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything.

839
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,630
Right, Jesus?

840
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,130
Right.

841
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,390
I could hear him say that.

842
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,970
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

843
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,010
Next topic.

844
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,150
Next topic.

845
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,390
Terrorist insurance.

846
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,370
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

847
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,390
And science.

848
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,090
That's the life of Brian, isn't it?

849
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,550
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

850
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,870
To the sounds of hell.

851
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:23,090
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

852
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:29,250
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

853
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:37,050
Wrapped in wrapping paper, we're gonna break our necks.

854
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:43,790
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

855
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:45,450
Sleigh.

856
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:47,410
Sleigh ride to heck.

857
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,050
Sleigh ride to heck.

858
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,870
Sleigh ride to heck.

859
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,150
The elves are full of cheer.

860
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,690
The kids are tucked in bed.

861
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,230
Santa ain't coming.

862
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,630
And we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

863
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,190
Their dreams are filled with toys.

864
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,710
But they're out of luck.

865
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:25,390
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to fuck.

866
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,970
Sleigh ride to heck.

867
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,670
Sleigh ride to heck.

868
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,570
Sleigh ride to heck.

869
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,470
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends.

870
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,450
From his new album.

871
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:46,970
Don't trust Whitey.

872
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:48,450
James Kochalka.

873
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,250
Superstar.

874
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,470
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith.

875
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:04,550
That he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob.

876
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,170
Stomping on a picture of Bob.

877
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,210
He'll do it himself.

878
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,630
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

879
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,350
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

880
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,870
Now we subgeni.

881
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,010
I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes.

882
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,450
But we subgeni may be bad.

883
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,790
But our way of bad is holy.

884
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:27,250
Is holy compared to the evil of so...

885
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,990
Not all, by any means.

886
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:32,610
But so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc.

887
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,870
In general, of course.

888
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:40,470
They and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.

889
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,850
If you ask me, are actually the ace of the devil's sword.

890
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,110
I believe.

891
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,370
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends.

892
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,970
Just like Jesus warned about.

893
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,490
I...

894
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,470
We're...

895
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,510
Jesus and Bob, like we say.

896
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,630
Our old drinking buddies.

897
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:54,950
Got nothing against Jesus.

898
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,870
It's just his fan club.

899
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:01,130
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

900
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,710
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief.

901
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,590
Just like you or me.

902
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,910
But the uptight rival cults.

903
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,650
They don't think God has a handkerchief.

904
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:10,030
Uh-uh.

905
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:10,230
No.

906
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,790
Because God's perfect.

907
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:13,550
He doesn't even sneeze.

908
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:14,830
We're made to believe.

909
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,690
We're made in his image.

910
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,530
Except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us.

911
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,750
And we have to go in the secret room.

912
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,190
The bathroom.

913
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,130
To do awful things.

914
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,390
But God, oh, he's clean and pure.

915
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,650
According to them.

916
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,490
Oh, and he's male.

917
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,190
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

918
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,330
Because we sinned.

919
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:35,650
Oh, yeah.

920
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,610
We all sinned.

921
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,390
We're bad.

922
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,190
We're worthless.

923
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:43,070
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

924
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,130
First off...

925
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,190
I interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

926
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:47,810
Return.

927
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,830
K-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

928
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:52,550
And then...

929
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:58,050
I start to think...

930
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:21,550
You can get yourself some sleep

931
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:46,590
Over the ancient god's head

932
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:55,070
Just like the ones I used to know

933
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:05,290
I'm going to some small room

934
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:11,350
And it should be the same

935
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:20,170
To be a man that's in the snow

936
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,530
I'm going to some small room

937
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,030
I'm going to some small room

938
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:36,490
I'm dreaming about the ancient god's head

939
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:44,490
When everyone can come back right

940
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:52,350
Name your days being

941
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,770
Shhh and short

942
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:12,790
And they all will be your gods and you are in this

By Fernanda Nande-Lemar

944
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:27,130
Oh, holy night

945
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:28,030
Who's singing in the night

946
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,050
The stars are brightly shining

947
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:35,330
It is the night of our dear saviour's birth

948
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,270
Long lay, long lay the world

949
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,910
In the air of fighting

950
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,790
The appeared and the stormed on its way

951
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,130
A thrill of hope

952
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,030
The weary world rejoices

953
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,490
The yonder grace

954
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,630
A new and glorious dawn

955
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:57,850
Fall on your knees

956
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:02,850
Oh, hear the angel voices

957
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:06,390
Oh, night divine

958
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:11,090
Oh, night when Christ was born

959
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:19,230
Oh, night, oh, night divine

960
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:27,610
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice

961
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:27,830
A groovy little solstice

962
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:27,830


963
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,410
Myth rose one year's fight

964
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:36,930
Myth rose one year's fight

965
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,250
Oh, ho, ho

966
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:38,890
He, he, he

967
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,790
Oh, ho, ho

968
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,390
Come on, come on

969
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,490
It's t-bomb

970
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,950
Hey kids, you can help the mighty

971
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,510
Subtinus Wright's overthrow of the evil normals

972
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,870
with new Bob Dobbs action figure with rockin' pies

973
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,270
What I wouldn't do from Bob Dobbs

974
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,890
It's gonna get no more chocolatey pebbles from you, no ?

975
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,450
I'm a chocolate spice cadet

976
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,810
Life support system down to zero cocoa

977
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:57,810


978
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:01,330
Feeling free to have some of my new cocoa pimples.

979
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,910
Now so trumpety.

980
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,890
Mmm, smells coconut.

981
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,150
This cocoa liquid is...

982
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,330
Blue.

983
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,910
Well, friends, what do you think?

984
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,210
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

985
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:23,250
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob?

986
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:28,230
The Santa Bob, as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures.

987
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,490
The Jethro's, friends.

988
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,790
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

989
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,610
They're at...

990
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:12,290
They did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

991
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:19,750
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

992
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,090
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

993
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,870
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

994
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:32,590
Portsmouth, N-H-O-3-8-O-1.

995
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:37,330
Santa Claus is Coming to Town was by Corporal Blossom.

996
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:46,310
Information on that mutant Christmas is available from www.triagemusic.com

997
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:52,390
or www.detritus.net slash...

998
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,230
Illegal Art.

999
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:57,510
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, friends.

1000
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:08,210
You can reach me, send me tapes or whatnot at Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1001
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,590
And friends, as always, the Hour of Slack is brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

1002
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,490
www.subgenius.com

1003
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,650
It's all Christmassy right now.

1004
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,070
There's a bright green bob.

1005
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,290
There's a light out there.

1006
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:25,330
Is there a light out there?

1007
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,770
Is there a DJA?

1008
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,970
Is DJA out there?

1009
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,630
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1010
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,830
No, that's something just left for DJA.

1011
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,850
It's all Christmassy.

1012
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:42,810
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.

1013
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:43,810
Smell that cinnamon.

1014
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,670
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1015
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,410
And those sugar plums.

1016
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,710
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's, isn't it?

1017
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:51,470
Yeah.

1018
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:52,830
Or Santa, I mean.

1019
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:53,230
Yeah.

1020
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,230


1021
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,230


1022
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,230


1023
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,350
Otherwise, gosh.

1024
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:58,350
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1025
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,990
Oh, beloved Santa.

1026
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,390
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

1027
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:05,810
Besides, I'm so ready to let him be.

1028
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:06,470
What?

1029
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,430
For so long.

1030
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,070
Praise Bob and Mary Xmas!

1031
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:14,950

1046
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,910


1047
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,910

1049
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,070
Â¶Â¶

1050
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:59,430
Lone cow babe, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1051
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,010
Don't despair, just because it's Christmas

1052
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:17,230
Children there are so gay at Christmas

1053
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:24,330
All the children on the street

1054
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:28,150
Hope they get something good to eat

1055
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:32,250
But for me it's not so great

1056
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,170
Fuck Christmas!

1057
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,090
What a night!

1058
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,730
Before Christmas and all through the house

1059
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,850
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

1060
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,050
The stockings were hung by the tree

1061
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,450
Merry fucking Christmas

1062
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,130
Merry fucking Christmas

1063
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:04,050
Merry fucking Christmas

1064
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:07,590
Merry fucking Christmas

1065
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,170
To you!

1066
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:17,230


1067
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,990
Merry fucking Christmas

1068
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:37,850
Merry fucking Christmas

1069
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,750
Merry fucking Christmas

1070
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,510
Merry fucking Christmas

1071
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,750
Thank you.

1072
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,990
Thank you.

1073
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:47,510
Thank you.
