1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,740
Yes, I believe I'm gonna be

2
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,940
I think I'm gonna be alright

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,780
Alright, right, right, right, right, right

4
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,720
Splash!

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,300
I tell you I'm gonna be alright

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,280
Hey, Will, alright, baby, yeah

7
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,500
Splash!

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm playing

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Splash!

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:57,940


11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm gonna be alright

12
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,260
What a voice, what a voice.

13
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,760
As the man said, the legendary Screaming Jay Hawkins.

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,740
And our very good thanks to the Fuzz Tones for doing a very able job on the back in there.

15
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
Let's hear it.

16
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,100
This is Gary Gubrod's band.

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,500
This is the only thing that's going to be on the record.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,440
It's pretty unmistakable.

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,740
This is Arch Pope's Sternodonts.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:41,060
This is the last few minutes of the live foundation.

21
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,180
Hi Palmer.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,120
And this is the Pope of all New York.

23
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,400
This is Dr.

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,260
Howell.

25
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,480
Now I didn't understand the meaning of it.

26
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,340
This is not viral murder.

27
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,880
I got to hear lots and lots of these tapes and it's fine editing.

28
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,180
Now, you can relax and enjoy this quality product.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,400
Secure in the knowledge that it has been specially created for the lover of fine things and the man of good taste.

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh, sorry.

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,980
You can edit that out, can't you?

32
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,740
Yeah, that's fine.

33
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,220
Yeah.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,300
All right.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:24,900
mag pawer on兒

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,960
You got UV light, can we pull up here.

37
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:27,960


38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,540
Hello.

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,140
All right.

40
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,940
Good evening, nice to talk to everyone.

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
Welcome to the Farm Shim Lee Fettre dor.

42
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Thank you.

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,280
My name is muchを

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,900
Sh mean you.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,120
We love you.

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,120


47
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,080
Take care.

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,260
life.

49
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,420
Feel the heat.

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,520
Nancy, get down.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,760
Get down.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,620
Get down.

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,980
We're over.

54
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,020
Nancy.

55
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,120
Well, here we are.

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,180
Where are we?

57
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,700
Here we are.

58
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,560
In the kingdom

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
of Noxt.

60
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,060
Where all

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,180
Noxts begin.

62
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,520
Behind every Noxt

63
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,100
is an infinite number

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,460
of Noxts.

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,220
A pyramid of Noxts.

66
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,260
Noxt isn't in the

67
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,140
dictionary yet.

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,700
But it will be.

69
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,200
Just as sure

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,220
as Noxt is now.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,340
Because tomorrow

72
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,040
or maybe the day after

73
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
you and I

74
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,160
will start saying

75
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,660
what's Noxt.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,560
And of course

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,880
we'll know

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,140
it's a historical

79
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,580
kind of understanding

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,560
of what

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,300
Noxt was

82
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,980
before it became Noxt.

83
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,620
One side of the teeter totter is next.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,920
And the other side is Noxt.

85
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,580
And of course the center,

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,020
the fulcrum,

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,660
is just now.

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,700
So you have Noxt next to now.

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,360
And next, Noxt to now.

90
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,000
Doesn't that make sense?

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,360
Yes it does.

92
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:45,740
It does.

93
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,000
I think so.

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,180
I think so too.

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,580
What's Noxt?

96
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,500
Well, let's see.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,000
It's very difficult

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,760
to get a good

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,320
nice rest

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,500
here inside this

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,320
alarm clock.

102
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,760
I don't know.

103
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,400
I try to curl up in the bottom of the curve here.

104
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,060
With a little...

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,040
Projections are to keep it from rolling off the nightstand.

106
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,220
Right above me, the gears.

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,380
Time sure is noisy.

108
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,500
It should lubricate these gears.

109
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,800
Now is the time.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,480
You said that.

111
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,660
Did you hear that?

112
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,900
Now is the time, Monday's child.

113
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,460
I thought time was continuous.

114
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,900
Yes, that Tuesday's child.

115
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:28,380
Time is the movement of the first heavenly bodies full of grace.

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
This is the Shuffler's radio ministry.

117
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,000
Hour of slack on KNON 90.9 and all FXFs.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,820
Praise God.

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll be...

120
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,180
I'll be...

121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,940
I'll be...

122
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:41,940


123
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,980
I'll be...

124
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,580
I'll be...

125
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll be...

126
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,400
I'll be...

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,340
I'll be...

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,180
I'll be...

129
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,840
Turn on the machine.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
This is Radio Yerevan.

131
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,680
My name is Franz Ivanovich Hagen.

132
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,760
And this is the news.

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Wake up, puppet boy.

134
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,640
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

135
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,880
Somehow, Bob's making...

136
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,500
No trouble. Just get set and get going.

137
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,040
Hear me. Recording. Everything's going fine.

138
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,940
No trouble.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,080
Chapter 13.

140
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,560
Verse 11.

141
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,000
And I beheld another beast

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,520
coming up out of the earth

143
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,380
and he had two horns like a lamb

144
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,020
and he spoke like a dragon.

145
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,560
And he exercised all the power of the first beast before him

146
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,480
and caused the earth and them who dwell on it

147
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,360
to worship the first beast

148
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,580
whose deadly wound was healed.

149
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,480
And he doeth great wonders

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,280
so that he maketh fire come down from heaven

151
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,980
on the earth.

152
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,200
And he doth not let the earth

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,340
and the sight of men.

154
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,140
And he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth

155
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,120
by the means of those miracles

156
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,420
which he had power to do in the sight of the beast

157
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,240
saying to them that dwell on the earth

158
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,060
that they should make an image to the beast.

159
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,700
Mob?

160
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,100
Mob?

161
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,700
Mob?

162
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Let there be light.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
You may shoot your guns and that will split.

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
That's right, they gonna split all three.

165
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,040
And you know when your guns split

166
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,540
when they clip down over the land and escape

167
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,460
oh, let the spirit of fire blowin' in again.

168
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,380
Let the spirit of fire blowin' all over the country time.

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,000
Let the spirit of fire blowin' out of here.

170
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,120
Oh friends.

171
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,260
We want mob!

172
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,280
We want mob!

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
We want mob!

174
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,160
And have you ever wondered about your neighbors,

175
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,320
maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps,

176
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
or chants emanating from their apartment?

177
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,280
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

178
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,240
That's the fastest-growing cult here in the Southwest.

179
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,600
Channel 4's Kelly Lane has the story.

180
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,840
...worked up way, but I'll tell you, you'll never get to...

181
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,560
It's Bob.

182
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,960
It's Bob.

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,500
It's Bob.

184
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,900
It's Bob.

185
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

186
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,100
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,840
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

188
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,280
What about Slack?

189
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,500
That's your key phrase.

190
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,760
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

191
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,620
And now, the subgenius.

192
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
Our own.

193
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Slack.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Slack.

195
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,160
The subgenius hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

196
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,460
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

197
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,640
K-N-O-N.

198
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,660
...and only.

199
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:34,820
...only.

200
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,340
In the city of...

201
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,420
Dallas, Texas.

202
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,180
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

203
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,660
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

204
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,700
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

205
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,340
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

206
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,120
constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

207
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,680
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you...

208
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,260
...that the

209
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,920
...and special guest...

210
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,100
...M. Ilkman.

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,380
Ah, yes, dear friends, we're...

212
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,000
I know some of you have had a Jones for the show, the hour of Slack.

213
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,240
You wish it was a week of Slack, don't you?

214
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,380
I don't blame you a bit.

215
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,160
Dave Slack, at least.

216
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,660
Oh, yes, friends, it's caller time again.

217
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,580
Yes, we're going to speak to you on hour of Slack radio ministry tonight.

218
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,000
Hi, I'm Pastor Bucknick, your call-in host, and we're going to take some calls tonight

219
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,520
on signs of the conspiracy.

220
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,000
We want your calls, the actual signs of the conspiracy.

221
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,780
Like, how can you tell if the conspiracy is active in your life?

222
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,100
You know...

223
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,660
...men in black...

224
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,740
...sitting in the back seat...

225
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,840
...in your car...

226
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,800
...while you're on your way to work.

227
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,180
Work itself, friends.

228
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,560
Work itself.

229
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,280
That's all the proof you need.

230
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,980
The conspiracy has got a hold of you where it hurts.

231
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,900
But we want actual physical signs, cattle mutilation, but real things that happen to you.

232
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,680
Cattle mutilations that happen to you.

233
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,580
Or worse.

234
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,360
Or worse, dear friends.

235
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,540
And also, last week's topic, we're going to take a few passages...

236
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:41,440
...from any of your holy texts, your Tibetan Book of the Dead, your Old Testaments, your New Testaments, your Revised Testaments,

237
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,440
your tests, the old tests from school, or any Bibles that you've written yourselves.

238
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:55,300
We'll take a few of your calls with those things, and I'll be reading some of my own Uncle Buck's Bible time tonight, too.

239
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,300
Oh, yes, dear friends.

240
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,880
And listen to this drippy music.

241
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,640
This is...

242
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,820
God, dude.

243
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,400
Well, here's a sign of the conspiracy.

244
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
We've got one more line open at 823.

245
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,240
823-8801.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,520
So...

247
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,040
Standing next to me on the practice tee is Arnold Palmer, the winner of every major open title in golf,

248
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,960
including the United States Open, the British Open, and the Masters Tournament.

249
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,760
Arnold is going to teach you how to play golf in a new and easy and enjoyable manner,

250
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,960
in the comfort of your own living room.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,020
Are the feet, Arnie, the only part of the stance that need to be in position for that good swing we're talking about?

252
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,760
Well, no, Chris.

253
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,340
I would say that the head position is also very important.

254
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,400
The head is probably as important as the feet in the stance.

255
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,520
And keeping the head in a good, comfortable position over the ball is very important.

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,420
Now, you don't want to move the head up or down or to either side during the swing.

257
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,420
No, wait a minute.

258
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,820
No, wait a minute.

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,100
I love that area.

260
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,940
And I...

261
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,780
For now, I show thee signs in the heavens and signs in the earth.

262
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,700
Blood benches from the earth.

263
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,080
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

264
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:28,800
The children of heaven and the angels from hell are among thee, spreading lies and deception.

265
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,720
Black umbrella skate, go walking around.

266
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,200
Um...

267
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,100
I do things that are different.

268
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
Yeah, someone with a lot of energy.

269
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,060
Uh-huh.

270
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,500
Yeah.

271
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,600
Okay, your code number once more?

272
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,120
37.

273
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,240
It's a man.

274
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,000
Glorify me, Bob, that I may be glorified through you.

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,860
Glorify me that I may glorify you, Bob.

276
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,500
Who tithes his money to the subgenius church, his name will be registered in the cash register of life.

277
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,700
Bob, can you see me?

278
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,300
Subgenius beach party.

279
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,360
My mind is my own and nobody's gonna change it.

280
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


281
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


282
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


283
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


284
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


285
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


286
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


287
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:04,360


288
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,300
I'm not going into that room!

289
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Nobody is, come on.

290
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,660
Wake out of that glass box.

291
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,600
And join the church of the subgenius.

292
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,820
Oh my God.

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
Is this for real?

294
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,480
No, no, no.

295
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,440
This is just a tape.

296
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:24,900
Relax.

297
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,000
It is not the day before or the week between.

298
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,080
It's just the show.

299
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,220
The show that, yes, was thrown into the bay three weeks ago and...

300
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,080
They're not actors.

301
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:45,140
...and struggled free of its chains and floated up, swam back to the studio here, climbed up the antenna, and is now running all the way down those little air wires right into your ears.

302
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,780
Hiya, hiya, you're still on the air.

303
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,120
We'll be at test on Sunday, so...

304
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,700
Stay tuned.

305
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,140
You never know when you're here or not on this show because there are so many doctors.

306
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,540
Just a few dugs, sprinkle a few Gary's, drop a few Bob's over here.

307
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,300
A few Bob's.

308
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,100
Yes, I'm sorry, listener.

309
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,500
You've got a real problem now.

310
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,060
They're live all the time.

311
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,200
I'll be right back.

312
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,020
Be right back.

313
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,640
Let's go for a commercial.

314
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:31,100
We're living in a terrible, perilous, chaotic time.

315
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Oh, yes.

316
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,120
Chaotic time.

317
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,200
Yeah.

318
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


319
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


320
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


321
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


322
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


323
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


324
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


325
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


326
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


327
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


328
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


329
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


330
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


331
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


332
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


333
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


334
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


335
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


336
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


337
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


338
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


339
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,200


340
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,900
friends and most chaotic oftentimes on the telephone line.

341
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,880
Yes, and we're about to share something with Billy.

342
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,660
What happened?

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,300
We're about to share something with Billy.

344
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,900
Hello, Billy?

345
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,200
Billy?

346
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,340
I've seen the conspiracy.

347
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,720
Well, let's hear about it quick.

348
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,460
You're on the air, Bo.

349
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,560
I was cruising westward along Walnut Hill Lane when I took a ride onto Preston Road heading

350
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,840
north towards LBJ.

351
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,800
I was passing the first residential street.

352
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,600
I looked over to my right and happened to spy a Christmas tree shown through a window

353
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,120
of a fashionable corner house.

354
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,640
Right.

355
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,800
The Christmas tree was white frosted and it was decorated exclusively, no pun intended

356
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,080
yet, with white light bulbs.

357
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,060
Again, on the very night...

358
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,720
How do you know that's a sign of the conspiracy, Billy?

359
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:20,680
Because every street, the eight out of ten streets from Walnut Hill to LBJ, the Christmas

360
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,780
trees were white.

361
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,060
So this is patternology and color coordination conspiracy?

362
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:25,960
Oh, definitely.

363
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,080
Try it.

364
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,360
It was during the Christmas season.

365
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,500
Every tree...

366
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,560
Okay, we're going to punch this into our computer now.

367
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,960
We're going to get confirmation to you later on.

368
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,060
M. Ilkman is here.

369
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,540
Billy, Billy, listen.

370
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,640
We're going to get confirmation on whether that's an actual conspiracy code.

371
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,800
So go ahead and tell the rest of it now, the other side.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,300
I see.

373
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,660
Okay.

374
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,340
Where was I?

375
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,360
I don't know.

376
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I was cruising on Preston Road.

377
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,640
Anyway, the Christmas tree was white frosted and it was decorated exclusively in white.

378
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,260
Gotcha.

379
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:57,740
Gotcha.

380
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,900
Okay, thank you very much.

381
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,300
And thanks for sharing that with me.

382
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,380
Our Slack Radio Ministry, Billy.

383
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,640
And later on, we're going to get the soul sucker out and we're going to let you...

384
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,760
Okay.

385
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,320
Now, we've got another caller here, I think.

386
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,140
Hello?

387
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,940
Hello?

388
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
Hello, is this Ronald?

389
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,420
What's wrong?

390
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,060
Somebody's messing up here and it's not me.

391
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,020
Oh, listen to that scary wind outside.

392
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,940
Yes, friends.

393
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,020
That's the soul sucker that works with this show, waiting to catch your calls before they get to us.

394
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Are all phones down out there?

395
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,380
We joke around about it a lot, friends, but it's really pretty serious.

396
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,680
I mean, the paranormal isn't something you want to mess with a lot.

397
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,780
We're trying to get that caller in here.

398
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,060
Caller, don't give up.

399
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,760
Here, you got a...

400
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,740
Caller?

401
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't like that caller.

402
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,260
Just take it down.

403
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,560
Caller?

404
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,740
Hello?

405
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,060
Is this the caller?

406
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,760
Here he is.

407
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,620
Here's our caller.

408
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:10,680
Caller?

409
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,160
Are you alive?

410
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,860
Are you in there, caller?

411
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,860
Caller, you need to talk real loud.

412
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Let's hear your problem, caller.

413
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,640
What did you call our Slack Radio Ministry for tonight?

414
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,840
Okay, yeah.

415
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,100
A scientific conspiracy.

416
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,400
It's my own theory.

417
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,620
I'll admit it, but...

418
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,640
You have a spiritual problem?

419
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,280
Yeah.

420
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,240
It has proof.

421
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,700
I have proof that it's serious.

422
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,360
In your navel?

423
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:33,960
Yeah.

424
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,780
Cigarette smoking causes pregnancy.

425
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,020
Cigarette smoking causes pregnancy?

426
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,660
Yeah, I can prove it.

427
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:38,940
That's true.

428
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,540
My mother had me, so that's...

429
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,980
Thanks for sharing that with us and the radio ministry and our radio family out there.

430
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,420
Oh, yes, friends.

431
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,660
So we've got some sort of a communistic ad coming up here that we have to put on the hour of Slack rather than...

432
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,160
I've got another caller here.

433
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,280
Oh, you do?

434
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,080
All right.

435
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,840
Spirit voice, what is your problem?

436
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah, okay.

437
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,280
You know, when people burn their hands, they don't ever do that.

438
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,500
They don't ever do that again.

439
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,360
So, like, when people die, they don't ever do that again either.

440
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,780
So it must be an equally bad experience.

441
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,520
That's right.

442
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,300
That's proof of the conspiracy.

443
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,880
You do it once, you can't make the same mistake again.

444
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
I can't believe that they do that.

445
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,220
Well, just remember this.

446
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,060
How do you think that relates to the supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth that are waiting to get us?

447
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I don't know, but I think it's like a pre-shock wave after fabrication.

448
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,440
Thanks for sharing that with us.

449
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,800
Thanks for sharing that with us, caller.

450
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,780
All right, we got another caller.

451
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,760
Hello, caller.

452
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,780
Oh, yeah, about that theory.

453
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,400
I was hung up on her something.

454
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,420
I guess a pink boy...

455
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,580
Gee.

456
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,460
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.

457
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,740
There's something's happened to the sound control.

458
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,360
Caller, are you still there, caller?

459
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,300
I lost him.

460
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Caller, there he is.

461
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,620
The soul sucker is eating him up.

462
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,160
Caller, can you hear me?

463
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,700
Oh, okay, do it.

464
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,160
Okay, the world's greatest toys are all around the world, right?

465
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:00,760
Yeah, right.

466
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:02,900
Right.

467
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,240
You don't even need a stamp.

468
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,360
Just drop that into my body.

469
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,180
Press it to your forehead.

470
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,120
It will come.

471
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,160
Thanks for sharing that with us.

472
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,940
It'll get your car again.

473
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,060
And soon that Bob energy will start feeding out through the airways, and it'll catch you in your car.

474
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,600
It'll lift you out, and your car will be D-man, and you'll be flying right with Bob.

475
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,600
And you don't have to get up early on Sunday morning and wear tight shoes to be saved.

476
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,200
Hello?

477
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,360
Hello?

478
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,020
I'd like to speak to all of our callers.

479
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:38,060
We're about to get the soul sucker out, and I'd like to say to you that if it hurts, remember to scream,

480
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,600
because it's a very powerful unit, and it has actually stripped the souls of five callers who called last week,

481
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,800
have not gotten out of their catatonia yet.

482
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,960
So if it hurts at all, I want to hear you yell loud when we put the soul sucker on, okay?

483
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,120
So now we're going to play a tape.

484
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,100
This is called Dallas Police Unfair to Youth by Kate Griffin.

485
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,120
Is it 12?

486
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,600
Twilight Room.

487
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,560
Instead of simply closing the doors, eight police cars surrounded the parking lot.

488
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,060
Everyone in the parking lot was patted down and frisked.

489
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,240
No one was allowed to take their hands off the nearest car.

490
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,980
People who asked why were pushed or beaten.

491
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,120
I saw blood.

492
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,740
Then the police got in their cars and raided the other youth clubs.

493
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,920
What are we going to do about it?

494
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,620
Will we have to stand outside Reunion Arena with signs saying,

495
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,480
Dallas Police Unfair to Youth?

496
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,940
Things were fine.

497
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,320
We've been in this business for years.

498
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,100
Let's stop brutal searches and intimidation tactics.

499
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,020
We've seen people get into Bob and their business picks up 10,000 percent.

500
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,740
Or they get into Bob and all of a sudden they're whining with the gutter, but finally they're happy.

501
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,200
They're loose again.

502
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,980
They can feel free and think their own thoughts and not be feeling the conspiracy breathing down the back of their necks.

503
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,100
They could dance in the Mecham fountain and have a free heart while they did it.

504
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh, praise Bob.

505
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,180
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

506
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

507
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,880
He is the head of the subgenius church.

508
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,820
And that's why he's super cool like glass.

509
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,900
He's Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

510
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,680
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

511
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
He is the head of the subgenius church.

512
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,240
Those numbers are 823-7490 and 823-8801.

513
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,820
Give us a call on the hour of slack.

514
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,180
I either want a Bible quotation or I want signs of the conspiracy.

515
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,320
Or both.

516
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,660
This is Kano.

517
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,520
Kano and 94.9.

518
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,060
Welcome to the subgenius devotional hour here before the normal scary time.

519
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,340
As the smoke of that burning goeth up forever.

520
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,360
That was a stinkle.

521
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,320
But it had lots of prophecy involved.

522
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,460
You heard it right here on the subgenius hour.

523
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,560
And lots of few words.

524
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,620
Wonder why Fido came home with his wazoo missing.

525
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,700
Or wonder why those beefs like Buster and Deer on the parlor and the pasture are lying out there with their throats and half their rectums missing.

526
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,560
Well, it's because of those exists who came down to this earth.

527
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,260
One Christmas day many millennia ago.

528
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,740
To forge a new link.

529
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,520
One might call it a hot link.

530
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,240
Between the aliens and man.

531
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,020
A giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe.

532
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,620
The galactic center.

533
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,800
Those little tykes will be able to carry on for us.

534
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,160
Every one of those little kids is a potential Lee Majors.

535
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,380
And I hope you're pleased with what we've done.

536
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,960
The rising generations shall have reason to praise us.

537
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,580
To pour out libations on our smoking altars.

538
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,660
And we should know.

539
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,940
This is a non-smoking section.

540
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,620
The book of the subgenius.

541
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,600
Lunatic prophecies for the coming weird times.

542
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,800
Out now and on your stand.

543
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,320
From McGraw Hill.

544
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,000
If you don't see the book on your stand.

545
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,140
Complain.

546
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,860
Loudly agitate and tell the store if necessary.

547
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,300
They are crazy.

548
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,500
It's a question of bull dada.

549
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,700
And it's application of course in the society surrounding the bull dada.

550
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,920
We apply it from a little disposable tube.

551
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,660
That's right.

552
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,620
Using the power shell.

553
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,820
And using the spirit code.

554
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,540
The Yucateezum matrix applies the bull dada to the normals and pinks.

555
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,640
This is classified information.

556
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,080
Do you want to let this out on the air?

557
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,560
Take the sludge.

558
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,080
Proof of the conspiracy.

559
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,220
Right here.

560
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,360
Conspiracy proof.

561
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,880
Caller.

562
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:17,840
Hello.

563
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,660
Caller.

564
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,060
Caller.

565
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,200
Hello.

566
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,620
Say it.

567
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,380
Proof of the conspiracy.

568
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Proof they don't have slack.

569
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,240
Proof they don't have slack.

570
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,640
They use conspiracy street drugs so they have no slack.

571
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,400
Thank you caller.

572
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,260
Thanks for sharing that with our radio ministry.

573
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,100
Okay.

574
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,780
The AIDS town benefit series.

575
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,380
We're playing a benefit for AIDS town.

576
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,100
At the step ladder.

577
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,380
Just a step south of Lemon.

578
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,460
On McKinney.

579
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,900
3406 McKinney.

580
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,380
Remember that.

581
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,320
3406 McKinney.

582
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,160
I'd like all those folks who just called in to come and see us at 3406 McKinney.

583
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,620
Saturday April 19th.

584
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,900
That's next Saturday night.

585
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,340
At the step ladder club.

586
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,620
That's free right?

587
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,400
Free.

588
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,620
Free to the public.

589
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,440
But it's a benefit.

590
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,940
Because the bar is going to contribute to AIDS town to send them away.

591
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,080
Okay.

592
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,180
Also.

593
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,580
A little quotation.

594
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,440
Bible here.

595
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,960
Matthew 1032 to 1039.

596
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,920
This is the words of Jesus now friends.

597
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,020
This is not my words.

598
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,600
And this is you know your family's words.

599
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,540
This is the family Jesus saying this.

600
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:25,820
Okay.

601
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,480
Whoever acknowledges me before men.

602
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,380
I will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven.

603
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,620
But whoever disowns me before men.

604
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,920
I will disown him before my father in heaven.

605
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,520
Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.

606
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,720
I did not come to bring peace but a sword.

607
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,240
For I have come to turn.

608
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,600
A man against his father.

609
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,040
A daughter against her mother.

610
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,240
A daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.

611
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,980
A man's enemies will be the members of his own household.

612
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,340
Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me.

613
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,440
Is not worthy of me.

614
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,980
Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me.

615
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,020
Is not worthy of me.

616
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,600
And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me.

617
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,300
Is not worthy of me.

618
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,780
Whoever finds his life will lose it.

619
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,000
And whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

620
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,360
Translation.

621
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,040
This is my personal translation.

622
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,960
Matthew 1032 to 1039.

623
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,900
You can cut this Prince of Peace crap right here.

624
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,180
I'm in charge now so learn to kick butt.

625
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,240
I'll set up sons against fathers.

626
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,420
Daughters against mothers, etc.

627
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,220
And screw up all your other relationships.

628
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,040
Think of death as life and life as death.

629
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,620
Just remember I'm the boss.

630
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,580
If you get in my way I'll slice your head open with this here sword.

631
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,860
On the other hand if you do your job.

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Don't ask questions.

633
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,280
I'll get you a good deal in the afterlife.

634
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,220
They're starting to shoot at us now, friends.

635
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,040
Okay.

636
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
Yep, that's right.

637
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,540
We just heard gunshots outside.

638
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Absolutely for real.

639
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,440
That's either the pizza on the way or else the pizza thing was a ruse.

640
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,220
It's the pizza bandits on the road.

641
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,600
This Western street.

642
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,420
Huh?

643
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,940
I'm seeing a lot of Vaqueros shooting at each other these days, aren't you?

644
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,840
Uh-huh.

645
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,820
A lot of that.

646
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,420
Okay, well the numbers are 823-7490 or 823-8801.

647
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,560
We're gonna have the soul sucker and that young lady's just telling how the soul sucker really feels.

648
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,620
That's right, dear man.

649
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,520
We're gonna play tapes about 10 or 15 and come on back.

650
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,280
Bye-bye.

651
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,660
My friend hakans

652
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:36,960
is here.

653
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,980
Pizza for Bob, that's all right.

654
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,620
It is a donation to the subgenius radio ministry.

655
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,720
Thanks, Bob.

656
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,580
Ng-ng.

657
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,000
Finger lickin' good.

658
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,160
And who is this pizza courtesy of?

659
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,940
Doctor Dean.

660
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,620
Dr. Dean, oh, you have to pray.

661
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,600
It's another doctor for Bob, friends.

662
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,020
It's just kid Bob.

663
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,320
Oh, smell that.

664
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,860
Smell that church air coming off of that pizza.

665
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,080
Oh, yeah.

666
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,460
Bucky got the first slice.

667
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,140
Yep, and Buck's not putting it in the orifice that most people put food in.

668
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:08,880
Nay, nay.

669
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,800
This is a church for mutants, friends.

670
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,420
A mutant church.

671
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,740
Church. Oh, did you have a message, Reverend Dr. DDT agent?

672
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,860
Yes.

673
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,380
All you uninitiates who know me as Eric Kosick, you just don't know!

674
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,820
Oh, there went the needle.

675
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,360
So call the station to find out what it's all about.

676
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,000
Call or die, friends.

677
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,200
And here's what it's all about.

678
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,600
I think here's a song for the person who called to say that people who don't have slack end up using conspiracy street.

679
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,140
It's true.

680
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:50,180
That conspiracy street drugs are, in fact, a sort of a form of false slack.

681
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,680
A stopgap, scapegoat form of slack.

682
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,540
But, you know, all some people get.

683
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:07,020
Well, this song here coming up, not the one that's on now, which is by Professor Mother's Bob, Music for Insomniacs.

684
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:12,600
Some of the voices, by the way, this show you've been hearing was from, of course,

685
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,400
those of you who don't know,

686
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:19,540
don't recognize it, the amazing more than an hour, less than a show show from Berkeley with puzzling evidence,

687
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,780
Dr. Howell, Gary Gubrog, friend and so forth.

688
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,760
But here is the answer to the question of the conspiracy street.

689
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,000
Bob loves you.

690
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,800
Bob loves you.

691
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,800
Bob loves you.

692
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,800
Getting stoned.

693
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,980
Don't sunshine.

694
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,280
Getting high on air.

695
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,120
Getting to it naturally.

696
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,440
Really getting there.

697
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,860
Getting such a high on loving what I do.

698
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,860
I'm so full of happiness.

699
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,140
Hooked on something new.

700
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,580
Life is such a trippy thing.

701
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,340
Hello birdies, hello spring.

702
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,340
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

703
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,540
And I mean just what I sing.

704
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,260
Life is such a groovy thing.

705
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,020
Don't pity me.

706
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,460
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling.

707
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling.

708
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,100
My pot is filled with flowers.

709
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,840
My grass is bright and green.

710
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,260
My tea is brewing in my cup.

711
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,220
And still I make the scene.

712
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,340
So just don't try to change me.

713
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,780
I love the world I've found.

714
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,780
I've got to fly my own speed.

715
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:12,780


716
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,240
I've got to make it my own sweet way.

717
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,040
Don't you shoot me down.

718
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,620
Life is such a trippy thing.

719
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,320
Hello birdies, hello spring.

720
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,360
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

721
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,600
And I mean just what I sing.

722
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,400
Life is such a groovy thing.

723
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,120
Don't pity me.

724
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,720
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling.

725
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,640
Don't pity me.

726
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,940
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling.

727
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,200
Don't pity me.

728
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,740
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling.

729
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,600
Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling.

730
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,760
Boy, folks.

731
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,920
That was Frank Sinatra Jr.

732
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,100
And Nancy Steele.

733
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,360
Nancy Sinatra.

734
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:11,860
Yeah.

735
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

736
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,040
Hi, girls.

737
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,620
Hey, we got another caller here.

738
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,480
And I bet you know what he sounds like because he's been on our show before.

739
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,660
And here is our great caller.

740
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Hello, caller, are you there?

741
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,960
Yes, I would like to know what is the difference between a emergent pal,

742
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,940
rewardious, and a video creeper?

743
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,660
What's the difference between an ...

744
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,060
What's the difference between an emergent pal, a rewardion, and a mediocrity?

745
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
And actually, that's not a bad question.

746
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,380
Not a bad question.

747
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
Too bad he fell prey to the soul sucker.

748
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,840
I don't think ... I think he passed out because he soon as touched him.

749
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,460
I don't detect the pulse over the phone.

750
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,380
No.

751
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,140
But I'll tell you, we might ought to talk about that.

752
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,220
Actually, this is KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

753
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,140
The emergent pal, according to church, subgenius church dogma,

754
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,440
the emergentile is the type of subgenius for whom it's always an emergency.

755
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,080
And I'm the worst sufferer of that community.

756
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,440
They wait until the last minute.

757
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:14,980
They wait until the last minute.

758
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,360
They create their own emergencies because they live off that intensity.

759
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,640
Yeah, they're constantly in an emergency.

760
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,300
They really ... their idea of slack is constant activity.

761
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,180
Now, in the church, we give them ... there's two states of rewardionism.

762
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,540
One is the classic rewardion that simply rewards themselves.

763
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:32,820
Right.

764
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,440
Those are the opposite of the emergentile.

765
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,120
And they promise us to the ...?

766
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,880
They promise to themselves so that they can continue to function.

767
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,080
The other kind is the rogue rewardion that actually wallows in the rewards

768
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,200
and becomes a total pig and sells out, which is like almost everybody in America.

769
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,040
And then the mediocritan is just the hoi polloi that just kind of shuffle along

770
00:35:52,680 --> 00:36:00,040
in tune with the groove and make very little ... very little, well, difference.

771
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,760
I guess is the big way to say it.

772
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,700
And yet they create ... take up a lot of space, but they make very little difference.

773
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,980
That's the mediocritans?

774
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,140
No, that's the mediocritans, right.

775
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah.

776
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,300
Well, most ...

777
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,640
The hoi polloi.

778
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,000
Most people are mediocritans.

779
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,140
Yeah.

780
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,000
We're talking about the pink boys, them, the Barbies and Cans, the somnambulax, the its,

781
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,760
the mere food tubes who go through life for ...

782
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:26,500
I'd say that most ... most of you, not us, but most of you are simple mediocritans who

783
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,600
wish that you were rogue rewardions.

784
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,240
Every ... well, yeah.

785
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:30,520
That's exactly right.

786
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,260
But your rewards are so paltry that you get very little out of it.

787
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,680
And we've got a caller on the phone.

788
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,180
Question number three.

789
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,620
Hello, test, caller.

790
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,640
Oh, yeah?

791
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,980
Yeah, you're on.

792
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Say it.

793
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,500
Say it or the soul sucker.

794
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,940
Okay, I have a quote, a quatrain from Nostradamus.

795
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,440
Uh-huh, make it quick.

796
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:54,060
It says, like the great king of Algo-Moid, the year 1999, seventh month, the great king

797
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,040
of terror will descend from the sky.

798
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,240
At this time, Mars will reign for the good cause.

799
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,180
That was excellent, caller.

800
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,440
I would like to give you the four-month award.

801
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,420
For the best call we've had on our Slack.

802
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:06,860
That's right.

803
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:14,140
Yeah, this man has found a key that unlocks the prophecy of J.R. Bob Dobbs back in the

804
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,500
1500s.

805
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,060
This guy here ... now, I think you're tough enough to handle the soul sucker.

806
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,160
We're gonna give it to you and just howl a little bit.

807
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,500
I had it last week as well, so ...

808
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:22,720
Ready?

809
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,320
Okay.

810
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Are you still there, caller?

811
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,160
You still there?

812
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,780
Yeah.

813
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,260
Now, why in the world would I be going ...

814
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,800
Wait a minute.

815
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,140
Oh, well.

816
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,400
I heard ...

817
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,540
There was a pulse.

818
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,420
I have to play this again.

819
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,300
There was a pulse.

820
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
Listen, this is really important.

821
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,840
Do it.

822
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
Listen to this little bit of tape.

823
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,680
This is one of the funniest moments.

824
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,320
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

825
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:45,620
I can't really explain this.

826
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,640
I have to listen to it over and over again.

827
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,560
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

828
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,680
There must be that.

829
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Now, why in the world would I be going ... there, the dog?

830
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,860
Yeah, yeah.

831
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,460
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,480
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

833
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,920
8-2-3-8-8-0-1.

834
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,060
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,540
Yeah, yeah.

836
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:03,800


837
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah, yeah.

838
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,500
Yeah, yeah.

839
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:04,660
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah, yeah.

841
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,660
Yeah, yeah.

842
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,560
Yeah, yeah.

843
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,680
Yeah, yeah.

844
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:10,780
Yeah, yeah.

845
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:10,780


846
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:10,780


847
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,660
This is a tune.

848
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,660
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,120
Yeah, yeah.

850
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,820
Yeah, yeah.

851
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,640
Yeah, yeah.

852
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,220
Isn't that a pretty little tune?

853
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,880
That was sexy.

854
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,140
This is ... here.

855
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
Does Odan do that?

856
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,080
No, that's Mark.

857
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,220
Mother's book?

858
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,560
Yeah.

859
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,080
It's my ... my ...

860
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:24,940
Oh.

861
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,020
Yeah, yeah.

862
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,640
Now, not everybody can do the salute, friends.

863
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,500
And many of you out there in subgenius land do not ... still do not know how to do the

864
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,640
salute by which you raise your ...

865
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:34,640


866
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,840
Put your left hand towards the heavens.

867
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,740
Put your right index finger right up against your Adam's apple and forcefully, with the

868
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,220
vibrations that will attract the attention of the gods, go ...

869
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,600
Praise Bob.

870
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,960
Come on, help me somebody.

871
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

872
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,740
Down you go.

873
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,520
Down you go.

874
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,920
Oh, yes.

875
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:55,640
Down you go.

876
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,340
Down you go.

877
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:56,340


878
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,340
Hello?

879
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:58,880
Caller.

880
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,040
Caller.

881
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,640
What?

882
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,980
You ...

883
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,600
Oh, you can't say that over the ...

884
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:04,640
I'm sorry.

885
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:04,640


886
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:04,640


887
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:04,640


888
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:04,780
I'm sorry.

889
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,440
Your air, you darn fool.

890
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,500
That was ...

891
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
That was sick.

892
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,000
Bob.

893
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,460
Bob.

894
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,360
Bob.

895
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,460
Well, friends, before that gets any further ...

896
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:15,460


897
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:15,880
Are you in there?

898
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,560
Yeah.

899
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,840
I'd like to know what anyone thinks about Oral Roberts teaming up with Dick Army.

900
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,880
I'd like to know ...

901
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,940
There he went, friends.

902
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,040
It's sad, sad ...

903
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh, you know what?

904
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,420
I want to put on just a hairy little bit of a record here.

905
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,020
I think if we go like this.

906
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,340
Oh, yes.

907
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,620
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

908
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


909
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


910
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


911
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


912
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


913
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


914
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:34,620


915
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:41,240
This is for you to all the dogs out there.

916
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,180
The conspiracy fans out there.

917
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,940
This is for you.

918
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,180
This is for you.

919
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,420
This is for you.

920
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,600
This is for you.

921
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:46,320
This is for you.

922
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,560
Okay.

923
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,880
Last weekend I listened to the show there.

924
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,340
No, not that one.

925
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,160
I think it was called Damage Incorporated.

926
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,480
What's that?

927
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,040
Anything else?

928
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,580
I was wanting to know

929
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,520
is that being played now?

930
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,720
The answer to all three of your questions

931
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,580
is yes, no, no,

932
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
and yes.

933
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,280
Thank you very much.

934
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,820
Thank you for sharing that with us.

935
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,600
And now,

936
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,200
M. Elkman.

937
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,420
Yes, friends, this is the

938
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,300
Deacon M. Elkman, the

939
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,900
Deacon of hate, hate, hate, hate.

940
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,460
But I've got a little

941
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,040
something else to talk about, friends.

942
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,320
Tonight, yes, you know how

943
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,720
they were talking about

944
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,340
it's been signs of the conspiracy.

945
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,920
Well, you must realize, oh, there's that

946
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,480
soul sucker, he's just sucking you.

947
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:55,920
Uh-oh.

948
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,320
That was bad, my friends.

949
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,180
You know how they say

950
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,780
the signs of the conspiracy.

951
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,240
Yes.

952
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
I'm so irate at this moment,

953
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,820
I'm having trouble getting my thoughts together.

954
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,920
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

955
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
But my friends, with the conspiracy,

956
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,860
the sign is that all them Nazi concentration camps

957
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,240
were just a training ground.

958
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,240
They killed you pretty quick there.

959
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,580
I mean, it seemed slow at the time,

960
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,520
but it was quick because now they've got

961
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,400
those 80 story concentration camps going up

962
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,980
where slowly, little by little,

963
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,640
they're sucking your souls out

964
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,420
and all your money for the conspiracy.

965
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,000
And that kind of stuff,

966
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,740
that kind of stuff just makes me feel so mad.

967
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,420
I just have to hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

968
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,980
You must draw your own conclusions.

969
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,020
You've got to believe me.

970
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,360
You've got to believe me.

971
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,920
You've got to believe me.

972
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,000
Oops.

973
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,620
Where am I?

974
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,000
And what is putting this intersection?

975
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:06,780
The intersection?

976
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:06,780


977
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,320
In the Isle of Mar ideas,

978
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,280
回 болееada.

979
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:17,560
I said it prior,

980
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:17,560


981
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:17,560


982
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:17,560


983
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:17,680
democratizing the former

984
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:17,760
and now-

985
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,240
Thank you, Bob

986
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,240
For cleansing my memory

987
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,420
Thank you, Bob

988
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,980
For helping me sleep

989
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,860
And, Bob

990
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,240
I'll follow you always

991
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,340
That's right, Bob

992
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,860
Until that next day

993
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,800
Thank you, Bob

994
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,960
For sending them pills

995
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,580
Thank you, Bob

996
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,620
For finding me willing

997
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,300
Teenage girls

998
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,180
And, Bob

999
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,560
I'll follow you always

1000
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,320
That's right, Bob

1001
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,040
Until that next day

1002
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,560
And now McGraw-Hill has printed 15,000 copies of the collected teachings of Bob.

1003
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,760
More?

1004
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
More book.

1005
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,420
More book.

1006
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,120
You are absolutely amazing.

1007
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,380
Yeah, I know.

1008
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,320
Want some more book?

1009
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:40,740
I don't know.

1010
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,140
It's got some nice big fat places you can just blast your fist right into it.

1011
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:45,320
Oh, my God.

1012
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:45,600
Julie!

1013
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,940
Yeah, we paid for them bombs.

1014
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,040
Why couldn't we get the thrill of pushing the button?

1015
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,260
Now we paid for the schools.

1016
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,480
That's right.

1017
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,040
If I paid for that school, I'd blow it up.

1018
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,580
What if I go anyway and I can pretend?

1019
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,360
Because, you know, after something's happened, all you have left is the memories so you can

1020
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,260
just pretend and convince yourself.

1021
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,300
Oh, I wouldn't worry about the memories none.

1022
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,960
But then I won't have the Kodak.

1023
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,620
No one has the Polaroid.

1024
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,860
It was just a bad dream that, you know, you never went to school.

1025
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,460
It was just a bad dream that, you know, you never went to school.

1026
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
The past memories of my life that I no longer live.

1027
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,980
That would be awful.

1028
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:14,620
I don't want to go to school.

1029
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:14,900
I don't want to go to school.

1030
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,100
And let's have an awful little...

1031
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,360
Your memories.

1032
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,760
I think you didn't expect me to be listening tonight.

1033
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,280
Your memories are fading.

1034
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,180
Just by chance, I heard you guys came along.

1035
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,900
Oh, your memories are fading.

1036
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
I've got to wake up tomorrow.

1037
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,220
Even as you speak, your memories are fading.

1038
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,260
Oh, your thoughts are gone.

1039
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,500
There are people floating about unregulated, you know.

1040
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,840
They're not your own.

1041
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,780
Everybody's floating around now here in the morning.

1042
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,560
Oh, your memories are fading.

1043
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,840
After the blast of the bomb.

1044
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:44,880
Oh, your memories are fading.

1045
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:44,880


1046
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:44,880


1047
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:44,880


1048
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,300
But you're still going your own way.

1049
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,120
Where do I come from?

1050
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:47,720
You come from the shirt.

1051
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,440
You've got to come from the shirt.

1052
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,080
What is my name?

1053
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,780
What am I doing here?

1054
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,580
The nuclear bomb.

1055
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,040
You've come from the shirt.

1056
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,840
All right, come on.

1057
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,440
What color is your hair?

1058
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,620
What color is your hair?

1059
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,520
Here I am, hippie.

1060
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,320
Well, this must be a tree.

1061
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,820
Or a little tiny bomb.

1062
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,500
Our first time seeing you.

1063
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,680
Yeah, your beverage bomb.

1064
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,360
Was it real at all?

1065
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,440
You have a mission.

1066
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,860
Hot Silhouette's in the Convertible Converter.

1067
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:14,860


1068
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:14,860


1069
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:14,860


1070
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:14,860


1071
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:14,860


1072
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,000
Or did you get to the Convertible Converter?

1073
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,740
You gave this applause.

1074
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree.

1075
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,880
Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee.

1076
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,240
Bob is truth and Bob is lies.

1077
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,620
Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

1078
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,880
Bob's my hat, Bob's my watch.

1079
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,360
Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.

1080
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:44,860
Bob is my hat.

1081
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:57,480
Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain, Bob's an ugly yellow stain, Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch, Bob is taking off every stitch.

1082
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:10,880
Bob's my master, Bob's my slave, Bob will rob me, Bob will save, Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge, Bob's my little sister Mitch.

1083
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,600
Bob will cost you, Bob is free, Bob's a watch, and Bob's the key.

1084
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:24,100
In short, Bob Dobbs is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.

1085
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:30,900
If your mind is a jar, you can pour it out of the sink, and the subgenius church is the missing link.

1086
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,840
Ah, yes, dear friend.

1087
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,560
Dear caller, is this Gary?

1088
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,140
Yeah.

1089
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,780
Gary, what were you going to ask?

1090
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,340
It's about an hour of slack radio ministry.

1091
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,300
What would you like to share with our radio ministry?

1092
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,500
The end of this one long passage goes,

1093
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,420
And again, there is seen that this occurred in the entrance of the Messiah in this period, 1998.

1094
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,060
This is from Edgar Cayce, and I was wondering, what's it referring to?

1095
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,860
Oh, now say that one again.

1096
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,100
It's at the end of a long passage.

1097
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,800
Uh-huh.

1098
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,580
And again, is there seen that this occurs in the entrance of the Messiah in this period, 1998.

1099
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,620
Well, what occurs?

1100
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,820
You can give us a little hint.

1101
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,080
There's something about the rebuilding of the pyramid of ESA.

1102
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,180
Rebuilding the pyramid of ESA.

1103
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,840
And it's from Edgar Cayce's origin and destiny.

1104
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,280
Well, I...

1105
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,720
That's the fact that we're going to have a series of rocket launches out of, in the late 90s, out of Egypt,

1106
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:29,960
because they've got a good desert there, and everything falls into the Red Sea.

1107
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,640
So, that's what they're referring to when they say, builded the pyramid of ESA, because what it really means is NASA.

1108
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:37,960
Also...

1109
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,300
NASA. That's how it got pronounced in the Egyptian, NASA.

1110
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,580
Well, but you're...

1111
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:40,860
NASA. That's how it got pronounced in the Egyptian, NASA. Well, but you're...

1112
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,220
NASA. That's how it got pronounced in the Egyptian, NASA.

1113
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,220
We're missing over a main point of subgenius doctrine that many, many listeners out there may not understand,

1114
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:57,960
that the whole basis for this church is to warn you about the arrival in 1998 of what we call the men from Planet X,

1115
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,180
if men they really be.

1116
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,500
That's what I thought Nostradamus was referring to.

1117
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,540
That's exactly right.

1118
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,580
The great king of terror that will come from the sky, and you see...

1119
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,360
I didn't forget that. That's part of my very being.

1120
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,880
Bob is not...

1121
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,640
Bob is a bobber in my glands, dang it.

1122
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,260
I can't forget it. It's just that sometimes I don't even sort it out. It's just all part of me.

1123
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,980
Well, you gotta use the...

1124
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,000
It's in me.

1125
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,220
Let go of that part, and, you know...

1126
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,120
Give them the other part.

1127
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:40,080
But, friends, it's true. That's the whole point of this church, is those who are saved, friends, will wave goodbye to the ones who fry down below as cities, whole cities, are pulverized by those men from Planet X.

1128
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,300
by those men from Planet X.

1129
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:40,300


1130
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,540
Unless, unless, friends, Bob Dobbs can swing the right kind of deal.

1131
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,640
And see, Bob is a salesman. The guru of our cult is the greatest salesman who has ever lived.

1132
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:57,920
And he's got to do his greatest sales job to make sure, friends, that Earth does not get sold.

1133
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:03,440
Because if the conspiracy controls this planet on X-Day 1998, my friends,

1134
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:10,340
why, the X-ists will take one look at this planet and decide that it's like a dog's been hit by a car on the side of the road.

1135
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,340


1136
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,280
They'll put it out of its misery, friends.

1137
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,380
Speaking of which, speaking of putting people out of their misery, Gary, I understand we have already tried the soul sucker on you, and you'd like to tell us how it felt.

1138
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,580
Uh, kind of like a great rush, sort of.

1139
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,200
A rush?

1140
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,840
Kind of indescribable. I can't really put it into words.

1141
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,680
Did it hurt?

1142
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,560
Kind of, but not...

1143
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,480
Because here it is again.

1144
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,400
No.

1145
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,960
That's a... over there.

1146
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:04,420
I think that Nostradamus stuff is great. I think Gary's a fantastic caller.

1147
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,880
It's true proof of Bob.

1148
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,440
Hey, that's true.

1149
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,740
That's what I say.

1150
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,880
Hey, true, man.

1151
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,320
True.

1152
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:10,960
Baby.

1153
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,120
This is Jimi Hendrix on the hour of slack.

1154
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,940
Hello, dear caller.

1155
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,340
Uh, hello. I've got, uh, about three things that are, uh, conspiracy...

1156
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,440
Squirt them out. It's a squirting universe.

1157
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,900
Okay. Uh, the first one?

1158
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,540
Yeah.

1159
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,080
You know, like, uh, can't get any good praise anymore, it's all dry-freezed, you know?

1160
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,920
Okay. Next thing?

1161
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,840
And, uh, you know how, uh, you buy your, uh, hot dogs and they come in packs of ten?

1162
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,740
Wait a minute. Your packs of hot dogs and packs of ten?

1163
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,200
Yeah.

1164
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,040
Oh, oh.

1165
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,100
And then you buy hot dog buns and they're eight.

1166
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:54,620
Right.

1167
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,120
Hot dog buns is eight. Okay. And then what?

1168
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,900
And then, uh, how the candle end doesn't have a metro line.

1169
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,260
A metro line?

1170
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:01,840
Yeah.

1171
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,220
Because you didn't send enough money, friend.

1172
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,300
I sent my money.

1173
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,160
Maybe he's right.

1174
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,260
Huh.

1175
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,940
Well, we can't talk about that on the air.

1176
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,280
Friends, this is, this is not a comedy show.

1177
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:23,000
Absolutely. Thanks for sharing that with us, caller. I, I'm even afraid to put that guy on the Soul Sucker. He might sue us.

1178
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:23,940
Oh.

1179
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,960
We got another caller.

1180
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,700
Listen to the swinging love corpses in the background here.

1181
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,100
Hello, caller. Hello?

1182
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,660
Uh, yes, uh, Augustine in City of the Gods, uh, Chapter 8, Line 22.

1183
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,380
Okay.

1184
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,240
I said no credit is whatever, whatever is to be given to you.

1185
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:48,960
Listen to the opinion that demons act as messengers and interpreters between gods and men to carry all petitions from us to the gods, and to bring us back, uh, to bring back to us the help of the gods.

1186
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,480
On the contrary, we must believe them to be spirits most...

1187
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:02,160
Friends, you know, the, it's, what he was saying is true. You gotta watch out.

1188
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,080
You gotta watch out.

1189
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,320
Watch out.

1190
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:05,940
Watch out.

1191
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:06,440
Watch out.

1192
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:07,740
Watch out.

1193
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,060
Watch out.

1194
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1195
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1196
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1197
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1198
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1199
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1200
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1201
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1202
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1203
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1204
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1205
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1206
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1207
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1208
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1209
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1210
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1211
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1212
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,060


1213
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:14,240
Hold on.

1214
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,240
I think Bob's just a guy with a pipe.

1215
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,840
Oh, that's crazy talk.

1216
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,140
They're not emotional.

1217
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,840
Angels don't have any emotions.

1218
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,920
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious that it's the worst in human history.

1219
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,600
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands.

1220
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:37,300
Every hour, we are getting news that our factories and our refineries and schools are being attacked

1221
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,720
with a lot of bale and ash.

1222
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:42,440
race of unknown origin. They haven't been analyzed so far. Professor, I know you've

1223
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,960
been in this book line study for many years. You know more about them than we

1224
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:57,160
do. Tell us, what should we do? Don't go up there at night. Stay in sunlight. Keep

1225
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,740
yourself safe and secure, and in the daylight, we'll draw you out of there.

1226
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:10,320
You've got to use all your power to knock them out. All your power... Laser guns?

1227
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:17,480
Laser guns. Not only laser guns, but your crew. Get them up there and knock them out.

1228
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,080
When you knock them out... But we're gonna have trouble with the launch pad.

1229
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,500
Well, the launch will be all right as soon as I can get there. We know we've

1230
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,520
been behind it for years.

1231
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,720
It's been a long time.

1232
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,240
It's been my research staff that came up with the initial evidence.

1233
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,700
Dr. Moore, can your staff come up with a weapon to stop the Nazi hell creatures in time?

1234
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:55,860
I can't say for sure, but we've got the physiological providers for the answers.

1235
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,280
A man? Is he a captain?

1236
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,080
What is he?

1237
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:19,000
Everybody's got love on the planet Everybody's got love on the planet

1238
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,980
The girls have all five tips on the planet

1239
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,260
Well friends, that was the swinging love corpses, which you may not know about. To begin with,

1240
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,540
with Love Planet.

1241
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,200
That's a fantasy world

1242
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,680
they dwell in, I think.

1243
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,880
Love Planet.

1244
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,660
What's wrong?

1245
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,660
It's sad, friends.

1246
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,980
But, what's...

1247
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,500
I don't know.

1248
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,180
I can't hear myself.

1249
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:45,840
You're on.

1250
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,640
Oh, well, we got a caller

1251
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,720
and this fella named Walter,

1252
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,380
in quotes,

1253
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,700
wants to give proof

1254
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,200
of the conspiracy

1255
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,180
and I think we need

1256
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,040
a little proof of the conspiracy

1257
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,200
from Walter.

1258
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,220
Walter.

1259
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Are you there, Walter?

1260
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,500
Yes.

1261
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,840
I am with you.

1262
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,620

1263
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,300
You better talk real loud, Walt.

1264
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,080
Talk loud, Walt.

1265
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,540
Okay, I have proof

1266
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,380
of the conspiracy

1267
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,020
that the phone company

1268
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,000
is in on it.

1269
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,640
Hurry.

1270
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,160

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,220
at four in the morning

1272
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,960
to share the word of Bob

1273
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,440
and start to tell them

1274
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,480
about Slack,

1275
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,300
the line goes dead.

1276
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,860
That is proof

1277
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,600
of the conspiracy.

1278
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,260
You score.

Anything else?

Oh, yes, dear friends.

We're right here.

It feels so good.

This is DK Jones.

1305
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,420
And I'm Pastor Buck Naked, and I'd like to say hi, girls.

1306
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,460
Well, also, I'd like to tell that guy that I do have a birthday present for his mother.

1307
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,220
No, we've been having fun with this rock and roller who's been calling us up and cussing us out.

1308
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:24,000
But that's okay because it's a free country and Bob lives, but, you know.

1309
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,640
Okay, friends, we've only got five minutes left to go on the show, and I'll tell you what.

1310
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,820
Every show I get down to the time where I'm in the show.

1311
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,320
I want to play the credits of the...

1312
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:33,580
What?

1313
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,540
And the sickening conviction that the man from Planet X...

1314
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,600
You can't say that out of the air.

1315
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,160
...had Enid powerless in his grasp.

1316
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,360
The man from Planet X?

1317
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,700
If she was to be saved, I had to think calmly.

1318
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,480
No, Bob.

1319
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,760
I checked off my resources.

1320
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,400
Where was Enid?

1321
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,740
Where was the man from Planet X?

1322
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,380
On a skateboard, on a skateboard.

1323
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,020
That's right.

1324
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,640
Uh, alright.

1325
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,300
To attempt an understanding of Bob without understanding his mortal enemies, the men from X,

1326
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,440
is to attempt seeing truth without knowing falsehood.

1327
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,040
It's the attempt to see light without knowing darkness.

1328
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,120
It cannot be.

1329
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,180
That was so sexy.

1330
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:09,600
The men from X?

1331
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,600
Are you ready for the soul sucker?

1332
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,660
Yeah.

1333
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,240
Are you ready?

1334
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:12,580
Yes.

1335
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,220
Here it is.

1336
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,280
No!

1337
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:14,840
Ah!

1338
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,340
Cole, are you alright?

1339
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:19,760
Yeah.

1340
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,360
You alright?

1341
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,460
I...

1342
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:21,920
Ah...

1343
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,620
Wow.

1344
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,040
I was gyrating.

1345
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,500
Here's a little more.

1346
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,400
No!

1347
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:26,840
Ah!

1348
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,580
Ah!

1349
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,360
Ah!

1350
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:29,440
Ah!

1351
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,400
Ah!

1352
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:30,480
Oh, here he is.

1353
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,280
I hear that guy's soul.

1354
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:31,800
All right, friend.

1355
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,780
Ben, your soul is black.

1356
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,020
Your soul is black.

1357
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,440
You know that?

1358
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,800
