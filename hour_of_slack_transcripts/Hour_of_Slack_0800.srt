1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Well, get this, because my sacred main multimedia womb module computer broke.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:22,340
This is not only a rerun of an old hour of slack, a number 114 from 1987 or so, produced on cassette tape.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:31,020
Hey, remember those old cassette tapes that I'm having to send out to the radio stations in the year 2001, dubbed on cassette tape.

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,660
But we will be back with the CDs soon. Give me slack or kill me.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Oh, it's biggin'. It's biggin'.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,380
We've had so many big days here lately that we just have more money than we know what to do with.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,500
And I hope that you do too someday.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,960
But, you know, big day can go on forever.

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,220
Yeah, that's right. It can go on.

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,960
For a long, large time.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,520
But you may wake up tomorrow and you're having a small day.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,400
Yeah, a small day.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,320
I might have a small day tomorrow. I kind of doubt it.

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,080
But it's possible.

15
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,280
Small days.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,240
Yeah, if it happens, it happens.

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,660
Now I don't know where the moral is or where the song should end.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,040
But I wonder just how many more.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,700
I don't know.

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,760
It's going to be tough. It's going to be bad.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,500
It's going to be bad.

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,820
She is good and we don't.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,320
We be in

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
Welcome dear friends

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
To the subgenius

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,920
Hour of Slack

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,420
Sponsored by the church

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,540
Of the subgenius

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,160
The subgenius

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
Hour of Slack

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,100
That you are about to listen to

32
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,600
Is specially designed

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,220
Only to be played

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,460
On radio station

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,060
And only in the city of

36
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,980
And I don't want to

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,300
You've got a much better mood

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,860
No I won't

39
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,760
No

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
Ultimately what

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,540
Know ye

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,440
Of the purity

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,300
Of the essence

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,800
Of hate

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,140
Of

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,080
Of

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,340
Envy

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Of

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,480
Of

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,300
Of

00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,380
Of

52
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,020
Of

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,240
Of

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,240


55
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,640
Of

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:02:59,840
Of

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:02:59,920
To

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:02:59,920


59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,240
To

60
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,360
To

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,460
To

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,360
To

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,620
To

64
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,040
To

65
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,780
To

66
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,780


67
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:04,860
To

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
I guess you bloodsuckers enjoy being repulsed, eh?

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,100
You're loyal to the gore.

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,820
Well, that's good.

71
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,500
We don't want any dead wood in our fraternity of fright fans.

72
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,000
That just...

73
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,640
Listen, I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins, spinning every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong.

74
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,360
I feel so bad, but it's good, good.

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,260
Yes, it is good.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,960
You are about to experience a totally new dimension in sound.

77
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,260
No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself.

78
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,920
We will remake man in our image, not his.

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,180
It's just like a...

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,880
The music is just going through.

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,100
Quick, the torch!

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,600
Get out of here!

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,660
You've got to match!

84
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,780
Get out of here!

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,460
I've got to match!

86
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,500
It is sound that surrounds you.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,720
In front, behind, above, below, all around you when you wear headphones.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
So, put on your headphones.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,340
You should be hearing me in your right ear.

90
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,000
If not, reverse your headphones.

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,620
You should now be hearing me in your left ear.

92
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
So now, sit back and enjoy a new dimension in sound.

93
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,100
The Kunzkopf Binaural Sound Experience.

94
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,800
I...

95
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,520
I...

96
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,580
Effective.

97
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,980
Done. Done.

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,720
Continue.

99
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,940
Who are we?

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,400
I was born a...

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
...bob.

102
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,900
Why?

103
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,080
That's a good question, Michael Pepe.

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,140
Well, you know, dear friends...

105
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,820
It's sort of like this.

106
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,040
I haven't had a cigarette in ten days now, friends.

107
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,540
That's right.

108
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,560
Your host, Rev. Ivan Stang,

109
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,920
hasn't had a cigarette in ten days.

110
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,180
Now, you non-smokers, you can laugh all you want,

111
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,360
but for me, it's like I can't touch one.

112
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,820
I won't and I can't.

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,100
It's like I've lost a loved one.

114
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,360
It really is.

115
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,140
It's just like...

116
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,420
It's like practice for grief.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,820
This is...

118
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,920
I'll be ready when a close relative dies next time.

119
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,840
It's about the same kind of thing.

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,740
See, last week, I still had enough of a brain left

121
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,180
at the back of my mind that I finally realized

122
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,120
I had to quit smoking.

123
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,260
And so I did, with the help of an injection.

124
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
A simple treatment, just a shot in the ear

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,000
at an acupuncture point.

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,540
A solution supposed to help your body retain

127
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,140
the nicotine that was in it so you don't crash so hard.

128
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,400
Oh, and, uh...

129
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,020
You know, when you quit...

130
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,780
When you go cold turkey,

131
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:15,820


132
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,680
off cigarettes, dear friends,

133
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,560
all reality changes.

134
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,620
You wish you could just be a baby again.

135
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,920
You want to crawl back inside there.

136
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,580
You get paranoid.

137
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,240
You feel like you want to turn yourself in to somebody.

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
Turn yourself in.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,700
But who are you gonna turn yourself in to?

140
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
Sort of like living in Russia.

141
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,720
It wasn't Popeye.

142
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,040
It wasn't Popeye sleeping on the street.

143
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,860
It was me.

144
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,020
I'm about worn out, friends.

145
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,600
You tell, baby.

146
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,060
It's like being hollowed out.

147
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,200
Every...

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Every cell.

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,080
And you can't hit the demon that's making the pain come.

150
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,200
You can't shoot him.

151
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
You can't stop that kind of pain.

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
It's a hurt that ain't like pain.

153
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,040
It's a brain hurt.

154
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
Every cell hurts.

155
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,640
And nobody knows.

156
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,160
You certainly don't know.

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,980
Not even you.

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,640
Because I haven't worsened anybody.

159
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,480
We're gonna continue on with some more enlightening material later on.

160
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,860
But I want you to know that when you...

161
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,760
You smokers out there, you might as well keep smoking.

162
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,020
It ain't worth quitting.

163
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,460
It ain't.

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,040
It's terrible.

165
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't believe the non-smokers.

166
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,800
After about a week, you start belching up the taste of metal.

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,700
The taste of the end of a ballpoint pen in elementary school.

168
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,620
Starts coming up out of your stomach.

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,100
When you least expect it.

170
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,420
Your sleep is disrupted.

171
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,200
You'll fall asleep at 7.30 in the evening.

172
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,660
And then wake up at midnight.

173
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,620
And twitching.

174
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,080
Twitching.

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Make passing horrible...

176
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,960
Extruded materials from your body.

177
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,860
Blurred vision.

178
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,120
Clammy limpness alternating with raging...

179
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,180
Blood engorged...

180
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,600
Horrors from your body.

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,220
And sneezing, snot and allergies.

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,960
Cramps.

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,000
Tremors.

184
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,080
The shakes.

185
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,220
Tumors.

186
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,980
And the worst part.

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,980
But maybe the most necessary part.

188
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,940
Is the fights.

189
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,720
The fights that you go over in your head.

190
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,520
Not in real life.

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,540
Just in your head.

192
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,000
You think of all the mean things you ever wanted to say to anybody.

193
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,300
And you say them in your head over and over again.

194
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,780
Because they don't know exactly the right thing to say to you when you're totally freaked out.

195
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,420
They come up and go, can I help you?

196
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,180
Can I get you anything?

197
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,760
And then you'll start into it.

198
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,060
You'll go, oh, can you get me anything?

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
And you realize, oh, no, no, this isn't real.

200
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:47,980
No.

201
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,620
You go, no, no thanks.

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,960
I don't need anything.

203
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,920
And...

204
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
And you feel pretty bad, friend.

205
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,200
So don't believe anything I say.

206
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,440
Don't believe anything I...

207
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,560
You hear it in my mouth.

208
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,860
This show, last show, or the next few shows.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,980
You kids out there that do crack.

210
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,200
You don't...

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,300
You don't know nothing.

212
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,460
Tobacco is the ultimate crack, friends.

213
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,560
Well, maybe not.

214
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,760
No, I can think of something else that might be the ultimate crack, but...

215
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,660
Oh.

216
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,780
Oh, no, no, no, no.

217
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,720
Oh, the music here is from Doc Stock.

218
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,120
Beautiful, beautiful Doc Stock.

219
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,200
This is, uh...

220
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,420
I think some broken combination of Doctorsters for Bob,

221
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,860
Pope David N. Meyer on drums,

222
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,740
and Dr. Philo Drummond,

223
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,600
Sterno on bass,

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,380
and, uh...

225
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,320
Gene Splice on the...

226
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,840
on the...

227
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,980
skitzed-out guitar.

228
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,760
Thank y'all.

When stress builds and you're about to lash out, stop.

Take time out.

233
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,360
Don't take it out on your kid.

234
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,520
Don't take hold of your child until you get a hold of yourself.

253
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,680
in an egg. We're going to look for low-level cell activity at the beginnings of life.

254
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,400
A fire and for a mighty rushing wind which will cover the face of the earth and wipe clean the

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,200
scourge of woolly thinking once and for all. It's satisfying though. I don't understand what

256
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,760
happened. This is a situation unlike any experience by modern man.

257
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,820
Folks, you are looking at a real life drama.

258
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,360
Quack, quack, quack here. Quack, quack there. Gas with amazement as I fell back asleep.

259
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,500
Yeah, folks.

260
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,360
Come on, don't confuse people. I've been listening on the radio and probably two people crashed right

261
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,600
now as you said that thinking, I'm late. I'm late. Crash. We talked about doing

262
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,000
this. We talked about this show for so long. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

263
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,020
I don't know.

264
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,540
We leap up and go.

265
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Are we not radio?

266
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,500
E-Radio.

267
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:33,760
E-Radio.

268
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,700
T-D-O-N.

269
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,740
Oh, yeah.

270
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,700
Did you say kill me?

271
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,800
Yeah.

272
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah.

273
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,620
Yeah.

274
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,260
Yeah.

275
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,720
Yeah.

276
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,260
Yeah.

277
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,540
Yeah.

278
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,040
Yeah.

279
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,420
A-2. Listen to them.

280
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,140
Yeah.

281
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah.

282
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
He's right here in the script.

283
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah.

284
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,580
He's right here in the script.

285
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,360
Page 8, yeah, there you go, hello.

286
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:22,960
Hello.

287
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,500
Great.

288
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,240
Oh.

289
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,120
Paging number 8, caller.

290
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:26,920
Hello.

291
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,580
Yeah, this must be, you're going to be Hal, right?

292
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,540
I'll be Hal?

293
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,820
Yeah, aren't you Hal this morning?

294
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,840
Yeah, I'm Hal.

295
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,300
Okay.

296
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,220
Who are you?

297
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,760
Well, hey, Hal.

298
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,860
Hal doesn't recognize us anymore.

299
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,860
Who are you?

300
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm just one of the Dugs.

301
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,520
Come on, Hal.

302
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,400
You're Dugs?

303
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm Hal.

304
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm any of the Dugs, yeah.

305
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,100
You're one of the Dugs?

306
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,460
Yeah.

307
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,080
Oh.

308
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,260
Okay, wait here, Hal.

309
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,600
I can't wait that long.

310
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm calling long distance.

311
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,920
Okay, go ahead.

312
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
Hey, state short Hal question.

313
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,340
Right?

314
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,220
What?

315
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,880
Oh, I mean, maybe, that's where I thought I was here.

316
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Isn't that where I am on the script?

317
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,280
State short Hal question?

318
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:04,960
Wow.

319
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,660
Right?

320
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,220
Right?

321
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Is that right?

322
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,780
Oh, okay, wait a minute.

323
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,380
I think, I see what the problem is.

324
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,620
It's...

325
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,620
Yeah.

326
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,120
Okay.

327
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah, no, wait.

328
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:15,760
Hello.

329
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,860
No, I think I got it.

330
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,300
No, I got it.

331
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Okay, caller, I got it.

332
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,740
Sorry.

333
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,620
Yeah, I got it now.

334
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,700
Oh, man, yeah.

335
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah.

336
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,340
It's kind of scary there, because you think for a minute you don't have it together, and

337
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,560
then you think, oh, I got it, but...

338
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:27,960
Hey, Hal.

339
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,120
What?

340
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,800
Hal.

341
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
Oh, hi, Hal.

342
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,300
Well, at any rate, it doesn't matter how I say it.

343
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,780
It's just...

344
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,140
Let's see you come out of that.

345
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,740
Oh, it's an ugly, ugly situation.

346
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,340
Oh, горdy!

347
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,860
Buddy, let me know what's on.

348
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:52,980
Apparently, the investment you're putting in a Yesная found that it's a little stupid,

349
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:52,980


350
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:52,980


351
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:52,980


352
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:52,980


353
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,320
Where is that?

354
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,740
Yeah, see, ah...

355
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,840
You called me out in the middle of it.

356
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,880
A little

357
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,020
of this, I broke it up.

358
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,880
See if we can find a lot more expansion and info.

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,160
friends, and you've got to help me. You've got to pray for me, and you've got to call

360
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:32,760
the Will of Dobbs at 823-7490. He's got nothing better to do. Yes, you can get, come on, call

361
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:47,660
823-7490 for phone social intercourse with a beautiful live man. So friends, be a winner,

362
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:54,200
don't be a loser. I can't, I have to be a winner. I can't start smoking again, or my kids would be

363
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:02,700
disgusted, totally disgusted. So would I. I'd be, I'd be, I'd be in loser mode because of that,

364
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,060
from cigarettes. But instead, I'm going to be a winner, friend, like they say in those stupid

365
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,320
motivational tapes. And the fact that I can even say this and joke about it only 10 days after my

366
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,420
last cigarette, wow, that's proof that the treatment works, even if it's just

367
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,640
something that I can't do.

368
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:24,260
Psychological faith healing. So, so friends, like I say, I haven't killed anybody yet. I quit

369
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,060
smoking, and I haven't killed anybody. Haven't mistreated my, my dog, haven't killed it. I didn't

370
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:37,760
do nothing. No, I didn't. I swear, I did nothing. I, I made certain suggestions from certain

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,120
philosophical viewpoints with my friend, Dr. Philo Drummond, but we, we were merely throwing

372
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,640
out possibilities. We weren't giving orders. We were speaking to people. We weren't giving orders.

373
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,100
We were speaking metaphorically. We'd never in our wildest dreams have imagined that some

374
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:59,340
misguided, misbegotten teenage normals would go out and do these things to, uh, respected golfers.

375
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,200
It was, it was artwork, officer. That's all artwork. That's all we're doing. Artwork. You

376
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,140
have a light. Does anybody have a light? The batteries in this radio are dead as hell.

377
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,680
I told you.

378
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,860
Will it hold?

379
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,380
What?

380
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,720
Are you sure?

381
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,780
Whew. Yeah. Yeah, it's alright. I promise.

382
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,960
Yatahey, Ray Spruce. Yatahey, Chief Woodenhead. I am ashamed to stand inside this place.

383
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,660
And you, for cranking up history, the pin-

384
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,880
I'm gonna pay you a fine.

385
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,620
If not, you'll pay the Sons of the Seventh.

386
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,620
If it doesn't pay off, you'll be hanged.

387
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,180
Nothing matters. Determined to take us with them. It means force. I'll handle this.

388
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,860
No. No, no, Savvy. You know, my Sunday school teacher used to-

389
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,880
You say you gotta learn to swallow disappointments in this sad life.

390
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,340
We are so mercifully free of the ravages of intelligence.

391
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,780
You save us.

392
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,740
Robert, we must plan a new world together. This time, we're started properly.

393
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,420
And again in Ruth 16, 23, we read,

394
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,220
For we shall gain great comfort from this, that he who shall turn his head from the brightness of the Lord shall have it loose from his neck.

395
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,000
And since we have time for debate, let's close now the passage from Ezekiel 12, 14.

396
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,260
Hmm.

397
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,380
Hmm.

398
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,940
Busy, busy, busy. Want a cup of coffee? You don't have a bathroom, do you? Don't pump me.

399
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,400
You know how things go.

400
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,120
Hmm.

401
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,460
Hmm.

402
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,100
Busy, busy, busy. Want a cup of coffee? You don't have a bathroom, do you? Don't pump me.

403
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,420
You know how things go.

404
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,800
Hey, hey, hey!

405
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,300
Everybody knows you run around town.

406
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,320
All my friends. What you doin'?

407
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,500
Way up there.

408
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

409
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:27,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

410
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:36,240
Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

411
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh, dear friends, that was Michael Pepe.

412
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,740
Michael Pepe, pope, and what is his subgenius name? I can't even remember.

413
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,020
Y'all keep your eyes open for Michael Pepe. That's from a tape that he did.

414
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,220
Um, I don't think it's commercially available, but you can if you want to call us.

415
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:18,300
And find out where to get those, um, you can at least get our address, which we'll also be reading at the end of the broadcast.

416
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:26,480
Or watch out in a couple of months for the book High Weirdness by Mail, which will tell you where to get all of these, uh, things.

417
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
But you can't get it yet. It's not available.

418
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,200
Um, just keep your eyes open. A book, High Weirdness by Mail.

419
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,260
Just pick it up in the store and every time you hear an hour of slack, go in the store the next morning.

420
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,440
You don't have to buy the book or anything.

421
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:49,140
You just look up the name of the person I played on the show, and there will be their address, and, uh, just copy it down right there in the store. No problem.

422
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,100
Do you believe you got a conscience that'll put you to death?

423
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,400
Or do you think you don't believe you got one?

424
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,760
What can I do to you?

425
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,360
That's me sick of all this talking and fussing about nonsense.

426
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,200
Shut up, White Ice.

427
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,420
Or else I'll have to shove something into your mouth to kill you.

428
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,420


429
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,420
I'll keep you quiet. Hey, Sam.

430
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,560
Now, eat the egg.

431
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,060
Go!

432
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,500
Shit, shut up!

433
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,360
Yeah, why don't you run us out of town, Chef?

434
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,880
Or I'm gonna ask my buddy here to bring me something off the hardware shelf that I can use to slice off your fingers.

435
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,400
Move, lady, or I'm gonna blow off your old man's Uncle Bishis!

436
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,560
Time-ho!

437
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,340
Cowboys and Indians were never like this.

438
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,100
I've gone empty.

439
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,480
I'm gonna kick your ass.

440
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,920
Yeah, bang, bang.

441
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,080
Aborted fetuses that we rescued.

442
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,560
Huh?

443
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,480
Immortality.

444
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,900
Oh, now, come on.

445
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:48,980
Well...

446
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,560
Here they come. Stay down. Here they come.

447
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,680
Scary little ugly things.

448
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,920
That's a heliopter.

449
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,480
I don't understand why our own church sends these things in to try to kill us on our own show.

450
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,540
Well, it's part of the dogma.

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,020
That was the only show we'll try to kill, dude.

452
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,980
If I can't talk, I'll vote.

453
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,820
How do I know? I can't think anymore.

454
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,300
That's how it is.

455
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,660
Just trying to remember something.

456
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,560
Oh, I can't breathe.

457
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,340
What did you say?

458
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,400
I can't breathe.

459
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,180
I don't understand.

460
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:19,400
Oh, yeah.

461
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,220
I've seen people do that.

462
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,460
I think they eat black rock.

463
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,120
You'll have to be thankful for it.

464
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,880
Oh, there we go.

465
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,200
Beautiful.

466
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,060
As we listen to the music being played, there are thousands of low-income people in Dallas struggling to survive.

467
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,400
They are families.

468
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
Single women with children.

469
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,540
The elderly.

470
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,120
The young.

471
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,640
The poor.

472
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,440
The common people trying to edge out a living to get justice.

473
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,460
That battering situation, it ended with me being shot and left paralyzed.

474
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:59,300
I don't think that I could be here today if it wasn't for the fact that I care so much about women.

475
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,380
From the initial report that they gave us, it doesn't seem like they made much of a difference.

476
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,660
I think that they made much headway in making these loans available to the low- and moderate-income people.

477
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,680
These voices, for the most part, go unheard or take a back seat with other media.

478
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:25,120
And it's time for us to stand up and be counted and recognize we need somebody down there with voices and can be heard.

479
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
Not seen, but be heard.

480
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:34,120
Stand up and let them know that it's not just her speaking up, but it's for everybody who really wants these things done.

481
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:41,600
The movement back in the 60s, and yet we've come a long ways, but there's still a lot that has to be done.

482
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,120
When it comes to people like us, we go to the bank, fairly good critic or bad critic.

483
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
It doesn't really matter.

484
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,660
They're not going to loan us any money.

485
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,340
With an organization like yours, maybe we could get together and form a committee like the young lady said, and get to work.

486
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,560
You know, instead of talking, let's do something.

487
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,320
Get up off our do-nothings, you know.

488
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,940
And stop sitting on the premises.

489
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,100
You know?

490
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,460
And stand on the promise.

491
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,660
You know, she asked me if this would make a difference.

492
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:16,280
And I said, well, you can bet your bottom dollar this is going to be the topic of conversation at the banks that were represented here this weekend for a long time to come.

493
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,500
But no single event like this changes things.

494
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:31,080
It's the accumulation of events and pressing the challenges and pressing the negotiations and pressing home the point of the problems in the neighborhoods that's going to create the change.

495
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,320
Or something like that.

496
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,460
If you like what it's about, we will equip you with a tape recorder and teach you how to make a difference.

497
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,620
What time is the show in tonight?

498
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Same old time.

499
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,360
Same old time?

500
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:46,740
Yeah.

501
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,160
What time is that?

502
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,360
What time is that?

503
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,560
I don't know, man.

504
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,340
Do you have a ticket?

505
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,900
Yeah, I got a ticket.

506
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Okay, great.

507
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,480
You got your ticket?

508
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,320
Yeah, I hope so.

509
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,260
I hope so, too.

510
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,000
Okay, I'm going to go check the bags in.

511
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,500
See you wait here.

512
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,300
Okay.

513
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,300


514
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,300


515
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,300


516
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,300


517
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,300


518
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,340
Hello?

519
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,880
Oh, hello.

520
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,260
zoals números Representativeを赤2が答えた

521
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,260


522
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,420
I'm here.

523
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,100
I've got to go.

524
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,740
I have a quarter of that.

525
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,340
Quarter quarter.

526
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,560
You got a quarter?

527
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
Sure, here you go.

528
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,360
Thanks.

529
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,160
Thanks.

530
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,300


531
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,020
Here I go.

532
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,140
You know, you really shouldn't be wasting so much time with this dumb machine.

533
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,420
Quiet, you're making it mad.

534
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,040
Why haven't you found a job yet?

535
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,880
Have you got another quarter? I want to play it again.

536
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,940
Sure, here you go.

537
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,740
You know, you're...

538
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,320
Have you got another quarter?

539
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,400
Sure, here you go.

540
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,080
Thanks.

541
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,260
Here I go.

542
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,460
You know, you really shouldn't be wasting so much time with this dumb machine.

543
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,100
Have you got another quarter?

544
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,060
Here you go.

545
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,340
Thanks.

546
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,860
Thanks. Shouldn't be wasting so much time with this dumb machine.

547
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,340
Quiet.

548
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,860
Why haven't you found a job yet?

549
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,500
Here I go.

550
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,400
Why haven't you found a job yet?

551
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:04,700
Quiet.

552
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,340
Why haven't you found a job yet?

553
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,900
Because I want more than a job.

554
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:08,940
Well, I...

555
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,460
Attacker.

556
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,020
Attacker.

557
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,060
I want to play it again.

558
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,120
Have you got another quarter?

559
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:12,800
Sure.

560
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,460
Thanks.

561
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,880
Here I go.

562
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,760
Why haven't you found a job yet?

563
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,040
Quiet, you frauds.

564
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,600
Attacker.

565
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,160
Have you got...

566
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,580
Here you go.

567
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,200
You know, you really shouldn't be...

568
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,460
Quiet.

569
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,280
Well...

570
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:22,840
Attacker.

571
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Attacker.

572
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
I want to play it again.

573
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,000
Sure.

574
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,120
You frauds.

575
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,520
Thanks.

576
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,320
Here I go.

577
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,960
Here I go.

578
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,940
Why haven't you found a job yet?

579
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,340
Quiet.

580
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:30,720
Sure.

581
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,480
Attacker.

582
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,020
Have you got...

583
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,440
Here you go.

584
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,120
Here I go.

585
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,620
You know, you really shouldn't...

586
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,000
Frauds.

587
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,420
Quiet.

588
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,340
You're making it mad.

589
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Why haven't you found a job yet?

590
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,560
I want to...

591
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:39,980
Here you go.

592
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,620
Thanks.

593
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,300
Sure.

594
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,240
Why haven't you found a job yet?

595
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,140
I really want to...

596
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,660
Aim high.

597
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,640
Well, why can't you find something like that?

598
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:47,980
Quiet.

599
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,120
You're making it mad.

600
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,000
Attacker.

601
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,320
Quarter.

602
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,720
Dumb, dumb, so dumb.

603
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,800
You're making it mad.

604
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,560
Attacker.

605
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,120
Quarter.

606
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,740
Sure.

607
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,220
Thanks.

608
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,520
Sure.

609
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,340
You frauds.

610
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,320
Why haven't you found a job yet?

611
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,780
Dumb.

612
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,220
Attacker.

613
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,660
Here you go.

614
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,260
Thanks.

615
00:27:59,440 --> 00:27:59,920
Sure.

616
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,860
Why haven't you found a job yet?

617
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,580
Aim high.

618
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,000
Dumb.

619
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,520
Attacker.

620
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:04,760
Quarter.

621
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,460
Here you go.

622
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,080
Thanks.

623
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,780
Dumb machine.

624
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,480
So dumb.

625
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,800
Haven't you found a job yet?

626
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
Because I want more than a job.

627
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,220
Attacker.

628
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,840
Attacker.

629
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,820
Have you got another quarter?

630
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,040
Have you got...

631
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,800
I want to play it again.

632
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,520
Well, that was negative land.

633
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,300
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.

634
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,360
He has come and keeps coming again and again,

635
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,940
not to forgive your sins,

636
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,960
but to rationalize them,

637
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
to justify your sins.

638
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,880
Rather than forgiveness,

639
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,040
he offers something far more powerful.

640
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
An excuse.

641
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,660
A divine, all-inclusive excuse

642
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,640
which allows the bearer to free himself

643
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,760
from the grip of temptation

644
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,420
by overindulging in it

645
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,060
until it releases him.

646
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,200
The true seeker must give himself up to temptation

647
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
or he will never conquer it.

648
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,360
As Bob says,

649
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,460
too much is always better

650
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
than not enough.

651
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,260
The sad, weakly self-denial

652
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,240
preached by the New Age movement

653
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,940
is pure conspiracy pabla.

654
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,340
The true son or daughter of Bob

655
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,400
knows that our universe

656
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,880
is no laid-back,

657
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,840
home-chanting cosmos,

658
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,960
but an active, tumultuous,

659
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,300
squirting universe

660
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,260
bent on rampant reproduction

661
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,460
and easy grins.

662
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,280
The false cults may try to teach

663
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,560
personal transformation,

664
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,740
psychic development,

665
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,680
human potential,

666
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,720
but Bob goes straight for the glands

667
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,880
and seeks to amplify the self,

668
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,500
to bloat the abnormality potential

669
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,560
of his pupils.

670
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,660
Only through excess

671
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,380
can one contact the lower self

672
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,460
where the real decisions are made.

673
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't just eat a hamburger,

674
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,560
eat the hell out of it.

675
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,580
The advanced initiate, once freed from

676
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,840
conspiracy programming,

677
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,580
as well as the worldly goods

678
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,840
that had enslaved him,

679
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,920
makes his pilgrimage to Dobstown,

680
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,860
the church's fabul-

681
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,040
walled encampment

682
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,840
deep in the jungles of Malaysia.

683
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,000
There, the initiate's third nostril

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,280
is surgically opened by psychic surgeons,

685
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,400
allowing him or her to

686
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,720
whiff-read the psychic stench

687
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,700
of those around him.

688
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,580
He masters the mystic sciences of

689
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,540
schizofreniatrics and memory editing,

690
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,820
creating a clean slate on the way to his death.

691
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,200
The first thing Bob can do

692
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,820
is to read the book of the

693
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,780
The Art of Excremeditation,

694
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,460
which is taught by the mind

695
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,260
that is void upon the great throne of relief.

696
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,500
As soon as you turn your back,

697
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,220
everything in the universe

698
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,640
snaps itself inside out

699
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,380
with a hideous sucking motion.

700
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,020
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible

701
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
is because it is only through the world

702
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,640
that you know the concept of impossibility.

703
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,820
You have been enlightened,

704
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,520
and led to believe that everyone feels

705
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,600
he or she may be the only living consciousness,

706
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,900
but you are in fact the only one

707
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,560
for whom this is true.

708
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,440
The fundamental structure of reality

709
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,180
is totally transformed every instant,

710
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,320
but it provides you with a phony memory

711
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,160
that it has always been the way it is.

712
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,280
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity,

713
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,120
there is no such thing as movement,

714
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,520
location, space, or time.

715
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,540
You are a row of electrochemical events

716
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,080
taking place in your cerebrum.

717
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,060
Nothing has meaning in itself,

718
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,720
but everything can support any meaning.

719
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,360
If you could glimpse for even a moment

720
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,040
the real meaning of existence,

721
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,620
your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

722
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,660
You cannot conceive of a thing

723
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,820
for which you do not have a word.

724
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,160
Everyone's perception is radically unique,

725
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,040
but leads them to believe

726
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,680
it is more or less similar for everyone else.

727
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,320
You have always been listening to this tape.

728
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,260
You cannot remember a time before you were born

729
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,900
because there was no such time, nor any other.

730
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,200
It has always been this moment.

731
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,140
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

732
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,980
The oddness of the world exceeds the imagination by an infinity.

733
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,120
It has produced this talking about it,

734
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,600
this talker,

735
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,440
this labeling of it,

736
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,780
this labeler,

737
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,960
the concept of labeling,

738
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,900
the concept of oddness,

739
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,900
the word oddness,

740
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,880
the concept of truth,

741
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,240
the concept of a word,

742
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,220
the word word,

743
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,380
the word concept,

744
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,460
and the concept of a concept.

745
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,240
Consciousness is not a continuous state,

746
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,640
but a momentary surfacing for variable periods at random points.

747
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,640
Your next awakening could be 20 years from now.

748
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,060
Nothing can be proven to be true.

749
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,880
Because reality is composed of infinitesimally small moments,

750
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,000
there is no such thing as an event.

751
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,980
The reason people are untrustworthy

752
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,560
is because their cerebral processes are fundamentally random ones.

753
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,300
During the night, every ego in the world changes bodies,

754
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,500
inheriting also the memory.

755
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,100
Old age is not a gradual, but a catastrophic process,

756
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,840
and could strike at any moment.

757
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,760
Dreams are the reality for which the real world is a dream.

758
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,920
There has never been a time in history

759
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,380
when men have voluntarily used less than the greatest possible military technology against their enemy,

760
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,940
and allowed a great technology to fall into disuse and ignorance.

761
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:14,480
Therefore, there will be a full-scale nuclear holocaust.

762
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,260
You are dreaming this moment.

763
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,800
The universe will continue to expand

764
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,900
until there is not enough matter per unit space

765
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,720
to provide the gravity necessary for regeneration,

766
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,520
and it will slowly die out.

767
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,060
When you finish listening to this,

768
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,640
everything will be different from the way it was when you began.

769
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,180
But again, your new memory will conceal this from you.

770
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,540
All events occur at random.

771
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,200
The universe is one of an infinite number of universes,

772
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,880
the closest of which is undetectable,

773
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,700
being a billion universe lengths away.

774
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,800
Only what you are experiencing right now exists.

775
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,840
Love is the feeling that another person is really yourself.

776
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,320
You are about to make the first conscious decision of your life.

777
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:23,740
S Francisco

778
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:23,800
Mir syst겠

779
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,060
Trans í

780
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,900
안

781
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,160
You're in big trouble now, dear friends.

782
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,880
You now have the power.

783
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,480
What are you going to do with it, huh?

784
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,200
Well, that was Pope M. Ho-Pep,

785
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,000
Innocent III,

786
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,040
or Reverend Michael Pepe,

787
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,720
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack radio ministry

788
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,760
here on KNON.

789
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,900
The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

790
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,380
I don't want to win the seat.

791
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,180
Hey, wait a minute.

792
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm sorry, you're going to have to use a Texan accent

793
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,220
if you want to be on the show.

794
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,160
You got a nice accent.

795
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,360
You can hear the accent that Ivan has here.

796
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,040
He scared him away.

797
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,480
We talk about talking like a real man,

798
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,420
and they just disappear.

799
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,700
Huh!

800
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,500
Huh!

801
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,980
Another holy huh.

802
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,900
Huh!

803
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:22,620
Wow.

804
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,740
A plug of noise whizzing past your ears.

805
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,620
That's what we do.

806
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,920
Take the old cotton wad that comes with this station

807
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,440
and clean it out for Bob.

808
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,580
There he is now.

809
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,640
Which one's the real Bob?

810
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,000
Which one's the conspiracy Bob?

811
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,740
He was a bad good bro friend.

812
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
You know, he was a bad one.

813
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,160
So welcome to KNON radio from Center Highway.

814
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,920
It's the best radio station in the world.

815
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,880
It's a little bit early in the morning,

816
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,240
but we can clean up because these fabulous studios down here

817
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,920
are equipped with showers and a full sports gymnasium

818
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,140
right here next to the KNON.

819
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:09,520
That's right.

820
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,080
If you want to radio hoes out, this is the place to be.

821
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,700
More book.

822
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah, we want more book listening to this show.

823
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,700
Yeah, get more book, I'll say.

824
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,380
Ooh, on YouTube.

825
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,320
Ooh.

826
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,620
Okay, we just have to play this music, all right?

827
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,900
Then we'll be able to go home.

828
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,460
And you, the listener, will be free.

829
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,580
Oh, not yet.

830
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,180
No.

831
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,380
Got a little bit more music to listen to, boys and girls.

832
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,560
Here on KPFA in Berkeley.

833
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,560
Whoa.

834
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:41,560


835
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,740
Good, Gino!

836
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:46,980
Whoa.

837
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,200
And I've been, you know...

838
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,080
Since I quit smoking.

839
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,920
Fortunately, I don't have a job right now,

840
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,080
so I've been sitting around watching a lot of horror movies,

841
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,600
renting horror videos,

842
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,000
so as to enjoy the miseries of those in more pain than myself.

843
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,300
I've been, you know, I would really blow it

844
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,380
were I to work too hard,

845
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,060
so I'm refusing to force myself back into any emergentile work mode,

846
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,720
because if I do that, then enough brain cells

847
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,960
would probably be awakened,

848
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,900
awakened to justify smoking again.

849
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,640
I'd be able to...

850
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,420
I'd be aware enough to think up some elaborate reason,

851
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,660
so I'm staying as dumb as possible.

852
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,680
And you can, too, friends.

853
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,820
Just keep listening to this show.

854
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,060
Or call 823-7490.

855
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,540
Or write to the Church of the Subgenius for information.

856
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,700
We'll be giving that box if we don't forget.

857
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,260
Yeah.

858
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,820
The ironic thing is,

859
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,080
I quit smoking and I developed this horrible cough.

860
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,060
A painful cough.

861
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,980
The doctor warned me about it.

862
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,320
He said, your lungs will heal up

863
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,060
and you'll have a, quote, productive cough,

864
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,460
which means a cough producing phlegm and mucus

865
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,660
and also terrible pain.

866
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,340
And so I'll spend an hour hacking and hacking

867
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,260
with my poor bruised rib cage,

868
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,080
aching and aching,

869
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,860
and my brain ruined.

870
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:19,980
And...

871
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,200
Oh.

872
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,040
I can tell I'll never be able to write again.

873
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,940
I'll have to...

874
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,220
have to avoid water instead.

875
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,420
Makes you lightheaded.

876
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
Sort of like being a...

877
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,460
a speed freak Spider-Man.

878
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,920
You know, in sixth grade, hell yeah, you were a man.

879
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,720
That was the big kid world.

880
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,740
You go, yeah.

881
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,160
Yeah, I'm in sixth grade.

882
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,080
Yeah, my daddy gave me a gun.

883
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

884
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,940
I drove my brother's car.

885
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,760
Oh, I've got some cocaine.

886
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,320
I smoke cigarettes.

887
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,040
That's what they say in sixth grade.

888
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,740
They say yes to drugs, the fools.

889
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,620
And that's one reason why I'm quitting.

890
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,080
So the kids, the kids will see that even if you're dumb enough

891
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,760
to get hooked on drugs like cigarettes,

892
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,480
that you can quit.

893
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,760
Even the worst drugs, cigarettes.

894
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,920
The one that's safe.

895
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


896
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


897
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


898
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


899
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


900
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:20,920


901
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,660
It's legal because no one can quit it.

902
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,340
Sort of like alcohol.

903
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,280
It's funny, isn't it?

904
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,640
How the two most addictive things in the universe

905
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,040
are the two legal ones.

906
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,160
Because the lawmakers can't quit either.

907
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,520
I can tell that cough is coming back.

908
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,360
Chunks of lung...

909
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,560
being coughed up.

910
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,240
Actually, it's not really chunks of lung, friends.

911
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,360
It's mostly ordinary, plain sputum.

912
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,300
But there's a taste of blood in the mouth.

913
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,680
And my wife says I smell like vitamins all the time

914
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,580
instead of tobacco.

915
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,020
So search your soul, friends.

916
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,640
Is there anything funnier, I ask you,

917
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,240
than another man's pain?

918
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,740
Is there...

919
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,160
You know, really, nothing is more delightful

920
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,420
to the eye of a great man or great subgenius

921
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,720
than the pain of another being.

922
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,340
The pain of a fool.

923
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,380
Uh...

924
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,380
A man even more fu...

925
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,180
I wish I had a cigarette.

926
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
...hoolish than us.

927
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,760
But, uh, instead, all I can do is

928
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,780
deliriously rant and spout

929
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,060
like I'm doing a useless, shambling once-man...

930
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,860
a thing.

931
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,020
A thing.

932
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,320
No, it's okay. I just...

933
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,800
I wish I had a cigarette.

934
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,640
I'm on normal. I'm okay. I'm okay.

935
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,940
I need my pills.

936
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,720
I'm gonna kill myself, friends.

937
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,980
I'm gonna finish this show first.

938
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,500
But only so that you listeners can know

939
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,000
that you helped to drive me to suicide.

940
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,280
Because you're laughing, aren't you?

941
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,520
You think it's funny?

942
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,460
I can tell.

943
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,920
Oh, God. Oh, devil.

944
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,900
Or UFO beings. Or astrology spirits.

945
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,820
Or Ramtha. Or any deity.

946
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,580
Jesus. Odin. Buddha.

947
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,180
Make it go away.

948
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,660
Oh.

949
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,120
?

950
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,000
?

951
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,400
?

952
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,880
?

953
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,580
?

954
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:32,600
?

955
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:32,600


956
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:32,600


957
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,120
Hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna

958
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,700
Hare Rama, Rama, Rama

959
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,920
Bodhisattva, won't you take me by the hand

960
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,060
Someone to watch over me

961
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,400
Ave Maris Te La

962
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,420
Dei Mater Ama

963
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,940
So nice to be with you again.

964
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,260
Start a new week together?

965
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,080
Tomorrow, tomorrow

966
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,020
We'll start the day tomorrow

967
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,800
With a song or two

968
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,140
I'm not the only

969
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,380
songwriter

970
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:43,380


971
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,160
Solar, cue, start, hit and run

972
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,980
Tad Jack started, watch your back again

973
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,200
See if that's your fun

974
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,300
See if that's your fun

975
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,640
See if that's your fun

976
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:00,860
See if that's your fun

977
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,060
See if that's your fun

978
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,660
I must leave your planet now and return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings.

979
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,300
I will give them my report and I will be destroyed.

980
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,440
I have failed in my mission, not because I am weak, but because you are stronger.

981
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,700
We boldly should value the day as a national today,

982
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,180
charge the Argentine government with blatant violations of human rights of the very...

983
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:45,920
Phone, code, nucleus, multiple house, bloom, blood, germinate the sign of host.

984
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,360
Sempre liberati, geofolli, gianni, te gioia,

985
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,280
you look up and I'll be gone.

986
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,940
Bit by bit I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not heed my urgency.

987
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,300
Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today?

988
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,080
Make an alarm, cause they out in the town.

989
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,560
Watchin' all the tech dogs.

990
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,620
Oh, I'll say shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, now.

991
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,460
Yeah, we got for you.

992
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,440
We're thinking, we're thinking out there.

993
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,020
We're cleaning, we're cleaning out there.

994
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,400
Who are we? We're the communication people.

995
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,040
The people who've taught us scripted state of the art technology.

996
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,580
It's disposable, reversible, reusable with almost any leading ground of idea,

997
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,960
including our DevOps life.

998
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,760
Your...

999
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,720
Apple boom.

1000
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:38,500
Oh my God, I said you.

1001
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,640
Them doggies moving.

1002
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,560
The rickish you.

1003
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,440
Hey you, talk to me.

1004
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:43,920
Come on.

1005
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,500
The only cannon, number nine.

1006
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,200
The waltz you see, the twist.

1007
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,220
El Dorado, can you draw a bead on him, can you draw a bead on him?

1008
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,460
I'm rebel of wild fetch, a guy's here in a train station and the rain is in sight.

1009
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,420
Kick down, go ahead and shoot, you'll be doing me a favor.

1010
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,920
Oh, bonjour, Monsieur Danseboule.

1011
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,740
A man once told me, and I've run out of my head, the way he described it,

1012
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,060
he said it'd be better dead than alive.

1013
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,160
The dripping flames hanging from my...

1014
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,540

1024
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:26,680
sixth seal and behold the sun became black as sackcloth the full moon became like blood and

1025
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:33,220

but the bounty suffer realizes that all five scoundrels are empty

1030
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,800

You don't know what the information is.

1042
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,860
This is free. This is free.

1043
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,060
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1044
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,600
And let's listen to Brother Jay Cotton's Muzak,

1045
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,080
subgenius Muzak, here in the background.

1046
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,220
This is a song called Bob.

1047
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,220


1048
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,640
Tiger, tiger, burning bright.

1049
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,700
In the forest of night.

1050
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,040
Yes, it's the slow, sleepy subgenius circus.

1051
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,980
Too late.

1052
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,000
By the way, don't buy the books.

1053
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,860
You're being full black.

1054
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,900
The trick of a false duck trip tricked me.

1055
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,880
You don't need an old show.

1056
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,940
That's the whole idea.

1057
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,500
Get away from old and go to the new.

1058
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,600
I'll go to shoot a shot.

1059
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
Yeah, I tried to shoot my show last week,

1060
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,900
and it kicked me right in the face.

1061
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,060
You tried.

1062
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:37,740
Shoot the show.

1063
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,420
Believe me, you'll be in better shape.

1064
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,540
And you always will.

1065
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,820
Because that's his part of the job.

1066
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,220
Or so he thinks.

1067
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,600
Okay, so pull the show lever again, please.

1068
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,180
Sure.

1069
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,500
This thing, this thing, when you feel bad,

1070
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,340
pull the lever and down you go.

1071
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,040
It feels real bad.

1072
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Am I in the copy?

1073
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,620
Pull the lever and down you go.

1074
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,260
Oh.

1075
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,620
A-okay?

1076
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,200
Failure.

1077
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:57,980
Failure.

1078
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,660
Oh, no.

1079
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,320
Now what do we do?

1080
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,660
Sure, new members tend to go overboard

1081
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,440
in placing the blame on the conspiracy.

1082
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,560
Soon they learn of the major role

1083
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,720
played by its dupes,

1084
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,300
the pinks, who we spoke of,

1085
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,380
the normals, and the mediocritans.

1086
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,020
The answer is, you have the answer.

1087
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,560
Take the slack.

1088
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,740
It's yours.

1089
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,600
You didn't recognize it

1090
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,040
because the conspiracy had you looking

1091
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,040
for something more expensive

1092
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,360
and more complicated.

1093
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,160
The right people must be made

1094
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,760
into superhuman overmen

1095
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,300
by that alien technology

1096
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,660
that is the end of their world,

1097
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,000
not our world.

1098
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,040
That's another thing.

1099
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,420
I mean, we don't stop when we turn.

1100
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:36,680
Is this a computer?

1101
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,680


1102
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:36,680


1103
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,120
We're not going to you into a zombie.

1104
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,020
Beyond that, you can undergo the surgery,

1105
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,160
the glanscaping at the hands of the many doctors.

1106
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,180
Male or female.

1107
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:45,620
Right.

1108
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,320
Right, absolutely.

1109
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,120
And uh...

1110
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,220
We can go either direction once we have you, too.

1111
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,680
This religion canonizes our most hostile heretics

1112
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,100
and our most devoted monks.

1113
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,620
This is a religion for outcasts,

1114
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,500
for crypts, freaks, morphidites.

1115
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,840
So kick the conspiracy out of your life

1116
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,860
and call up, avoid it in your friends,

1117
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,320
slap yourself awake with weird experiences and wake up.

1118
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,540
Notice the scale.

1119
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:06,540


1120
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,880
As he said earlier, the luck plane, the work net of synchronicity.

1121
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,280
Any confessions out there?

1122
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,480
I'm talking to you by telephone from the over room at the White House.

1123
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,760
Right.

1124
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,540
How are you doing?

1125
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,020
This certainly has to be the most disturbing.

1126
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,200
Oh, this guy calls all the time.

1127
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:30,580
Our charter says that the Church of the Subgenius is an order of scoffers and blasphemers dedicated to total slack,

1128
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,660
delving into mockery science, sadofuturistics, megaphysics, scatolography, schizophreniatrics,

1129
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,000
more realism, sarcastrophe, sinosacraligin.

1130
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,320
It goes on and on.

1131
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,020
I mean, we don't stop with anything.

1132
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,300
This is going off in a million directions at once.

1133
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:47,580
Right.

1134
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,540
Bob is a benevolent sex god.

1135
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:58,460
But when you get deep, deep into any belief system,

1136
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,040
you start to find reflections.

1137
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,460
You start to find reflections of the darker side of your own personality.

1138
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,040
So, I mean, when the collective unconscious really gets stirred up,

1139
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:15,320
it's like one big worm on the end of a hook drawing its giant alien fish closer and closer.

1140
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,140
The launch had to go in the exact sequence at the precise moments of the molecular decay pattern

1141
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:22,680
as the golf club hit the head at the final moment of the incantation.

1142
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,620
The ritual would have set off the chain reaction, opening the doorway to...

1143
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,060
in a spread of epidemic disease destruction starting in Dallas.

1144
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:30,360
So...

1145
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:30,560
Moving ahead.

1146
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,380
The future started in 1971.

1147
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,320
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1148
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,800
Damn nickel.

1149
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:39,080
Damn nickel ball.

1150
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,340
I hear a Bob song coming out.

1151
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,660
Bob.

1152
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:46,900
Bob.

1153
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,500
Bob.

1154
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,640
He's no slob.

1155
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,900
Bob.

1156
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,400
Bob.

1157
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,600
He's no boo.

1158
00:53:59,600 --> 00:53:59,700
Boo.

1159
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,780
A fool.

1160
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,220
Yeah.

1161
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,620
What a stool.

1162
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,760
He is the head of the subgenius church.

1163
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,120
And he is super cool.

1164
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:15,940
Bob.

1165
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,460
Bob.

1166
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,380
Bob.

1167
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,160
He's slob.

1168
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,640
Bob.

1169
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,300
Bob.

1170
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,700
He's no boo.

1171
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1172
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,080
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

1173
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,380
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

1174
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,880
He is the head of the subgenius church.

1175
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,320
He is super cool.

1176
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,100
This problem is important to you.

1177
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,240
Well, well, well, well, yeah.

1178
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:44,640
Yeah, okay.

1179
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,560
Very interesting.

1180
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,380
Interesting.

1181
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,360
Very interesting.

1182
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,160
Yeah, yeah.

1183
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:49,920
Right.

1184
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:50,420
Uh-huh.

1185
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,020
Make it echoing.

1186
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,440
Right.

1187
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:53,900
Uh-huh.

1188
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,580
Well, what you do is you put a toothpick down the first contact of tape on the wall.

1189
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1190
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1191
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1192
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1193
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1194
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1195
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1196
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1197
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1198
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1199
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1200
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1201
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1202
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,580


1203
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,560
And what the tape has with a cassette deck as it rolls through is with an erase head.

1204
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,740
It's a little tiny piece of metal.

1205
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,800
And you just put something between the tape and the erase head.

1206
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,480
You see, we were vindicated as you rushed back and forth from the pool table to the

1207
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,860
light table, back to the navigation board, trying to keep the computer on track, trying

1208
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:22,460
vainly to find out exactly what it is you can find out about.

1209
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,240
There's not a whole lot left here in the studio that can be eaten or breathed.

1210
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,740
We're thinking of you, not in stereo but in mono.

1211
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,100
Not the stinking babies.

1212
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:39,140
This week, the stinking babies will find out what county law is all about.

1213
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:39,780
Right.

1214
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,280
And so will Doug Wellman.

1215
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,440
He's a pointy good.

1216
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,260
All right, baby.

1217
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,600
Yeah, okay.

1218
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,840
Everybody there in Berkeley.

1219
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,560
Thank you.

1220
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:47,800
Thank you.

1221
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,340
How'd you learn to run this before anyway?

1222
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,640
We had to kill those people because they saw what was happening here.

1223
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,380
And we'll fire upon that crowd over there who was watching from about 500 yards distance.

1224
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,260
There they go.

1225
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,560
Guys have a lot of energy.

1226
00:55:59,560 --> 00:55:59,560


1227
00:55:59,560 --> 00:55:59,560


1228
00:55:59,560 --> 00:55:59,560


1229
00:55:59,560 --> 00:55:59,560


1230
00:55:59,560 --> 00:55:59,560


1231
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,600
I'm getting a little nervous coming on the radio without any jokes.

1232
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,720
Well, that's the joke, okay?

1233
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,480
Now can I go home?

1234
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,100
Now that's funny.

1235
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,120
Of course, you have to arrive at that decision yourself.

1236
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,640
Right.

1237
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:18,240
This is your chance, dear friends, to make, this is your first and possibly last chance

1238
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,360
to make that first decision on your very own, the decision to keep listening to the American

1239
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,140
Music Party coming right up.

1240
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,700
Oh, my God.

1241
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:30,820
This is the rim.

1242
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,200
So please.

1243
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,560
That's what it is.

1244
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:32,560


1245
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,260
So please, please have faith.

1246
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,100
Hang in there.

1247
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:45,820
And get your pledges in friends, really we're only about half of the beloved faithful out

1248
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,020
there have paid up.

1249
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,420
The other half of the hated faithless heathens haven't done jack.

1250
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,260
So please...

1251
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,200
Have mercy.

1252
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:05,040
