1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,600
We're back.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,260
Genius Hour of Swatch.

3
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,240
We'll have to wait and see if this plays out.

4
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,240
Now, despite that evaluation...

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,560
Workers have to be smarter, which is what corporate leaders tell us.

6
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,600
But the workers also have to be dumber.

7
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,380
That is, jobs are being smartened up and dumbed down.

8
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,640
For every new job for a computer programmer

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,980
in the United States,

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,700
in New York, for example, there are about 14 jobs for cashiers.

11
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,360
The cash register in most of the fast food organizations

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,460
takes about nine minutes to learn, and they want to cut it down to seven.

13
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,140
And the less math you know, the better.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
There are no numbers on the keys.

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,340
If you're smart enough to spot a French fry on site,

16
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,600
you're smart enough to work at McDonald's.

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,660
So at the time the schools are trying to increase their standards,

18
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,360
there's an incredible array of jobs and services

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,980
that require almost no education at all.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
Ah, yeah.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Yes, dear Frenzy.

22
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,620
Hehehe.

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:04,980
Ah.

24
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,220
Wherein the days of me forever makes me mine.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Now, ere the compline hour of being alone at hands itself,

26
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,380
and a puff or so before we yield our spiritus to the wind.

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,760
And there goes that wind.

28
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,080
And we brought in a big bucket of show tonight.

29
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,980
You see him here being lifted up to the door of the...

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,260
station.

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,900
And it's once again, dear friends,

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,500
the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,940
Ah, yes, and this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,740
Uh, Will O'Dobbs is here, uh, co-engineering and, uh, ready at...

35
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,960
Oh, if this, uh, storm doesn't put out the electricity

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,120
to take your calls here at the station in Dallas

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,620
only between nine and ten o'clock on Sunday nights,

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,760
Central Standard Time at 8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,420
Uh, yes, it's a big bag of show tonight, dear friends,

40
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,140
because, uh, well, we're...

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,080
As we approach the...

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,980
the new year,

43
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,440
uh, we'll do the...

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,500
Since everybody else is doing their decade roundup,

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,860
we'll be looking at the new decade,

46
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,540
the last decade,

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,760
the X decade,

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,540
during the next couple of shows.

49
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:28,740
Uh...

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,720
Eventually,

51
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,080
you'll learn Dobbs' predictions

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,540
for the coming New World Order

53
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,140
and the terrible tribulations coming up in between.

54
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,740
Uh, but we'll begin looking ahead by looking back.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,920
Also, you'll be hearing some clips

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,040
from some live subgenius revivals

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,960
of wonderful new Papa Joe Mama sermon

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,440
that will touch your heart

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,360
and other marital aids,

60
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,700
uh,

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,620
audio marital aids you can stick in your ear.

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,740
What do you want?

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,780
You want information.

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,380
You won't get it.

65
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,140
Uh, by hook or by crook,

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,720
we will.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,420
We will.

68
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,480
We will hurt you.

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,300
Because, uh, the truth hurts, dear friends.

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,100
Looking back over the...

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,180
the lovely, uh, 80s,

72
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,980
the ugly 80s, I suppose you could say,

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,120
you know, in 1980,

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,720
there was no AIDS

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,260
and no crack.

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,760
Uh, I don't know.

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,800
Rock Hudson was a he-man.

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,980
There were very few homeless.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,500
There were few, if any, video recorders,

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,160
home computers, answering machines,

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
fax machines,

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,540
uh, compact discs,

83
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,940
self-published fanzines,

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,900
independent cassette bands,

85
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,560
or microwave ovens, for that matter.

86
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,520
The Russians lost a nuclear reactor.

87
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,380
We lost a space shuttle.

88
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,700
And, uh,

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,160
Bhopal, India lost 3,000 residents.

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,200

91
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,540
The whole planet lost a lot of ozone layer and rainforests.

92
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,180
And there was a kid that got a baboon heart and died.

93
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,000

And, and, Charles Adams died.

141
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,680


142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,680


143
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,680


144
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,680


145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,680

J.R. Bob Dobbs.

156
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,320
A few thousand species.

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,380
And a lot of oxygen.

158
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,320
Bummer.

159
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,460
On the other hand, friends, there were gains.

160
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,640
The populations of several Central and South American tar paper shanty towns rose to 30 million each.

161
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,440
The average population of the Alaskan beaches gained 11 million gallons of oil.

162
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,440
So, see, not everybody was a loser.

163
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
Ah, yes.

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,360
Well, yes, it's going to be a, you know, looking back, I guess it wasn't so bad.

165
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,880
I mean, a pope got shot.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,580
A whole bunch of presidents got shot.

167
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,260
The United States kicked booty on Granada and Libya.

168
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,080
Whoop-de-doo.

169
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,620
Whoop-de-doo.

170
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
Whoop-de-doo.

171
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,580
Whoop-de-doo.

172
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,220
Whoop-de-doo.

173
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,580
Whoop-de-doo.

174
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,320
Some show.

175
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,660
Go for it.

176
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,820
Church of the Subgenius is more than unmotivatable therapy.

177
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,540
un-motivational therapy that is.

178
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
Un-motivational?

179
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,400
It is! No, that's true.

180
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,220
It is more than un-motivational therapy

181
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,060
because that just opens up the limits completely.

182
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
I mean, it could be anything.

183
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,980
It could be that armadillo dead on the side of the road

184
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,640
that you had to watch.

185
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,820
It could be the discarded syringes

186
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,760
washing up on those New Jersey beaches.

187
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,240
It could be the free syringes handed out to AIDS sufferers

188
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,360
to prevent them from spreading it further.

189
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,960
It could be the poor, pathetic bastards sitting in this room.

190
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,180
What's all the hate?

191
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,240
It could be that body!

192
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,980
Don't you need to vomit your hate out into the little show deck?

193
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,500
You can't.

194
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,160
I mean, this thing's been running for 45 minutes.

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,820
And I ain't heard...

196
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,400
The only kind of hate I've heard was

197
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
the church against its own members.

198
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,280
And that's sad.

199
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,240
God, that's a sad, pathetic thing.

200
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,500
How much money have we seen?

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,260
Man, I hate the ulcers on the back of a tropical forest!

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,340
I hate it!

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,660
I hate everything that grows at the bottom of the sea that you can't see

204
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,860
just because we don't have the technology!

205
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,440
I hate those lesions that grow on the back of my ears

206
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
when I don't wash enough!

207
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,280
I hate it!

208
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,820
I hate it when blood comes out of my eyes!

209
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,560
I hate it when I tear my own hair out!

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,100
I hate it when I wake up in the morning and I crawl out of bed!

211
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,160
And I leave my bed!

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:18,820
I hate it when somebody comes up with a razor blade

213
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:22,420
as I'm walking into work at 8 o'clock in the morning,

214
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,380
and they cut my britches, and they fall on the ground,

215
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,220
and I'm standing there, and I forgot to put on my underwear!

216
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,760
I hate it!

217
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,700
What about the poultry?

218
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,820
I hate it when Bob comes to my house

219
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,860
with a garbage sack full of poultry claiming to be my in-law!

220
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,140
I'm not married! I'm not married!

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
I hate it when Bob takes one of those...

222
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,680
one of those big industrial ball bearings

223
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,740
and makes it into a pot roast!

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,700
I hate it when I see the summer constellations

225
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,980
rise in the middle of winter!

226
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,440
Praise Bob!

227
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Look! One man's already on the floor spazzing me!

228
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,780
That's my dog!

229
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,740
Yeah!

230
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,380
Yeah!

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,520
Yeah!

232
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,260
Yeah!

233
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,640
Yeah!

234
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:28,900
Yeah!

235
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,740
Oh, God almighty, I'm speaking in tongues!

236
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah!

237
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,380
Yeah!

238
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,980
Big mouth, dirty tongues!

239
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,660
Big hands, dirty tongues!

240
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,920
Man, I know what you mean about having that...

241
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,700
when you don't wash behind your ears!

242
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,240
Woo!

243
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,040
Look!

244
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,280
Here it moves!

245
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Whoa!

246
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,100
Sex and violence!

247
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,540
Sex and violence!

248
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,000
Sex and violence!

249
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,160
Sex and violence!

250
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,400
Sex and violence!

251
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,020
Sex and violence!

252
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,640
Sex and violence!

253
00:11:59,640 --> 00:11:59,640


254
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,300
Sex!

255
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Sex!

256
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,480
Sex!

257
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,120
Sex!

258
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,700
Sex!

259
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,000
Sex violence!

260
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,460
Sex!

261
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:06,920
Sex!

262
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,360
Sex!

263
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Now Sex and Magazine,

264
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:08,980
TV,

265
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,900
Sex and Songs on the radio,

266
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,000
the human body is a helpless receptor

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,020
before the vast electronic hum and buzz of our world.

268
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,480
Commercials are aimed either at the stomach

269
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
or at the genitals, or sometimes at both,

270
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
as when the act of drinking a soft drink

271
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,820
causes buttocks and breasts to rise before the drinker.

272
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,720
For it is to you,

273
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,800
firstborn and first fruit of woe,

274
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,660
to me, branded sheep,

275
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,360
pick of the waste or paper bascal,

276
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,180
are the tremors of thundery and utterance dog-star.

277
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,220
Hello, friends, and welcome.

278
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,480
The sermon tonight is entitled

279
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,520
The Pain of Bob.

280
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,540
I want to begin tonight by asking a personal question,

281
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,080
if you don't mind.

282
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
How many of you have ever been tortured?

283
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, really tortured.

284
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,040
Raise your hand if you've ever really been tortured.

285
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,220
Ha! It was a trick question.

286
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,980
If you've ever really been tortured,

287
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,580
you wouldn't be able to raise your hand.

288
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,680
You wouldn't have any arms.

289
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,280
You see, real torture changes you for life,

290
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,740
however short that may be.

291
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,860
Real torture is not something you can experience and forget

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,460
or go back to the way you were before.

293
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,000
No one knows us more than our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

294
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,200
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

295
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,600
J.R. Bob Dobbs was regularly tortured,

296
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,220
and you probably thought his assassination

297
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,320
was the height of his pain.

298
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,220
Ha! Compared to torture,

299
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,000
Bob's assassination was an orgasm of pleasure,

300
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,280
total euphoria,

301
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,460
complete bliss,

302
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,780
the tickling sensation one feels

303
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,520
as a bullet ricochets through the body,

304
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,080
the sweet numbness of shock

305
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
slowing the world down around you,

306
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,880
the warm, lazy feeling of swimming in your own blood.

307
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,160
You see, Bob's sacrifice wasn't that he died for us.

308
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,100
Dying was fun, at least in comparison,

309
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,540
in comparison to his real sacrifice,

310
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,200
the sacrifice of life.

311
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,220
That's why we worship Bob,

312
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
because he lived for us,

313
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,420
and it was torture of everyday life

314
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,180
that Bob suffered for you and me.

315
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,320
And yet, even in the midst of that pain,

316
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,580
Bob was not bitter.

317
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,660
The conspiracy strapped him down,

318
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,600
the conspiracy rammed bamboo shoots up his fingernails,

319
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,700
jammed razor blades in between his toes,

320
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,300
threw salt in his paper wounds,

321
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,300
and yet Bob never requested divine intervention.

322
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,700
Instead, he rolled his eyes heavenward

323
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,560
and whispered with failing breath,

324
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,180
forgive them, Father,

325
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,360
because I'm going to get even!

326
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,140
And, friends, payback time is just around the corner,

327
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,780
and that's good news for all the subgenies

328
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,920
who want to help Bob avenge the pain.

329
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
We've talked about X Day,

330
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,500
we've talked about the trials,

331
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,720
we've even discussed the fate of the few fortunate enough

332
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
to escape the final judgment.

333
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
But have you ever stopped to consider

334
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,360
the sheer magnitude of the bureaucracy and red tape

335
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,620
that must exist for the X's

336
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,980
to carry out the judgment on those found guilty?

337
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,080
We're talking about news!

338
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,340
We're talking about news!

339
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,040
He has billions of conspiracy dupes,

340
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,580
accomplices, peak boys, and self-proclaimed Normals,

341
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,820
and that's just the followers, mind you.

342
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,640
Let's not forget the leaders.

343
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,120
They're the ones who deserve special attention,

344
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,700
but will they get it?

345
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,900
After all, efficient as they are,

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,700
can these X's really process some four billion earthlings

347
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,980
and yet guarantee extra time and attention to detail

348
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,760
that those extra guilty deserve?

349
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,540
Probably not.

350
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,140
And that's where you and I come in, friends!

351
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,180
because Bob needs us to help fulfill his holy covenant,

352
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,600
his sacred promise to do unto those as they did unto him.

353
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,540
Now, when Bob promised to get even with those who tortured him,

354
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,160
he didn't just mean those handful of torture masters

355
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,740
who were directly responsible for his torture only.

356
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,820
Why, Bob cares for all the oppressed,

357
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,740
not just the subgenies either,

358
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,880
but anyone tortured for any reason,

359
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,860
be it because of your religion or what you think

360
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,280
or that you think at all.

361
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,360
No, it doesn't matter.

362
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,940
And don't let size fool you either.

363
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,860
Bob cares as much about the little guy as he does the big one.

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,700
It's just as important to Bob to get the child abuser

365
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,280
as it is to get Edie Amin.

366
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,400
And just how does Bob propose to punish this scum of the earth?

367
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,100
Glad you asked.

368
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Now, I don't know about you, but me, I'm a smoker.

369
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah, I know I shouldn't do it.

370
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,660
It's bad for my health, makes me smell,

371
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,600
keeps me short of breath, et cetera, et cetera,

372
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,580
and I keep meaning to quit.

373
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,260
But it does have...

374
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
It does have one redeeming quality.

375
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,560
It gives me a little trademark, a greeting card,

376
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,120
a, uh, I mean business card, if you will,

377
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,960
something for me to give my clients

378
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,460
so they remember me and all the excitement.

379
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,300
I like to take that cigarette,

380
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,940
suck in a nice, long, hard, deep puff,

381
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,260
get it nice and hot,

382
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,820
and bury it in the subject's navel.

383
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,580
Oh, it'll hurt him.

384
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Don't you think it won't?

385
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,700
That belly button is where life's begun,

386
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,540
and there's a lot more than just sentimentality attached to it.

387
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,020
Trust me.

388
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,560
Now, after I've gotten your attention,

389
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,940
I don't like to waste time

390
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,160
with, you know, small talk.

391
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,140
Time is money, right?

392
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,580
That's one concept that conspiracy appreciates

393
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,620
even when they're under the blade.

394
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,140
So I get right down to business.

395
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,640
I get me a bucket, and I get me some water.

396
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,220
Fill the bucket with the water

397
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,500
and stick their head in it.

398
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,440
I hold them down.

399
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
I keep them down.

400
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,660
A little longer.

401
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,720
A little longer still.

402
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,580
Oh, they squirm.

403
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,200
They start to kick.

404
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Watch out for those feet now.

405
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,740
They can buck you if you get in the way.

406
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,000
Make sure they're secured.

407
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,420
Up come the bubbles.

408
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,720
Keep them under a little longer.

409
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,380
And finally, lift them up by the scruff of the neck.

410
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,920
Now you can see them.

411
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:41,920


412
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:41,920


413
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:41,920


414
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,180
Now you got a subject you can work with.

415
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,440
He's cold, he's wet, and he's scared.

416
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,440
Now, he'll probably be the last one to admit it,

417
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,340
but he's ready now for the pain of Bob.

418
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,580
Now, a lot of folks come up and stop me on the street

419
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,460
and say, Father Germano,

420
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,520
what do you recommend for the ultimate pain?

421
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,380
Hot poker?

422
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,460
Boiling water?

423
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,220
Dry ice?

424
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,600
Well, I tell them that stuff is fine and dandy,

425
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,300
but let's face it.

426
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,040
We're not living in the dark ages anymore.

427
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,080
We've got electricity.

428
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,300
The power of power.

429
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,660
Now, don't start.

430
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,400
Don't start talking about energy crisis either.

431
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,000
Cost is not a factor here.

432
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,720
The best is not too good for these guys,

433
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,540
which brings me to an important point.

434
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,540
Always keep a licensed physician on hand

435
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,880
when you're using friendly Mr. Kilowatt.

436
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,020
That's for three reasons.

437
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,200
First and foremost, your own protection.

438
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,960
That's right.

439
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,560
Electricity is dangerous.

440
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,060
Accidents can happen.

441
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,420
People can get hurt.

442
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,300
And when they do, no delays.

443
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,320
Your doctor's right there.

444
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,780
Secondly, preservation of your subject.

445
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,100
You don't want him to die.

446
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,600
If you wanted him dead, you'd just take him out

447
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:41,900
and shoot him.

448
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,900


449
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,860
But what would that make us?

450
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,360
Executioners?

451
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,240
Are we executioners?

452
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,980
No, we're debt collectors.

453
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
We're just balancing the books.

454
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,020
And believe you me, we're not doing anything to these folks

455
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,000
that they haven't done to someone else.

456
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,960
These are professionals you're working with.

457
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,020
They've seen it all.

458
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,840
They've done it all.

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,060
And if you want their respect, you've got to act like a professional.

460
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,800
You've got to be efficient.

461
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,820
Which brings us to reason three for having a doctor.

462
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,860
He'll show you just when to back off,

463
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,140
how to keep your subject alive,

464
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:11,900
and more importantly,

465
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,360
how to keep him conscious.

466
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,060
Don't be afraid to use them for this.

467
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,240
That's their job.

468
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,560
That's what they're paid for.

469
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,360
That's what they went to seven years of medical school for.

470
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
But now you're all set.

471
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,840
You've got everything you need.

472
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,700
You've got your doctor, you've got your patient,

473
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,060
and you've got your electricity.

474
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,300
Now, I'm not going to insult your intelligence

475
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,840
telling you how to use electricity.

476
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,720
Anyone can hook up a lamp cord to an outlet and let it rip.

477
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,860
And I'm sure you already know that the tender parts are best.

478
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,920
The underarms, the bottoms of the feet, the genitalia.

479
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,460
Why state the obvious, right?

480
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,960
If you need any guidance, just follow your heart.

481
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,520
And remember what Bob said,

482
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,020
when it comes to torture,

483
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,220
it is more blessed to give than it is to receive.

484
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,620
Herein is the word of Bob.

485
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,440
Praise Bob.

486
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,240
Amen.

487
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,080
Oh, praise Bob and amen to you, Father Joe Mama.

488
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,220
A marvelous, wonderful, inspirational moment.

489
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,240
You know, I consider Father Joe Mama to be the,

490
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,440
right now, to be the top king of society.

491
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm sure he has not been the top king of society.

492
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,480


493
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,480


494
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,480


495
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,240
a subgenius preacher.

496
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,980
I really do.

497
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I've been most impressed with that young man.

498
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,240
He's a young graduate of the Dobstown School for Preachers,

499
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,820
dear friends.

500
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,240
And what you've been hearing here,

501
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,520
let's see, my little list, background music.

502
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,920
a lot of it's been the Swingin' Love Corpses.

503
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,180
Also, a lot of the new collage bits that you'll be hearing more of,

504
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,220
and you've heard some of, like the Sex and Violence Collage,

505
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:46,620
that was a mystery tape from radio station WHRW in Birmingham, New York.

506
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,860
There was no name attached to the tape, a long, elaborate log,

507
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,960
which was very helpful, and no human name, or even church name.

508
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,280
So, you got me.

509
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,860
But I believe now is about time to get back to...

510
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,460
What?

511
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,980
Of course.

512
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,140
The predictions.

513
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,700
Dear friends, or no, we're not going to do the predictions.

514
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,780
As I said, we have to work.

515
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,760
We have to work our way up to them.

516
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,340
These are predictions in the background.

517
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,180
And I don't like those predictions in the background.

518
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,540
They're confusing me.

519
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,480
There we go.

520
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,580
Actually, we're going to continue with the 1980s decade roundup.

521
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,480
And that was an impressive list of dead subgeniuses, now wasn't it?

522
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,840
But, as we said, there were a few good things.

523
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,560
There were a few bad things that happened.

524
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,580
We lost all those people, but the federal deficit grew.

525
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,400
In 1980, it was only $40 billion.

526
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,680
Can you believe it?

527
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,020
It's like three times that now.

528
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,440
And look, I could see it over there in the corner growing bigger and bigger.

529
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Now there was a big economic boom, we must be fair, where at least the rich got richer.

530
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
But then, somewhere in the late 80s, everything went wrong.

531
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
Everything sort of came crashing down on everybody's heads.

532
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,100
When Reagan left office, all but the very richest ended up poor again.

533
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:37,760
And we all are getting the bill for the last 20 years of free love, drugs, pollution, waste,

534
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,900
and big business deals.

535
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,240
And of course, we're going to have to pay that up, dear friends, in safe sex.

536
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,260
Burned out brains, wrecked immune systems, and stock market crashes.

537
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,820
Layoffs.

538
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,180
Although probably we'll weasel out of most of that and our kids will end up paying it

539
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,340
see.

540
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,620
But we'll be dead so they won't be able to get revenge on us.

541
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,720
And there were other things on the bright side too, besides that.

542
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,320
But like little Jessica McClure and those three whales got saved.

543
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,480
And Princess Charles married Lady Di.

544
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,460
And there wasn't a world war with thermonuclear weapons that destroyed the world.

545
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,120
And the Church of the Subgenius went public.

546
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
We must not forget that now.

547
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,660
In 1980, went public.

548
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,380
And most importantly of all probably, the King of Norway came to the Texas State Fair

735
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,460
anybody else abnormal.

736
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,640
Satanism hysteria causes decay of freedom of speech and religion in the U.S.

737
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,080
Subgenius books selling better than ever.

738
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,460

And finally, hour of slack show number 212 broadcast at this moment.

741
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,640
Bummer.

742
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,180
Told you it was all going to make sense in the end, didn't I?

743
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,040
I wasn't lying.

744
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,100
This is Humphrey with a little distilling exploits and all.

745
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,100
But Tom's will till.

746
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,880
I know he will.

747
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,060
I know he will.

748
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,060


749
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,880
Temp on chamber will hiss for no man.

750
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,200
As you spring, so shall you, Neap.

751
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,660
Oh, the rowdy old rap.

And thus.

755
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,580
Right here.

756
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:30,940
Wow.

757
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,220
I admit the, the, the.

758
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:33,740


759
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,020
I've been trying to keep it real.

760
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,400
How can I keep it real?

761
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,100
I'll keep it real.

762
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,640
I'll keep it real.

763
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,260
I'll keep it real.

764
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,840
I swear.

765
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,380
I swear.

766
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,020
It started out as funny, but it...

767
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,160
It was a funny show.

768
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,820
Yeah, it kind of went downhill.

769
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,160
Especially this sentence.

770
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,420
This sentence just wasn't as funny as it came out.

771
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,260
Okay, we ran along and...

772
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,360
Just a little bit this way, just to tell you...

773
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
No, I can fly back this way.

774
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:52,840
Okay, now.

775
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,620
Now.

776
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,540
Yeah, but we're not trying to say that we'd just go on...

777
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,320
It's not a me show.

778
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,720
Yeah, like we sit here and take pictures of ourselves on the air or anything.

779
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,540
And just talk about something that didn't make any sense.

780
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,480
It's not like that kind of me show.

781
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,480
Just talking about...

782
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,240
Just going on and on about...

783
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,720
Oh, thank you.

784
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,320
Yes, thank you.

785
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,220
It's not just the me generation these days.

786
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,140
It's the gimme generation with these kids.

787
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,820
I've never seen such a bunch of gimme kids.

788
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,820
I mean, I think it should be the me decade, as long as it's me.

789
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,160
They're decading.

790
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,380
But who are you?

791
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm Franken-decade.

792
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,340
Decem.

793
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,420
Yeah, they're like...

794
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,160
Decem.

795
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,960
Yeah, but I'm his little baby.

796
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,380
He does love short, you know, bread.

797
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,340
Oops.

798
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,820
Okay.

799
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,800
I went to the doctor.

800
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,060
The doctor said,

801
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,600
feed that child on shortening bread.

802
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,440
My little baby loves shortening, shortening.

803
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,120

804
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,020
My little baby loves shortening, shortening.

805
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,960
My little baby loves shortening bread.

806
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,680
And the audience loves it.

807
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:52,900
Yes.

808
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,300
At last my mind is still okay.

809
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,300
They can't get enough of it.

810
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Mindly still, I have...

811
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,520
Okay, here we go.

812
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,720
Now Jader's going to balance seven foot miles on the dead.

813
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,280
That is...

814
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,020
Time for your ticket.

815
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,100
Time for your ticket.

816
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,100


817
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,100


818
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,100


819
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,540
That giant razor blade into a tub of mine for us.

820
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,020
What's my interest?

821
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,460

00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,040
Have I mind still enjoying that?

829
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
I don't know what's my interest.

830
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,100
What?

831
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,580

835
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,880

In Dallas, Texas.

890
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,960
It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route.

891
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,920
In the motorcade route.

892
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,840
Three shots were fired.

Oh no.

902
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,760

Oh no.

904
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,840

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,380
The world is very different now.

910
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,500
We are different.

911
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,040
We claim to have gained the power of today.

912
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,060
We are balloons.

913
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,660
We can fly high above the Mas Physique, and we

914
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


915
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,060
We are life.

916
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,140
We are estouroids.

917
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
We are real life peninsula.

918
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:35,500
We are capable of fighting يا

919
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,560
The energy jumped up, she called, oh no.

920
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,620
Oh no.

921
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,600
The energy.

922
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,680
Oh no.

923
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,660
The faith.

924
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,740
Oh no.

925
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,580
The devotion.

926
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,780
Oh no.

927
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,760
The motorcade sped on.

928
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,620
The flash.

929
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,160
Apparently official.

930
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,760
The flash.

931
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,440
Apparently official.

932
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,880
President Kennedy died.

933
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,740
Apparently official.

934
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,660
1 p.m.

935
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,980
Central Standard Time.

936
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,340
Time.

937
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,380
Time.

938
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,480
Time.

939
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,560
Time.

940
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Time.

941
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,100
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.

942
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,300
Here is a prisoner.

943
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,380
Here is a prisoner.

944
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,200
Wearing a black sweater.

945
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,420
Do you have anything to say to your defense?

946
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,020
Puzzle at the shot!

947
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,060
Puzzle at the shot!

948
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,820
Jack Ruby.

949
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,000
Jack Ruby.

950
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,440
He runs the carousel club.

951
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,520
Here is the ambulance.

952
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,100
More details don't arrive.

953
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,280
Mrs. Kennedy, jumped up, she called, oh no.

954
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,400
Oh no

955
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,920
Oh no giving up.

956
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,480
He gave it toılıwe.

957
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,480


958
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,820
Oh no money.

959
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,660
It must have been waiting for you.

960
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,740
Oh no Monday one time. We should just have a conversation tomorrow.

961
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:18,740


962
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,560
The motorcade sped on.

963
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,800
More details just arrived.

964
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,960
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

965
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,980
She called, oh, no.

966
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,060
Oh, no.

967
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,140
Oh, no.

968
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,260
Oh, no.

969
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,240
Oh, no.

970
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,180
The motorcade sped on.

971
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,580
Ah, dear friends, that was, I know you want to know who did that.

972
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,820
That was done by, according to the log that came with the mystery tape from which I got that.

973
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,600
It was done by, it's called the motorcade sped on by Steinsky and the mass media.

974
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,440
If you know anything about who Steinsky and the mass media is, please call the station here.

975
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,700
Speak to Will O'Dobbs itself.

976
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,040
Well, himself.

977
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,560
I don't know why I say that.

978
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,940
Will's very definite, him.

979
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,840
Ain't going to horn in on my territory.

980
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,100
He better bird dog that stuff or I'll be taking it away from you.

981
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,620
At 823-7490.

982
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,420
And it was, see, there was one.

983
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,580
You can hear him there in the background.

984
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,580
And what a historical show.

985
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,220
We're going to pop back over here to Berkeley for a second for the KPFA.

986
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,280
More than an hour, less than a show.

987
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,100
Show puzzling evidence.

988
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,220
Dr. Hal Robbins and I believe special guest Jane or I.

989
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,040
I believe so.

990
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,640
We shall never let our scalpels grow rusty except for the purposes of podcast.

991
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,040
None of it's real.

992
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,440
Just remember, none of it is real.

993
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,760
Yes, there was a couple of sand.

994
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,580
There was behind it.

995
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,880
Is what I'm saying live or is this, is this a tape?

996
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,580
What you're saying is live, but we're thinking of taking a rock and away break.

997
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:07,700
Hmm.

998
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,620
But you don't rock and away, do you?

999
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,460
I don't what?

1000
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,680
You don't rock and away, do you?

1001
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,580
Well, if this is a tape, just turn me off.

1002
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
That'll be $44.67.

1003
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,500
We're not sure.

1004
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,900
Thank you.

1005
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,500
Come again.

1006
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,280
Part two of show.

1007
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,060
Okay.

1008
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,120
You have now reached part two of your hour of slack show tape.

1009
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,620
You may now continue.

1010
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:33,240
Hey!

1011
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,340
Proof.

1012
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,580
Proof that the brain is nothing more than an alien parasite that infests a human body

1013
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,900
shortly before birth.

1014
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,000
No, it is not the brain.

1015
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,200
Rather, it is the brain.

1016
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:44,200


1017
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:53,460
So, part two of bracelet'sGodzilla wag,

1018
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:54,780


1019
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,160
And you're gonna have to decide what

1020
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,580
to do with a come color if

1021
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:00,580


1022
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,580
These days it's easy to say man.

1023
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:04,840


1024
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,480
box.

1025
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,820
On the highway kind.

1026
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,760
Really kill him.

1027
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,520
Well, do you have it in your heart to look up to that man, that man who's too close.

1028
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,640
The man you love, hate so much, walk up to Bob and just end it all?

1029
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,540
I didn't.

1030
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,660
Would you really do it?

1031
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,800
I had to stop and pick him up off the side of the road, give him a ride, wherever he wanted to go.

1032
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,460
I was compelled to do so.

1033
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,620
I'm sorry.

1034
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,120
We're killing the engine.

1035
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:35,860
We'll kill her.

1036
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,600
I pushed the pedal down, but my engine wouldn't run.

1037
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,740
The gas wasn't going to it.

1038
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,460
Man, you know, that's why we were born with organic baseball bats,

1039
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,560
for us to bash Bob over the back of his head with it.

1040
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,580
You know, that's why women are weaker than men.

1041
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,040
Hey!

1042
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:00,540


1043
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,600
Come on, not the pie!

1044
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,860
You ate it on the pie.

1045
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,440
Come on, you can do it.

1046
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,280
You hate the pie.

1047
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,160
I was too weak.

1048
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,120
I was too weak to kill him.

1049
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,720
I hate the pie.

1050
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,580
I understand.

1051
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,540
I understand what you're going through.

1052
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,440
What is this?

1053
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,560
I'm creating social.

1054
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,320
Let's kill these wimps.

1055
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,720
Kill the wimps.

1056
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,440
Looks like we don't need stage.

1057
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,380
Man, I'm going to chop these wimps into bits and pieces

1058
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,560
because they don't stop sticking to something.

1059
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,080
I'm going to eat your fingernails into my head.

1060
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh, friends, that, uh, the lead, uh, hate ranter there was, uh,

1061
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,200
at that fantasy fair revival was,

1062
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,500
was known as Nirvana Day.

1063
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,400
We're wondering about, what, what?

1064
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,360
That was the other thing I wanted to say.

1065
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,280
Oh, yeah, I don't care.

1066
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
As long as I get more of these.

1067
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:55,380
We cannot run this ministry on love alone, children.

1068
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,080
Give Wellman more show.

1069
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,180
We could, but...

1070
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,340
Keep him going.

1071
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,080
...you have to reach down in your pocketbooks.

1072
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,160
Maybe if we just sold everything we own,

1073
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,900
we could stay on the air another day.

1074
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,740
Those naked girls are doing their wicky-wacky-wacky dance.

1075
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,080
Wow, take a look at them.

1076
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,920
You don't have to tell me that three times.

1077
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:15,220
Look at them, you know, those, uh...

1078
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,200
Look at them, look at them, look at them.

1079
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,380
They say every gesture, every movement has a meaning of its own,

1080
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,460
and you can believe that.

1081
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,860
Watchin' these wack-down wacky knees and...

1082
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,180
My God, now they're...

1083
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,380
My eyes have been glued to that one in the middle.

1084
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,340
If I could only pull them off,

1085
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,060
if super glue or something, I...

1086
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,880
Mama, by me death.

1087
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,480
Not you, Bozo.

1088
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,380
I was talking to a lady.

1089
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,480
You're telling me my eyes have been nailed to that one on the end

1090
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,060
for the past year?

1091
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,020
You're telling me your eyes are as big as your stomach's a heap.

1092
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,640
You'll need a 30-pound claw hammer to get those incredibly painted out of there.

1093
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,640
...in our country it is considered...

1094
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,980
I'm no doctor, but I think you're gonna need a chainsaw to get your eyes back.

1095
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,680
Hey, you don't need a chainsaw to tell which way the wind blows.

1096
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,620
Hey, listen, I'm not in medicine.

1097
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,480
Maybe I should be a staple instead.

1098
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,480
You're gonna need something to...

1099
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,060
You're telling me my eyes have been stapled to that one on the far right

1100
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:05,820
for the past five light years.

1101
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,680
You need to be pounded good and hard in your massage room.

1102
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,740
A need to be needed.

1103
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,400
Hey, I'm no MD, but you're gonna need a staple puller to leave this dance hall.

1104
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,660
Yeah, you'll need to have that staple taken out of your navel.

1105
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,760
What do you think you are, a playboy or a playmate?

1106
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,040
Playboy, play me, eh?

1107
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,660
These days, everyone hears voices.

1108
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,460
Oh, God, he's lost it.

1109
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,160
Most of punk rock's made on independent labels, right?

1110
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,300
Okay, now, if you take the album out,

1111
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,160
and you look past the last song on a given side,

1112
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,660
in between the last song and the actual paper label,

1113
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,840
on independent record companies,

1114
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,440
you've got to engineer a little stencil, a little message,

1115
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,760
from anything from Happy New Year to your brain is wasted.

1116
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,120
For some people, these voices don't even come from the outside.

1117
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,800
They come directly out of their knees or the metal plates in their heads.

1118
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,440
Five o'clock Sunday afternoon, and I'm stuck in a traffic jam

1119
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,780
that stretches 150 miles.

1120
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,980
Let's get in one more call.

1121
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,820
We talk, we read, we listen to Mozart sometimes.

1122
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,640
Right now, I am coming in.

1123
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,320
I am coming in through your ears,

1124
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,720
which filter what I am saying up into your brain.

1125
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,260
...

1126
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,540
...

1127
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,300
...

1128
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,700
...

1129
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,200
...

1130
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,200


1131
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,200


1132
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,200


1133
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,340
You know what I hate?

1134
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,660
I hate it when I'm playing with my fishing kit,

1135
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,880
and I get the fish hooks caught in my urethra.

1136
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:38,620
...

1137
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,300
...

1138
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:40,560
...

1139
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,920
...

1140
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,440
I take a pipe, and I shove it in there to make it bleed more,

1141
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,440
then I twist it, and I squirm it.

1142
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,200
I take the pipe and put it in my mouth and suck out the frog.

1143
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,740
...

1144
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,840
...

1145
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,460
...

1146
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,100
...

1147
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,940
They keep calling, slimy worms, and they crawl into my brain,

1148
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,280
and I see a pipe in front of my face again.

1149
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,620
And I eat it, and I eat it!

1150
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,180
And then I turn into a worm!

1151
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,480
And then somebody shoves a fish hook in my urethra.

1152
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,900
Praise Nirvana Dave, dear friends.

1153
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,420
I hate that too, man.

1154
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,820
Well, see? Something happens.

1155
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,320
All you gotta do is bring Bob and just drag Bob into it.

1156
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:38,420
The problem is the moon is in third conjunction with the fourth dysfunction of Mercury's opposite on the other side of the moon that we can't see.

1157
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:39,740
He's not supposed to know that.

1158
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:51,080
In effect, it's through the slack field Bob's pipe conjunctively blows outward instead of sucking in.

1159
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,560
You're all in Bob's pipe.

1160
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,120
Every damn one of you is sitting in Bob's pipe right this minute.

1161
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,260
Can't see the edges of the bowl right now.

1162
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,500
If you could just see, if you could see,

1163
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,340
you'd see the edges of...

1164
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,400
the bowl of Bob's pipe surrounding you.

1165
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,980
You'd see the flames coming down, licking at your brain to...

1166
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,860
so he can inhale your brain.

1167
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,900
And you'd see that you were floating in an ocean of ice cold pills.

1168
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,100
But, oh! Too bad!

1169
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,540
Too many are so blind.

1170
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:37,420
Well, it seems that Pope S. Cecilia has her own schismatic clench bowing down before her.

1171
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,960
That's right, kids.

1172
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,900
Reminding you that the father of the gods is fair and we shall all vanish without a trace.

1173
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:44,380
Bye!

1174
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,240
Yeah!

1175
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:46,500
Yeah!

1176
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,220


1177
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,500
In our stingy, merry, suffering, stroomings of hair,

1178
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,400
parting them and soothing her and mingling it,

1179
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,520
that was deep, dark, and ample like this...

1180
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,640
and the

1181
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:31,040
Oh, yes, the swinging love corpses there in the background, dear friends.

1182
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,380
And before we get out of here, I'm going to do as I promised.

1183
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,980
We're going to give you the beginnings of the predictions series.

1184
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,180
For the 1990s.

1185
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:46,420
And this time it's going to take the form of investment advice from J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

1186
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,920
channeled through me, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1187
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:57,680
Friends, those of you with money to burn, and if you want to make money with money in the coming tribulation times,

1188
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,720
here are some growth industries that are foolproof investments.

1189
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,960
These are industries that are going to pay you back $100,000.

1190
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,160
100-fold on your investment, dear friend.

1191
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,280
Number one, ice.

1192
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,860
Ice, you know, smokeable methamphetamine.

1193
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,720
You can definitely look for this industry to grow.

1194
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,240
Crack will be passe.

1195
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,060
Ice addicts will make fun of people who are still nothing but wimpy old crack addicts.

1196
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,000
Number two growth industry, drug rehabilitation.

1197
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,600
Drug rehabilitation.

1198
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,760
Especially of the religious variety.

1199
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,120
And, in fact, number three investment opportunity is religious cults in general.

1200
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,960
Uh, yeah.

1201
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:44,600
However, that ties for the number three place best investment with low-brow comedy-oriented entertainment companies.

1202
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,520
If you can combine the two, dear friends, you're going to be doing great.

1203
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,940
Uh, number four investment opportunity, medicine.

1204
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:58,280
Both conspiracy-type medicine, cancer treatments, for instance, like painkillers, new painkillers,

1205
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,460
and also quackery, new age vitamin and nostrum sort of scams.

1206
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,440
Number five, self-defense courses.

1207
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,460
And security technologies and companies, especially electronic security.

1208
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,460
Locks, bars on the door.

1209
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,940
Number six, survivalist industries.

1210
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,160
Training, supplies, and arms.

1211
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,340
Number seven, illegal abortions.

1212
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:27,420
Number eight, home video and computer entertainment systems, which, uh, require people to not leave the home.

1213
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,200
Number nine, law.

1214
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,760
Any kind of legal services at all will be a big growth industry.

1215
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,420
Number ten, employment services, such as job finding,

1216
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,560
and related to that, number eleven, family-sized cheap tents.

1217
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,200
Cheap tents. The cheapest housing.

1218
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,260
But big ones, family-sized. Old families living for the rest of their lives in a good, well-made American tent.

1219
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,560
Uh, number twelve, cheap, brittle fiberglass broomsticks.

1220
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,920
This relates to a teenage fad, uh, that, uh, you, if you want to look in, uh, your, uh, pre-scriptures

1221
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,160
in the, uh, Dateline for Dominance prediction in Book of the Subgenius,

1222
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,400
which, by the way, has many more predictions than we're reading here today.

1223
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,260
And other ones. These are unpublished ones.

1224
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,760
Number twelve, growth industry.

1225
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,080
Water purifiers.

1226
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,520
Number thirteen, air purifiers.

1227
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,840
Number fourteen, food sterilizers.

1228
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,740
Uh, number seventeen, ozone replenishment devices.

1229
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,980
Number fifteen, uh, plastic surgery.

1230
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:26,160
Number sixteen, high-tech police supply and surveillance device manufacturers.

1231
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,780
There's gonna be a lot of demand for that.

1232
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,040
Number eighteen, real estate in the far north and Arctic.

1233
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,080
Uh, in preparation for the greenhouse effect, dear friends.

1234
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,800
That was a beautiful Swingin' Love Corps song, hidden in the background under the rant.

1235
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,180
Uh, you'll just have to take my word for it that it was fantastic and wonderful.

1236
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:52,340
And as we wait for the, uh, upcoming show, which here in Dallas is the, uh, Collector's Showcase,

1237
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,180
but in other cities is...

1238
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,400
Insert Show Title Here.

1239
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,260
Which is a great, great show. We just love it here in Texas.

1240
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,720
And, uh...

1241
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,100
Oop!

1242
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,400
So, somebody was cuttin' up.

1243
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,280
We're gonna have Philo in the background.

1244
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,240
But we're gonna hear Philo sing.

1245
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,800
Just to, uh, lift you out of this...

1246
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,300
This, I know it's been interesting, this historic, uh, overview of the last ten years.

1247
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,400
And, uh, hints for investment opportunities in the future.

1248
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,260
In the 90's, at least up until 1998.

1249
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:31,360
Of course, your best investment, dear friends, is always going to be a Church of the Subgenius membership card.

1250
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,980
Uh, and you can get information because, you know, otherwise, what's the rest of it worth?

1251
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,460
What is...

1252
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,280
Really, ask yourself.

1253
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,280
What's the rest of it worth unless you have that membership card and gigantic package which allows you, uh,

1254
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:51,860
uh, to board the flying saucers of, uh, pleasure when the men from Planet X come to take we subgeniuses away

1255
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,780
to some better world at the end of the 90's.

1256
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,800
Uh, more on that later.

1257
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:02,560
And you can find out about those things by writing this post office box I'm about to give.

1258
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,300
That's right.

1259
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,180
You can write to Bob.

1260
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,460
Ask for free information from Bob.

1261
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:07,740
