1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
It begins.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,560
When you and Connie first split up, I understand.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,300
I ended up being the same person.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,900
She was running, and we did.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,080
How did you do that?

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,620
Connie, what does your husband think about your relationship?

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,140
We're friends, that's it.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,120
Kenwin thanks you for pledging to your favorite show on our recent pledge drive.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,280
He just wanted us to call him Captain Doc.

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,520
He said you could call me Doc.

11
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,720
We've all been there.

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,820
We've got plans for you also.

13
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,480
Yeah.

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
They must have tightened, you know when they do the saline solution, they tighten up around the ribs.

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
Yes, he is in hell.

16
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,660
Oh my god.

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,240
Too bad, he was such a fine noble savage.

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,120
Wasn't he?

19
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,020
Wasn't he?

20
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,060
Wasn't he?

21
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,440
Yeah, we've all been there.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
I don't understand.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
I don't understand.

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,260
Neither do I, Frank.

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,340
You take a rabbit and you eat them and you stuff the air in them and you put them in the guns.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,980
You stuff the air in the rabbits?

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,060
Yeah, in the rabbits.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,680
And then the rabbits, you know, wow, man, have you ever seen the rabbits, man, flyin' across the freeway.

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,100
Pink noises, blowing in the night.

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,200
On New Years Eve.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,720
Heavy.

32
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,040
Not hitting nobody.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,200
Not even Pierce.

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,980
Love you.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
even hitting on nobody, man.

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,000
Not even begging like they do most of the time

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
for the rabbit's fun. Those rabbits, man,

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,780
though they are screaming up the whole park

39
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,340
with this begging. How is that?

40
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,960
Well, man.

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,520
Oh, Daddy, oh,

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,540
you're so crazy.

43
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,380
Bob?

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,480
Bob?

45
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,940
The message is now part

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,600
of and registered in your

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,900
subconscious mind.

48
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,880
Every time you say

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,860
see, hear,

50
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,220
or think.

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,580
What about Slack?

52
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,700
That's your key phrase.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,040
It will trigger the entire

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,160
message without your being aware

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
of it.

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
And now,

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,180
the self-genius

58
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,620
hour of

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,580
Slack.

60
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,960
A universe where anything

61
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,620
is possible.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,380
A universe

63
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,800
of many gods often

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
in conflict.

65
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,140
You have to

66
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,800
believe in the biblical

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,560
explanation

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,520
about

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,420
God

70
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,880
supposed to have

71
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,420
blown

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,040
in or breathed

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,680
into the dust

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,900
and from this came

75
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,180
forth man.

76
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,500
Too simplistic,

77
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,400
but a story

78
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,180
of a sort of

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,480
child's fairy tale.

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,000
When she made it

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,920
with the dust,

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,860
what came forth

83
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,900
was water.

84
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:28,860
Water.

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,980
The living water.

86
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,100
Water that contained

87
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,800
the minuscule beginnings

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,500
of critters.

89
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,360
Crawling little things.

90
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,140
And she nurtured them,

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,540
took care of them,

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,100
and interbred them

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
to finally,

94
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,080
create

95
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,100
things out of all the

96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,100


97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,180
Whatever kind of

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,180


99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,300
you see.

100
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,540
Daggers at

101
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,000
an

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,140
almost

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,360
10

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,240
year old,

105
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,140
is solamente

106
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,600
a

107
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,420
gift of nature.

108
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,820
Not a Leonardo, for me,

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:36,320
I've been up all night and starting to see things.

110
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:46,240
Like, well, heck, you know how sometimes when there's only a little bit of light in the room

111
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,020
and pictures on the wall start to get wavy?

112
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Are you smoking, Fromm?

113
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,980
No, absolutely not.

114
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,200
It's just sleep deprivation.

115
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,840
Could something be making me hallucinate?

116
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,360
Nice touch.

117
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,420
I'm a writer, and this helps me write sometimes.

118
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,280
But I'm not writing right now.

119
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,120
I'm trying to sleep.

120
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,200
It's not working.

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,500
So I turned it into...

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,840
So...

123
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,640
Would you like us to turn our show down?

124
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,420
Is that what you're saying?

125
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,260
No, not at all.

126
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,040
It's really neat.

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
I like it a lot.

128
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,200
It's actually healthy.

129
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,800
It's actually nice.

130
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,280
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

131
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,320
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,120
Oh, this one.

133
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,120
...and only in the city of...

134
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,900
Right around here.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
...should any other shows be heard...

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:57,960
...right around here.

137
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:57,960


138
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,640
...or contacted in the course of this show.

139
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
The listener is advised to remain calm

140
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,840
and only contact listed or unlisted officials

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,080
in the event of any material from this radio

142
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,720
or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,300
Small animals or other children becoming exposed

144
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,080
to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

145
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,120
constantly scanned throughout our program

146
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,640
should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

147
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,960
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you

148
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,980
that it's often a photon that light releases,

149
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,300
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,140
Not everyone.

151
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,440
Just people smelling.

152
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,840
And they smell bad.

153
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

154
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:33,660
Yes.

155
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,560
Yes.

156
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,480
We are the brain-free society.

157
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,640
Self-indulgent, it's a matter of taste.

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,640
We're a living, breathing example

159
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,680
that a brain is a terrible thing to waste.

160
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,260
We are brain-free.

161
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,220
Yep.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,140
And this here is insane.

163
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,040
A five-year-old Chinese boy...

164
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,820
...record high temperatures in the region aggravated the...

165
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,960
...situation. ...inexplicably burned...

166
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,020
Hey, wait a second, is there one last time, "'cause I'm...

167
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,620
I remember how long you And the

168
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,420
mortgage you now have?

169
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,580
10 hours to go.

170
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
The first yelled...

171
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,760
10 hours to go?

172
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:23,800
20 hours.

173
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:23,820
Me?

174
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,080
bedwetting and narrowly missed setting his grandmother on fire when she got too close.

175
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,660
Everyone was terrified to go near him.

176
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,120
For Goofball Radio, this is Ralph Fielding Schnell.

177
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,960
Yeah, okay, now we're talking to Granny now about the birth of the little boy.

178
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,260
See if you can get anything out of her.

179
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,900
I couldn't.

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,420
Oh, God.

181
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,360
You know, I think we just had a bulletin in from the subgenius something or other.

182
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,720
It's the sad show.

183
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,680
That laughing gas again.

184
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,680
It's a very sad moment here on the show.

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,040
Come on.

186
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,860
Oh, sorry, I put these feathers away.

187
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,440
I should be crying and you're making me laugh.

188
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,320
It's a sad moment here on the show.

189
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,740
We don't like to make fun of things.

190
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
And, of course, pregnant men.

191
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,240
Hi, this is Gouin.

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,620
Anybody call for me?

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,120
Were the awesome megaliths of Europe erected on Earth energy centers not long ago, but since forgotten?

194
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,680
I forgot.

195
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,300
Where were you, pal?

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,840
I forgot.

197
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,040
Why do powerful magnetic fields and ultrasound continue to be recorded near them?

198
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:48,260
One in five general motorists actually enjoys being stuck in a traffic jam, according to a survey in the Hamburg-based BAT Leisure Research Institute.

199
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,100
Can we ever decode the hidden meaning of Ohio's Great Serpent Mound?

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,380
Why have the pictures of Pahuvastan been etched by a knife?

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
The opening lines, in a sense, mislead.

202
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,460
Last week, in another part of the city, a human head turned up.

203
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,660
It no longer owned a body, sealed in a plastic bag and swaddled tightly in cloth.

204
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,800
It was being used by some boys for football.

205
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,160
Doesn't it make you tense right up?

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:33,660
What ancient wisdom remains locked inside the seventh wonder of antiquity, the Great Pyramid of Egypt?

207
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,920
Is it a mammoth tomb?

208
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,220
If so, why has no mummified mammoth ever been found within its walls?

209
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,400
The leaders of the superpowers of the world...

210
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,340
gathered at the United Nations in heated conflict.

211
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,180
And as they were about to walk away from the table,

212
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,320
everyone in anger, and launch a full-scale nuclear war,

213
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,300
a spacecraft appeared in the skies,

214
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,260
and an alien beamed down into the middle of the General Assembly of the United Nations.

215
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,160
And he said, you know, we have planted you folks here on this Earth millions of years ago.

216
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
We've let you evolve.

217
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,640
We've waited for you to reach the space age as you're reaching today,

218
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,740
and you're on the verge of destroying each other.

219
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,220
Something has gone wrong, and we are going to come back

220
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,980
and show you how to take this next step in your evolution

221
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,760
and start a new age on this Earth.

222
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
I think everything was so.

223
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,480
The popular story goes, because they overfed themselves.

224
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,160
Believe it or not, it doesn't make any difference.

225
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,060
She was out.

226
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,300
She was out to get a critter with the appendages,

227
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,260
to finally have evolved over the centuries.

228
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,140
A critter with the appendages that could carry out her will.

229
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:11,140
A will that's demanding a critter be able to build and manipulate the extension of the brain.

230
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,060
Of the brain.

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,780
The knowledge center which she instilled.

232
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,380
The will.

233
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,840
The initial living will.

234
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,900
The selling of a religious and non-true weapon.

235
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,580
Well, I'm not.

236
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Yes!

237
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,920
People have been mindless since the world began.

238
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,500
You see, it's perfectly alright.

239
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,960
Who cares about life if that is just in the real world?

240
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,980
We demand our human rights.

241
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,040
We are brain free!

242
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,480
This here is insanity!

243
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,540
I got three legs of leg and three sparks of spring as my brain

244
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,620
sploomed out into the avacron nova somewhere in the middle of the Cygnus.

245
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,260
I got one of those little red race cars that have a big head.

246
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
And you can tell from the back.

247
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,920
You know, you can tell with a little U-dot generator, I mean a little microviolet generator.

248
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,620
And I got one of those.

249
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:26,480
I had the hippopotamus removed and sent to me from a friend of mine who's working in Kenya.

250
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
I had him assured there.

251
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,380
And he said, what the hell?

252
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,920
These things are not intended.

253
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:37,820
So why not just go and take a big chainsaw and lop off one of the feet and send it to old Lone-Tree Cowboy Dave back in Cleveland.

254
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
But he's still trying to act.

255
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,520
Okay, now don't forget it.

256
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
Okay, now don't forget it.

257
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,560
Okay, now don't forget it.

258
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,300
Okay, I'm smoking the snot.

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,760
Rubbing the grass.

260
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,420
Come on.

261
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,540
Come on.

262
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,600
Come on.

263
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:50,860
Come on.

264
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,800
Come on.

265
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,140
Thank you folks.

266
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,460
Come on.

267
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,560
Thank you folks.

268
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,380
Squeal.

269
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

270
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:10,400
I guess I should make some personal contact with you real quick and let you know that you've been listening to so many different subgenius tape contributions.

271
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,680
We have so many for you here.

272
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,980
Um.

273
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,740
Going back.

274
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,840
Going backwards in time.

275
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,960
Let's see.

276
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,060
Brain rot theater.

277
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,480
By the way, what I've been calling Lonesome Cowboy Dave show, really I should have called it Brain Rot Theater.

278
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,460
I knew it as Lonesome Cowboy Dave Show because, well, somebody told me that was what it is.

279
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,940
I knew Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,320
Anyway, Brain Rot Theater out of Cleveland.

281
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,500
And hopefully we'll get to the Rudolph Hitler Christmas show they did tonight.

282
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,640
So I'm going to hurry through this.

283
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,100
Uh.

284
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,940
The music Brain Free 7 by John Bartles.

285
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,320
More John Bartles coming up.

286
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,280
Also known as Joe Schmo.

287
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:04,180
That amazing stuff about she who evolved the critter to build the pipe.

288
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,720
We still don't know, friends.

289
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,040
Uh.

290
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,220
Some KPFA news from Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

291
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,660
Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell show.

292
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,560
That's, uh, there's more of that coming up.

293
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,560
Uh.

294
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,460
Of course, Bleepo Abernathy is our official announcer.

295
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,120
You heard some KHSU shows.

296
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,320
Uh.

297
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,300
Bits there from the fellow who, the caller who was seeing things.

298
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,580
And, uh, little bits of Media Barrage by Reverend Nick Nolan.

299
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,620
Some really rare Firesign Theater, which will also pop up again.

300
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,040
And, uh, some Joe Newman, of course.

301
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,620
Which, uh, and So So Dada on sound effects.

302
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,560
Even Dave Flugelwitz on sound effects.

303
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,540
But, friends.

304
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,220
Friends.

305
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,960
I have an announcement to make.

306
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,540
Uh.

307
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,460
Yes.

308
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,280
And this is not.

309
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,640
A

310
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,900
Specifically你們出 and

311
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
Please, sir, do you have anything about my financial case?

312
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,880
Oh!

313
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Watch what you say to me.

314
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,780
That was very heavy sound effects.

315
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,720
You know, the United Nations right now is meeting,

316
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,140
trying to limit the use of violent sound effects.

317
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,660
You got a big nose.

318
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,740
You know, I think KCFA should be a little more serious.

319
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,860
I wake up in the morning and I turn you on.

320
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,860
I'm an original subscriber.

321
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,140
And you're disrespectful of your listeners.

322
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,640
In what way?

323
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,600
You know, I'm quite serious about this.

324
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,560
Well, which listener are we not respectful of, properly speaking?

325
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,720
Well, if you wake up in the morning and you come into the station,

326
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,580
you should listen that your readers, your listeners should be intelligent.

327
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,720
Well, we can't affect that.

328
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,500
Intelligence.

329
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,100
Our listeners should be intelligent.

330
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,960
We can't affect their intelligence level.

331
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
You could try.

332
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,660
Well, how?

333
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,180
Will you teach them terrible things?

334
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,060
You could try by being intelligent yourself.

335
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,320
Well, we attempt to educate them, but they just won't learn.

336
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,040
You don't seem to be talking about anything serious,

337
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,340
like peace, like understanding, like consideration,

338
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,600
like education, like stuff like that.

339
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,340
This is a peaceful.

340
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,420
This is a warlike situation.

341
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,580
Uh, no, I don't think it's peaceful.

342
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,740
I think it's silly.

343
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,300
It's not warlike.

344
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:03,980
It's not warlike.

345
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,700
You complain about silliness?

346
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
What about the laugh?

347
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,200
It's ridiculous.

348
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,820
The ecstatic laugh in the fields of the Lord.

349
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,280
Rolling in the fields of understanding and peace here.

350
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,420
Oh, don't be silly.

351
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,760
Well, you want us to be unnaturally grave, grumpy, solemn, gloomy, long-faced, slant,

352
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,420
jorged.

353
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,080
Honey, you're not even funny.

354
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,160
Well, we're funny-looking.

355
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,180
That's worth something.

356
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,880
Why don't you try to defend yourself?

357
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,880


358
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,880


359
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,880


360
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,880


361
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,880


362
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Well, you can say it's funny, but you can't tell if you're funny or not.

363
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,360


364
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,380
Well, I mean, we're a little humorous.

365
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,260
And we're a little humorous, too.

366
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,400
Well, we're aqueous and vitreous humor.

367
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,520
We're trying to grow a lump for us.

368
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,320
That's your idea.

369
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,140
But you are not humorous.

370
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,000
You are silly.

371
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,660
You are cannibalizing.

372
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,640
Well, I'm sure that some of our callers may agree with what this caller has to say, and

373
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,260
marginally, like all such complaints.

374
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,620
That's why people like Chris and Philip, for instance, is that they're very serious.

375
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,700
You know, I'm a princess.

376
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:56,860
You're a princess.

377
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:56,860


378
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:56,860


379
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:56,860


380
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:56,860


381
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:56,860


382
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,120
We go golfing together, and I go water skiing with his lovely wife.

383
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,560
It's time to get personal now.

384
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,540
What inspires you to attempt to modify?

385
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:15,000
I used to work at KPSA, and I'm 72 now, and I have five children.

386
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,860
Well, I hope they're listening to our program, too.

387
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,420
The thing that impresses me about you young people in the morning is that you're so frightened that you're silly.

388
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,340
Well, but we're actually old as the hills. We're not young.

389
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,580
Ah, she just couldn't take the blinding truth.

390
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,480
I have waited so long for such a call.

391
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,820
I must say, it's pretty low when people call up and pretend to be old,

392
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,440
when they're actually young hippersnappers and spring chickens.

393
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,300
They can't fool old grandpappy.

394
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,220
Does that sound kind of foolish to you?

395
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,000
You know, you're not funny, and you're not serious, and you're just silly.

396
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm sorry, honey, you're just silly.

397
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,400
He's the boy.

398
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,200
I worked at it.

399
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,480
You know, the thing I've noticed about you young people is that you're just, you're silly.

400
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,540
Oh, come on, we're serious.

401
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,880
This is an absolutely serious show.

402
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,740
No, you're from Sirius, not Alpha Centauri like most people think.

403
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,000
A mysterious object from the depths of space.

404
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,540
We don't make any jokes.

405
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,360
We don't ever make fun of things, and we're serious.

406
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,220
I'm 106 years old now.

407
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,800
I've got 25 great-grandchildren.

408
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,320
Hey, didn't you accidentally cut off your hair?

409
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,600
Oh, no.

410
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,380
You're funny, and you're not serious.

411
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh, no.

412
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,820
What is funny, and what is serious?

413
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,720
It's partly evidence.

414
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,420
It's partly evidence.

415
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,300
I re-edited that call.

416
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,560
Do you want to hear the re-edit version?

417
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,620
All right, yes, ma'am.

418
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,300
Let's shut this down.

419
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,680
You know, I think KCFA should be a little more disrespectful of your listeners.

420
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,920
Hey, honey.

421
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,400
Your listeners should be silly.

422
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,420
Well, we attempt to educate them, but they don't learn.

423
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:54,680
You don't learn.

424
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,400
You don't learn.

425
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,620
You're notahnann 있어요 ничего.

426
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,180
You don't learn to be talkaittinh about anything that's silly.

427
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:58,760
Silly.

428
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,920
Silly.

429
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,340
It's not like you may make sense to m.

431
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,140

437
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm not do standards anymore.

438
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,040
I'm commonplace.

439
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
I feel court.

440
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,420
I canlighpottild.

441
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:34,440
and prestige. I want ratings and success. I don't give a damn about you or the world.

442
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:44,260
That's the truth. But if I could say I'm sorry, then I won't. Why should I? I mean, who the

443
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,960
hell are you anyways, you audience? You're on me every night like a pack of wolves

444
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,840
who can't stand facing what you are and what you've made. Yes, the world is a terrible place.

445
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,420
Yes, cancer and garbage exposures will get you. Yes, a war is coming. Yes, the world is shot to

446
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,200
hell and you're all goners. Everything's screwed up and you like it that way, don't you?

447
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,280
You're fascinated by the gory details. You're mesmerized by your own fear.

448
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,260
You revel in floods, car accidents, unstoppable diseases.

449
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,460
The happiest wonders are pain. That's where I come in, isn't it?

450
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,980
I'm here to lead you by the hand through the dark forest of your own hatred and anger and

451
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,940
humiliation. I'm providing a public service.

452
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,960
You're so scared. You're like a little child under the covers. You're afraid of the boogeyman

453
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,200
that you can't live without him. Your fear of your own lives has become your entertainment.

454
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Next month, millions of people are going to be listening to this show and you have nothing

455
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,820
to talk about. Marvelous technology is at a disposal. Instead of reaching up to new heights,

456
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
you're going to see how far down we can go. You're going to see how far down we can go.

457
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,760
How deep into the muck we can immerse ourselves.

458
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,060
What do you want to talk about?

459
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,420
These last thoughts? Your pet? Orgasms?

460
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,080
Pathetic. I despise each and every one of you.

461
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,560
You're nothing.

462
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,040
Nothing.

463
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,880
Nothing.

464
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


465
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


466
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


467
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


468
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


469
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


470
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


471
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


472
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


473
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:49,940


474
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,240
Nothing.

475
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
No brains.

476
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,500
No power.

477
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,980
No future.

478
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,740
No hope.

479
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,940
No God.

480
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,180
The only thing you believe in is me.

481
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,640
What do I really have in me?

482
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,860
I'm not afraid, see?

483
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,440
I come in here every night.

484
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,120
I make my case.

485
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,720
I make my point.

486
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,760
I say what I believe in.

487
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
I tell you what you are.

488
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,580
I have to.

489
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,500
I have no choice.

490
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,140
You frighten me.

491
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,980
I come in here every night.

492
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,700
I tear into you.

493
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,640
I abuse you.

494
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,820
I insult you.

495
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,060
I just keep going back for more.

496
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,940
What's wrong with you?

497
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,780
Why do you keep calling?

498
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,420
I don't want to hear anymore.

499
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,240
Stop talking!

500
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,100
Go away!

501
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,940
You're a bunch of yellow-bellied, spineless, bigoted, stupid, stupid punks.

502
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:49,940


503
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:49,940


504
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:49,940


505
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:49,940


506
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,480
You're a bunch of weird, quivering, drunken, insomniac, paranoid, disgusting, perverted,

507
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,880
voyeuristic, little, obscene phone callers.

508
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,280
What the hell with you?

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,140
I don't need your fear and your stupidity.

510
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,920
You don't get it.

511
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,580
It's wasted on you.

512
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,440
What's wrong?

513
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,300
So sad.

514
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,920
I'm going to go to bed.

515
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:19,920


516
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:19,920


517
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:19,920


518
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,640
So fresh, the days that are no more.

519
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,020
Tears, idle tears.

520
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,140
I know not what they mean.

521
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,920
Tears from the depths of some divine despair rise from the heart and squirt right out the

522
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,360
eyes.

523
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,060
When looking only happily at the views and thinking of the days that are no more.

524
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:49,300
Two days later, he killed himself by hammering two five-inch nails into his head.

525
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,280
Fresh as a sunbeam glittering on the sail that brings our friends up from the underworld.

526
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,640
Here they come, Al.

527
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,100
Sad as the one that trembles on the verge before it sucks them all back down again.

528
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,740
I'm going to take those nails away while he's trembling there.

529
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,660
I think that's a bad deal.

530
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,980
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

531
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,900
Ah, brain-burned hours as in dark summer dawns the earth.

532
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:19,900


533
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,200
The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds which see to dying eyes a dying show which

534
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,840
in the listener's ear doth fade and fade.

535
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,940
So sad, so fresh, the shows that are no more.

536
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,900
So how goes the show?

537
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:49,880
Well, it wanders mooing throughout the pastures, up the hillsides, across the meadows, over

538
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,160
the stills, and the hillsides now.

539
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,100
It is buried deep in the next valley of glades.

540
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,260
Oh, spooky!

541
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,380
Oh, yeah, Jim Jones' rocket party.

542
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,000
That's right.

543
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,240
Yes, that's right.

544
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,540
You see, we trap deuterium in the form of a plasma.

545
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,500
It's an ionized gas and confine it within a powerful magnetic field right here in the studio.

546
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,400
The gas is then heated by bombarding it with energy.

547
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Now, when we get the temperature of this plasma up to a...

548
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:19,880


549
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,520
At least 50 million degrees Celsius, this process becomes self-sustaining.

550
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,620
And the energy of the emitted neutrons can be captured as heat.

551
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,700
And in turn, we use that to power our vehicle.

552
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,520
...positive by the otherness of the 911 instructions that are included in the warhead.

553
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,880
Yes, the itchiness of the scratchiness and the richness of the water.

554
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,860
Well, I'm having a major heart attack right now.

555
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,220
I'm going to call 911.

556
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,180
Excuse me.

557
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,240
Oh, no, no, no.

558
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,700
Wait a moment.

559
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,700
You know, it's all in the mind, you know.

560
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,020
We are the 57th!

561
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,060
We are living we shall!

562
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,920
And away is a terrible thing to wait!

563
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,940
Can you think space and time are everything?

564
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,640
All encompassing.

565
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,420
But whether or not you think it or not...

566
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,780
Does it matter?

567
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,300
What is the reality?

568
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,780
To discover the reality of anything, we have to find out certain...

569
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,760
Certain... facts.

570
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,900
And the most important fact in any scheme...

571
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,260
...is to find out what the end result of the scheme is.

572
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,180
Something is trying to get through to us.

573
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:01,280
The moment person out there had any idea what I was talking about, I...

574
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,320
Your mind.

575
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,120
It is the center of your life.

576
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,420
It is everything you hear.

577
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
Everything you see.

578
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,260
Everything you hear.

579
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,260


580
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,720
Everything you feel.

581
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
It is everything you are.

582
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,340
How you move.

583
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,020
It is such a story, your mind.

584
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,440
Well, that's pretty sad.

585
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,040
And as long as we're listening to this music, we're going to be sad.

586
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,840
And if this next story is sadder still, I'll be close.

587
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,540
Instead of vacationing in the Florida sun this winter,

588
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,400
Steve Weiner spent his days in court listening to a hellish tale of decaying animal carcasses,

589
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,680
open graves, and odious smells.

590
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,760
Weiner, 32, a New York City policeman, had spent $3,500 to bury his two beagles,

591
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,240
Billy and Bert, at the Long Island Pet Cemetery.

592
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,920
He was one of about 20 Pet Cemetery customers who listened in court last week

593
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,800
as witnesses...

594
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,140
Sorry about this.

595
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,440
...described what was found when police raided the decaying tombs of the disgustingly charmed cemetery.

596
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Now look at how he's growing larger than life size now.

597
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,680
See, that's a show effect.

598
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,680
Tens of thousands of dead animals brought to the cemetery were dumped into mass graves,

599
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,540
stored in walk-in freezers and burned en masse in a large crematorium

600
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,880
after their owners had paid hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars to have their pets buried with dignity.

601
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,900
What would you do, caller?

602
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,460
What would you do?

603
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,140
Suppose that the little pet, the friend of your bosom that you had all these times,

604
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,160
was taken and thrown into a pit like vermin.

605
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,820
What would you do?

606
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,880
What would you do?

607
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,880
What would you do?

608
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,740
Fly around, little caller.

609
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,940
Whee, whee, whee.

610
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,680
The music would get louder and louder and louder.

611
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,180
Oh.

612
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:30,520
Oh.

613
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


614
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


615
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


616
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


617
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


618
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


619
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:30,780


620
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,760
We'd have a cold and...

621
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,000
We were smaller than the spiders.

622
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:35,960
That's right.

623
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,420
We were.

624
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,280
Reverend Hell and myself crawling up the sides of the flowers,

625
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,100
looking out for spiders because they were bigger than we were.

626
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,520
You'll remember it differently from the idea.

627
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,420
There were no flowers at this early time in our Earth's history.

628
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,620
They weren't like flowers to me in those days.

629
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,820
They had broad leaves, but they were actually gigantic.

630
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,060
A burst of color up near the sky and a little caller all alone out there in the cold.

631
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,420
That's a little caller.

632
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:00,780
Not the bird.

633
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:00,780


634
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:30,600
little colors since the most everything was green and brown. The color that we associate with flowers didn't arise until the Cretaceous period ended, approximately 65 million years before the present era. Then grasses and flowering plants made their appearance in the Cenozoic world. The common bee, which appeared during the Cretaceous era, managed to organize and pollinate the plants, causing the flowering of the flowers.

635
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:47,740
The world was taken over by huge, gorgeous blossoms, but the flowers of this early prehistoric time were far more glorious in their first default than the decayed and senile blossoms and plants of today. Yes, horrible horticultural facts.

636
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:57,360
On the eyeballs, farther and farther, like the eyeballs of a decaying mummy, into the mysterious, infinite vagueness of the future.

637
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,660
Here we go now, into the mysterious, vague future.

638
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,680
Yes, sirree, the Rob Joes.

639
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm Reverend Hal, gives you a guide of how to find out about the future when it happens to you.

640
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,220
Here we go.

641
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,740
Yes, we're hurtling into the future at 60 seconds per minute.

642
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,140
Wow.

643
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,580
How big a jar.

644
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,200
Now let's go over that again. You say you saw some sort of future.

645
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,560
The little color looks like a firefly, doesn't it? As he glows inside the jar here.

646
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,200
Well, the reason he is highly glowed that way is he has powerful sexual attraction.

647
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,760
And a nice little tea.

648
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:44,320
The little color is made by eliminating the fluid which causes bioluminescence, or the phenomenon of a little collared hiney blinking in the dark.

649
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,620
Stop it.

650
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,780
Let's have that close-up now.

651
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,300
Wow.

652
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,320
Look at it.

653
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,060
It's scintillating.

654
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,560
It's a little collared insect-like round eyes.

655
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,700
With which they could see the movement of the sun if they cared to.

656
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,220
Yeah, but they don't.

657
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,700
So we don't either.

658
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,240
They're prepared to spend their time burrowing through the muck.

659
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,300
Well, forget it, fella. We gave you some air holes.

660
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,340
And a little flashlight.

661
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:20,360
And some food that'll last you, the size of an insect, over one month in your time.

662
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,600
Oh, hi. Okay, there we go.

663
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,860
Even Bob Nelson's here to entertain you.

664
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,260
Oh, no, that old man's trying to kill us.

665
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,000
11 minutes left.

666
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,120
Bad show.

667
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,700
Yeah.

668
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,220
We got it in here.

669
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,220
What?

670
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,500
All right, now, what's your beat, caller?

671
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,360
And we'll just play piano here.

672
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,360
I'd like to dedicate this next song to all of you who are out there listening to the show.

673
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,280
On the show.

674
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,880
It's spooky.

675
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,940
Being with us tonight here.

676
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,500
It's cootie.

677
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,260
It's almost 6 o'clock, but we still have a little fun and good cheer to go around.

678
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,420
We're still trying to find out where the fun and good cheer is.

679
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,620
And we're going to see the night out with you, our audience.

680
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,420
That's right.

681
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,780
He's trying to get through to us.

682
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,280
Something is trying to communicate with the consciousness of mankind.

683
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,360
And he says it appears to be space aliens.

684
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,900
But Stryber also points out, he says it's funny, in almost every instance of people contacting UFOs,

685
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,880
there's a heavy occult involvement as well.

686
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,700
These people have been involved in new age techniques and therapies.

687
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,960
You say you can throw dude out the window and shimtoism.

688
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,680
No, no, no, you don't.

689
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,740
Because these were...

690
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,800
These were the space showers as they came by at a certain time or periods of our time to show us the light back to God.

691
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:44,180
But what they're telling us, the space brothers, don't put too much of your energy in letting somebody else show you the way.

692
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,760
You should be in direct contact with God since we are all part of that God creation.

693
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,260
And you think like Christ is just like somebody that is like showing us the way to this God?

694
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,780
Well, he was a way shore too.

695
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,180
His real name was Emmanuel.

696
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,400
Emmanuel.

697
00:35:59,620 --> 00:35:59,620


698
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,800
Well, look at your Bible, Matthew 1, verse 22.

699
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,460
Right.

700
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:13,240
And if you have, depending on what version of the Bible that you have, verse 23 and 24 will tell you a different person gave him the name Jesus.

701
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:21,960
He was really named Jesus, which meant the anointed one, by Saul of Tarsus 300 years after he left the Middle East after he went through the crucifixion.

702
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,140
So you actually do prescribe to the Bible that?

703
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,820
No, I say parts of the Bible are correct, not all of it.

704
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,720
Okay.

705
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:28,840
Okay.

706
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,160
So, George Green, some wild things tonight.

707
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,480
He's talking about UFO and much more than just UFOs and UFO sightings.

708
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:42,500
He's really got theories about how this whole world runs and he's making it run, the Committee of 300 and so on and so forth.

709
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,640
Okay, first of all, all right, this is the way, I'm a believer, all right?

710
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,320
Thank you.

711
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,540
Okay, first of all, I'm from Vancouver.

712
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,720
I was in Cypress Park last year.

713
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,380
I saw an alien crash land.

714
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,840
Were we on acid, Alec?

715
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,320
No, this is truth, truth.

716
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
I'm telling you, all right?

717

It kind of makes you wonder

763
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,820
Don't it?

764
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,500
You don't know

765
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,480
To you

766
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,820
Who put the holes in the donuts?

767
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,840

But that's mine, don't matter

769
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,760

Nothing on earth can hold you

771
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:26,880
Nothing on earth can hold you

772

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,500

I'll be back soon

784
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,940
I'll be back in those words

785
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,580
Uh, sad.

786
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,600
The tape runs out so suddenly there.

787
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,720
Um, beautiful song called, uh,

788
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,720
I don't know what it's called,

789
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,140
but it's from Cloaking Device,

790
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,940
Ultimate Klingons,

791
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,620
Reverend Nancy Darnell there in Germany.

792
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,660
She's like the Grace Slick

793
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,580
of the Church of the Subgenius.

794
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,720
Uh,

795
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,280
Ultimate Klingons.

796
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,100
Before that, some clips, uh,

797
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,120
Media Barrage clips put together by

798
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,520
Reverend Nick Nolan about the Space Brothers.

799
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,100
Uh, a little bit more music by, uh,

800
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,440
uh,

801
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,340
Who was it that I ran?

802
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,460
Oh, John Bartles, yeah.

803
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,420
And, uh, John Bartles,

804
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,900
wonderful, uh, uh,

805
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,600
sort of cantankerous singer,

806
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,700
songwriter in, uh,

807
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,860
Springwater, New York,

808
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,380
I believe.

809
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,500
And, dear friends,

810
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,940
lots of KPFA Subgenius radio show,

811
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,140
uh, from the California radio show

812
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,080
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence.

813
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,140
Oh, I should mention that, uh,

814
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,740
some of the tapes that we're playing in the background,

815
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,480
including the music that's in the background right now,

816
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,720
is by Reverend Arnold Mathis.

817
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,400
Like, uh, Arnold Mathis stuff.

818
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,380
And some of the tapes that we're playing in the background right now,

819
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,620
is that KPFA material, um,

820
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,900
and some other material we're playing tonight,

821
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,060
is from the KPFA fan, uh,

822
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,800
Reverend Phineas Narco,

823
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,760
who did a compilation of the, uh,

824
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,060
sort of a best of the KPFA show,

825
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,860
which he sells.

826
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,260
And some of the recording quality is kind of tinny,

827
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,580
because it's been copied several times,

828
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,880
but I think Phineas Narco has done a,

829
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,560
a pretty good editing job.

830
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:27,960
Really,

831
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,260
really an excellent editing job,

832
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,100
if you consider how difficult it is to edit those guys' show.

833
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,760
Not like this show, of course.

834
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,580
This show's really, um,

835
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:37,980
and,

836
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,120
what else?

837
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,780
Yeah, that's a,

838
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,220
that's, uh, about it.

839
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,600
Now, I,

840
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,940
I do have a whole nother show's worth of tape

841
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,960
that I put together last night,

842
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,140
that I could play, but I won't,

843
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,920
because, uh,

844
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,440
I think it's very important.

845
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,700
It's still near Christmas now,

846
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,360
and some of you need,

847
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,100
well, you have to hear

848
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:57,940
Brainwashed,

849
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,900
and, uh,

850
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,200
it's, it's a,

851
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


852
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


853
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


854
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


855
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


856
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


857
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


858
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


859
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


860
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,200


861
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,240


862
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,060
Although, I do want to mention one thing.

863
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,860
Well, two things.

864
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,380
Number one,

865
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,180
you're listening to the

866
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,100
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

867
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,320
the voice of the Church of the Subgenius

868
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,360
here in Dallas, Texas.

869
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,300
And we do have this show coming up,

870
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,560
a, a massive Subgenius revival,

871
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,680
or devival,

872
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,860
as the case may be.

873
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
Uh, New Year's,

874
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,940
New Year's night.

875
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,620
Inaugurating the year five,

876
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:36,340
BX. And we had some listeners call from Fort Worth who had a good idea, a real good idea.

877
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,880
You know, we always do short duration mass marriages at our revivals towards the end

878
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:50,600
so that those who aren't married can do whatever sort of guilty sex acts that they can think of

879
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,760
completely absolved and sanctified during that duration of that short duration marriage,

880
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,840
usually 24 hours. Well, this couple in Fort Worth suggested that we ought to do a mass

881
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,340
short duration divorce first because several people, them for instance, are already married,

882
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,440
but they want to go fornicate with other people that New Year's night at the subgenius show

883
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,920
at Club No. And they don't feel like they can unless they have a short duration divorce first,

884
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,340
which of course only lasts as long as those short duration marriages,

885
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:26,740
will do.

886
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,900
So they're going to be looking for other people to marry, friend. And if that serves as any sort

887
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,980
of inducement, I'm glad because I have a feeling we've been getting call after call from young

888
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:48,120
folks going, come on, it's not really only 21 and over, is it? I'm afraid it is. They serve drugs

889
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:56,400
at this club, Club No, alcohol, the, well, it's probably the strongest drug next to crack. I'm

890
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,580
sure.

891
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,280
And I'm sure they'll be legalized next. They'll never, ever get around the froth because the

892
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:14,540
froth users just aren't that desperate, you know? So, so friends, really, if you were thinking,

893
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,100
well, I know it's going to be too crowded down there. I don't want to go down there on New Year's.

894
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:26,120
It's going to be too crowded. I have a feeling it's not going to be too crowded. Okay. And not

895
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,620
only that,

896
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,180
it's, uh, well, we need, we need the support. We need the show of support, dear friends. Anyway,

897
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,680
enough of that. We're going to go to this amazing thing from Brain Rock Theater in Cleveland. There

898
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,300
are new friends, our new radio friends, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Psychopath Finder, and,

899
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:54,000
uh, Reverend Chaz have created this horrible thing. Once again, you are listening to the

900
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,300
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

901
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:26,200
If you need more information on the Church of the Subgenius for free, just for free, go ahead. See, let me put a challenge to you. See if you can not only write that postcard, but address it and put a stamp on it and get it into the mail. I'm amazed how few people are even able to do that much for such a wonderful giant pack. Well, it's actually, it's pretty pathetic pack of information, but it, it, it tells you how to get a really good pack for almost free information.

902
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,280
Okay.

903
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


904
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


905
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


906
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


907
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


908
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,280


909
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:55,720
That's right. The Bob, just Bob or our Slack or Subgenius, the post office knows all our names at post office box 1 4 0 3 0 6 Dallas, Texas 7 5 2 1 4. I'll give that number again. That's box 1 4 0 3 0 6 Dallas, Texas 7 5 2 1 4.

910
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,280
Okay.

911
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,380
Ah, yes, dear friend.

912
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,000
Yes.

913
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:23,100
Good evening. This is See How He Fools You. If you type it, they will laugh. In the annals of radio comedy, sporadically has a yarn been so cooked up and so off base that it had no basis in actuality at all. No rhyme, no reason to manifest itself in any form, except maybe to tease and titillate. That story is this story.

914
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,040
From the unopened files of your secret government.

915
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,880
Stranger than the hangar 19 aliens or conspiratorial than the Ronnie Reagan clones.

916
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:48,740
Didn't know about that one. Did you more diabolically inane than whatever you could think of in the next 30 minutes comes a story only recently released by a secret directive from the CIA CLU, the central intelligence agency for civil liberties union.

917
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,880
This story was hidden from the American pubic hairs for fear on the economic impact on the Christmas season.

918
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,540
President.

919
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,660
Transition here.

920
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:07,280
But through the most diligent efforts of the brain rot radio news team, and especially the efforts of its two most obnoxious reporters, Phil Matt in 11 and Cameron close up.

921
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,920
It will be told tonight.

922
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:15,940
Welcome to the brain rot cowboy Christmas presentation of Blitzkrieg Christmas.

923
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,800
The Rudolph Hitler story.

924
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,820
We turn now political powder keg.

925
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,140
That is a North dramatic pole in the 1990s.

926
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,280
Where there is an ugly.

927
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,760
Specter raising his head.

928
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,640
The horrific Phoenix arising from people's ashes.

929
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,280
Hey, what's that?

930
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,320
You want me to go before that?

931
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,760
That's my producer.

932
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,600
A huge idiot talking to me in the headset.

933
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,400
Okay.

934
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:38,660
Okay.

935
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,160
We go now.

936
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:46,000
Prison in the North dramatic pole where Peter slave puller Rudolph Hitler works on his book.

937
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,440
Mine cough.

938
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,020
Oh.

939
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:49,820
Oh.

940
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:50,600


941
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:50,940
Oh.

942
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,040
Oh.

943
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,560
Oh my.

944
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,300
Oh no I'm out of palabra.

945
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,300


946
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,300


947
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:55,300


948
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,880
That's my cough trap.

949
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,300
That's my cough,

950
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,760
my cough.

951
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,240
If I'm modest.

952
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:04,940
That's not okay.

953
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,220
No go back to the future or forward to the pasture to the 1990s.

954
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:11,500
Again,

955
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:19,940
us four and in the North dramatic poll and pick up as a whiskered Rudolph gives one of his infamous speeches to his goose trotting Jennifer.

956
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,980
Bullies.

957
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,680
A skin had beyond.

958
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,220
in the old East Germanic Pole.

959
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,280
I tell you, Nixon,

960
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,980
Rudolf Hitlerbach makes a lot of sense.

961
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,520
He's got them elves figured out all right.

962
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,960
Those damn elves are the cause of everything

963
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,020
that's wrong with the North Germanic Pole.

964
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,580
Oh, elves, you say?

965
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,580
Eh, that effect?

966
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,200
You know I never liked their kind anyway.

967
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,660
Always kept to themselves the way they dress.

968
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,680
They all dress the same.

969
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,020
It's Halloween every night.

970
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,480
You see, this Rudolf Hitler's got the good on these elves.

971
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,800
Hey, wait, Vomit, come over here.

972
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,200
No, that's stupid.

973
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:10,640
Come here.

974
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,380
Stupid Vomit, come here.

975
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,220
Hey, hey, stop stomp, stomp,

976
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,860
stomp eating or what?

977
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,440
Bucking antlers, bucking antlers?

978
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,620
Bucking antlers?

979
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,660
All set, get ready for the hit for the Hofer speech.

980
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,580
Get out, get out.

981
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,060
They be handing out the red cheese.

982
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,400
They got free beer.

983
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,380
And thoughts, too.

984
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,980
They know how to treat us, Nazis.

985
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,200
We interrupt this Blitzkrieg Christmas

986
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,160
with a word from one of our sponsors.

987
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,700
The snide world of sports presents the Skinshead Game,

988
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,820
the sports show where skinheads can tee off on any foreigner.

989
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,220
Watch them drive.

990
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,540
With long distances to find foreigners.

991
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,060
They'll be slicing foreigners up

992
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,380
and hooking to the right.

993
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,620
The far, far right.

994
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,120
Yes, there'll be subpar rounds galore

995
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,800
as the skinheads are already subpar.

996
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,800
That's the Skinshead Game.

997
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,420
Later from the lovely Autobahn Shores.

998
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,840
Now back to a blistering Christmas.

999
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,280
Christmas.

1000
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,600
Say, Donner,

1001
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,160
I heard this Rudolph Hitler is the leader of the nostrils.

1002
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,860
Say, right here, these pamphlets, man on man there.

1003
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,420
These pants are tough to turn with hooks.

1004
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,080
Yeah, the Nutshe Party's leader, Rudolph Hitler,

1005
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,660
aka, the Hooper, says,

1006
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,820
if we join, we get to rule with the night in here.

1007
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,520
The kind of money that the Hooper himself.

1008
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,560
One, two, three.

1009
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,560
That is correct.

1010
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,040
The Hooper, he is the new master.

1011
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,960
He's the reindeer of destiny.

1012
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,140
He'll go down and in for me.

1013
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,220
He speaks for all of us pure reindeers.

1014
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:58,700
He speaks of a strong, unified, right stag land.

1015
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,480
Employment, fixing the economy.

1016
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,140
These elves are ruining the economy.

1017
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,020
He has ways to stop the elves from overrunning our unified stag land.

1018
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,640
I vomit.

1019
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,760
I ain't had a job in three years.

1020
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,520
But I see all the elves working,

1021
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,480
taking hay out of my kid's mouth, banisters.

1022
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,720
That's right.

1023
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,320
Check it out.

1024
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,960
Who owns the toy factories, huh?

1025
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,360
Who owns the stables, huh?

1026
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:22,940
Uh-huh.

1027
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,120
Them freakin' elves.

1028
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,100
We're being slowly conquered.

1029
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,060
We gotta get them damn elves.

1030
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,800
Come on, let's go.

1031
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,380
Ladies, fineholds.

1032
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,040
The Hooper is set to speak to us.

1033
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,520
My caribou, Petrus.

1034
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,340
My fellow stags.

1035
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,100
My national socialist northern reindeer party brothers.

1036
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,520
There's a conspiracy going on in our Reichstag land.

1037
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,880
A deep-rooted, foreign-funded conspiracy by traitors.

1038
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,700
Traitors are everywhere.

1039
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,420
Every day there's more of them immigrating here.

1040
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,780
They own the stables.

1041
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,600
They own the hay.

1042
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,620
They own the toy store.

1043
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,140
Yes, they even own our supposed leader, Hindenklaus.

1044
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,040
Who are these defilers who dare to take what is ours from us?

1045
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,300
The master breed.

1046
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,960
It's the elves!

1047
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,000
Yes, the elves.

1048
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,680
Always the elves.

1049
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,300
What's wrong with our North Germanic pole?

1050
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,280
There's a cause of us reindeer being treated like cattle?

1051
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,160
Like second-class beasts?

1052
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,960
You see the elves everywhere.

1053
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,340
More and more of them every day.

1054
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,540
Dressing funny, talking funny, acting arrogant.

1055
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,280
Acting better than the rest of us reindeer stags.

1056
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,720
The master breed.

1057
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,260
Wandering around with their bald legs.

1058
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,860
Always tinkering, tinkering.

1059
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,160
All of them with their beards and funny hats.

1060
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,500
Taking all of this rightfully ours.

1061
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,280
Ours if we herd together.

1062
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,760
Excuse me.

1063
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,720
Herd together.

1064
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,400
They must be punished.

1065
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,040
Must be stopped and eliminated.

1066
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,540
Must be eliminated for the good of the North party and the Reichsland.

1067
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,160
It's the master breed.

1068
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,160
Obey me and I will lead the way to a new order.

1069
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,700
A new worldwide order.

1070
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:18,820
Think!

1071
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,200
Ho!

1072
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,300
Think!

1073
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:20,900
Ho!

1074
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,040
Think!

1075
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:22,640
Ho!

1076
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,500
Think!

1077
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,240
Ho!

1078
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,200
You see my Nerean stock.

1079
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,880
Modern society is what, is what, is what?

1080
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,780
A colossus with feet of clay.

1081
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:38,740
That is why I have created an unpretentious centralization which united all power in the hoofs of my government.

1082
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,860
I am the government.

1083
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,920
I have created a covert constitution which will mechanically govern all movements of elves.

1084
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,680
And we will not stop until every elf is accounted for and held accountable for.

1085
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,700
Now is the time to strike.

1086
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,580
To quell their lioness objectives.

1087
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,380
Follow me and I will take the elves down from their high purchase.

1088
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,580
I will build a stronger, greater, unified Stagland.

1089
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,620
An unstoppable Stagland.

1090
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,540
But we can't stop there.

1091
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,660
This is a world-wide funded conspiracy.

1092
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,980
The elves wear many hats and have long arms.

1093
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,900
We will have to take our conquests worldwide.

1094
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,140
To eliminate them for the good of our stock.

1095
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,660
No more will we have to build toys for stag.

1096
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,460
No more will we have to pull the slave or hidden clothes.

1097
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,240
For we are the ones who pull the reins.

1098
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,280
To build a third rein of pure, superior stock of reindeer.

1099
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,700
To last for a thousand points of light.

1100
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,280
Did I say that right?

1101
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,020
Wait a minute.

1102
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,340
And so Rudolf Hitler got his reindeer cronies on his inner circle.

1103
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,620
Denser, stupid, vomit, smasher, crasher, downer and blitzer.

1104
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,140
They carried out his promise of persecution and bad manners.

1105
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,820
They formed various secret police forces.

1106
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,620
The most notorious of these were the Winter Storm Troopers.

1107
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,060
Big leather booted reindeers defending North Sea meetings.

1108
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:03,800
Disrupting left wing Republican, far right liberal and hippie communist meetings.

1109
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,440
But what they did best was to harry and persecute elves.

1110
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,120
This the reindeer did with glee.

1111
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,460
The weaponless elves were no match.

1112
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,520
They were outweighed by 800 pounds.

1113
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,840
And horns.

1114
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,020
Who could that be at this hour?

1115
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,100
What do your reindeer want?

1116
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,940
Gestapo police!

1117
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,500
Shut up, elves!

1118
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,840
And get packing!

1119
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,520
You got three minutes.

1120
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,860
Where, where are you taking us?

1121
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,520
You and your family are headed toward constipation.

1122
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:44,500
You never need to be here.

1123
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,280
camps where we're putting all you elves.

1124
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,520
But we're not elves. No, listen.

1125
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,040
We're Lithuanian sea monkeys.

1126
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,040
You look elfish to me.

1127
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,980
You're all three feet high.

1128
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,440
Look at them slippers, curled up,

1129
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,220
toes at the end of the bell,

1130
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,040
and them straight up lovely

1131
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,400
tarts. If you ain't an elf,

1132
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,360
I'm boy George Harrison Ford.

1133
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,240
Now move it.

1134
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,240
Not only were the elves hunted down,

1135
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,560
but anything resembling an elf was rounded up.

1136
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,540
Up gnomes, trolls, munchkins,

1137
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,060
pixies, and even fairies

1138
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,520
were put in Nazi constipation camps.

1139
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,400
The once happy singing toy

1140
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,120
factories and toy land of

1141
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,080
Hindon Claus were turned into

1142
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,420
a dysentery infected and hateful

1143
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,780
nuclear playground.

1144
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,640
Hey kids, wanna have a blast?

1145
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,520
Come fall out with the other kids

1146
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,500
ages one to a half life

1147
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,920
at the Nuclear

1148
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,000
Playground.

1149
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,880
You'll have the time of your

1150
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,820
short life playing Scud,

1151
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,380
Hide and Seek, Atomic Leapfrog,

1152
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,000
Landmine

1153
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Hopscotch, Surface to Air

1154
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,800
Frisbee, ICBM

1155
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,400
Red Rover, and Thermonuclear

1156
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,680
Bingo.

1157
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,240
The Nuclear

1158
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,040
Playground on sunny and

1159
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,860
mushroom cloudy days.

1160
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,860
In order for the Nazis to fulfill this,

1161
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,200
quest of manifest expansion,

1162
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,700
they had to stock up on materials of war

1163
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,980
which was forbidden by the Treaty of Verslay.

1164
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,580
The resourceful, nationalistic reindeer

1165
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,220
turned to synthetic products.

1166
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,320
Plus, they found eager sellers

1167
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,180
for their other war-making material needs.

1168
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,160
During the worldwide recession,

1169
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,320
American companies, funded by the

1170
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,160
first nationalistic bag of terrorism,

1171
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,380
and the CIA-CLU,

1172
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,260
were negotiating secret deals

1173
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,180
to sell arms to the Reichstagland.

1174
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,260
Business is as business does.

1175
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,640
War is good business.

1176
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,100
With the war machine geared and oiled

1177
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,940
by the conglomerate IC Farben,

1178
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,320
making the synthetics,

1179
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,460
the Nazis and Rudolf Hitler were ready.

1180
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,500
They invaded the Poles first.

1181
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,720
They blitzkrieged the East Pole.

1182
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,920
That went feebly. Next, the South Pole.

1183
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,840
That too fell.

1184
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,240
Now, only the West Pole remained.

1185
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,860
To attack the West Pole, an alliance

1186
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,720
was formed between the Nazis and the

1187
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,960
Italian caribous and the Japanese antelopes.

1188
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,860
These three powers wanted

1189
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,860
to take over the cosmos.

1190
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,260
And only one thing stood in its way.

1191
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,440
The good old USA, which helped

1192
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,340
arm the Nazis in the first place.

1193
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,120
The invasion of the West Pole

1194
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,720
was to start in two cities.

1195
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,120
Cleveland and Dallas.

1196
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,780
The date was picked.

1197
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,040
November 24th of the next Christmas.

1198
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,520
The die is cast.

1199
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,100
You hear the pitter-patter on the rooftop.

1200
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,780
This Christmas, be wary.

1201
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,260
Be very wary.

1202
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,320
Things are not what they seem.

1203
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,940
To be continued.

1204
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:38,860
Continue.

1205
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,100
Get on your best DVD,

1206
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,100


1207
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,520
we've got the audio app at all times

1208
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:00,700
if you are into inspired music.

1209
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,080
Have your subdomlining

1210
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,080


1211
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,060
Now you can go any direction

1212
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:05,080
for all the various

1213
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,080


1214
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,080


1215
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,080


1216
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,260
in the自我

1217
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:10,980
or typhoid.

1218
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,580
Yes, I mean typhoid.

1219
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
Yes, you can give these diseases and more

1220
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,980
with Brain Rot's designer diseases.

1221
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,200
One of your wife's friends blew the whistle

1222
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,260
on one of your little affairs.

1223
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,520
A little whooping cough will cure her.

1224
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,040
Yes, you could give the gift that keeps on taking

1225
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,120
this holiday season.

1226
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,380
As I said, I'm Dr. Out of Tech.

1227
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,860
You can choose from HIV, the plague,

1228
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,520
polio, diphtheria, malaria, yellow fever,

1229
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,680
and a colony of designer diseases.

1230
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,700
Yes, and that colony will be singing an unhappy melody

1231
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,500
because we've got infections that complicate complexions

1232
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,120
like acne, eczema, spheria.

1233
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,280
Longing for a lasting gift?

1234
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,780
Give the gift of male pattern baldness.

1235
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,060
That's designer diseases.

1236
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,920
Are you vain and worry about staying?

1237
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,700
Then we've got a specialty shop just for you.

1238
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,920
The armpit euphorium.

1239
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,860
Ape for short.

1240
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,200
A-P-E-T-E-Q.

1241
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,040
Everything you and your...

1242
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,820
Our armpits will need to get and keep them fresh and trendy.

1243
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:30,040
We have the shampoo, the mousse, the spray, the combs,

1244
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,240
the brushes, and of course the Afro pick.

1245
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,780
Do you have armpits like Don King's hair?

1246
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,000
Come to the armpit euphorium.

1247
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,520
We'll style your pits with such exotic cuts

1248
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,820
as the dreadlock armpit cut, the mohawk armpit cut,

1249
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,140
the marine cut armpit, and so on.

1250
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,460
Our specially trained armpit barbers will blow them dry.

1251
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,480
Next door to the armpit euphorium,

1252
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,820
right now, there's a special on pubic haircuts at Pubic Parking.

1253
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,180
We'll wash, condition, gel, and blow dry your pubes

1254
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,740
in one of our special boos.

1255
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,860
Yes, for just 200 bucks,

01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,300
we'll give you the best blow dry of your life

1257
