3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello! Praise Robert!

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,180

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,560
I want to create diversity of the forms.

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,860
Open to my words.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,320
You that divide and multiply it.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,340
Hear my sounds.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,600
I make yield league to you.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,600
Ancient associates and fellow wanderers.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,940
You that move the heart in fur and scale.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,400
I join with you, you that sing bright and subtle.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,380
Making shapes that my throat cannot tell.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,180
You that harden the horn and make quick the eye.

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,280
You that run the fast fox and the zigzag fly.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,620
You sizeless makers of the mole and whale.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,040
Aid me, and I will aid you.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,480
You.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,140
I make a blood pact with you.

25
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,720
You that lift the blossom and the green branch.

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,120
You who make symmetries more true.

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,580
You who consider the angle of your limbs.

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,020
Who dance in slower time.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,800
Who watch the patterns.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,660
You rough coated.

31
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,260
Who eat water.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
Everything's going fine.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
No trouble.

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,820
Just get set and get going.

35
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:30,920
Recording.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,220
Everything is going fine.

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,060
No trouble.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,640
Everything's going fine.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
No trouble.

40
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,780
Recording.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
Everything is going fine.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,820
No trouble.

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,800
Just get set and get going. Amen.

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,700
Recording. Everything's going fine.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,620
No trouble.

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,580
Get set and get going. Amen.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,820
Bob?

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,600
Praise Bob.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,680
Praise Bob.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,040
Vov, vovo stavo, vovo stavo,

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,620
Pravo, Three.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,020
Bü Cheers folks.

53
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,760
Oscar and a lot of Eiwit исследanis verbose music y'all.

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:38,620
Boo boo boo boo boo.

55
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Bob?

56
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,700
Bob?

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,260
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

58
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,920
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,020
Bob?

60
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,960
That's your key phrase.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,120
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,660
We are controlling transmission.

63
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,840
We will control the horizontal.

64
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,480
We will control the vertical.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,440
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,820
and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,600
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.

68
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,740
And what exactly does this do for them?

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,140
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned

70
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,160
and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,

71
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,160
the imprinting of the true subgenius.

72
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,200
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,200
You have to turn on the machine.

74
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,060
This is Radio Yerevan.

75
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
We got you, boy.

76
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,600
We got you, boy.

77
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,320
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,440
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

79
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,080
There is absolutely no other possibility.

81
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,440
And now you are ready for the final...

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,460
200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,300
We subjected it to careful editing

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,200
to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste

85
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,380
for late night viewing.

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,400
As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code

87
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,620
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,600
than the industry code.

89
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,200
We are sensitive to the concerns

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,580
of the public and the public.

91
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,860
We are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter

92
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,240
and assure you that this network will continue to adhere

93
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,180
to the high standards we have maintained throughout the years.

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,900
Thank you.

95
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,500
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

96
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,920
which reaches from the inner mind to...

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,820
The subgenius.

99
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,100
The power of slack!

100
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,540
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

101
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,940
Gosh!

102
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:31,300
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

103
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,160
Awe yes, it's so good to be back on the air to deliver.

104
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,900
at least some slight modicum of that ethereal and elusive slack.

105
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,300
Friends, it's been a long week for me.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,840
I've just spent the last 17 hours saving old, cool-looking,

107
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,220
wise and Chinese peasant faces from the cutting room floor.

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,960
But that's all over with now, friends,

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,420
and it's hour of slack number 47 just before the pledge drive.

110
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,720
Yes, next time you hear from us, we'll be screaming for money.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,700
And, friends, you better be ready to give.

112
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,680
Be ready to give.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,520
Shoot, give to the Soul Oldies show coming up next,

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
and then give to the next show after that.

115
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,840
Give and give and give.

116
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
K-N-O-N will be so glad to take and take and take

117
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,460
and to once again deliver the goods to you for another few months.

118
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,640
Ah, yes, dear friends.

119
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,200
Praise God.

120
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, so this is, once again,

121
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,280
not the...

122
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,620
the promised and long-awaited subgenius anti-drug hour of slack.

123
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,900
I just couldn't get it together to do a theme show tonight.

124
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,140
I had to indulge my own slack here, friends.

125
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,900
So instead, we're going to reach out and try to save us some souls

126
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,000
the best way we know how on a moment's notice.

127
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,140
We'll have the subgenius weird news coming up pretty soon.

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
So, praise God.

129
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,560
This is the

130
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,080
tattoos

131
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,700
bag

132
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,240
band

133
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,600
on

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,880
the

135
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:31,900
stage

136
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,920
and

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:31,960
this mainly

138
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,200
for

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,240
music.

140
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:53,000
I found myself a friend, someone I could believe in until the very end. I found myself the devil, he was sitting in a bar. He bought me 15 rum and cokes and then he went too far. Now the devil is my friend, the devil is my friend. Wherever I go, the devil will go, the devil is my friend.

141
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:28,680
And now at Easter, I'm feeling mighty low. That dirty rotten devil, he said he had to go. Dirty stinking devil, I'll shoot him with my gun. He made me mad, the devil spied, the devil is a bum.

142
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,220
But the devil is my friend, the devil is my friend.

143
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Wherever I go, the devil will go, the devil is my friend.

144
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,620
And Godzilla is my friend, Godzilla is my friend.

145
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,520
Wherever I go, Godzilla, Godzilla is my friend.

146
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,540
And Shidenko was my friend, and Brezhnev was my friend.

147
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,380
And Andrew Bobby just popped up, now Gorbachev is my friend.

148
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,260
Frank Sinatra is my friend, Frank Sinatra is my friend.

149
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,220
Wherever I go, Sinatra goes, Frankie is my friend.

150
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,180
And blood and rockets are my friend.

151
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Blood and rockets are my friend.

152
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,100
And Stingy, and Kevin, and everyone around the bend.

153
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,060
And the queen is my friend, and R.E.D. is my friend.

154
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,420
And Idi Amin, you know what I mean?

155
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,400
Was someone who meant to be a party hand.

156
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,960
The devil is my friend, the devil is my friend.

157
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,040
Wherever I go, the devil will go, the devil is my friend.

158
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
Stay tuned.

159
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,760
Subgenii.

160
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,220
But nothing too intense with a lot of responsibility.

161
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,100
The Cootie.

162
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,220
The Cootie.

163
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,980
The Cootie.

164
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,220
The Cootie.

165
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,860
The Cootie.

166
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,980
The Cootie.

167
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,520
The Cootie.

168
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,460
The Cootie.

169
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,920
The Cootie.

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,960
The Cootie.

171
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,180
The Cootie.

172
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,740

Yeah, the world is a bloody mess.

So what else is new?

181
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,380
Texas Park, so what else is new?

182
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,220
Texas Park, so what else is new?

183
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,040
Texas Park, so what else is new?

184
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,100
Texas Park, so what else is new?

185
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,540
You said that you loved, but it happened together.

186
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,380
You said that you loved, but it happened together.

187
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,280
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction.

188
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,420
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction.

189
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,680
But I say you're wrong, we're just on the dawn of correction.

190
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,400
Yes, callers, you're all wrong.

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,040
We need a sludge, not slag.

192
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,300
Well, there's going to be sludge on this earth.

193
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,360
In a high abundance for anybody who needs it.

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,540
Sorry, some of that slag is there to help you.

195
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,180
Is there a loss of quiet parts on this show?

196
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,280
Sometimes for good reason.

197
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,140
You will be able to pummel like a pummel ball between these huge messages hidden inside the quiet parts on this show.

198
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
This is the key.

199
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,000
If you can reach 7 a.m.

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,380
With what?

201
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,380


202
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,960
With this show.

203
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,140
Then you will know that you are already in the night.

204
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,420
Yes, but for most people it's just too late for this planet.

205
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,640
Are we puzzling, Evan?

206
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,140
No, no, no.

207
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,080
This is just a tape.

208
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,920
Yes, we Pink Boys were sitting around here looking at your radio show.

209
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,800
Or the week between.

210
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,260
Well, we're really quite concerned.

211
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,080
The fact that you realize that Pink Boys are the first step.

212
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
They're not actors.

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,080
Hmm.

214
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,660
Well, how do you think?

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,940
I'm not sure I want to take it.

216
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,440
You think it could be a late subject?

217
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,900
I think I will be putting up a long show for Mr.

218
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,040
Doocy Morey.

219
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,840
Oh, rain.

220
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,500
It would have to будем a bit.

221
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,420
You know why you need such a few miniorgt.

222
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,000
Airwire.

223
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,340
Anh.

224
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,280
Two I guess.

225
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,460
You better.

226
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:40,460


227
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,440
Well, Jean, Sun and so on and so forth, they make the question.

228
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh, really?

229
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
That was the voice of.

230
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,980
All I have to do is sell.

231
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,460
Also.

232
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,500
soul. And we will give you that chapter.

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,600
Do I have a soul?

234
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm not sure if I do.

235
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,940
Most people have two of them.

236
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,680
And most people, they're inactive.

237
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,040
The doctors can't activate

238
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,940
those souls.

239
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,180
Yes, Dr. C.

240
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,300
Has this been hurt so much

241
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,820
you just can't see?

242
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,560
I had a friend that had 666 souls.

243
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,740
Oh, yes. Imagine that.

244
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,420
I'm trying to fit all those together

245
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,680
into one single brain.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,140
All right.

247
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

248
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,300
this song introduces a new

249
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,720
genre in country and western

250
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,300
music.

251
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,580
Gospel.

252
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
It's gospel music

253
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,760
for people who know they're going to hell anyway.

254
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,540
It's a little thing called

255
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,880
Legs of Fire.

256
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,580
This is Doctors for Bob.

257
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,700
Okay.

258
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,860
Well, I

259
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,720
thought I could get

260
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,220
away

261
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,740
with sauna

262
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,860
on our wedding

263
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,900
day.

264
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,040
Preach to me and said,

265
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,840
boy, better put away your song.

266
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,700
But I said, I don't

267
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,720
cotton to no God's county

268
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,840
law. But that song

269
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,040
was stolen. At least that's

270
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,520
what they said. So I

271
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,880
wrapped up in asbestos from my

272
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,440
waist up to my head.

273
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I wrapped up in asbestos

274
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,680
that I got from

275
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Greg's. I only wish

276
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,500
I had enough to cover

277
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,400
up my legs. So I've been

278
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,300
sinning, sinning, sinning, but

279
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,120
I ain't no liar.

280
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm burning, burning, burning

281
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,740
my legs, my legs, my legs of fire.

282
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,500
Oh, my

283
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,140
head's dry and cool.

284
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,360
So's my arms and tool.

285
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,760
My torso,

286
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,940
even more so.

287
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,700
But I ain't no liar.

288
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,460
Now I'm burning, burning,

289
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,640
burning my legs, my legs, my legs

290
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,320
of fire.

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,460
Well, I was selling hair,

292
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,880
when at the elementary

293
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
school, preacher man

294
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
said, boy, you know that

295
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
isn't cool. The good

296
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,400
Lord come to me, said

297
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,780
my time was up.

298
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,320
When I asked why God, he

299
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,340
said, because that horse was cut.

300
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,200
They were shooting up in the

301
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,220
bathroom. Yes, you know

302
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,180
it's true. But they

303
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,980
were not getting off until

304
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,180
my soul was through. Oh, I've been

305
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,380
sinning, sinning, sinning, but I

306
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,340
ain't no liar. Now,

307
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,300
I'm burning, burning, burning, got

308
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,440
legs, got legs, got legs of fire.

309
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,140
Oh, my

310
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,300
brain ain't in no flame, and

311
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,080
my shoulder ain't in pain.

312
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,680
But my toes

313
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,380
need a hose.

314
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,060
But I ain't no liar.

315
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,300
Now I'm burning, burning, burning,

316
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,320
got legs, got legs, got legs of

317
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,720
fire.

318
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,040
Well, I was stealing cars

319
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,280
for God to try to get in well.

320
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,200
But when my judgment

321
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,280
came, he said, you'll have to go

322
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,140
to hell. It's true,

323
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,920
I gave my son, he said,

324
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,600
to pay for all your sins.

325
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,020
But when you fought me that limo

326
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,140
chain, or the door was dented in.

327
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning,

328
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,020
sinning, but I ain't no

329
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,940
liar. Now I'm burning,

330
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,040
burning, burning, got legs, got legs,

331
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
got legs of fire.

332
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,980
Oh, my head ain't on

333
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,020
the line, and my arm is

334
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,300
doing fine. But my knees

335
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,120
are crying, please.

336
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,100
But I ain't

337
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,120
no liar. Now I'm burning,

338
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
burning, burning, got legs, got legs,

339
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,500
got legs of fire.

340
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,960
Well, I was

341
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,060
bashing Grandma's head with

342
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,260
a railroad tie.

343
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,740
The good Lord come to me

344
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,740
and said, why did you lie?

345
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,180
When I said, why did I

346
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,760
lie? He said, you must

347
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
confess that ain't your Grandma's

348
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,940
head at all. It's just a

349
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,300
bloody mess. Oh, I've been sinning,

350
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
sinning, sinning, but I

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,520
ain't no liar.

352
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,900
Now I'm burning, burning, burning,

353
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,020
got legs, got legs, got legs of

354
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,420
fire.

355
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,720
Well, dear friends,

356
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,940
well, that's my cue

357
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,920
to junk that one out.

358
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,900
And, well, let's do

359
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,840
some of this, this, uh,

360
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm gonna, this is

361
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,960
something I've been wanting to do on the show for a long

362
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,780
time, and that's read the

363
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,060
Fortean News.

364
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,280
Folks,

365
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,960
get a little background here.

366
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,780
Ah.

367
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Listen

368
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,900
to that slack.

369
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
No, that's not slack.

370
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,300
But, you know,

371
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,880
when you can't get real slack, false slack

372
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,100
is better than nothing, right?

373
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,120
Uh,

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,340
friends, this station's

375
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,080
been running on.

376
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,060
False slack. For a while, you're gonna have to give them

377
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,080
some of that real green slack out of

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,300
your pocket. Dig me?

379
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,820
Baby? When time comes,

380
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,060
cause, cause you owe it. We're gonna have

381
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,480
to do a show about guilt.

382
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,960
That's what our pledge drive show should be.

383
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,340
It should be the guilt show.

384
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,780
It's the way the other churches

385
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,880
do it. Anyway,

386
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,960
dear friends, this is,

387
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,880
this is, these are all news, uh,

388
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,860
items from the Fortean Times, the

389
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,400
Journal of Strange Phenomena,

390
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,620
done by a group of latent

391
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,000
and,

392
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,860
and, uh,

393
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,760
declared subgeni in England.

394
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,800
London, England. The first one here

395
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,340
actually is from the Dallas Morning News.

396
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,000
$50,000 in coins

397
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,820
kills guard. Yes, this

398
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,600
was a guy who guards money,

399
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,980
friends. Riding in the back

400
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,620
of an armored truck was

401
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,220
killed by a load of

402
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,720
$50,000 in quarters

403
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,000
that crushed him when he slammed on the brakes

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,780
to avoid a swerving car.

405
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,580
So, uh,

406
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,480
100 boxes of quarters weigh in

407
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,380
and 2,000 pounds toppled onto this

408
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,080
poor guy, Rand

409
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,480
Arachelian. He was, what a way to

410
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
go, friends, killed by

411
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,260
that which he thought might give him

412
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,300
freedom, and which I could use

413
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,860
some of myself. Here's another one.

414
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,440
The luck runs out for the human lightning

415
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,260
rod. Now, you folks remember Roy

416
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,980
Cleveland Sullivan, I'm sure,

417
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
the retired forest ranger of

418
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,780
Waynesboro, Virginia,

419
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,500
who's listed in the Guinness Book of World

420
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,780
Records, uh,

421
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,060
because he survived

422
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,560
being struck by lightning

423
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,880
seven times.

424
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,080
And in 1983, at the age

425
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,060
of 71, he succeeded by his own

426
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,140
hand where Jupiter's bolts had failed.

427
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,880
He shot himself and was

428
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,900
finally earth-grounded, folks.

429
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,780
And during

430
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,260
his 36 years, he got to be a celebrity

431
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,080
for his, uh, affinity for

432
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,980
this, the mighty electrical fluid.

433
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,100
In 1942, he lost

434
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,960
a big toenail to lightning, and in

435
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,060
1969, his eyebrows were

436
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,820
blown off. His left

437
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,780
shoulder was seared in 1970,

438
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,100
and his hair set on fire in 1972,

439
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,060
after which he always carried

440
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,800
a few gallons of water in a can

441
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,020
in his car. The amazing thing about this

442
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,060
guy was that he once remarked

443
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,480
that he could see the lightning

444
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,060
traveling towards him.

445
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,140
Whew!

446
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,400
So watch out there.

447
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,080
Uh, oh, yes,

448
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,940
and the Ministry of Agriculture

449
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,980
official in England warned

450
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,000
of a new breed of super rat,

451
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,960
which is spreading across Hampshire,

452
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,100
about three miles a year. It is immune

453
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,780
to conventional poisons

454
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,140
and breeds fast. One pair

455
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,200
of these mutant rats can produce

456
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
200 young a year.

457
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,040
So, now,

458
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,460
friends, Bob predicted all of this,

459
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,140
all this stuff. Every one of these

460
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,900
things was predicted by Bob. Look to

461
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,040
Dateline for dominance. Look

462
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,140
to the prescriptures, friends, if you're

463
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,440
doubters, if you're gonna be doubters.

464
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
All right, let's see

465
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,940
what else we have here.

466
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,460
Brains!

467
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,460
Who needs them? A scenario

468
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,480
for Eraserhead 2 was played out

469
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,340
in Columbus, Ohio, when Dale

470
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,560
Elder, 22, walked into the police

471
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,160
station where Officer

472
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,360
Dan Canada was manning

473
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,120
the information

474
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,420
desk. In response to Canada's

475
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,820
query, Elder said, yeah,

476
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,460
I need an x-ray. I want to make

477
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,420
sure I have a brain.

478
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,300
They took me

479
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
brain, quote unquote.

480
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Then Elder reached

481
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,960
up to his forehead and began

482
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,400
tugging at a thin wire protruding

483
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,140
from it. Blood started

484
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,080
to trickle down his forehead,

485
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,400
Canada said. At first, I thought

486
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,180
he was pulling his hair. Then I

487
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,200
realized it was a wire, and I yelled,

488
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,220
hey, Sergeant. Elder had pulled about

489
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,400
three inches of wire out

490
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,280
of his skull before the officers

491
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,480
handcuffed him. They took him to the hospital

492
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,320
where doctors removed the remainder

493
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,380
of the wire. Elder said he

494
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,340
had drilled a hole in his

495
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,120
head and slid the wire

496
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,860
inside to check.

497
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,040
If he had a brain, he

498
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,860
felt no pain throughout the adventure,

499
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,040
friends. Now, some of you

500
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
amateur subgeniuses out there

501
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,780
keep trying to open your third eye

502
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,020
or your third nostril with

503
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
this trepanation techniques

504
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,200
with a power drill.

505
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,020
Those of you who do that,

506
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,320
I believe, have probably lost your marbles

507
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,980
before you ever picked up that drill.

508
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
In the central Philippines,

509
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,180
a 15-year-old boy of the Mangyang tribe,

510
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,920
about 100 miles,

511
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,520
South Manila, was swallowed whole

512
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,360
by a python he disturbed

513
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,920
while searching a cave.

514
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,760
Other tribes managed to

515
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,680
kill the snake and cut it open, but the

516
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,840
boy was dead when found.

517
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,820
That calls for a different piece of music,

518
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,340
friends, I'm afraid. Let me

519
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,920
dig about.

520
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,580
This ought to be suitably

521
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,020
mysterious.

522
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,380
Oh!

523
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,700
Yeah.

524
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,960
Just fine. We can plunge down.

525
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,960
Further into the depths of horror.

526
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,000
Here.

527
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,720
Oh!

528
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,900
The new monkey girl.

529
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,160
A new wild girl,

530
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,300
about eight years old,

531
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,160
was discovered in Sierra Leone,

532
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,700
Leone, and her name has been given the name

533
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,460
Baby Hospital.

534
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,040
Doctors say she's more animal than human,

535
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,780
seemingly brought up by apes or monkeys.

536
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,340
Now, obviously, friends, this is,

537
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,160
you see these humanistic,

538
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,380
normal scientists,

539
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,560
they can't recognize a yeti.

540
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,040
They prefer not to believe.

541
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,900
They believe that some humans

542
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,640
may be descended from the

543
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,320
so-called abominable

544
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,400
snowman.

545
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,020
Um, her hands and arms

546
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
are remarkably strong.

547
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,120
She walks on all fours.

548
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,320
She eats from her food bowl

549
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,260
with her head down instead of using her hand.

550
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,980
And this is the part that

551
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,640
proves that she's one of us, friends.

552
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,780
She has resisted attempts to

553
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,080
quote, civilize her, unquote,

554
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,960
and spends most of her time

555
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
crying and looking lonely.

556
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,060


557
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,520
longingly towards the jungle.

558
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,840
And related to that,

559
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,140
here's some news from our friends in China.

560
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,500
Um,

561
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,720
they're so convinced,

562
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,560
the Chinese scientists are so convinced

563
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,140
of the existence of ape-like wild men

564
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,620
in the Xinongjia region

565
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,020
of Hubei Province

566
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,920
that a portion of a national park

567
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,560
has been designated a special reserve

568
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
for these Bigfoot creatures.

569
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,560
And they have done

570
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,220
tons of expeditions out there,

571
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,560
and evidence indicated the creature

572
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,920
which seems active in 13 of China's

573
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,100
29 provinces, when fully grown,

574
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,580
is more than 8 feet tall

575
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,280
and weighs about 550 pounds.

576
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,800
And those of you who've done your homework

577
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,060
would know that these creatures

578
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,760
also smell terrible.

579
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
There's also stories in here about,

580
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,720
this is, once again, this is the Fortean Times.

581
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,160
You can write,

582
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,820
I don't want to give their address over the air

583
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,480
because it's really long, but you can write

584
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,640
for information from the Church of the Subgenius

585
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,920
and we'll tell you their, um,

586
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,240
their address.

587
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,640
It's a magazine you can subscribe to.

588
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,840
It comes out quite a bit. There's an incident in here

589
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,260
about a 15-year-old boy in England

590
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,380
who drove a car

591
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,800
seven miles in his sleep.

592
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,400
Um,

593
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,400
plague hamsters, which have gotten loose,

594
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,140
they were injected with a virus

595
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,180
and were missing for two weeks

596
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,360
from a New Haven, Connecticut.

597
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,820
Uh, yeah, this was a virus

598
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,560
which affects the human nervous system

599
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,720
with invariably fatal results.

600
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,740
And yet these guys,

601
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,660
these scientists said there is no cause

602
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,800
for alarm. So,

603
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,680
uh, you know, how these creatures

604
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,560
teleported out of the laboratory

605
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
is another thing entirely, but

606
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,140
well, we'll get back to the tapes here.

607
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
There's amazing stories in here

608
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,920
about all the awful things that people do

609
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,980
to each other. Well, here's a religious one.

610
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,100
This is the last one I'll read.

611
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,080
The 62-year-old Pentecostal preacher

612
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,840
was about to baptize a boy in front of a congregation

613
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,620
in Stockholm.

614
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,580
Pentecostal baptism is by total

615
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,540
immersion, friends, and Swedish

616
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,580
priests are electrically heated.

617
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,220
The preacher, standing in water up to his waist,

618
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,340
was handed a microphone

619
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,680
and was electrocuted.

620
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,040
Friends, that's why, that's why we don't

621
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,120
do full immersion in the subgenius

622
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,920
church. We do pill

623
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,040
immersion. Let's hear from

624
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,120
Sister Chris with the subgenius

625
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,720
show in, uh,

626
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,320
in East Orange, New Jersey.

627
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,340
Doomsday.

628
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:20,940
Doomsday.

629
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,660
Doomsday.

630
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,980
Doomsday. UFOs and the

631
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,640
Space Brothers want you to

632
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
survive. UFOs and the

633
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,900
Space Brothers want you to

634
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,420
survive.

635
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,740
Doomsday.

636
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,800
One night,

637
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,760
he was awakened by the hum of a high

638
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,540
voltage electrical transformer.

639
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,980
It sounded as though it was right in

640
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
his room. He got up

641
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,900
to investigate, searching out the

642
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,740
noise. He found a neon sign

643
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,460
in his fridge, flashing the words,

644
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,700
Oral Gratification, in vivid

645
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,020
pink letters. Something turned

646
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,820
green behind him. He spun

647
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,880
and saw another sign had splintered out of

648
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,780
his wall. Suddenly, neon

649
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,940
signs began popping up everywhere

650
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
he looked. He didn't know what

651
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,040
to do, so he went back to bed.

652
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,220
The humming of all the transformers

653
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,120
kept him awake, not to mention

654
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
the bright flashing light.

655
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,000
Sometime later, a fuse blew, and

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,540
he gratefully fell asleep.

657
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,160
Doomsday.

658
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,080
Doomsday.

659
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,080


660
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,420
The UFOs and the Space Brothers

661
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,200
want you to survive.

662
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,440
Doomsday.

663
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,680
Bianca was afraid to leave the

664
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,920
apartment without the cool uniform

665
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,920
of distinction worn by

666
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,060
all the other mutants.

667
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,040
A heavy gauge polyurethane

668
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,620
wetsuit-like trousers

669
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,780
required the body to ship

670
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,220
like a sack of potatoes.

671
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,720
Burlap and fiberglass

672
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,260
form the tunic.

673
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100
It's an alien problem.

674
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:24,540
It's an alien problem.

675
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,460
Oh, I've never seen one.

676
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,080
You know, the visits from aliens

677
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,860
need not be a painful item.

678
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,580
It can be quite an exciting time.

679
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,700
I don't personally have any

680
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,900
desire to have any...

681
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
It's like meeting Bob. I don't want to do it.

682
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,780
I just need to...

683
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,520
He'll be coming up also.

684
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,840
Oh. He's checking her for her

685
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,340
foot gland. Oh my, I can't watch this.

686
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,960
Punch up five for me, please. Thanks. Yeah, thanks. My video is...

687
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,980
a little bit strange. We're going to go right now

688
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,100
to another song by Glass Madness here on Live Tape

689
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,140
in the studio.

690
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,100
.

691
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,100


692
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,840
.

693
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,040
.

694
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,240
Whatcha gonna sing about

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,860
at five o'clock in the

696
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,380
morning?

697
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,020
Yee-haw!

698
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,940
Talking about Bob Dobbs in the

699
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,960
church, everything in a whole big mess on the

700
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,700
floor. Just like

701
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,040
a disorganized first church, a disorganized mess on the floor.

702
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,820
.

703
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,480
.

704
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,140
.

705
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,480
.

706
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:31,560
.

707
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:31,640
.

708
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,640


709
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,700
.

710
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:31,740
.

711
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,120
.

712
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
.

713
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,940
.

714
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,420
.

715
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,000
.

716
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,740
across the page at this very moment as you try to read your radio is inevitably and subatomically

717
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,680
decreed your brain is working without your machinations of a cosmic puppeteer who works

your string so skillfully you never knew they were there until now feels good doesn't it oh it feels

719
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,720
so very good when i've got the strings pulled tight but we can show you where the strings are

720
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,440
attached and how to sync up with the puppeteer well they say life after death reincarnality

721
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,600
psychic powers immortality invisibility nirvana communications with higher challenges slack

722
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,020
slack slack so long it only takes a few seconds to stare at the fabulous mystic diagram on the

723
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,800
back of the book of the subgenius but once you copy like palmer readings you will be transformed

724
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,520
into another world yes jehovah one has yet two other books that are coming up and two heads

00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,020
not yet do do that you know for the next show or next week on the hour of slack we're going to need

738
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,960
it friends we're going to in order to prove that anybody listens we're going to need your uh

739
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,140
support you're not just visible but uh you know palpable support in the form of ounces worth of

740
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:54,560
dollar bills maybe even pounds of them uh now uh speaking of callers there we boy i just got a

741
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,700
i wish i could put calls on the air but we we can't do that until we get like a seven second

742
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,960
delay because the reason for that is we can't trust subgenius callers to speak uh in in under

743
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,340
conspiracy restraints they just won't you know leave those those those taboo danger

744
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,620
words you know they so we can't do calls but i got one a minute ago that i really would there

745
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:26,960
two a minute ago i would have loved to put on one was from a an artificial intelligence and the other

746
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:34,160
which which was probably a lot more so than the than the natural organic one that also called

747
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,460
which was with the question what are you guys trying to do like what i said well we're trying

748
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,720
this is the church of the subgenius everybody knows that we're trying to uh to save or

749
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,180
destroy our lives and we're trying to uh to save or destroy our lives and we're trying to

750
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,180


751
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,220
the minds or souls and or souls of the of the listeners and and uh i mean he says trying to

752
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:58,560
save or destroy save minds i said save or destroy so uh he said well aren't you trying don't you

753
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:08,440
want people to listen i said well some people you know not you necessarily and and and uh so i don't

754
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:15,630
i guess i guess some of this music just and the sound effects see they they can't see they just

755
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:23,430
yeah they just aren't they can't drive down central expressway and listen with their windows

756
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:31,270
open and their air conditioner off and feel that grit from the highway and that noise and and

757
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:36,730
considerate music they just don't consider so i don't know i don't know i guess you know it takes

758
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,170
all kinds certainly

759
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:38,390
you

760
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,970
takes all kind where would we be without the normals dear friends where would we subgeni be

761
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:49,210
without the normals i mean we'd probably be a lot better off admittedly but you know who would do

762
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:56,510
all that stuff that normals i mean it would be a world of chaos it would be slack but at the same

763
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:02,410
time it would be a it'd be almost like too much you know but as bob said too much is always better

764
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,010
than not enough and that reminds me of the too much that you need to i mean you think

765
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,770
30 bucks next week when when we do the pledge drive is going to be too much but friends

766
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:22,510
i think you know at 30 bucks that'll help it'll help it might you know we i don't know

767
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,590
this is the rain makers

768
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:34,410
i always play something commercial one commercial song this is a song about the before life

769
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:37,610
friends this by the rain makers it's a

770
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,370
set you can buy at the store and it's about the afterlife or the before life as we call it

771
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,670
which will be followed up by

772
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,510
well me and mark twain were having us a ball telling each other lies

773
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,390
looking down from the bull with a bottle and a worm and a

774
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,990
clear

775
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,490
oh we were fishing for secrets where the catfish crawl the mississippi river

776
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:20,610
going downstream we can go for mexico somewhere downstream meet the atlantic ocean somewhere

777
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,850
downstream going to meet you in the water somewhere downstream

778
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,770
so

779
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,930
well we picked a pair of truvans floating down from independence we said what about the war he said

780
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:50,090
couldn't win so he said what about the bomb are you sorry that you did it he said pass me that bottle

781
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:56,410
and mind your own business and the mississippi river flowing downstream meet the gulf of mexico

782
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:04,610
somewhere downstream meet the atlantic ocean somewhere downstream going to meet you in the water somewhere downstream

783
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:05,910
downstream

784
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,070
We were out of St. Louis

785
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,930
And heading for the coast

786
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,530
When we picked up Chuck Berry

787
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,110
In a little rowboat

788
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,930
With one oar in the water

789
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,490
And one in the air

790
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,670
A lightning rod for a white guitar

791
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,490
And life is struck once

792
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,110
And life is struck twice

793
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,850
And I said if there's a God

794
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,490
He sure ain't nice

795
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,810
Chuck said God is an Indian giver

796
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,430
I don't trust nothing

797
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,050
But the Mississippi River

798
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,690
And the Mississippi River

799
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,030
Flowing downstream

800
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,770
We could go to Mexico

801
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,330
Somewhere downstream

802
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,430
We could go to Mexico

803
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,590
Somewhere downstream

804
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,670
Gonna meet you in the water

805
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,890
Somewhere downstream

806
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,910
The Mississippi River

807
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,250
Flowing downstream

808
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,030
Meet the Gulf of Mexico

809
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,570
Somewhere downstream

810
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,550
Meet the Atlantic Ocean

811
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,850
Somewhere downstream

812
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,870
Gonna meet you in the water

813
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,210
Somewhere downstream

814
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,110
In short I'm a bobby

815
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:44,330
With you the cultivator

816
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,250
I'm gonna meet you in the water

817
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,290
I'm gonna meet you at the sunset

818
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,550
On the other side of the river

819
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,690
And rockin' like I'm in Mexico

820
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,490
It's a wonderful summer

821
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:56,490


822
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:56,610
deal with some rain

823
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:56,610


824
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,870
Tryin' to past you

825
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,170
Never expected nothing

826
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,150
Take it with a flash

827
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,170
To the investment

828
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,270
Of my life

829
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,410
Selta's gonna find you

830
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:06,410


831
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:06,410


832
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:29,090
We've surfed the Mississippi several hundred times.

833
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:35,450
One time I got on the back of this boat behind the barge and surfed all the way down to New Orleans.

834
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,030
Really?

835
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:39,110
Yeah.

836
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:50,230
Well, I don't want to get too far away from the subject, friends.

837
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:56,170
Once again, if you just tuned in, we have with us in the studio here on the Hour of Slack,

838
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,830
KNON 90.9 in Dallas.

839
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,850
Texas, FM.

840
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:08,030
As our guest, the fantabulous swinging love corpses, dear friends.

841
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:13,210
This is also known in some incarnations as the Cubs.

842
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:21,550
Here in the studio live, dear friends, Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Sphinx Drummond,

843
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:29,050
the two of the three guiding tools of WOTEX.

844
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:33,290
Dr. Sphinx is a great man who keeps this incredible band.

845
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:40,430
And I know that you can't believe that we've got the swinging love corpses here on KNON, on this station.

846
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,770
I want you to know that none of the other stations could get these guys.

847
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,950
They couldn't get past the agent secretary, friends.

848
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:57,430
But the swinging love corpses are here because they're doing it for Bob.

849
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:57,930
That's right.

850
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,070
They're taking time out from the show.

851
00:42:59,070 --> 00:42:59,070


852
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,030
And they're busy schedule.

853
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,510
This Dr. Drummond, I...

854
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,770
Reverend Stang.

855
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,390
Philo.

856
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,530
Glad to be here.

857
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,170
If you don't mind if I call you that.

858
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,130
Yeah, welcome to Dallas.

859
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:20,290
Boy, your show last night at the Coliseum in Fort Worth, it was kick, man.

860
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:22,270
It was crack.

861
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,690
It was a lot like crack.

862
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,290
I was jacked up and stoked out on my fun thing.

863
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,950
I couldn't believe that.

864
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,130
I was just looking at the audience participation, the way they threw all that money on the stage.

865
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,730
I was digging on those keyboard riffs on Good Board, Bad Ride.

866
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,250
Or Bad Board, Good Ride.

867
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:39,850
I'm sorry.

868
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,330
For a minute there, I was like...

869
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:42,830
I don't know.

870
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,550
I mean, that's the one that went platinum for you guys, right?

871
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,490
There was just so much.

872
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,570
Yeah, that was our...

873
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,450
That and Poop Dog Hat.

874
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,610
Yeah, second platinum.

875
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,230
State of Emergency.

876
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,810
I thought Poop Dog Hat had gone platinum.

877
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,890
That's the new...

878
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,330
That will go platinum.

879
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:56,970
It's...

880
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,830
All right, that's right.

881
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,990
You guys have a new album.

882
00:43:58,990 --> 00:43:59,850
That's right, friends.

883
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,330
And you're going to hear it here on KNON first.

884
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,110
The Swingin' Love Corpses' new album.

885
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,890
And is that Le Petit Main's Disciples?

886
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,530
Right, Le Petit Main's Disciples.

887
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,210
Le Petit Main was one of our mentors.

888
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,570
He was a famous French artist.

889
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,890
And what was his canvas?

890
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,590
What was the canvas of the great Le Petit Main?

891
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:27,450
Well, actually, Le Petit Main could manipulate a certain...

892
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,510
area of his body in such a way as to produce sounds.

893
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,330
He could play five notes with his body.

894
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,230
And this was not...

895
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,130
The flesh horn?

896
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:37,950
The gas pipes?

897
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,610
It was more like the gas pipes, I would think.

898
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,850
Pyroflatulations for you subgeniuses out there.

899
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,910
Can be musical.

900
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,650
And Le Petit Main was the...

901
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,150
You can read about him in any great history book.

902
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,610
Le Petit Main had his own place near the Malin Rouge there.

903
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,610
In Paris.

904
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,790
And he used to play music with a little horn through his...

905
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:03,030
From his...

906
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,070
Neither Lung.

907
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,130
Neither Lung, right.

908
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,390
And he was able to...

909
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:15,350
He could blow candles out from a foot away.

910
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,630
Yeah, he'd blow candles out from a foot away.

911
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,750
He could expel water up to 12 feet.

912
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,770
And so thus, you're...

913
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:23,930
He could suck water and expel...

914
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,450
And I understand that in your show last night,

915
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,530
you made the attempt to do that,

916
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,530
but then the Fort Worth police at the last minute

917
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,930
had heard about you doing that in Miami.

918
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,970
I understand there was some trouble in Miami.

919
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,350
The fans went nuts.

920
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,310
Well, they didn't understand it.

921
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,670
Everyone else wanted to try to do it.

922
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,170
I mean, they thought it was something new.

923
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,170
They didn't realize that Le Petit Main had pioneered this, you know,

924
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,470
over a century ago.

925
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,670
That's right.

926
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,010
And, well, that's the conspiracy, friends.

927
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,190
So the new album, Le Petit Main's Disciples,

928
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,590
and I've never...

929
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:00,570
Notice you've got, like all 1,000 Doctor albums,

930
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:01,790
it's a double album.

931
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,210
It's got just the songs here.

932
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,050
Let me run through these.

933
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,890
Just Another Doctor Song,

934
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,510
Something's Wrong,

935
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,450
Little Jazz Poot,

936
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,090
Drizzlin' on the Hershey Highway.

937
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:20,490
That must be one of your free AIDS songs.

938
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:21,290
Right, right.

939
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,850
Yeah, human interest.

940
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,570
Right.

941
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,270
We were trying to make a statement there

942
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,950
in regard to some of the plight of some of the poor,

943
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,110
misguided individuals in this country right now.

944
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:40,510
I've noticed that this band seems to be one of the more caring bands.

945
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:45,530
I understand that you played in the MeAid Festival.

946
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,430
Right, we were in the...

947
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,690
With all the other Doctor bands.

948
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,810
Right, it was right after Us International,

949
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:56,250
and we managed to hitchhike down to the MeAids International Festival,

950
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:56,690
and we were part of the MeAid Festival.

951
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,390
And became one of the Me.

952
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,950
Right, we were one of the official Me generation.

953
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,650
We actually signed the papers to indoctrinate and incorporate the Me generation.

954
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,130
That's beautiful.

955
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:14,310
That is such a meaningful statement, and I'm sure it helped.

956
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:18,550
So many of the starving bands, and yeah.

957
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,890
Yeah.

958
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:22,770
I know Doctors for Bob did really well there.

959
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,250
Doctors for Bob didn't raise quite as much money.

960
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:26,250


961
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:30,470
as they would have been expected by a band of their caliber.

962
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,090
But...

963
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,690
Now, is this professional jealousy here, Dr. Drummond?

964
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,670
That I detect?

965
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,190
I understand Doctors for Bob...

966
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,830
We only know the bottom line, you know.

967
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:49,370
The Doctors for Bob hit, Told the Judge, went platinum at the same time as Poop Dog Hat is going to, right?

968
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,550
Right, well Told the Judge, that was before the lyrics were released to the public.

969
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,250
And after that it was actually banned.

970
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,170
And of course that caused the sales to go up considerably.

971
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:06,290
I understand that Swinging Love Corpses is now banned in several American cities.

972
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,290
Washington D.C., at the riots.

973
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,370
Well, ever since our...

974
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,670
When you opened for James Brown.

975
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:17,510
Actually, since we, on our Lepidomanes Disciples Tour, we've been banned in several locations.

976
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,130
It has something to do with our stage show.

977
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:26,250
But in the past we've met with really good reception by local artists.

978
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:26,690
And we've had a lot of good audiences.

979
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:33,950
They always have to buy a whole lot of extra fire insurance whenever we play on this tour.

980
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,130
Yeah, because of the Bobbies out there.

981
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:37,050
The Pyroflatulation.

982
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,710
The Pyroflatulation, right.

983
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:43,190
Well, I hope you fans out there are listening, you know.

984
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,490
There's, I mean, concerts are like life.

985
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,490
That's right.

986
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,490
Don't act like cattle at a roundup.

987
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,350
When we were...

988
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,050
The Pyroflatulation is something to do in your church.

989
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:55,430
Your, you know.

990
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,130
Your place of worship or your own home.

991
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,470
When we were on our...

992
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,430
Your recording studio.

993
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:02,790
When a bunch of old ladies get together after a garden club meeting.

994
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,370
Well, friends, praise Bob.

995
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,430
That was, that's an excerpt from the Swinging Love Corpses interview.

996
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:13,730
And, well, I think it would take them forever to get into the next song.

997
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,170
So here's the next song, Swinging Love Corpses.

998
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,450
They're here.

999
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,030
Thanks, Dr. Drummond.

1000
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,950
This is a song called...

1001
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,190
Well, let's just call it a bummer.

1002
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,110
I had to censor the chorus.

1003
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,770
Let's just call it a bummer.

1004
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,070
This is a bummer.

1005
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:03,290
Two hundred thousand people killed in an industrial accident in India.

1006
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,470
It's a bummer.

1007
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,890
Oh, bummer.

1008
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,810
Hurricane killed 25 in Florida.

1009
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,210
It's a bummer.

1010
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,010
A real damn bummer.

1011
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,170
Oh, bummer.

1012
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:30,730
Oh, bummer.

1013
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:30,730


1014
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:30,730


1015
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,890
I took that man to the office first.

1016
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,450
It was a bummer.

1017
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,990
He is the enemy, bummer.

1018
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,730
It's a bummer.

1019
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:46,110
Oh, bummer.

1020
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:52,570
One hundred and fifty thousand people killed in an earthquake in Mexico City.

1021
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,110
And he tells the people that he's a North American child

1022
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,150
Bummer

1023
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:34,030
There was a guy in California that couldn't get a snout one night

1024
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,530
Bummer

1025
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:36,950
Bummer

1026
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:37,950
Real

1027
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:40,990
Bummer

1028
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,930
I burned my finger the other day

1029
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,370
Bummer

1030
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,170
Bummer

1031
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,670
Bummer

1032
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,550
I had to tear my band-aid off

1033
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,750
Bummer

1034
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,530
Real bummer

1035
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,170
Bummer

1036
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,010
Trillion dollar deficit

1037
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,470
Bummer

1038
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,770
Sort of a bummer

1039
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,010
I don't believe a thing

1040
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,450
I ran

1041
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,790
I ran as the hundreds involved

1042
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,170
Bummer

1043
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,790
My insurance rates just went up

1044
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,610
Bummer

1045
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:38,310
I had to tear my band-aid off

1046
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,930
I cut myself shaving

1047
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,830
Bummer

1048
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:43,470
Bummer

1049
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:45,110
Bummer

1050
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:45,170
Bummer

1051
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,310
Bummer

1052
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:53,510
All 12 million people die

1053
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,070
in an earthquake

1054
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,030
in Southeast Asia

1055
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,450
Bummer

1056
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:02,490
Bummer

1057
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,370
Bummer

1058
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,590
End of an era

1059
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,810
Dinosaurs are killed

1060
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,090
Bummer

1061
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,510
Bummer

1062
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,470
Bummer

1063
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,110
Bummer

1064
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1065
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1066
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1067
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1068
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1069
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,110


1070
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:34,010
And friends, thanks to the Swinging Love Corpses there for that.

1071
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,770
That was there.

1072
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,790
You all remember that hit from 1967.

1073
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,230
Bummer.

1074
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,730
Actually, that's a new version of that song.

1075
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,290
I redid it just last year, and you can hardly tell.

1076
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,130
It's almost exactly like the one before.

1077
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,470
Now, friends, you know, I was going to play a tape here,

1078
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:59,630
but I got to get on and rant because I got to thinking about this hate Bob caller.

1079
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,050
This guy calls up, and he doesn't like Bob.

1080
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,550
And that's fine because we like the hate Bob callers.

1081
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,030
But that's all.

1082
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:09,790
Friends, the reason I like them is because they make me hate so much.

1083
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,570
We can hate them because we've got Bob and they don't.

1084
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,310
You know, them, they.

1085
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:16,810
The.

1086
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,670
Others.

1087
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:23,370
And, you know, when they say things like, well, who are you trying to.

1088
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,950
I mean, like, you expect people to.

1089
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:29,350
Are you trying to get people to listen to this?

1090
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:35,030
I mean, you mean you're doing this in Dallas, Texas, and they haven't killed you yet?

1091
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:43,950
Well, you know, when I turn on KON, I don't always expect to hear something I might like.

1092
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,670
I expect to hear stuff that.

1093
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:55,350
You know, that's not for the mainstream normals, you know, like when I turn on Saturday mornings,

1094
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,490
I'll turn on the radio and hear the Vietnamese news show.

1095
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,010
That's all in Vietnamese, and I'm not going to listen to it.

1096
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,370
Mainly because I don't speak Vietnamese.

1097
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:08,190
But that doesn't mean I hate the show.

1098
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:13,830
That doesn't mean I think, God, what are they doing that Vietnamese show for?

1099
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,430
What do they don't mean?

1100
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,790
Don't they?

1101
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:17,750
They want people to listen?

1102
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,310
Why are they talking in Vietnamese?

1103
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,270
I mean, friends, we're talking in subgenius jargon, and it's fast.

1104
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,030
I mean, it goes by quick.

1105
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:33,250
This is a show that we encourage people to tape and listen to on headphones because you can't assimilate the word of Bob easily.

1106
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:35,530
It's not like a TV show.

1107
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,130
It's not like the love boat.

1108
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:44,330
You know, and it's also not like the other religious shows you get to listen to.

1109
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,990
Now, people may.

1110
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:51,490
You know, I figured usually the reason somebody doesn't like the hour of slack is because of religious reasons.

1111
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:57,190
They just won't admit it because they're a little embarrassed, you know, to speak up for their own religion.

1112
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,390
And because they also because they're offended for religious reasons.

1113
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:11,030
And, well, I'm real sorry, but some of those other religious programs offend the living daylights out of me.

1114
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,870
And I don't call them up and say, get off the air.

1115
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,970
I'm tired of hearing.

1116
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:23,630
I'm tired of hearing about how we're supposed to send money so we can be saved by your new Cadillac, Reverend Falldown.

1117
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:34,470
And, you know, it'd like to make me drop a geyser, don't you see?

1118
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:37,390
Because these kids out there.

1119
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:44,730
Well, anyway, friends, those of you who are listening for the first time to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack, this is what it is.

1120
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:45,970
This is for the church.

1121
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:47,590
Church of the subgenius members.

1122
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,630
And those of you who are believers in Bob who may not have actually signed up.

1123
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,270
But I can tell you where to write for information.

1124
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,610
I can't tell you much else besides where to write.

1125
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:05,270
But just ask for the free info pack from Bob, dear friends.

1126
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:09,530
And get those pencils and pens ready because I'm going to give that mighty, mighty number.

1127
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:15,130
That's Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1128
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,650
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1129
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,550
I'm going to give that number again.

1130
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:26,090
And send those prayer requests, friends, to our mighty guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1131
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,170
I'm sorry.

1132
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,950
He never gets to speak on the air because he's supposedly been assassinated.

1133
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,510
And he's supposedly dead for the last two years.

1134
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,110
But I don't believe it.

1135
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,850
Oh, I've got to let the next DJ in, friends.

1136
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:37,950
So it's time to listen to a little bit of the here.

1137
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:45,490
This announcement from the record contains important information for radio.

1138
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,670
Program directors and is not for broadcast.

1139
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,670
Home users of this record may disregard this announcement.

1140
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:59,690
The following cut has been cross-format focused for airplay.

1141
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:08,130
As you well know, a record must break on radio in order to actually provide a living for the artists involved.

1142
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:14,770
Up until now, you've had to make these record-breaking decisions on your own.

1143
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,770
Relying only on the perplexing intangibilities of taste and intuition.

1144
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,430
But now, there's a better way.

1145
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:30,150
The cut that follows is the product of newly developed compositional techniques

1146
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:34,190
based on state-of-the-art market analysis technology.

1147
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:40,150
This cut has been analytically designed to break on radio.

1148
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,570
And it will, sooner or later.

1149
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,790
For the station that breaks it first, the benefits are obvious.

1150
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:56,370
And no matter what share of the market you do business in, no other release is going

1151
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:01,330
to be quite so suitable for your corporation's current idea of good radio.

1152
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:07,610
On this cut, we're working together on the same wavelength.

1153
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:10,170
In scientific harmony.

1154
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,470
But remember, this cut is constructed for multi-purpose.

1155
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1156
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470

00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1158
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1159
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1160
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1161
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1162
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1163
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1164
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1165
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:15,470


1166
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,210
We're working together to create a future where all the market-breaking can be done.

1167
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,490
And we're working together to create a future where all the market-breaking can be done.

1168
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:25,470
We've done the hard work of ensuring your success.

1169
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,650
The final step is up to you.

1170
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:36,210
Special designer song follows in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1171
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:45,390
Special designer song follows in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:58,490

Just a minute!

1191
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,970
Just a minute!

1192
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:23,350
Just a minute!

1193
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,690
I can't hear a thing!

1194
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:42,190
Quiet, please!

1195
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,050
Quiet, please!

1196
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,870
Is there any escape from noise?

1197
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:59,650
Oh, there's so much noise!

1198
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,690
I can't hear the music!

1199
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:04,910
Is there any escape from noise?

1200
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,070
What orchestra is this?

1201
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:07,710
No!

1202
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:24,330
Is there any escape from noise?

1203
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,030
No!

1204
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,550
Is there any escape from noise?

1205
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,150
No!

1206
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,150


1207
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,710
No!

1208
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:34,430
Ah, dear friends, this is K-N-O-N 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

1209
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:42,690
And what you're listening to in the background there is Negative Land off of the new, that's an unreleased album, folks.

1210
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:43,630
You can't buy it.

1211
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,010
Hope you had your tape decks running.

1212
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,250
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1213
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,370
Oh, but keep your eye out for Negative Land, they're great.

1214
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,650
Well, Ron Lindsey's here with Soul Oldies.

1215
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:54,290
Friends, you're gonna have some more...

1216
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:54,890
Oh, what?

1217
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,070
Maybe the slack doesn't end with the hour of slack.

1218
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:01,070
Maybe there's more slack to be had yet.

1219
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,390
Hey, there's slack everywhere.

1220
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,250
Yes, that's true, friends.

1221
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:04,670
Praise God.

1222
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:08,230
Slack is where you find it, and, uh...

1223
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:09,430
Oh, let's see.

1224
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:13,190
I guess it's about my time to get out of here.

1225
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,790
Let Ron take over.

1226
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,430
Help me, somebody.

1227
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,290
That's what all the villagers said.

1228
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:22,330
And then they said, it's Bob!

1229
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:30,890
And then they all started to say, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

1230
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:36,070
And then they started to sing to him like this.

1231
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,170
Oh, Master Bob!

1232
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:43,670
Oh, Master Bob!

1233
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,630
You are the hero of us!

1234
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:51,130
Oh, Master Bob!

1235
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,330
Master Bob!

1236
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,890
Oh, oh, Master Bob!

1237
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:02,270
Master Bob!

1238
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,650
Master Bob!

1239
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,470
Master Bob!

1240
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,870
Master Bob!

1241
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:12,430
Master Bob!

1242
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,370
I'm watching,
