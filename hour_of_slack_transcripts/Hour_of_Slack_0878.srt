1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
The following broadcast is a subgenius production.

2
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:57,480
This is a subgenius production.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
The answer.

4
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,460
Yes, it's a new day.

5
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,460
It's a new day in Riyadh.

6
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,400
It's a new day in Baghdad.

7
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,260
The sun is rising over the desert.

8
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,960
It's a new day and the sun rays are shining red, white, and blue.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,960
All over the world.

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,340
There's swirling sands below Basra.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
A jackal howls.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,620
Oh, wait a minute. He's on his way to the mall.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,140
Soon the entire planet will be covered in drop cloth and duct tape.

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,160
Yes.

15
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,580
All will be safe.

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,000
We will tape up every board, every window.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,240
What about?

18
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,280
That is about shaving yourself for five hours until you suffocate to death.

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,980
That's John Ashcroft's idea of a subgenius production.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Silly joke.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,820
They're making jokes now, Chaz.

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
Guys, that's what's going on today.

23
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,180
Really?

24
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,880
They're tickling our funny boners.

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,180
They're trying to get us to split our, you know, our corpus callosum.

26
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,580
Duct tape.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,240
And there's a big split between our brain hemispheres.

28
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,160
I'm glad to hear that.

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,100
They want to fight.

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,680
Duct tape and cellophane wrap.

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,600
Because they were...

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,160
Well, in some places, there's some clubs in New York City where you have to pay extra for that treatment.

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,260
To have your corpus callosum split?

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,180
To have your hemispheres?

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,440
No, the duct tape and saran wrap treatment.

36
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,920
Well, usually it results in a hemispheric split.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,980
If it's a joke...

38
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,000
Man, look at all the Valentine's stuff.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,200
They actually managed to scare me that maybe they weren't just playing good cop, bad cop, and it was only bad cops.

40
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,180
I think what they're playing is retarded cop, sleeping cop.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,700
And you're sitting in a cell by yourself going,

42
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,700
Get me out of here!

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,900
You!

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,280
And then the crazy cops come in and he goes,

45
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,380
And the whole time you're stuck in the same cell with lonesome cowboy Dave.

46
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,980
Or Mr.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Guillotine.

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:00,820
Yeah.

49
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,020
Or Chuckie Chicken Cheese.

50
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,400
Or one of those other strange people that appear.

51
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,080
Or Duke the Trucker.

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,320
Well, he's been outlawed.

53
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,060
He's been banned.

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,020
Along with a bunch of other malcontents that are wiping up the airwaves with their hot sauce and sweat.

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,880
I think it's the media's behind all of it.

56
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,920
I think that whole thing was a hoax.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,780
I think that the Twin Towers falling down...

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,460
They're still there.

59
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,200
That was a hoax.

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,920
They are still there.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,500
It was all a hoax.

62
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
It's an optical illusion.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,180
It was an optical illusion actually.

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Caused by a...

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,960
What's the name of the really, really good Vegas magician?

66
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,040


67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,160
The guy that made the Grand Canyon disappear?

68
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,100
Not Karnak.

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,720
What's...

70
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,120
Carbuncle?

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,600
Merlin.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,260
Merlin.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,860
No, no, no.

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,720
This is like a real...

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,620
This is like a Vegas guy.

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,100
He's got like...

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,220
He's got a twin sister or something that wears a bikini and, you know, like twirls the scimitars.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,620
No, that's the other guy.

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,540
No, that's the other guy.

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,480
The other magician.

81
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,800
The disappear with the disappear.

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,820
Well, anyway, it's supposed to be a big success, but I don't think anybody's even aware of what's going on.

83
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,020
Who?

84
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,720
Osama was?

85
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,640
No.

86
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
He was one of the bootleg...

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Have you guys got the new bootleg terrorist type?

88
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,220
No, but I've got tapes.

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,500
My legs taped together.

90
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,460
I've got 20 different translations for it.

91
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,180
Here they come.

92
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,580
Comes on our first airborne.

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,680
And only if we were all Native Americans too.

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,720
We'd not only win the war, but we'd also win back...

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,600
The country which was taken from us so many years ago.

96
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,820
White eyes, you will now return what is ours.

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,480
You with your forked tongues and your fig-shaped feet and your funny little goat ears.

98
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,240
Go back to Europe where you came from.

99
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060
And have a nice day.

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,760
And here come the baton twirlers that headed their first 101st airborne.

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,140
The Screaming Eagle Templates, as they're called.

102
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,040
Look at those dresses.

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,700
That's absolutely crazy.

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,300
What they could do with those flaming batons.

105
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,760
And look at what if we're actually juggling a flamethrower.

106
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,760
And her teeth exposed to the wind.

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,140
And the sand.

108
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,340
And the dust.

109
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,800
And the eternal heat.

110
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,880
What do those smoke signals say over there, Lieutenant?

111
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,220
They say you better not talk about the Commander-in-Chief or you're going to do three to life for talking nasty.

112
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,400
Have you heard that?

113
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,920
The recent?

114
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,500
What did you say?

115
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,060
Two things that are too silly.

116
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,780
That aren't, you know, that are on the edge of funny and nasty about President Hex.

117
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,320
You could be put in jail for three years like a person in North Dakota was for saying that.

118
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,120
Now, I'm disclaiming myself from saying this.

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,760
Some guy said...

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,240
They get down on our music, man.

121
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,700
They say, hey, man, turn that down.

122
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,460
But did they ever listen to the words?

123
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,940
Yeah, really.

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
Did they ever listen to the words, man?

125
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,320
When you climb into that Subaru vacuum cleaner at five miles an hour, think who it ain't.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,580
Me.

127
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,920
You're no Senator's son.

128
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,540
There's no silver spoon stuck in your colostomy bag.

129
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,020
You're free as the wind, but only as far as those stretched-out clothes will take you because you're a po-boy.

130
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,540
A po-po-po-boy.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,220
So, what are them poor guys, eh?

132
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,960
Line up for sandwiches, children.

133
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,920
We're going to take care of your knees and your elbows and your...

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,380
The braces on your...

135
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,380


136
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Your head.

137
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,480
And also the wounds that you've incurred over your...

138
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,880
Things are getting a little bit paranoid around my wounds.

139
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,240
I've heard about a website that was closed down by cyber attacks.

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,200
It was specialized in war protest-type news.

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,720
Oh, so they were hacked.

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,240
Well, they were more like flooded by some bot with so much stuff that basically they were knocked off the air by...

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,900
It must have been a Justice Department bot.

144
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,700
They got the bots.

145
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah.

146
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,640
You know, it could be anybody.

147
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,480
But, like, I was...

148
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,960
I saw this hilarious little cut-up of a State of the Union speech on the Internet.

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,580
I thought, well, I'm going to download this down from that and use it on our Slack.

150
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,020
Princess Wee said, don't.

151
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,620
Don't do it.

152
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,880
Don't download it.

153
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,340
It's not funny enough.

154
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,020
There's code in it.

155
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,280
No, I'm afraid they'll come and get you.

156
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,400
They're watching you through the screen.

157
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,100
They know.

158
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,380
Now, that's not illegal.

159
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,120
Group of complaints.

160
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Finally, this is a group of social criminals.

161
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,380
These big...

162
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
People in the space program.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Nassholes, I call them.

164
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:43,400
In case you haven't heard, the latest disaster for the rest of the universe is that the United States is going to go to Mars.

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Okay?

166
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,980
Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,600
There's a bigger disaster that happened.

168
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,720
We lost seven great American heroes.

169
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:57,360
We're about to lose seven million great American heroes entitled to most of Seattle.

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,280
Seattle.

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,500
Seattle.

172
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,960
Oh, you guys are worried about those North Korean nuclear weapons hitting the West Coast, right?

173
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
You're not worried about Kim Jong-un?

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,740
Everybody on the East Coast is paranoid about germ bombs and dirty bombs being set off in their harbors.

175
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,260
The nation is hacked neatly in half like a filleted steak waiting to be grilled.

176
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,480
On the Pacific Rim, they're giving them the Korean Rim job.

177
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,540
And, of course, on the Eastern Seaboard, they're ready to board the planes with Iraqi dissidentals.

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,380
And other dissidentals.

179
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:29,640
And other dissidentals.

180
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,560
I know.

181
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,060
Well, it does make me more eager to say, newcomer!

182
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,680
You know, just because.

183
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,880
Well.

184
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,060
I mean, it works that way.

185
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,200
I think a lot of people in your position, you know, as a standing, necrobiotic, comic, paraplegic.

186
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,680
As someone too old to be drafted.

187
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,280
Too young to be escorted from the building.

188
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Not living in Los Angeles or New York or Washington, D.C.

189
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,260
Not literally languid enough to be free-festered.

190
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,380
You have to wait for the biopsy.

191
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,920
You have to wait for the biosphere to increase.

192
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,680
And you're going to start expanding.

193
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Actually, you know, their joke did start scaring me.

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,840
The other night when the Northern came in, the wind was whistling and howling outside.

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,980
We don't call it a Northern.

196
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,220
Like a crazy, well, Blue Northern.

197
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,260
That's what you guys call it.

198
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,480
Yeah, right.

199
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,280
Well, it was scary.

200
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,380
And I was laying in bed hearing that wind and thinking about the duct tape.

201
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,540
And my kid in L.A. and my other kid in Dallas.

202
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,240
Without enough duct tape.

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,880
Cleveland.

204
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,040
Cleveland.

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,240
Nobody.

206
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,160
This would be an embarrassing place.

207
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,580
You would attack.

208
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes, it would.

209
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,020
It would.

210
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
It's an embarrassing place to be attacked in.

211
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,940
You're pretty safe here in Cleveland.

212
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,000
I would think so.

213
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Way down low on the list.

214
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,040
Destroy the booming steel industry or something.

215
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,340
Right.

216
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,640
And the old BPO.

217
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,120
They moved.

218
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,780
That would have been a target.

219
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,120
Yeah, because they're just cranking out tanks down there in the flats.

220
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,480
Tanks upon M1 tanks are rolling out of the flats by the dozen.

221
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,780
Is that what that smell is?

222
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,580
Every day.

223
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,140
Yeah.

224
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,860
Steel industry is so vital here.

225
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,220
We're making a patch.

226
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,780
We're making a patch.

227
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,540
Blackhawks.

228
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,080
This is the place to be if you want to blow up another country.

229
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,520
I mean, if you want to get into the blowing up business.

230
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:07,600
If you can take over Cleveland.

231
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,500
With impunity.

232
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,040
If you can.

233
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,560
Yeah, that's.

234
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,680
It's like in the 50s, like the music industry.

235
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,020
If you can, you know, you're successful in Cleveland.

236
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,800
Yeah, today it's.

237
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,540
If you can take over Cleveland, you've got it.

238
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,040
You've got the whole country.

239
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,660
Well, now.

240
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,320
Just got to get Cleveland.

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,460
Couldn't a bunch of, like, ice soldiers just stomp across the lake?

242
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,320
Blue ice soldiers?

243
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,380
They don't have those anymore.

244
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,980
Canadians.

245
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,540
Everyone freezes up.

246
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,420
Well, they are.

247
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,160
They are socialists.

248
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,860
And as a consequence of being socialists, they are quite crisp or, you know, tensile.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,540
You know, like a frozen thing.

250
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,520
Like Frosty the Snowman.

251
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,140
Yeah, you see them skittering across the lake like so many Canadian soldiers.

252
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,620
Yeah.

253
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:45,960
Yeah.

254
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,900
Yeah.

255
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
藍洛

256
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,860
Obi-Wan.

257
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:03,860


258
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:03,860


259
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:03,860


260
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,580
Um.

261
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,320
Bowl.

262
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,980
A.

263
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:07,980


264
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:07,980


265
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,480
Thank you.

266
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,660
Thank you.

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,500
Thank you.

268
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,540
Thank you.

269
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,320
Thank you.

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,420
Thank you.

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,460
Thank you.

272
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,380
Thank you.

273
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,660
Thank you.

274
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,500
That's all for now.

275
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,860
That's all we know.

276
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,280
This is the end.

277
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,760
A place for us

278
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,500
Somewhere

279
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,940
A place for us

280
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,680
Hold my hand

281
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,560
And I'll take you there

282
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,400
Hold my hand

283
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,360
And we'll have

284
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,440
We'll have

285
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,340
Somewhere

286
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,660
There's a place for us

287
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,880
Somewhere

288
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,960
Somewhere

289
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,180
There is a time for us

290
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,100
Somewhere

291
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,240
Somewhere

292
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,320
Hold my hand

293
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,380
And I'll take you there

294
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,960
Sit down

295
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
Ooh

296
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Ah

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,940
Ooh

298
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,800
Ah

299
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Ooh

300
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,380
Ah

301
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,080
Ooh

302
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
Ah

303
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
sworn to life

304
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,140


305
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,140


306
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,140


307
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,160
and and

308
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,160

Affordable

315
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,380
You change

316
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,340
Thank you.

317
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Thank you.

318

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

322
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,280
Thank you.

323
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
Thank you.

324
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,940
Thank you.

325
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,780
Thank you.

326
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,800
Thank you.

327
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,220
Thank you.

328
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,720
Thank you.

329
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,960
Thank you.

330
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,760
Thank you.

331
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,740
Thank you.

332
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
Thank you.

333
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,260
Thank you.

334
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,340
Now I'm back to change your mind

335
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,120
Now I'm moving right in time

336
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,680
In a world that's turned on time

337
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,740
I see what's going on behind my back

338
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,180
I'm a people boy

339
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm a people boy

340
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,060
I'm a disco dancer

341
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,740
And I keep dancing on and on

342
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm a people boy

343
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,740
I'm a people boy

344
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,620
Oh no

345
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm a disco dancer, baby

346
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:52,740
But I think that something's wrong

347
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,880
I'm a people boy

348
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,620
I'm a people boy

349
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,420
Oh no

350
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Oh no

351
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,360
Oh no

352
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,800
Oh no

353
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
I've been sleeping twenty years or more

354
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,440
I remember that time ago

355
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,400
Now I'm back to change your mind

356
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Now I'm moving right in time

357
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,800
In a world that's turned on time

358
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,780
I see what's going on behind my back

359
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,740
I see what's going on behind my back

360
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,540
I'm a people boy

361
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,600
I'm a people boy

362
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,480
I'm a people boy

363
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,200
I'm a people boy

364
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm a people boy

365
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,040
I'm a people boy

366
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
Oh yeah

367
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,560
Somewhere with Deebo

368
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,640
Dear friends

369
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,740
Ah, loved soldiers

370
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,600
Oh no

371
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,740
We're so wrongfully outnumbered

372
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:29,360
Ah, we would like to wrongfully remind you of the legendary snacks being produced in your mind right now as the Fluffing Box is being sold to the United States.

373
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,360


374
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,440
The

375
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,660
boats includes

376
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,760
Do most of the events on Cotton College must include sources and their reports on the

377
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,800
sounds.

378
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,340
The

379
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,000
Amy films amazing

380
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,000


381
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,940
I see you

382
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,340
Please know that the

383
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,360
called the

384
00:29:59,340 --> 00:29:59,940
What a laugh.

385
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,040
That was the last time they took a peaceful breath of air for six years.

386
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,540
The Pentagon and a bunch of other quack-o-whack-o of the Hordegard clique

387
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,460
decided they were going to go the full distance.

388
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,140
Yeah, that's right.

389
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
Snowshoes and onions for the whole pack.

390
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,080
And we're not talking about Cub Scouts.

391
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,720
We're talking about maulers, murderers, midgets, people without eyes.

392
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,920
We're talking about the scum of humanity.

393
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,360
Humanity.

394
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,120
Yeah.

395
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,700
The fighting.

396
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,320
That's who we're looking for, kids.

397
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,320
So line up and join up today.

398
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,160
The Church of the Subgenius is looking for...

399
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,220
Mental soldiers.

400
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,760
I want to be a soldier. I'm wax.

401
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,120
I'm not a real man.

402
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,600
Be what you want.

403
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,080
Be all that you can be

404
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,660
and much, much more

405
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,900
that you will never be.

406
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,480
You can be what you want with...

407
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,060
Because it's a church of love.

408
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,740
These are love soldiers, baby.

409
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,660
The soldiers have...

410
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,700
They got their guns and holsters

411
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,440
all oiled up

412
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,140
and ready.

413
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,900
Ready for the sacred fight.

414
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,000
That holy battle.

415
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,300
It's just a kiss away, baby.

416
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,900
It's just a kiss away.

417
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,260
Just a kiss away.

418
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
And I'd like to explain to you now

419
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,540
how the Patriot Act,

420
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,060
or not the Patriot Act, I'm sorry,

421
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,240
the Homeland Security Act,

422
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,600
it works in its full efficacy.

423
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,600
To understand well,

424
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,900
first take the scotch tape

425
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,280
right here in your hands.

426
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,380
Place the top of the scotch tape tube

427
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,480
right below your nostrils.

428
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,500
Pull the scotch tape down over your mouth.

429
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,200
Now, you're not leaving out the plastic wrap

430
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,720
that goes over your mouth.

431
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,000
No, no.

432
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,700
That part out of there.

433
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,340
And then after you've taped over your mouth...

434
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,740
You're going to express yourself freely.

435
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,860
To prevent expression

436
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,840
and poisonous mass weapons of destruction.

437
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,120
Also thought crimes.

438
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,280
Then get your duct tape and your drop cloth

439
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,160
and cover the nose orifice

440
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,800
to protect your lungs.

441
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,700
And if you'll cover up your nose and mouth,

442
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,280
eyes and ears completely,

443
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,360
then you can save

444
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,380
a lot of money on drops

445
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,780
that don't have to do your windows or doors.

446
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,920
You won't think this is so funny

447
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,720
when that botchoo toxin,

448
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,680
plague, smallpox,

449
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,160
radiation germ comes

450
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,080
wafting in down your chimney.

451
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,280
You didn't board up your chimney, did you?

452
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,040
No, you forgot.

453
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,300
You took the boards out

454
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,060
because you thought Sandy Claus was coming.

455
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,480
Well, Sandy Claus might be coming, all right.

456
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,040
He might be coming with something

457
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,140
like you don't want.

458
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,020
He might be coming with something worse

459
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,080
than a bucket full of coals and switches, my friend.

460
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Sandy Claus.

461
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,300
He's coming with the promise of heaven.

462
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,940
He knows the combination of your locker, baby.

463
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,200
I'd like to remind all of the quality people

464
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,380
with the steps you need to get, um, you know, uh...

465
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm sorry.

466
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,680
He's a mean banjo picker, too.

467
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,520
Just listen to him.

468
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,920
Make sure his socks are neatly strapped

469
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,480
to the inseam of the butler's front.

470
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,340
Wow.

471
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,080
Make sure the socks are high enough

472
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,880
to ward off any sort of toxic elements.

473
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
Make sure the bio-tox...

474
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,040
Thank you.

475
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,340
Put your head between your knees

476
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,840
and kiss your knees goodbye.

477
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,100
You said that politically correctly, my friend.

478
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,700
They used to say that to us in fourth grade.

479
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,100
Yes.

480
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,220
During the, um, duck and cover.

481
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,020
As the way to protect yourself

482
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,800
from, uh, nuclear blasts.

483
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,560
That was the way we'd worship.

484
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,100
You're gonna die!

485
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,040
You're gonna die in the hot, cold war, babies.

486
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,620
So put your head between your knees

487
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,820
and kiss your little tokers goodbye.

488
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,560
Because you're going to heaven.

489
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,340
You're gonna see Jesus.

490
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,860
When those communist mamas...

491
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,840
That's when you're gonna see Jesus.

492
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,100
Of course, I was raised in Fort Worth, so...

493
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,460
They may not do that in the public schools here.

494
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:22,960
I don't know.

495
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,400
Mind you, Stan, I...

496
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,340
I was raised in Fort Worth in the 90s.

497
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,020
I was raised in the 50s.

498
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,260
Well, that was at least...

499
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,060
A little different from the...

500
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,680
One of the implants you were born and raised in.

501
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,500
How is it different?

502
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,380
And that...

503
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,460
Well, I'm telling you,

504
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,560
you had a number of overlays, we call them,

505
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,920
in your psychic programming.

506
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,320
And so you think that one of them

507
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,880
had to do with what was the last town

508
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,140
you mentioned, El Paso Auto?

509
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,380
Uh, Hunchkiss.

510
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,160
Hunchkiss Valley?

511
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,400
Where did you say you attended grade school?

512
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,340
We all had to hide under our desks

513
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,100
and put newspapers in front of our eyes.

514
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Ah, no, but you were hiding under an assumed identity

515
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,360
while the other children were hiding under their desks

516
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,060
so neatly.

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,120
And so full of slack.

518
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,900
I was doing both.

519
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,920
I was good boy.

520
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,740
Well, you were as good as you could be

521
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,820
in considering the wavelength.

522
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,120
When I kissed my ass goodbye,

523
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,200
I Frenched it, baby.

524
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,420
Oh, and you were known for it?

525
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,220
Did I just say that?

526
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,200
Yeah, of course you said it.

527
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,040
And you meant it, too.

528
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,220
You, you...

529
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,420
I was just wishful thinking.

530
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,900
You know, I've seen dogs do that.

531
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,580
And you always, you go,

532
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,360
why would I wish I could do that?

533
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,660
Well, that's what they say about Turks.

534
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,140
You know, when the dog snaps and barks at you.

535
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,300
That dog knows it's going to become soup real soon.

536
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,600
Now, see, that music makes me want to go fight

537
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,800
or send somebody else to go fight in my place.

538
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,980
Some young, expendable, nice person.

539
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,280
Makes me want to play lacrosse.

540
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,900
Some sucker.

541
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,520
Some unicorn.

542
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,660
Tomatoes.

543
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,100
Dance.

544
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,060
Oh, man.

545
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,560
Go swimming for catfish.

546
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,820
Bite myself.

547
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,280
And cure the wrath of dobs.

548
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,100
Is this a segue into a more cerebral part of the,

549
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,280
uh...

550
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,680
thing?

551
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,980
Before this.

552
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,440
The song about, uh, necrophilia?

553
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,680
No, a secret necrophilia.

554
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
It's not overt.

555
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,220
It's real overt, Dave.

556
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,800
Yeah, yeah, it is kind of overt.

557
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,760
It's totally overt.

558
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,380
It's about...

559
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,280
Condemn arise.

560
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,100
Yeah, I mean, it's, it's...

561
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,300
I can almost smell it.

562
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,960
Yeah, there, you know, there are kosher distinctions

563
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,820
between putting your milk in your cheese

564
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,060
and your rotting fly shig in your same refrigerator.

565
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,240
It reminds me of an old poem I used to not say on this show.

566
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,860
You used to say it frequently.

567
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,800
It was an old lash from what, what was, where was it from?

568
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,520
I met an old gal in the grave here.

569
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,120
I met an old gal in the grave.

570
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,680
Yeah, but we won't go into that.

571
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,660
Al, let's just listen to Alice for a second.

572
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,480
I never even knew you're now rotting the face.

573
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,960
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave.

574
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,100
I have other uses for you, darling.

575
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,660
The company was piling on all kinds of defensive...

576
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,120
What do you think?

577
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,360
Well, I mean, um...

578
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,020
Nor of dungeons to ourselves.

579
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,020
I, I ask you, I mean, what do you think?

580
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,640
What do you think?

581
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,180
I mean...

582
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,980
Poison pills, gold disparages.

583
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,460
I ask you, I mean...

584
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,400
Who name it?

585
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,640
How do you, what do you, should we go in?

586
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,280
Should we go in?

587
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,560
Shh!

588
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,700
Let us have faith.

589
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,720
So...

590
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,180
That right makes might.

591
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,340
Saddam's much vaunted berms.

592
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,900
So, what?

593
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,180
Dang it, this thing doesn't work better than that.

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,680
And in that faith...

595
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,740
Saddam!

596
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,440
Let us to the end.

597
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:19,940
Fool!

598
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,560
Ah, they have to do our duty.

599
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,240
They're starting to get it.

600
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,500
They're starting to get it.

601
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:22,980
They're starting to get it.

602
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,140
They're starting to get it.

603
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,320
They're starting to get it.

604
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,640
I don't understand.

605
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,920
It's all I'm taking from you.

606
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,560
Get back here!

607
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,440
Yes, you're a kind of slanderer!

608
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,060
Saddam's court rapist.

609
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,380
Hey, shut up!

610
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,060
Fool!

611
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,320
I take care of all his raping.

612
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,860
Fool!

613
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,020
Fool!

614
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,420
Fool!

615
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,240
But, uh, make sure...

616
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:46,480
Dr. Drummond, don't tell me you believe that silly propaganda about Saddam Hussein's court rapist.

617
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,420
Yes, I am a court rapist.

618
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,300
Oh, you are?

619
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,120
Oh, well.

620
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,200
Well, tell us more about, uh...

621
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,300
Uh...

622
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,640
This handsome Mr. Saddam Hussein.

623
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,720
He's on the tips of everyone's tongues.

624
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,300
He's being talked about in the highest social circles these days.

625
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,380
Old Saddam.

626
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,240
I call him Saddam.

627
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,240
Was a mighty man.

628
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,600
A mighty butcher.

629
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,420
But he went crazy that one time.

630
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,760
Took too much acid.

631
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,420
Is that what it was?

632
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah.

633
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,980
Too much acid.

634
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,280
You know, too much acid has been the downfall of many saintly worlds.

635
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,680
World leaders.

636
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,980
And now he's just a crazy mockery of a man.

637
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,600
These obstacles only fueled my big dick passion to win.

638
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,800
I remember when that happened to Ford.

639
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,400
Yeah, that's true.

640
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,260
Pull it out of your...

641
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,780
When Ford started doing too much acid...

642
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,380
What was it, Gary?

643
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,900
I would own that company.

644
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,460
Where's Gary?

645
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,080
It seems like sooner or later every president ends up doing too much acid.

646
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,460
Why?

647
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,320
I don't know.

648
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,560
Why?

649
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,180
Because it feels good.

650
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,920
Because they like to.

651
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,920
Yeah, people like to get high.

652
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,300
So, watch.

653
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,840
Gary wishes he was high.

654
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,960
So, watch.

655
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,220
So, where's the caller?

656
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,020
And the stretch caller.

657
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,720
Where's the caller?

658
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,700
Hello, caller.

659
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,560
Is that you?

660
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,220
Does it work if I punch it over here?

661
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,460
I'm going to agree with you on the president taking action.

662
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,140
I mean, look at a code statement.

663
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,480
I always look doped out on something.

664
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,660
I always look doped out on something.

665
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,240
Jesus Christ.

666
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,040
What is he, chopped up on coke?

667
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,860
When I was asked whether we would accept bids in the 600 to 700 million range...

668
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,000
Is that Ronald Reagan?

669
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,040
Oh, God.

670
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,160
I answered...

671
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,760
Man, the guy had a screw loose there, man.

672
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,800
That's a price we wouldn't even begin to be interested in.

673
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,880
Oh, the caller seems to feel that our country is going downhill and the presidents behave

674
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,540
as if they're going downhill.

675
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,480
Oh, they look like them.

676
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:53,620
They look like them.

677
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,680
Oh, but they're like that.

678
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:02,560
Callers, what do you have to say about this truly original and startlingly original observation?

679
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,260
That's bad.

680
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,440
Good thinking.

681
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,080
Next.

682
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,320
That's bad.

683
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,480
The country going downhill.

684
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,460
Could this be?

685
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,040
I've never heard such a suggestion.

686
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,380
Your country is going downhill for 15 minutes at a time.

687
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh, but that's good.

688
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,440
That's good.

689
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,300
Well, actually, the country goes downhill for about 15 minutes and then it goes up for

690
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,960
a while.

691
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,760
It even kind of gets up and down, up and down.

692
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,720
Sometimes it goes uphill for a long time.

693
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,900
Then it goes rushing down, speeding, out of control.

694
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,360
And then sometimes it'll take a left turn right in the middle when you think it's going

695
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:34,840
to go straight.

696
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,800
It takes a crazy left turn.

697
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,340
Casey Jones at the wheel of our country.

698
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:39,600
Calls it a Louie.

699
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,520
Says hook a Louie.

700
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,600
Casey Jones, the fastest train racer of all time.

701
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,540
And he was...

702
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,940
Little people, long people think that he's driving.

703
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,160
He's driving.

704
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,240
He's at the helm of Spaceship America.

705
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,540
He's driving.

706
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


707
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


708
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


709
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


710
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


711
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,540


712
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:58,540
Casey Jones is taking us in orbit around the moon and back.

713
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,560
Who says this country's going to hell in a handbasket?

714
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,320
Hell.

715
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,080
We're going to the moon and back.

716
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,560
You're going to the moon, baby.

717
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,760
We're going to the free stop in Hooterville.

718
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,900
We're going to the free stop in Hooterville.

719
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,280
The moon, the future in Hooterville.

720
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,480
That's American's destination.

721
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,520
We need to learn old devil the words.

722
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:22,520


723
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,200
We'll finally get to go to college.

724
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,700
And that's the way it was with Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Philodrumm...

725
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:38,260
Don Joyce of Negative Land and that show, Over the Edge, which combined with the Puzzling

726
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:46,620
Evidence show and Michael Pepe, Bishop Joey, Gary Gabrogfran, and of course, as always,

727
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:52,500
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz Smith, Princess Wiardo, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan the

728
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,400
Lone Stang, all right now and back then.

729
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,440
Oil.

730
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,540
Covered in oil.

731
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,280
Lapping it up.

732
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,580
Got to get that Lincoln.

733
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,740
Man, that's pretty cool.

734
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,680
Lincoln now has a SUV.

735
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,120
It's really big.

736
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,440
I thought he was dead.

737
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,420
Didn't they shoot that guy at the Ford Theater?

738
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,480
No.

739
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,380
I'm still alive.

740
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,320
That's the closest he ever got to a car was...

741
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,880
Oh yeah, a Lincoln was a Ford, wasn't it?

742
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,400
Boy, it gets confusing, doesn't it?

743
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:30,800
I know.

744
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,100
It's pretty much the same as the way all the other...

745
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,680
They began the cloning experience...

746
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,940
I drive a booth myself.

747
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,300
They began the cloning experience back in 1957.

748
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,400
And one of the first things they did was they made a bunch of Lincoln clones.

749
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,800
Well, they also cloned Mussolini also.

750
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,460
And they also...

751
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,240
What's the guy who came up with the term?

752
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,480
I don't know.

753
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:52,880
I can't remember.

754
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:52,880


755
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:52,880


756
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:52,880


757
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:52,880


758
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:52,880


759
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:52,940


760
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,080
He was a youngster.

761
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,740
There was a warehouse full of Hitler's brains in South America.

762
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,760
Yeah, but they can't find the right cranial snap.

763
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,460
It's the plaster end, because they vary in size.

764
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,340
All they can say is, mock schnell, mock schnell, mock schnell, mock schnell, our bite-mocked

765
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,640
fries.

766
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,300
Ridiculous.

767
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,780
And how would he know if our bite-mocked fry?

768
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:10,660
You know what I mean?

769
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,940
As far as he knew, our bite-mocked French fries.

770
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,600
I mean, unfortunately, a lot of people were French fried because of that phrase.

771
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,800
But I don't think it was old Adolf Hitler's fault.

772
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:20,960
No.

773
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,440
But he was a good-hearted guy, basically, wasn't he?

774
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,540
Oh, he was an artist.

775
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,460
But he was a frustrated artist.

776
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,120
Well, you know, they can be pretty moody, can't they?

777
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,300
Hey, man, what happens when they don't make their million bucks before the age of 25?

778
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,160
When somebody wipes their derriere on your best of show?

779
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,180
He tried to sell his land.

780
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,740
I hate that Norwegian.

781
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,380
He was a perfectly good landscape painter.

782
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,440
He couldn't sell them.

783
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,480
But, you know, hey, anybody would get a little bit bent out of shape over something like

784
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:49,680
that.

785
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,940
He wants people to know that he's a good artist.

786
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


787
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


788
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


789
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


790
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


791
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


792
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:50,940


793
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,900
And穗 in the Ellyphon Tower stallions as it depuated by in Vienna.

794
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,420
It was a beautiful sight.

795
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,840
And everybody, everybody everywhere knew that someday he was going to go somewhere special.

796
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,580
Maybe Jamaica.

797
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,500
Reminds me of my good friend Papa Duvalier.

798
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,760
And Joey Ramone.

799
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,080
Oh, what a little boat they went out to the silver sea in.

800
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,840
In Haiti.

801
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,580
Haiti was a—Bob used to do a lot of business with the Haitians.

802
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,580
Yeah, he threw the looking gas.

803
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,540
They called old Bob.

804
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,920
You could get a lot of good fetus brain tic.

805
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,580
issue there. Now, that was a man.

806
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,880
No questions asked. None of this silly paperwork.

807
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,740
No, no. He had the layered

808
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,760
personalities. Whatever you want, that's the

809
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,660
one that's there. Bob the architect.

810
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,660
Bob the smoker of

811
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,540
royal herbs. Bob the

812
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,700
shoeshine salesman. Finally,

813
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,700
when Papa Bob was dethroned in Haiti,

814
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,800
we had to go to

815
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,580
China. But we still got

816
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,760
a lot of dolls. We still got a lot

817
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,700
of Bob Voodoo dolls with a lot of pins

818
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,220
to sell.

819
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,900
I mean, I thought we did.

820
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,060
I don't know. Maybe we didn't.

821
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:52,840
We sold out.

822
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,640
Bob Voodoo dolls were

823
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,600
very popular during the last war.

824
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,680
The war with Mars. You remember,

825
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,760
don't you? Yeah, and the other, that was the

826
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,300
layered personality, 52.

827
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,580
But I think we

828
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,900
fought Mars to a draw in that layer, didn't we?

829
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,760
Yeah, well, we're gonna go back.

830
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,140
We'll be back. We'll be back.

831
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,860
We'll show those rotten

832
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,480
sticking Martians control our nuclear

833
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,340
beer. We will be back.

834
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,880
All the Martians. We will be back.

835
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:19,880
We will be back.

836
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,400
We're getting our beer!

837
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,960
I don't want to do no beer!

838
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,400
We can't get to the

839
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,340
building, man.

840
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,860
Even the Jamaican Martians

841
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,360
must all be wiped out.

842
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,140
That is, we can find them on.

843
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,440
Well, you can't exactly kill them because they're not

844
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,720
exactly alive. But we need the oil,

845
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,540
too, for the robots to run the robot

846
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,340
soldiers. We need the Western oil.

847
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,520
We need the pubic hairs in the

848
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,340
arch. Our soldiers will

849
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,300
go all rusty.

850
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,560
We've got them not going to die.

851
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,640
We're not going to die.

852
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,180
We're all going to die.

853
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,820
May their swords never grow

854
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,040
the rust that lands

855
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,800
them here in Happlegate

856
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,460
Harbor, next to the

857
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,280
Mayboat Parade, as the flag

858
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,400
shines brightly.

859
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,600
A thousand, thousand

860
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,520
gallons of water have

861
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,560
churned by this magical spot

862
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,380
and still people come

863
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,660
to watch, to sing a song

864
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,280
and play the ukulele,

865
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,720
and to dream of those magic,

866
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,080
Days before they were transformed.

867
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,840
Ah, man, I'm not about ready to get up yet.

868
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,700
It's still freezing out there.

869
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,520
So cold.

870
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,920
I wait for the springtime.

871
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,880
I wait for March 25.

872
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,740
25.

873
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,260
That's the number on your shorts.

874
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,040
That's your cue card.

875
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,760
That's the number on your wrist.

876
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,340
That's your number in line.

877
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Very, uh, you must have been first in line for the camps.

878
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,520
Number 25.

879
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,140
I tattooed on my neck, too.

880
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,400
Look at this.

881
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,680
I have a little tiger underneath.

882
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,640
Can you see it?

883
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,800
We like punctuality in our camp inmates.

884
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,740
Well, you want some puncture marks?

885
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,200
If you look on the other side there.

886
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,880
Oh, that's very good.

887
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,880
I see you've been tortured.

888
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,320
Well, I did it myself.

889
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,220
Did that happen?

890
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,240
Did you do that here at this camp?

891
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,380
Or at the last camp you've had?

892
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,560
I've done it at every camp.

893
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,140
Yes, every camp I've been to, I have saved them the work.

894
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,060
Do the guards suck your blood from the back of the wounds?

895
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,900
No, they videotape.

896
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,900
They have some...

897
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,100
Of the prisoners, of course.

898
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,960
The other, your fellow.

899
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,400
Your fellows, of course.

900
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
Well, they're on the front row.

901
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,500
But the archdiocese keeps a very, very close watch

902
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,320
on what I do in between acts.

903
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,340
You know what I'm saying?

904
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,840
Well, they love to rip off subgenius show business ideas.

905
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,520
Oh, they love to rip everything off of it.

906
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,200
They do.

907
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,700
They whip their clothes off and they grovel in the oil

908
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,420
because they have filthy love and unpleasant love.

909
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,460
That's why they must...

910
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,580
Love for robot fluids.

911
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,360
Yes. They must be destroyed.

912
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,940
They come onto the battleground

913
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,760
when all the robots are laying around wounded

914
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,980
and bleeding their oil out and they bathe in the fluid,

915
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,920
these vicious religious fanatics, non-subgeniuses.

916
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,100
Someday their kind will be wiped out.

917
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:10,960
Yes, wiped out.

918
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,780
We'll run them all out.

919
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,940
That's right.

920
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,860
It will be the great grandmother of all battles.

921
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,040
And the festering uncle of all dupe shows.

922
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:28,080
Ready to appear on your screen at any time your brain is ready.

923
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,840
Notice how I tagged the front and the top

924
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,060
with the non-existent concept idea thing there.

925
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,500
That leaves scissor space. You can put in any concept.

926
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
So what are you saying? You're saying scissor space?

927
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,240
You're talking about, like, the excellent corpse thing?

928
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,160
No, no, that's just technical talk, radio talk for, you know, editing.

929
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,740
The sound later. So we can insert the other concept.

930
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,220
Oh, you're talking about the thought process.

931
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,300
I'm talking about the NSA labs in Langley

932
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,860
and what they're doing with this art project.

933
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,760
They're the cut and splice jobs on your memory.

934
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,520
No.

935
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,600
No, I thought it was yours.

936
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,620
No, it's your memory. I can't remember now.

937
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,100
It's your language pattern, too.

938
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,160
I'll take your word for it.

939
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,340
I'm afraid you're going to have to.

940
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,240
Well, that's what they said.

941
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,540
That's what a pitchfork in my butt says.

942
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,080
That's what you're saying.

943
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,920
That's what that cute little pair of sailor pants says.

944
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,760
I should have listened to the Baptist.

945
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,300
Yes, yes, you should have.

946
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,080
Where are the wooden shoes? Where are the wooden shoes?

947
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,820
Your hair's on fire, hombre.

948
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,080
Now, that's the mark of a true friend,

949
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,680
a man who'll tell you when your face or hair are on fire.

950
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,140
Well, at least when you're almost done.

951
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,120
You know, so many people in today's world won't even go to that much trouble.

952
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,120
Say, your hair or your face.

953
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:48,680
Your face or your face are on fire.

954
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,720
Are they going to go, hey, man, your face is on fire?

955
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,200
No way.

956
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,260
They just walk right by and pretend they don't see.

957
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,040
They think you know what you're doing.

958
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,500
They giggle at you, laugh at you.

959
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,140
And they let you go all the way with it.

960
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,800
Oh, look, that guy's face is on fire.

961
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Well, you must know what he's doing.

962
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,960
Free will, man.

963
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,200
You know, laissez faire and so forth.

964
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,760
Yeah, it's the new age, you know.

965
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,780
Maybe he's doing his own thing.

966
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,240
Here is the most incredible thing you have ever seen.

967
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
A man with an eye on fire.

968
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,460
A lid lodged in his hip socket.

969
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,200
And a woman who claims to be his friend.

970
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
They're not quite...

971
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,740
I'm sorry, did you want me to...

972
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:37,400
Well, the surrealist parade continues down Main Street.

973
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,900
There the Man Ray float is.

974
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,480
I think that's what that is.

975
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,880
It's kind of hard to tell what it is.

976
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,000
Oh, and here comes the hobby horse itself.

977
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,520
The da-da.

978
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,600
Oh, look, they've got a man riding the stang.

979
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,200
Isn't that cute?

980
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,500
Oh, that's Bill Clinton.

981
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,700
He's frisking the bull dada, yes.

982
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,900
Oh, yes, the running of the bull dada.

983
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,520
Here we go.

984
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,280
Notice the pikes, those special pikes.

985
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,520
Those are called frop sticks that the soldiers there use against the bull dada.

986
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,340
In Pamplona, we run the bull dada three times per day.

987
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,160
Before the orange fight and after the tomato fight.

988
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,480
And here is the leader of the pack, Mr. Hotfoot Tooth Whistle himself.

989
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:26,220
I wear my little red hat and my little white cotton shirt and my red pants.

990
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,080
And I take a lot of the drugs and I run, run, fleeing down the street

991
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:37,400
away from the Tyrannosauruses, which they release here at the running of the Tyrannosaurs in...

992
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,160
Papalona.

993
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,020
Pamplona Jurassic Park.

994
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,140
I notice you are running.

995
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:44,820
I'm wearing the...

996
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,640
The majestic Brontosaurus seen here with a different head.

997
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,460
It's being led by the clowns.

998
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,820
Look, the little clowns behind him.

999
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,220
Some of them are wearing butcher's aprons.

1000
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,180
Those trucks you clean up after.

1001
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,440
Carrying little cutaways.

1002
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,680
That's a lot of fine meat on the hoof.

1003
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,680
Although I don't believe those dinosaurs actually have hoofs.

1004
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,100
There's a lot of tension down on the street here.

1005
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,100
They'll be letting the carnivorous...

1006
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,440
Dinosaurs out, of course, at high noon, exactly.

1007
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,160
And then after the weigh-in, I guess we got the shoe ceremony for some of the behind quarters.

1008
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,560
Spaniards and tourists down there are incredibly drunk.

1009
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,200
Well, the Spaniards are always drunk and the tourists are always very close to the bloodshed.

1010
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,520
So I don't think we really...

1011
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,920
You know what I'm saying.

1012
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:38,720
30 people were eaten at last year's festival and the crowd ate it up, you might say.

1013
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,920
They love this sort of thing.

1014
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,580
I think what the actual statistics were, there were 25 people were eating.

1015
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,140
Oh, here comes the stripper.

1016
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,940
Here they come.

1017
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:45,820
Well, here they come right now.

1018
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,300
The cave stripper babes or what are they called?

1019
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,640
They're from Holland, I think.

1020
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,980
The Neanderlites.

1021
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,820
Yes, they don't...

1022
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,180
Neanderlites and they...

1023
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,600
Incredible, they don't even shave their legs.

1024
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,680
And they make sure that the bottle caps are fully and completely open.

1025
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,480
And look at how sloping the foreheads are.

1026
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,700
That's a sign of beauty to them.

1027
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,340
Yes, they find that attractive.

1028
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,440
And they're twirling the cave torches.

1029
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,980
And I guess that's supposed to scare the old dinie, but it doesn't seem to be...

1030
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,340
It's symbolic.

1031
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,400
No, it's symbolic.

1032
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,060
Yes, it's part of their beautiful, lovely culture.

1033
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,000
And really, I'm sure the males find these cave ladies very attractive.

1034
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,760
Well, they love the culture and they love the petri dish.

1035
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,840
They put the culture on and some of the ladies can save them from it.

1036
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,860
But at least they're there to give them their own engrams

1037
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,480
and perhaps smoke what's left, the remainderings, I think.

1038
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,320
Well, the crowd is certainly into it.

1039
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,640
They can't wait for the slaves to be brought out and fed to the dinosaurs.

1040
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,180
Is the gate ready to go up now or is it going to go down?

1041
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:50,460
I'll tell you what, this virtual world we're in is so much better than the tedious real world

1042
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,980
with its duct tape and drop cloth, don't you think, Dave?

1043
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,980
Well, we still do need to use a little bit of duct cloth and drop cloth.

1044
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,900
Uh, duct tape and cloth.

1045
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,120
Oh, but then we wouldn't be able to see these amazing, gigantic dinosaurs...

1046
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,600
Well, not from this crawlspace, but...

1047
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,100
...these crowds of drunken Spaniards and all these happy, happy subgeniuses.

1048
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,580
Here at the Pamplona Running of the Dinosaurs X Day 2012.

1049
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,940
And we've got a front runner right in here, Pablo Neres,

1050
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,900
who was in there for like a good solid 45 minutes

1051
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,820
before having part of his slats removed.

1052
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,760
Pablo, what's the situation down on the ground?

1053
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,680
It is rich Corinthian leather.

1054
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,480
My wine sack and my nut sack

1055
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,620
are of rich Corinthian leather.

1056
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,200
You're supposed to say my wine sack and my...

1057
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,140
What was the other one?

1058
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,300
I am no...

1059
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,280
Uh...

1060
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:51,780
Uh...

1061
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,100
Brutal cave person, my friend.

1062
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,460
You are a Buddhist, though, aren't you?

1063
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,260
I am a... I am a surrealist artist from Barthelona.

1064
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,140
I am Dali, everything romping, yomping and yomp.

1065
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,220
I use only squid ink for my black paint

1066
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,040
and squid blood for my red.

1067
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,620
And that is all I have.

1068
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:12,620


1069
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,440
That's all I need, red and black,

1070
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,740
because I remember the revolution.

1071
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,380
That is all I live for, is my memories of the revolution.

1072
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,920
That's... Because there never was a revolution.

1073
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,840
I just had to... I love to think about it, if only...

1074
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,800
In times like this,

1075
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,580
I like to remember the story of Stang's Overcoat.

1076
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,060
The next day, there were so many hungry and poor.

1077
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,800
Not one has a fresh overcoat.

1078
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,320
But Stang is in the front of the pack,

1079
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,420
leading the victorious soldiers.

1080
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,480
And one says to him,

1081
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,500
Stang, take my beautiful new overcoat.

1082
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,520
And Stang says,

1083
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:55,140
I will not wear a clean new overcoat until every subgenius has one.

1084
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,520
What the hell have I forgotten?

1085
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,780
I... They fell for that one.

1086
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm a fool.

1087
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,840
Now we're down to the last moments

1088
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,300
of this radio program.

1089
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:11,460
This is the first time

1090
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:11,460


1091
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,500
Praise Bob.

1092
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,020
Praise Bob.

1093
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,240
And hail Connie.

1094
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,620
And hail the extreme factors

1095
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,380
who have forced the nurture here...

1096
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:20,700
That is unbelievable.

1097
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,620
...in the Celery House,

1098
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,600
where the nipples are strong and free,

1099
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,380
the odors are everywhere.

1100
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,980
But, Nanza, it's a corny copia.

1101
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,260
A corny copia.

1102
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,420
We're not afraid. We're not afraid.

1103
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,020
Her cup runneth over,

1104
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,160
and I'm spilling my words

1105
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,860
all over the ground and the air.

1106
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,540
Smell it.

1107
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,960
Like the old fish market.

1108
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,780
Like squid vomit.

1109
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,860
A squid.

1110
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,900
Let's grab a squid and wrestle with it.

1111
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,220
And kill the show.

1112
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,660
To hell with the show.

1113
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,040
Life is short.

1114
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,500
And may the devil take the hindmost.

1115
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:58,760
Shorten.

1116
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,140
Mary, leave a good-looking squid corpse behind you.

1117
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:02,480
Ha-ha!

1118
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,640
Well...

1119
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,340
That's it for another week.

1120
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,840
And I hope you enjoyed it.

1121
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1122
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1123
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1124
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1125
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1126
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1127
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1128
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1129
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1130
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1131
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1132
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1133
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1134
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1135
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1136
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1137
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1138
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,840


1139
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,020
I'll be marching off

1140
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:46,280
to the internment camps for radio disc jockeys any day now.

1141
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,520
I long you for this camp, buddy boy.

1142
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,440
You look like you've got three marks.

1143
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,580
One on forehead, one on neck, and one on foot.

1144
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,560
That's a great bridge you got your men to build there, Dave.

1145
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,520
That's a great blastodermia growing in the Petri, Dave.

1146
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,580
You seem to have built it in the wrong place and upside down.

1147
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,260
It just goes from one side of the hill to the other side of the hill.

1148
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,260
It's supposed to go across the river.

1149
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,480
Goddamn you, Stang.

1150
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,240
I can't.

1151
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,520
I must do it right.

1152
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,420
I don't care about this bloody war.

1153
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,920
If this bridge has my name on it, or at least nearby,

1154
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,180
or perhaps in the next town,

1155
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,420
if someone will just scroll my name on a piece of paper

1156
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:33,440
and mail it to this number, this address, send it to...

1157
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,240
A bridge named Dave.

1158
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,380
Box. Box.

1159
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,560
Box one eight.

1160
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,340
One eight one four one seven Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1161
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,080
Four four one one eight. Praise Bob.

1162
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,900
Until next week, keep your hat on tight.

1163
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,520
You're back to the winner, sack in the saddle.

1164
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:51,400
And God save our Quinn.

1165
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,960
Don't worry, Boris. We'll get to all of the cages eventually.

1166
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,920
But first, you must climb into, and then escape, the cage of B-B-B-Bob!
