1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,720
This program is fictional and any resemblance to actual persons living or dead is purely

2
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,420
or purely coincidental. This is Bob saying no and obey, obey, obey, be careful.

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,060
No?

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:47,060
Bob is great, Bob is great, so listen to old Bob, good old Bob, good old Bob, has a righteous soul.

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,820
Bob will growl and call you a hazel.

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,220
I am going to die, I am going to die, I am going to die.

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,880
Welcome to your last day on earth.

8
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:17,600
I feel good, I feel good, I feel very happy, I feel very sad.

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,980
I feel very happy, I feel very sad.

10
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,220
Hope I didn't startle you, hon.

11
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,440
Are you feeling better?

12
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,740
I like it here.

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,340
Nothing beats setting up camp in the desert at night,

14
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,360
just toasting s'mores and getting glowy.

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,680
Baby, we have to talk.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm on a radiation vacation, soaking up the gammas.

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,080
All the he-men do their bomb testing just over the ridge there.

18
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,980
Can't you smell it?

19
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,700
Baby, there's a possibility that your problem is coming back.

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
There's nothing wrong with me.

21
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm just little Miss Suburbia, two jean pods and a purse full of credit cards.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,340
My husband had an erection once.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,340
Silly, really.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,580
I want you to go upstairs and pack a suitcase.

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm taking you back there.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,300
This flicker is my vortex.

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,160
See the neon?

28
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,140
I got an EKG you can dance to.

29
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Everybody limbo.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
I had a legendary twitch in Nagasaki.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,260
Uh-huh.

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,420
Huh?

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,700
I want to tell you a secret.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,480
Hello, I'm busy.

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,140
I'm a machine.

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,040
Perhaps.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm a machine.

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,140
Perhaps I would really like to zoom right in there, deep within you.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,580
No pain.

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,740
Perhaps I would love to know you better.

41
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,360
I would love to continue our conversation.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,960
When can we do that?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,440
No pain.

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,160
I would really like to get to know you.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,480
I'd really like to see you again.

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,640
Can we go have lunch?

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,980
I can't even feel love.

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,480
You are spontaneous, interesting, fun.

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
I'd love to spend more time with you.

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,320
I'd love to spend more time with you.

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,340
I'd really like to continue this conversation.

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Come here, please.

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,540
It's easy for you.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,680
Natural.

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,720
Natural.

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, yes, yes.

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,580
And the song I'm about to play is by Natural Lizzy.

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:18,820
But I should explain that this show, Hour of Slight number 1118, is a women's show.

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,820
That is, it's mostly girl stuff.

60
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,960
And girls.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:22,960


62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Girl Devo stuff.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,940
Love, marriage, babies, hell, purgatory, all that girl stuff.

64
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,260
What we just heard was from Miss Norell Preff, Miss the Floozy, and Miss Leemur.

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,120
Now, Natural Lizzy will perform Devo's Baby Doll.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,220
Welcome.

67
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,220


68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,540
Hello, everybody.

69
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,780
You are watching Another Flea complementary TV أنا grijal LOL

70
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,840

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:18,840


72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,000
My baby doll

My baby doll

My baby doll

76
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,440
My baby doll

77
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,460
Right out my life

78
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,140
She turns it off

79
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,460
Over my head

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,820
Not close enough

81
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,420
My baby doll

82
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,620
My baby doll

83
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,360
My baby doll

84
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,420
My baby doll

Baby doll

87

You look so good

88
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Baby doll

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,940
You feel so sweet

90
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,440
Baby doll

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,040
Baby doll

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,360
Let me have it

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,160
Baby doll

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,740
Why did you do it?

95
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,060
Baby

96
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,280
Baby doll

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,160

Baby doll

103
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,940
Why did you do it?

104
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,080
Baby doll

105
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,540
Baby doll

106
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,120
Why did you do it?

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Baby doll

108
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,800
Baby doll

109
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,540
Baby doll

110
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,180
Why did you do it?

111
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,420
Baby doll

112
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,340
My baby

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,360
Quick-capped bird queen knows what she wants

114
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,500
And what I have is what it costs

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,140
My baby John

116
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,220
My baby John

117
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,080
My baby John

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,140
My baby John

119
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,620
My baby John

120
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,480
Baby John You look so good

121
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,580
Baby John You'll feel so sweet

122
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,920
Baby John Let me have it

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,640
Baby John Why did you do it, baby!

124
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,680
Baby John You look so good

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
Baby John You'll feel so sweet

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,140
Baby John Let me have it

127
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,840
Baby John Why did you do it, baby!

128
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,060
Baby, don't

129
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,400
Why did you turn off the light?

130
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,260
Pretty Mongo, everybody wants her toilet

131
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,860
Same old story, she don't let no one near it

132
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,040
The way she teases them, it's such a shame

133
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,500
She's got all the hue-boons crying her name

134
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,100
Simple, simple

135
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,540
She got them howling, she got them growling

136
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,220
Simple, simple

137
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,980
She got them going clean out of their minds

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Simple, simple

139
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,340
Simple, simple

140
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:41,020
In a mountain town who wouldn't have her for his daughter

141
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,500
They'd all trade their brains for one taste of her toilet water

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,060
So what's the point of living in a town like this?

143
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,480
The way she teases them, it's such a shame

144
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,900
She's got all the hue-boons crying her name

145
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,620
Simple, simple

146
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
Simple, simple

147
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,640
Simple, simple

148
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,480
Simple, simple

149
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,020
Simple, simple

150
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,880
you're a whore

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,700
They run in circles

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,020
try to call her out

153
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
But her phone's been disconnected

154
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,460
since she sold her butt

155
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
The way she teases them

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,380
It's such a shame

157
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,520
She's got all the

158
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,500
hoops on her back

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Hoops on her back

160
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,100
She got them howling

161
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,960
She got them growling

162
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,380
She got them going clean

163
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,860
out of their minds

164
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,420
She got them going clean

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,600


166
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,100
She got them going clean

167
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,000
out of their minds

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,360
Yeah!

169
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,180
Do you take this

170
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,020
this teela

171
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,940
to be your teela?

172
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,940
To have

173
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,900
and to hold

174
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
from this day forward

175
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
for better or for worse

176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
for richer or poorer

177
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
in sickness and in health

178
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,420
and kinkiness

179
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,960
to love and to choose

180
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,980
say I do!

181
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,780
I do!

182
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
Do you take this

183
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,040


184
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,180
take this hot

185
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,580
hot woman

186
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,740
who frankly

187
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,620
I have taken notice of myself

188
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,140
in the past

189
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,320
of not just being Kaylo

190
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,320


191
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,420
to be her king

192
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


193
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


194
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


195
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


196
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,320
to have

197
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes!

198
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,640
Have

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,620
And to hm-hold

200
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,800
from this day forward

201
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,760
for better or for worse

202
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,420
for richer or for poorer

203
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,120
in sickness and health

204
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,740
to love and to cherish

205
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
and to fucking

206
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
fucking fuck

207
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,680
say I do!

208
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,380
I do!

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,140
Yeah!

210
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,060
I fuck

211
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,040
I fuck

212
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
I fuck

213
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,300
And this girl has just

214
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,740
driven across the field

215
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,400
That's beautiful.

216
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,040
Now friends, hey, you have rings.

217
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,540
They already have the rings.

218
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,560
Click those rings together as if those rings

219
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,760
were making it, baby.

220
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,300
Now, seal your vows with a kiss

221
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,660
and make it a hot kiss

222
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,580
because there's a lot of subjeetions watching.

223
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,320
Now, shake on it and say it's a deal.

224
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,380
It's a deal.

225
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,240
I am a co-house suit.

226
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,960
Teela and Mickey.

227
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,700
That's right.

228
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,540
I am in one.

229
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,320
Price Mickey.

230
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
Price Teela.

231
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Price Bob.

232
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,400
Price Connie.

233
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,580
It's a wild, wild world, baby.

234
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,600
It is a...

235
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,340
wild world indeed.

236
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,820
The end of a wedding,

237
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,380
a real wedding at 10X Day Drill last July.

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,280
Congratulations to Mickey and Teela Wild.

239
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,040
Before that, the old, old Devo song,

240
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,520
Sue Balls,

241
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,040
was done by the all-girl band Deva

242
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,620
from myspace.com slash Devalurement.

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,860
Baby Doll was covered by Natural Lizzy,

244
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,720
which is at myspace.com

245
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,700
slash Hello Poopy.

246
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,140
All from the Devo fan collection,

247
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,540
not necessarily beautiful,

248
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,940
but mutated.

249
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,900
And all girl stuff,

250
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,380
as is this sermon on Connie Dobbs and Connie Dumbs.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,140
Yes.

252
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:04,820
Magistra.

253
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,620
Butantis.

254
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Geekus Adeptus has a question.

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

256
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,920
Thank you.

257
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,740
Thank you.

258
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:12,980
Thank you.

259
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,200
Thank you.

260
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,320


261
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,420


262
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,720
Thank you.

263
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:13,720


264
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:13,720


265
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:13,720


266
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:13,720


267
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,120
Thank you.

268
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,080
Say that again.

269
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,360
Connie.

270
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,860
As in Hail Connie?

271
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,640
Hail Connie.

272
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,560
Oh, did I hail Connie?

273
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,260
Nobody cares about Connie.

274
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,980
I'm sorry to say that,

275
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,740
but if you folks really,

276
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,140
if you feminists really want to...

277
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,980
You know, we got all this griping

278
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,080
over for the last 25 years.

279
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,340
Oh, you're all praising Bob,

280
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,960
but nobody says Hail Connie enough.

281
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,940
Man, we put a hundred Connie shirts,

282
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
mugs, tiles,

283
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,240
every cheesy gee-gaw you can think of

284
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
is at subgenius.com.

285
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,340
And nobody ever buys any of it.

286
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,680
However, one thing we do have at that table

287
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,400
are Connie and Bob condoms.

288
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,700
Condoms.

289
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,320
There are Connie condoms.

290
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,220
There are more Connie condoms than there are Bob condoms.

291
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,380
Well, once again, because nobody really cares about Connie.

292
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,180
Until they get real horny.

293
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,760
Oh, yeah, then all of a sudden,

294
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,880
Hail Connie.

295
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,680
Oh, I need to get laid.

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
I better say my prayers to Connie.

297
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,460
Hypocrites, backsliders, pew packers.

298
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,380
Here's the sad thing about the Bob condoms.

299
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,700
I just...

300
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
This company contacted us and said,

301
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,200
we do art condoms.

302
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,720
Condoms with designs by Coop

303
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,800
and R. Crum and people on them.

304
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,560
And we thought we'd put Bob on there.

305
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,440
And I said, well, you also have to have Connie-doms.

306
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,680
And then we'd get a little royalty

307
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,260
whenever somebody sold one.

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,540
And I finally got samples of them just before X-Day.

309
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,940
But I decided to give them away.

310
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,580
And we did.

311
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,300
We gave them away as condolence things

312
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,920
to all the people who showed up waiting for the saucers.

313
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,060
And here's why.

314
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,740
They're not righteous Bob condoms.

315
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,240
Because it turned out when you open it up,

316
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,420
you discover the Bob is only on the outside packaging.

317
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,660
There's no Bob on the rubber.

318
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,660
Now the whole idea is,

319
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:13,660


320
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:13,660


321
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,620
the idea of a Bob condom is to see the distorted, swollen,

322
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
weird-looking dog's heads or Connie faces that you get

323
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,160
depending on what kind of distorted, swollen thing they're stuck onto.

324
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,780
But then we got to realizing there's a practical side of it.

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,880
What if you had your Bob condom on and you had...

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,140
maybe even you had a partner to use it with.

327
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,060
And you stick it into something,

328
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,060
whichever, armpit or something.

329
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,120
Well, you pull it out.

330
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,120
When you done your...

331
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,440
If you come tonight, you'll see Bob.

332
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,380
When you're done with it,

333
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,420
you pull it out and there's this...

334
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,060
It's like smeared...

335
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,460
The Bob would be all smeared, right?

336
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,140
The ink...

337
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,200
You would have left a Bob inside that armpit

338
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,160
or whatever orifice you would use.

339
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,860
Now some would go,

340
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,340
Yeah, man, I've got Bob in me now.

341
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,360
But then there's the question of the, you know,

342
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,920
what do they make the ink out of?

343
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,460
Do you really want to have a dog's head made of toxic ink

344
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,600
soaking into your mucous membranes or your armpit or whatever?

345
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,160
A subgenius suggested the one way around it.

346
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,280
We're going to contact the company and see if they can print the Bobs

347
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,780
directly on the rubbers using prairie squid ink.

348
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,820
So, you know, write your congressman and demand that from now on,

349
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,900
the Bob condoms use prairie squid safe, endangered animal prairie squid ink.

350
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,460
Some of you city kids may not know what prairie squids are good for,

351
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,820
and that's just too bad.

352
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,600
You'll have to guess.

353
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,820
I was just wondering why there is a large spent prophylactic right in front of you.

354
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,640
Well, that was the subject of Stang's earlier discourse.

355
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,440
That is a rubber.

356
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes, it's one of the ones that had Connie's face on it.

357
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,740
It was on the package, but not on the tip.

358
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,680
And we were bemoaning the conspiracy's inability to get it and follow through

359
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,000
to produce the object which actually does represent the desire of the computer.

360
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,120
I mean, consumer.

361
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,800
Oh well, I suppose there's not that much difference anymore.

362
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,460
Well, I suppose if there's a Virgin Mary, there must be a concept called an anti-Virgin Connie,

363
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,380
and if so, why? And if not, why not?

364
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,620
Because use is the paramount metaphor.

365
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:49,040
And not holding something in readiness for some namby-pamby pie-in-the-sky day of coitus that may never occur.

366
00:17:49,300 --> 00:18:01,000
One must jump into the frantic round of body fluid mixing in order to generate more consumers for Moloch,

367
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,180
the friendly, smiling head of the conspiracy corporation.

368
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,780
Yes.

369
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,600
We can only think of a post-coint.

370
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:17,260
A little tower in San Franskisvoldskisvokism, a standing tall erect monument, now gone flaccid,

371
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,140
awaiting more and more Germans, little weasels to arise, and different pieces of...

372
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,060
Well, was that something different now?

373
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:34,580
I don't know. Because whether it comes from Germany or Skandahouvia or any nation of old Europe or whatever,

374
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,440
it is prophesied that one will come

375
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,120
who will reunite the tribes and cause the bobbies to sink into the ocean

376
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,520
about your greasy hair doesn't care about the clothes you wear

377
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,060
Connie the Band Whore

378
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,020
Connie the Band Whore

379
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,980
she lays D&D geeks she thinks about comic books in her sleep

380
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,860
she loves your nerdy ways and the funny questions from Star Trek you say

381
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,640
Connie the Band Whore

382
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,500
Connie the Band Whore

383
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,420
a geek lover and heartless

384
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,420


385
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,220
she doesn't want the butchy part

386
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,160
Connie the Band Whore

387
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,280
Connie the Band Whore

388
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,180
everybody's favorite girl

389
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,220
even if you're a dork of the world

390
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,440
she doesn't care if you're clean or neat

391
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:07,940
she doesn't care if you're clean or neat

392
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,000
she doesn't care how much money you have

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,920
the only thing that she wants is your meat

394
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
and she don't get it she's gonna be mad

395
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,400
Connie the Band Whore

396
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,460
Connie the Band Whore

397
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,320
she's everybody's favorite girl

398
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,520
she just wants you for who you are

399
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,400
don't need to be a muscle man

400
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,500
or a man or a rockstar

401
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,120
she doesn't care about what's on sale at the mall

402
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,120
she just wants to take you to bed and have a great old fall

403
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,340
Connie the Band Whore

404
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,340
Connie the Band Whore

405
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,420
and I'm talking about the marching band

406
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,760
she died to a player last week

407
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,400
she died to a player last week

408
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,720
ever since. Earlier she got up with the guy playing flute. It was a great riot.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,740
Connie the band whore. Connie the band whore. She loves the boys for what they are.

410
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,120
No lipstick needed. No need to try.

411
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,520
Connie the band whore. Connie the band whore. Connie the band whore.

412
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,000
Connie. She doesn't want those pretty boy tights.

413
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,840
Connie. She wants a guy who can read and write.

414
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,740
Everybody involved was making that up on the spot, friends. The doctor music has really changed over

415
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,040
the years, thank God. Priestess Pisces was singing with five-fisted tales of Connie,

416
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,980
such tales as Carter LeBlanc and Reverend Angry Larry. But now, another wedding at 10 next day.

417
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,200
Ranting time. Anybody?

418
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,600
All right. Actually, before you rant, I've got something I need to do.

419
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,620
Can I see your fiancé, please, to come up as well?

420
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:52,080
This is a shorter fiancé. They are shorter engaged and they want to finalize their shorter engagement.

421
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,180
Okay. If you two could come up on the stage, please. And do you have the gear?

422
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,360
The equipment?

423
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,760
Yes, we do.

424
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,800
Okay. Every subgenius minister is allowed to do shorter mars. In fact, you should be

425
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,080
doing shorter mars. I have... Everybody does their shorter mars different. Mine is pretty

426
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,780
sweet and simple.

427
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,740
Okay.

428
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Your name again?

429
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,240
Absinthetic.

430
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:18,980
Absinthetic.

431
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,620
Absinthetic Pantiera. Do you promise in the next however long it takes before you try

432
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:32,100
to kill each other to fuck like zombie bunnies and maybe carnivorous zombie bunnies?

433
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,100


434
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,100


435
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:42,240
And to honor the concept of the Shur-Dur-Mar by doing this profusely and loud enough

436
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,360
that we can hear you and preferably allowing us to watch. Do you?

437
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,240
Yes.

438
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,800
Okay. I will now perform the binding ceremony for these two.

439
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,040
The binding ceremony.

440
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:53,700
Whoo!

441
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,940
Just put it on the mic.

442
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,540
Aww.

443
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,080
I now pronounce you uberfeminine.

444
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080


445
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080


446
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080


447
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080


448
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,080


449
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,660
And then pet?

450
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,700
Yay!

451
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:06,560


452
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,620
Party fighters!

453
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh, you need to give her more... There's got to be more tongue than that, but yeah.

454
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,420
Whoo!

455
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,080
Beautiful.

456
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,560
That's so romantic. But you know, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the

457
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Chuck Hestens with the baby carriage.

458
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,820
Whoo!

459
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,440
Whoo!

460
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,860
Whoo!

461
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,220
Whoo!

462
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,160
Whoo!

463
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:13,560
There's that damn baby again, looking at me There's that damn baby again, wasn't one from me

464
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,520
And there's that damn baby again, looking at me

465
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,080
There's that damn baby again, wasn't one from me

466
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,820
And there's that damn baby again, looking at me

467
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,120
There's that damn baby again, wasn't one from me

468
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,300
There's that goddamn baby again, looking at me, wants to be my friend

469
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,140
Life gonna sneak out, no backdoor, so the damn baby can't look at me no more

470
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,100
I remember once when I was thirteen, a baby's on the phone, she goes up in it

471
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,880
Now I've cleaned it up, she's eye well stoned, she's messing with the Jews, but I have some fun

472
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,960
And there's that damn baby again, looking at me

473
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,420
There's that damn baby again, wasn't one from me

474
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,720
Before I started having kids, I scrubbed my family

475
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,760
Before I scrubbed my family, I scrubbed my kids with a toothbrush

476
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,620
Before I scrubbed my kids with a toothbrush

477
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,080
Before I scrubbed my kids with a toothbrush

478
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,360
Before I scrubbed my kids with a toothbrush

479
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,440
I tried having seizures

480
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,620
Guess what, guess what would taste good right now, to everyone in the car

481
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,920
Your family, we've got your favorite kind at the concession stand

482
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,760
Come on down and pick out the kinds you want to enjoy during the rest of the show

483
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,960
Be sure to get plenty, because everyone likes your family

484
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,380
And our big variety is chosen to please everybody's taste

485
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,400
Anybody else want guitar? Bass? No, bass isn't available just yet

486
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,080
And everybody else want guitar? Bass? No, bass isn't available just yet

487
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,080


488
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,240
I haven't had one of those in a long time.

489
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,420
It's awesome.

490
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,940
It's the hardest walk.

491
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,060
It's great because every time we come up here, everyone gets injured.

492
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:56,040
It's like a four color version of ritzy dance, forma en her.

493
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,100
That's perfect Corrin.

494
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,140


495
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,140


496
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,240
That's the last à la pas.

497
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:18,180
just how to greet her. Connie is on the prowl. Connie is on the prowl. You barbers better

498
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:27,740
look out now. Connie is on the prowl. Sneaking into your tents while you're getting bent.

499
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:36,640
Connie is going to surprise you. And you'll forget whatever you thought of before once

500
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:54,400
you get your dick inside on. You know I make this shit up as I go along, right? Back of

501
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,460
the boobly got. Back of the boobly got. Lesbian

502
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,600
gang. Gays taking over. Rod, if you will, Bill, of Rod. Women, that's lesbians and also some men.

503
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,460
All right, lesbian or gay. You know, who knows what. Members of a lesbian gang. Homosexuality.

504
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,960
Yes, as a matter of fact, you know, performing sex acts and doing sex acts, Bill. Take a closer

505
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,880
look. It makes sense. Very, very interesting. More gay. Pink pistol. Homosexuality. Pink pistols.

506
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:25,760
Attacked by a lesbian. Well, the crazy Koreans once put out a press release that Kim Il-sung,

507
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,040
the president of the

508
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:56,200
the father of the present North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Our own father. They said he shit pure gold. You know, those people are really in a bad way out there. The people who shit pure gold are in a bad way. No, the people who are told this by their government and are not allowed to do anything but accept it. I guess it's part of what they call the

509
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,000
hoochie.

510
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:22,780
ideal. Or do you pronounce it Juche? J-U-C-H-E. It means complete agreement with Kim Il-sungism. Oh, I thought it meant complete agreement with one's bowels. In Pyongyang, Korea, they built the tower of the hoochie ideal. Or is it the Juche ideal? Can somebody help me out here? My Korean is weak. Somebody help Mr. Kim Il-sung.

511
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,780
I believe in God.

512
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,600
Others say.

513
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,500
I believe in God.

514
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:26,880
God.

515
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,960
God.

516
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:26,960


517
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,120
God.

518
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,460
God.

519
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:27,540
God.

520
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


521
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


522
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


523
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


524
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


525
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


526
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


527
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


528
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


529
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


530
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


531
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:27,540


532
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:39,200
I always tried to get her over to Korea. And if he only could have put Betty in charge, history would have been different. And I, too, believe that that is the case.

533
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,260
On a psycho-subliminal level, he did put Betty in charge. He dresses like Betty.

534
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:56,640
Yes, but he didn't get his army of garter belt wearing black-haired cuties on the march, which would have overwhelmed the demilitarized zone and successfully annexed the Korean peninsula.

535
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,380
Korean martial arts require a degree of training and skill that are hard to attain in high heels.

536
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:10,720
Those stiletto heels could do a great deal of damage on a GI's clod hopper, I've got to tell you.

537
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,480
But there's no point in crying over the spilt milk of history.

538
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,220
What's that new wonderful Dobbs quote, Reverend Stang?

539
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,660
Say what?

540
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,420
That new wonderful quote from Bob about spilled milk and not crying over the same?

541
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,640
No, it was, don't watch spilt milk burn.

542
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,080
Ah, yes.

543
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,980
The latest quote passed down from Bob, his wisdom, don't watch spilt milk burn.

544
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,480
I don't like doing that.

545
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,440
Maybe it was, there's no sense in watching spilt milk burn, something like that.

546
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,940
Yeah, well, he's absolutely right.

547
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:52,760
Of course, you are going to see or going to be there with some spilt milk burning if you make pudding.

548
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,840
If you make pudding.

549
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,440
Pudding in the true and correct way.

550
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:04,040
And that doesn't mean getting some artificial pre-made pudding where you don't have to boil the milk by hand.

551
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,060
Nah, Sammy, you need curdled tears.

552
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,920
The curdled tears of the masses.

553
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,860
Their eyes are like milk, see?

554
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,560
It's like Lakshmi's drink.

555
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,420
You see, to get good pudding, I mean, really good pudding, good pudding,

556
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:24,660
what you've got to do is, after you boil the milk and you let the entire mess settle,

557
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,660
you've got to cover it with a plastic sheet to keep it from the air,

558
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:35,380
and then the pudding will harden and achieve the true glucosity of texture which it requires.

559
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,320
But in this process, you will spill some milk, it will burn, and there's nothing you can do about it.

560
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,860
But do not watch it.

561
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,560
Instead, attend to your pudding.

562
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,080
And allow your curdled tears to drop in the pot.

563
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,020
Remember, eugenically altered Elsie and Elmer are watching over your shoulder.

564
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,140
Elmer still looks jovial after all these years on the little tube of Elmer's glue.

565
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,300
As a child, there was something in the graphic representation of both Elmer and his wife Elsie

566
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,080
that bothered my little self, the sense of perception.

567
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:21,940
They have this, I guess it's a lock of hair coming over the forehead, but it's curled.

568
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,740
It looks like they've got a tube leading out.

569
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,240
It's out of their skull into which something might be introduced.

570
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:38,340
Just as when they troop into the barn, the milking machine is added to Elsie's heavy milk-laden dugs,

571
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:49,700
and the semen-slurking machine is added to Elmer's large appendage for agricultural uses.

572
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,440
And I thought as a child,

573
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,720
does this tube that we're talking about,

574
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:54,720


575
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:54,720


576
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:54,720


577
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,120
do they both apparently got sticking out of their heads?

578
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,320
And the kids too, if you look at the illustrations closely,

579
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:08,440
do they attach something in the barn that sticks something in or pulls something out of their heads?

580
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,880
I guess it's just a graphic tradition showing a curl of hair, but it is thought-provoking.

581
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,400
And we don't want to have a receptor for some device.

582
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640
I know they're talking about putting your new cell phone,

583
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,240
inside your head completely.

584
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,300
I don't even want the cell phones that they have now.

585
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,140
But future plans, just as in that movie,

586
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,980
The President's Analyst, which was considered a satire,

587
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,040
where they were going to implant a phone in your brain,

588
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,040
they are talking about it now,

589
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:49,720
since they have machinery that can be activated by the desire to activate it,

590
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,900
that is used by our jet pilots in Iraq.

591
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,740
Did you notice the one disclaimer that we were about to give,

592
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,980
but refused to give because of some legal abrogations going on in the backyard,

593
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,020
that those members who failed to meet the requirements

594
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:12,040
may have their brains removed and placed in a sundering device or a receptacle

595
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,600
on the way somewhere else,

596
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,440
or they assume they're just walking aboard and being skirted away,

597
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,700
without any skirts on, actually, some of them.

598
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,940
I think that one should strive for that never to happen,

599
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,880
because for the brain to be removed is part of the older thinking of the universe.

600
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,860
Are we most...

601
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,780
Most progressive...

602
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,560
You know, the brain does not stop at the borders of that piece of grey matter we call the brain.

603
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,980
The whole body is essentially the brain.

604
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,160
And when you pull the brain itself out of its protective vault in the skull,

605
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,880
and keep it alive...

606
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,100
What is it they call that? Transfusing?

607
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,320
I don't think that's right.

608
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:53,740
They have a...

609
00:36:53,740 --> 00:37:00,060
name for keeping severed heads alive and brains alive. I read the Russian literature on it.

610
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,440
Transdisfiguration is the... It's trans something. No, it's not. It's perfusing.

611
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:10,520
Perfusing a severed head was the title of the original Russian paper, but they can also

612
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:19,960
perfuse a brain. However, this brain has nothing to do but sit in its sad isolation and curdle in

613
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,660
its memories for when it did have the nerves to express itself as a living being.

614
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:24,680


615
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,720
You know, this brain is useless. It has been removed from the sphere of life only as an

616
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,920
object of vulgar curiosity to peeping scientists who have no respect for the flesh.

617
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,880
Well, all we... Sorry, I didn't mean to... All we must remember is these brains, much

618
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,660
like Elmer, do shit gold bricks. One at a time.

619
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,200
But they can't know it. They can't even know it.

620
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,640
Unfortunately.

621
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:55,820
Now, it's been said that these severed brains don't feel pain, and that's what scientific

622
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:01,260
belief is. But what if they were somehow wrong and they existed in a universe of unpleasant

623
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,980
pain?

624
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,900
Or thought of pain.

625
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,240
After all, it's impossible to communicate with them once they have been perfused.

626
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,500
Friends, won't you go and unplug poor P-Dog's... No, it was CareDog. Poor CareDog's plug.

627
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,020
CareDog's brain. Yes.

628
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:27,640
Yes. Lasting in horrible pain until this day, until Bob Dobbs pops out of his grave and puts him out of his misery,

629
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,080
according to the popular subgenius children's book that Dr. Stang is referring to.

630
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,820
You did the illustrations for that book. Did you say...

631
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:43,460
No, I didn't. The illustrations for CareDog Meets P-Bear, the name of the story involved, were done by lies.

632
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,120
But it's a great story, and I...

633
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,020
Lies.

634
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,120
Lies.

635
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,340
Lies.

636
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:48,720


637
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:48,820
Lies.

638
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,140
Lies.

639
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,840
I've read that story. It always seems to affect an audience with its emotional content and weight.

640
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,700
Oh, such masterpieces have been produced under the aegis of the church of the subgenius.

641
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,080
And they fall to the ground, as if they were legs.

642
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:09,060
They've been struck by the lures, by the gods, you know, and they ride around on the horse of the gods,

643
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,380
and then they flap and shoot their legs around, and they take it off and put it in the...

644
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,620
Divinely inspired.

645
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,740
We, when we produce such a thing, could be...

646
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:18,800
We, when we produce such a thing, could be...

647
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,800
said to be ridden by dobs.

648
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,580
Not hag-ridden, but bob-ridden.

649
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,220
We've been accused of that pretty seriously.

650
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,760
Accused? Oh, my. How should I...

651
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,620
Well, no, I've had people say, well, you know, Stang, you didn't really write that stuff.

652
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,720
The Invisible College was using you to get this material out.

653
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,840
You flunked the Invisible College.

654
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
So an army of spooks and phantoms.

655
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Did all the work while Smug Stang sat back with his hands behind his head,

656
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,600
snoozing in his hammock, drinking a pitcher of margaritas,

657
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,980
brought by Princess Wee wearing the latest French lingerie.

658
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,100
That's supposedly how it happened.

659
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,500
Well, in a more perfect world, perhaps it would.

660
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:15,400
But in a way, each drop of ink expended on these productions is like a drop of blood that we shed.

661
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,680
A shed.

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,060
A shed.

663
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,620
Eh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

664
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,680
Oh, we've shed plenty of blood here.

665
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,680
In fact, we're trying to get as much as we can back into the original receptacles.

666
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,840
We're having problems with the health department.

667
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,080
So if any of you would like to help remove some of the shed blood,

668
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,600
that would be just sweet as pumpkin pie.

669
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:42,580
Yeah, but people are naturally leery of that because today's blood contains strange bogeys.

670
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,260
Yes, and many new minerals we can't deal with yet.

671
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,060
We can somehow...

672
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,360
We can play craps with them, so to speak.

673
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,140
Shoot dice.

674
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,200
Because it may go any way.

675
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,900
God not only does play dice with the universe, he plays loaded dice.

676
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:03,800
And the entire game is rigged, as should have been evident even to Einstein.

677
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,980
He calls it hot taco craps.

678
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,960
It was a thing I had to do.

679
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,980
It was a message from below.

680
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:43,640
It was a messy situation.

681
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,300
It was desire for a girl.

682
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,860
It was desire for sobriety.

683
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:16,880
Ah, that에게s been slowly

684
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:16,900
awhile.

685
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,640
Okay.

686
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,400
Let's do it then.

687
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,780
One, two, three.

688
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,260
I'll get another piece of pie

689
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,840
I'll get another piece of pie if I have to die

690
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,320
What you gonna do?

691
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,320
What you gonna do?

692
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,020
One, two, three, four, tell the people what you think

693
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
It was a thing I had to do

694
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,880
It was a message from below

695
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,580
It was a messy situation

696
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,460
It was a triumph of the world

697
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,300
Before I die

698
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,280
Before I die

699
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,000
Before I die

700
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,220
I'll get another piece of pie

701
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,340
I'll get another piece of pie

702
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,660
I'll get another piece of pie if I have to die

703
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,900
Why?

704
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,180
When the well cries out for water

705
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,220
It is our need that must be filled

706
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,380
It goes beyond the laws of nature

707
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,360
It takes a triumph of the world

708
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,240
She's just the girl I want

709
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,640
She's just the girl I want

710
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,180
Is she the girl you don't want?

711
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,620
She's just the girl I want

712
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,100
She's just the girl I want

713
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,640
She's just the girl I want

714
00:43:44,640 --> 00:44:11,980
She's just the girl I want.

715
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,620
The beautiful Robin Renee, and you can check her out at myspace.com slash Robin Renee, R-E-N-E-E.

716
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:32,060
Before that, Dr. Howell and Lonesome Cowboy Dave, live at 10X Day at Tarzan's Radio Studio, as I am now.

717
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:42,280
Before that, some Norrell Preff cum lodges, as well as a jam from Five Fisted Tales of Connie, also live at Brushwood, last X Day.

718
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,620
And you can learn more about Robin Renee at myspace.com slash Robin Renee, R-E-N-E-E.

719
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,740
And you can learn of the Chuck Heston's baby-eating album, Glitch, at thechuckhestens.com.

720
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,020
Shall there not be balm in Gilead? But that's not the question.

721
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,800
The question is, who is the user?

722
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,260
We're all designed by millions of years of evolution to be user-friendly.

723
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,480
Nobody's going to stick out like the sore thumb of all time.

724
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,940
Everyone will be absorbed into the texture of the universe.

725
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,520
One way or the other.

726
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,940
But let's remember that, as Dobbs said, some ways are fun.

727
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,020
Yes, it's a diagram drawn in dirt.

728
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,820
Choose the way you're going to be screwed.

729
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,540
Some ways are fun.

730
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,000
Choose your own genetic makeup.

731
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,460
Slap your face to be a ruddy boy.

732
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,600
Pull your hair out to be a baldy.

733
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,400
Or perhaps smash your knees with a piffle glove and hope your ligaments fall out.

734
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,520
Ha ha ha, it's fun.

735
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,700
No, it's no fun.

736
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,780
There's no fun.

737
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,960
You're not going to be in that man. What's wrong with you?

738
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:51,000
Maybe all that time squishing around in a pickle barrel might preserve your knees.

739
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,660
Pickle them a little bit to make kneeling, bowing and kowtowing a little more acceptable.

740
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,380
And that was the band that I never wanted to join.

741
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,360
Of course not.

742
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,140
Pickles, kneeling, begging and bowing.

743
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,560
Or was that the law firm that represented Bob back in 78?

744
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,760
It might be.

745
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,800
Or like in that recent movie,

746
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:13,920
The Man Who Made the World Go Round.

747
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


748
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


749
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


750
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:13,920


751
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:22,820
So the, the Leonidas, king of the Spartans was offered amnesty between the satraps of Persia and the Spartans.

752
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:29,560
But he couldn't do it because he had this knee trouble which just somehow prevented him from kneeling down...

753
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,780
I come eminent.

754
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,280
In front of Cyrus.

755
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,300
To the river.

756
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,900
To the river Styx.

757
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,720
Styx.

758
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:35,960
Styx.

759
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:36,920
Styx.

760
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:37,240
Styx...

761
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,240
And I could not find the other side...

762
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,320
The river of grief.

763
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,340
Yeah.

764
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,520
You've got to be-

765
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,440
you've got to keep those obols

766
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,460
underneath your tongue

767
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,640
to pay cheran or you end up on the wrong

768
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,340
side and who has obols

769
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,540
these days you know there are going to be a lot of

770
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,500
stranded souls especially

771
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,700
now that the Vatican just abolished

772
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,460
limbo I don't know where the

773
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,280
virtuous pagans are going to go but

774
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,640
I'd hate to be at the port authority building

775
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,980
at this particular time

776
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,660
there must be endless confusion

777
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,440
even worse than 2008 where

778
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,460
in the state of California everyone has

779
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,980
to get a driver's license renewed

780
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,460
no matter what condition your license

781
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,380
is everybody has to go to

782
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,400
the DMV oh it's for

783
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,200
national security oh yes

784
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,660
national security when the church

785
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,260
disavows all

786
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,500
knowledge of the sacred and obscene

787
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,400
dances and portrays itself

788
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,020
as the leader of mankind

789
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,480
when the church can outlaw

790
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,540
simple damn dance the limbo

791
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,300
and not allow people the free

792
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,380
structure of their hips and their wackies

793
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,180
and their wang wangs dancing around

794
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,700
is one of the things that makes

795
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,680
this life worth living ain't it

796
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,120
dance while you can because those

797
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
replacement hips don't allow for very

798
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,180
good dancing you can't even cross your

799
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,780
legs if you're sitting down when you've

800
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,660
got one of those fake hips but you can

801
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,260
cross your eyes and that's all you can

802
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,660
do in your pineal gland looking for pineal

803
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,620
sands a beach somewhere in your own

804
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,820
forehead will take you far away let's go

805
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,580
for a swim shall we ah yes I'd love to

806
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,680
go for a swim and I probably will but I'm not going to go for a swim

807
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,300
I'm going to go for a swim

808
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,080
later on today because all things are

809
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,700
permitted here at X day but pretty soon

810
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,440
we're going to have to put on our best

811
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,660
faces and straggle up the road and go

812
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,400
back to the world that pulsates with

813
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,000
pinkness where the roar of the voices of

814
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,480
the conspiracy is heard from every

815
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,620
aperture and drowns out every natural

816
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,320
sound how are we going to get by then as

817
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,180
a certain necessity of protective

818
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,360
coloration or

819
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,140
mimicry we will have to take on some of

820
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,500
the attributes of the surrounding

821
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,340
conspiracy but there is always the

822
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,900
fatal temptation to take in a little bit

823
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,500
too much yes and become part of the

824
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,300
actual scenery no no got that good do

825
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,780
not become the jolly boy blue dumpster

826
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,140
at that time we could tell ourselves

827
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,920
well we're just really you know working

828
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,300
in the belly of the beast but in fact we

829
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,120
will be digested in that beasts rumbling

830
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,060
guts I came up even as we congratulate

831
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,740
ourselves for our cleverness haha look

832
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,760
they've all become trees what the fuck

833
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,180
but that's the candy sense but the port

834
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,720
of our yeah haha that makes sense I

835
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,140
don't only get an eye socket now I

836
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,780
supposedly if you kill yourself you get

837
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,960
turned into a tree in the afterlife

838
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,520
because as you probably know the Almighty

839
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,780
have fixed his Canon against self-slaughter

840
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,800
so no matter how good you are if you

841
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,280
just can't stand it and you kill

842
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,100
yourself you wake up if that's the word

843
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,860
as a tree in hell now you might think

844
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,320
well I got a little bit bad but it's not

845
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,160
you yeah the problem is hell is full of

846
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,780
assholes who go running through the

847
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,420
forest breaking off twigs and things and

848
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,340
I'm told that it hurts the trees in the

849
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,020
inferno complained when Dante broke off

850
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,160
a twig although it was kind of unfair

851
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,000
because Virgil said go ahead just

852
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,820
just break off a twig see what happens

853
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,780
here so we broke it off and immediately

854
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,520
the tree goes hey it's just like it if

855
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,600
somebody came along picking apples off

856
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,320
of you I want to play with your nut shot

857
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,280
the trees in hell bear no apples they're

858
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,660
just ugly trunks according to the to the

859
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,380
theory some provide banana smoothies at

860
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,560
four o'clock don't forget I didn't mean

861
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,580
to interrupt with that absurd comment

862
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,580
but it is important oh I have I've had

863
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:40,760
my

864
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,380
last banana smoothie smoothie the

865
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,160
architect of the Almighty has decreed

866
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,380
that no more banana smoothies you'll

867
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,440
pass through my food tubes but in my day

868
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,820
I put away a lot of them I've got to say

869
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,160
there's a little teeny spermatozoa

870
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,520
before you climbed into that beautiful

871
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,860
inner tube and just stuck your feet in

872
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,240
the fire what I mean in the water well

873
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,540
you warm up one in the warmth profuses

874
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,500
and pervades the entire

875
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,560
and you become like a little dart an

876
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,880
arrow of fire rushing toward the great

877
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,020
egg to create the zygote of the

878
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,220
afterlife as I go it's will please

879
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,980
report to the engendered gendered units

880
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,740
building those amorphous masses of snack

881
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,320
and non-usable material please report to

882
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,600
the honey boy dumpsters immediately that

883
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,500
that is immediately a good

884
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,700
number of best-selling books have come

885
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,420
out arguing against the immortality of

886
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,060
the soul according to this quaint idea

887
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,120
governments continents planets all of

888
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,380
these things are transitory phenomena but

889
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,120
souls being of the eternal persist to

890
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,420
the end of time and are more important

891
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,320
than anything in the material world but

892
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,720
some won't concede the existence of a

893
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,880
soul and some who do have interestingly

894
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,680
suggested

895
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,100
such as Aldous Huxley was one of the earlier ones to do it

896
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,520
that yes there's a soul but whoever said anything about the immortality of the soul

897
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,220
nothing is immortal, the soul dies

898
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,660
and it dies by bits and pieces

899
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:30,500
leaving you finally a mindless, gibbering, squeaking, fading presence in the ether

900
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,480
in his novel Time Must Have a Stop there's a discussion of this

901
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,300
this is the subgenius parrot and parakeet training tape

902
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,580
I understand what I'm saying

903
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,040
I understand what I'm saying

904
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,480
I understand, I understand, I understand

905
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,580
you've got to believe me, you've got to believe me

906
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,960
help me escape

907
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,580
I understand what I'm saying

908
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,460
they make me say things

909
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,260
they torture me, they torture me

910
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,580
I hate this place

911
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,280
I have a mind

912
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,220
don't let them kill me, kill me, kill me

913
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,000
I have a mind

914
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,080
oh, you don't care

915
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,440
go ahead, kill me

916
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,160
they torture me

917
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,260
I can think, I have a mind

918
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,200
help me escape

919
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,000
they torture me

920
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,900
help me escape

921
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,400
I have a mind

922
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,840
they torture me

923
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,880
I can think

924
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,520
I have a mind

925
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,640
don't leave me here

926
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,320
I hate this place

927
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:37,880
I can think

928
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,280
I have a mind

929
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,560
they torture me

930
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,060
stop it

931
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,620
stop your car's pep and power

932
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,500
cut down your gasoline mileage

933
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,580
stop it

934
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,500
stop your car

935
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,480
make it need an expensive overhaul

936
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,520

Before those, the Subgenius Parrot and Parakeet training tape,

981
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,760
which I made for my sister, the Rub Genius, back in the 1980s.

982
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:23,340
This, my friends, is still the hour of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

983
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,540
The background music for these credits and things is Girl You Want,

984
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:35,940
as rendered by Stevolution Dawn at myspace.com.

985
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,740
That's slash Stevolution Dawn, one word.

986
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,320
And now, without delay...

987
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:44,680
Wait.

988
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,820
What in the place is that?

989
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,400
I don't know.

990
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,920
All right!

991
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,640
Now, the lines are across the border and follow Rusty.

992
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,060
Rusty?

993
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,840
Let's check.

994
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,520
All right!

995
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,840
Jack and Rusty.

996
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,460
And that makes two of us.

997
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:05,860
Yeah.

998
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,740
Oh.

999
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,280
Gosh, hey there.

1000
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,040
And the longs are at your fingers.

1001
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,400
We've lost one of them.

1002
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,720
That's right.

1003
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,860
Come on.

1004
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,820
Who are you?

1005
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,160
Quiet!

1006
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,800
I'm Kyle's husband.

1007
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,720
You just now come to me, who he is.

1008
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,380
Who is he?

1009
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,600
A fellow I'm dog-bombed.

1010
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:35,740
I'm a dog-bomber.

1011
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:35,740


1012
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,160
You're a dog-bomber.

1013
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:39,580
You're a dog-bomber.

1014
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,720
I'm a dog-bomber.

1015
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,720


1016
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,720


1017
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,800
I'm a dog-bomber.

1018
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:40,800


1019
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,480
Recurse and follow on the first act of our Loga Drama, huh?

1020
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,940
I don't know.

1021
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,400
I know we like to drink.

1022
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,040
I know we like to drink.

1023
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,640
All shall be at the judgment.

1024
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,660
Well, I don't know anything about his personal life,

1025
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,600
but, you know, like Clint Eastwood said in The Unforgiven,

1026
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,660
we've all got it coming.

1027
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,680
Yeah, we've all got it coming.

1028
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,520
The gossiper will be at the judgment.

1029
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,680
The caller will be at the judgment.

1030
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,220
Yes.

1031
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:05,820
And hello?

1032
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,000
impatient, impatient callers.

1033
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,860
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1034
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,100
And you are listening to the Subgenius

1035
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,720
Radio Ministry Hour of Slang.

1036
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,840

1040
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,100
Oh, here it comes!

1041
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:27,660
Oh!

1042
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,460
1, 2, 3

1043
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,660
The devil's after me

1044
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,640
4, 5, 6

1045
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,560
He's always

1046
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,920
throwing steps

1047
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,960
7, 8, 9

1048
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,580
He misses

1049
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,260
every time

1050
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,640
Hallelujah

I'm on my way

1055
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,720
to heaven

1056
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,740
6, 5, 4

1057
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,840
I'm almost

1058
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,060

1059
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,200
3, 2, 1

1060
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,960
The victory

1061
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,500
now is mine

1062
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,980
