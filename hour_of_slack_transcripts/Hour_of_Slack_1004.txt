From PR News in Washington, I'm skeptical of PR News in Washington.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former CIA Director George Tenet have been jailed outside of China.
Lawyers will be illegal.
It's not clear if 20 political parties in Mozambique raised Span again.
President Bush has been thrown out by a judge.
The ruling effectively overturns presidential elections.
He has been sharply criticized for the nation's highest civilian honor.
On Wall Street, 52, 690, 14, 21, 6, 12 of 2, 62, 5.
Notice. Cleveland.
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her.
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mm-hmm.
Gee, it must be great riding with him.
Is he picking you up after school today?
Mm-mm.
By the way, where'd you go?
Freedom.
I met him at the candy store.
Turned around and smiled at me.
You get the picture?
Yes, we do.
That's when I fell for...
The self-genius.
Our own.
What?
Look out, look out, look out, look out!
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg!
Egg, egg, egg, egg, egg!
Ooh!
Join us now for the Bob Hour, coming to you from the campus.
Bob.
Following the introduction by Bob, we'll hear a message preached by Bob.
The title of his message is...
I...
Kane.
I'm dumb. I'm not very bright, but I sure have tried.
I've done my best.
More money, more propaganda, more and more nudity, more and more filth, more and more homosexuality.
After these things, the temptations due largely to television.
Repression.
The entertainment industry is perfectly absurd and shallow and vicious.
Rubbish.
It's not hilarious.
Now, this week, the devil's gonna come if he can.
And he cried,
Look, look, the flesh.
The lust of the flesh.
Pornography.
Rock music.
It moved me almost to come.
And suddenly, you've been overcome by temptation.
Rock music gives you a kick.
It's excitement.
The thrill of seeing your mother made happy by the violence in this country.
Now, what does that mean?
I'll do this and do that and do the other for you.
Well, you don't go for that.
Make up your mind, young people.
After these things, that very hard thing just made me come.
It's the joy that comes from being out for a night on the town.
Firm? Come.
Throw up.
But do you think that lasted long?
That would be presumptuous of us.
Coming to you from the campus of Bob.
Send a check. Send a check. Send a check. Send a check.
Rock music.

Rock music.
I dance every weekend.
Rock music.
Black music.
Come on now.
Well, that's what I said, slacks
I'm the cat's pajama
So I'll run around with crazy little mama
Well, the girls all look wonderful
When I go by, slacks
I wear red bow tie, slacks
They say me on my slacks
With a cat chained down to my knees
I ain't nothing but a real cougar
Slacks, brrr, slacks

Jesus, help me.
Damn it, Doug.
Put that gun away.
Put that gun away.
You're already in so much trouble.
Doug.
Listen, I don't know anything.
Will you just get that through your...
Doug, are you crazy?
Who are you?
Doug.
Oh, God.
Very good, Dennis.
You're going to be all right.
Very good.
What other people talk about, I make reality.
My head feels like it's been in a blender.
Talk to me.
It's my brain.
It's not theirs.
You better cool it.
This is coming to you from the Bertling Sons and Daughters of Steam and Electricity's
Home for the Unreasonably Sane.
I think we got it, guys.
Are you ready?
Thank you.
I'm going to do this one sitting down, I guess, because I broke my toe last week.
Oh.
And I don't want to spend the whole thing standing up.
Normally, I have a pulpit and everything.
I was sitting at my desk chewing some gum, and I got up and walked across the room.
And I stubbed my toe, really, was all I did.
I don't ever try to do two things at once like this.
When it first happened, it was my little toe and my right foot, and it was bent out of
shape like that.
But it didn't hurt.
It just was numb.
But I kind of got my sock and shoe back on over it, and about two hours later, I heard
a snap and felt a horrid pain, much worse than the actual stubbing.
And at that moment, the veil of maya and illusion fell from my eyes, and I was here now.
I were there then at the time.
I was truly experiencing the now moment.
When that bone snapped back into place and all the nerves, the pain came back.
Praise God.
Oh, man.
It was like enlightenment, you know.
You knew what was real at that moment when you heard the bone snap.
And so now my little toe is taped up to its healthy brother.
It's funny.
I got on the internet.
I didn't want to go to Saturday morning.
I didn't want to go to the doctor.
And I got on the internet to look up broken toe.
And it said instructions for doctors that said, you go ahead and x-ray the toe because
it'll make the patient feel better.
There's no real reason to do that because they're all the same.
And I had luckily already had a broken toe on the same foot.
So it's a fad down there, I guess.
And that was from Winter Star Symposium, the winter version of Starwood.
Oh, yes.
Yes, deaf friends.
Here at Hour of Slack number 1004, we're catching up to our schedule by pausing in our feverish
editing of recordings from 8X Day Drill and simply leaning on our beloved and dependable
contributors, the great Fernanda Nandi-Lemur and Reverend Norel Preff, heard playing guitar
in the background and as just heard in all of our opening.
And I'm sure you'll be surprised to learn that we're actually recording this show.


Because these two artists specialize in bashing opposite sides of the Janus-faced conspiracy.
And so the theme of this show is the conspiracy.
It's a pretty frequent theme on the Hour of Slack.
It's about every fifth show.
But don't worry, it's not all preaching, friends.
We have some new music by a band called the Psychoskeletons.
You'll love that.
And others.
And others.
And lots of hate.
And heck, from Radio Synesthesia.
Plus, more Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummon from live at 8X Day.
But first...
America's more affordable than ever.
Just $19.
Now you can get the all-new, powerful, strong, sexy, affordable, great, easy, real, extreme,
simple, unrivaled, effective, special.
No money down today.
I love you, little boy.
Really?
Well, I love you.
Really?
America was declared unconstitutional.
Cool.
Cool.
America's so completely eradicated, it's a crime because of the phrase.
All right.
Folks cared about the phrase.
All right.
Whoa.
America.
Oh, man.
All right.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.
How?
Whenever we wanted money.
Could this be America's future?
Really?
It could.
Cool.
Go to money.

Let's make the erratic history.

Devil, do the rest.
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band at 8X Day.
Just a little clip.
Before that, Norrell Preff and Lee Murr.
I've got a lot of tweaking and remixing to do on the 8X Day band recordings.
The Amino Acids, Impaired Document, and the rest of Dave's concert are for future Earth shows.
We were hoping not to have any more of those, but, you know, might as well make the best of it.
Anyway, here's some collegiastices, or collegiostices, whatever, from Mr. Fernand and Andy Lee Murr,
and also from NorrellPreff.com.
Man, euthanasian, euthanasian, euthanasian, coming soon.
We're all a bunch of familiar with gay marriage.
Maybe, maybe, gay marriage, gay marriage.

You keep pushing, you keep pushing, pretty viciously.
Is that true? Are you pushing?
I keep pushing, I keep pushing.
Hack, hack, hack.
You're just a flack for the Bush administration.

No, no, witch hunt.
You're pushing, pushing, pushing, Bush, pushing, Bush.
Hack, Bush, hack.
I think you're corrupt, just corrupt.
Down the line, pretty viciously.

Go ahead.
Oh, laugh, oh, go ahead.
Oh, laugh, laugh, laugh.

Oh, laugh.
Call me crazy, call me crazy.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I was wrong, was wrong.

From PR News in Washington, I'm wounded today when clashes broke out between Donald Rumsfeld and Israeli soldiers in Charleston, South Carolina.
Now, are a lot of people going to be killed?
You bet.
Killed for peaceful purposes only.
Industry analyst Trophy Lundberg says crude cost and price pump specs were found in PR's PR.
It took the form of screaming.
The BBC broke out during the demolition of some abandoned cottages there.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says,
There's been another big jump in defeating PR News in Washington.
Pobucker Child Brain Sandwich.
Ah, those were the days.
And they've outlawed that even in Texas.
No slack.
They make laws about everything.
But friends, as long as they can't define slack, they can't outlaw it.
They can outlaw various ways of, you know, false slack and lots of side paths to slack.
But since slack is different for each person,
they can't bottle it, they can't sell it, and they can't even outlaw it.
They can't outlaw your thought crimes.
I mean, they can outlaw them, but they can't detect your thought crimes yet.
Unfortunately, in their primitive reptile-brained ways,
they do know that something is going on, so they will scrutinize you all the more closely.
The more slack you get away with, the more irritable and angry they will be
until, from your stimulation, they may lash out on account.
And one has to be prepared to deal with this, the mindless primitive.
Monsters from their ids.
Laws from the monsters from their ids.
I know, but the last time I had a cop tear my car apart looking for dope,
which he never found, because he was a dumbass.
At the end of it, I said, he was apologizing to Jesus and me.
And I said, well, man, you know, the reason I really don't...


I don't like you rooting through my car is not so much the war on drugs aspect,
as I'm just tired of the government poking their nose into every little thing.
And this Memphis cop looked at me and said, well, I'm not the government.
And I didn't say anything to that.
And you could see the little gear click in his head where he went, oh, yeah, that's right.
I guess I sort of am.
Friends.
Government is whoever has the biggest gun pointed at your head.
But it's amazing that you could evangelize even in those circumstances.
I have tried to evangelize with police officers, and I've had a gun pulled on me in another.
Oh, yeah, what are you doing out at four in the morning?
Well, sir, we were at an all-night radio show and are driving back to this beach house where we're staying.
Radio show, huh?
What kind of rock and rollers?
Well, actually, sir, this is what we tell cops.
It's kind of a comedy thing.
You ever heard of Mad Magazine?
It goes, show me some of your comedy.
I said, well, it's like, okay.
And I started into a little, you haven't got enough slack.
The minute I did that, he actually pulled out his gun, said, turn around, put your hands on the car.
He was just looking.
He wanted so much an excuse to shoot a hippie.
You know, the problem is that he's a cop.
I didn't.
Yeah, if I had just said cunt, he would have shot me, and we'd be rich and famous now.
Could be.
You know, it's all propaganda.
They're everything throughout all of history is the conspiracy's attempt to discredit J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Prove it's not true.
Once again, I rest my case.
Case closed.
It's like the Kennedy assassination.
Sure, Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone killed John F. Kennedy.
But rich!
Lee Harvey Oswald.
I know nothing.
Nothing.
So, I want pieces of this money.
Yeah, well, just...
Run for office.
You'll get lots of money.
You can have slush funds, hush money.
Just start a, just promise, you know, you'll institute pro-business policies.
Go last on environmental protection and...
Could you imagine what would happen if I was in politics?
Actually, well, that's crap.
Sloth man for president.
Sloth man for governor of Cleveland.
I'm mayor of Cleveland.
But he can't.
He doesn't live in Cleveland proper.
Oh.
Well, Cleveland Heights, then.
I would move to Cleveland proper just so that I could run for mayor.
Actually, I've thought about that in the past.
I would move to the slummiest neighborhood.
The slummiest section.
And then just run for mayor.
Well, you think about this.
It might just work.
Thang has radio popularity once he gets his name out there and he starts saying,
Hi, I'm Reverend Ivan Thang.
Would you like to vote for me?
Are you talking about...
That is the dumbest idea in the universe, man.
That's what...
I'm the exact opposite kind of person.
Wow, that's great.
My way of dealing with the conspiracy is to live between the cracks...
Yeah, but just think how much damage you could do on the inside.
Between the walls.
Don't talk.
There's only so much damage you can do from inside the system.
The system is set up in a way to preserve itself.
Yeah, and the other half is done from the outside.
Yeah.
I can see that history is doomed to repeat itself infinitely.
Exactly.
That's why infinity is seen as a gigantic loopy thingy.
It's a Mobius strip.
The conspiracy has already figured out every idea you're ever going to have.
They already know not only what you're going to do, they know what you're going to think.
Yeah, but the funny part is, so do I.
Yeah.
No, only Bob knows, and you'll pay to know what you really think.
That's right, kid.
That's right-a.
That's a million dollars every time you exhale.
Feel better now, Bob?
Good luck is a science, and we have the formula.
Of course, I can't share it with you here in this commercial.
The original formula.
If you'll send off your money, I'll send it to you.
My 12-volume course.
Recipe 21.
Not sold in stores.
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.
And slack is subgenius.
We heard from some sin, radiosynesthesia, with sin, Dr. Sinister, and Reverend Rocknar,
and Reverend Oroboros Rex called in, and me-stang, and before that, Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrummond
at 8X Day just recently.
But now, for some current events commentary from Norell Preff.
Concerned about bad breath, bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad-bad breath, bad breath?

Sepulchers of a dead God.
And it's like, you know, what a waste of time to go to a church of a dead God.
God was alive and then he had a heart attack.
Nothing but metaphors.
Are you dogmatic?
And that's why.
The United States of America and Western civilization is going down the tubes.
Now we're going off www.whichflavorofglobalismdoyouwant.org.

Chat, Justin.
Only five minutes in the woods and you got one.
Great job.
I saw him coming.
You're going to put some meat in the freezer this year, I think.
I promised him a squirrel sandwich, and that is what he's going to get after school.
You've heard of tuna melts or patty melts.
Why not squirrel melts?
Well, this is Justin's squirrel.
It's a nice, young, tender squirrel, and we're going to start by poaching this.
I've got some simmering water.
He's kind of cute.
I'm going to put his little tender butt in there.
Now, when it's all done and cooled, you want to pick all the meat off the bone and shred it.
And I've got some already done here.
I've got probably about a cup, a cup and a half of meat.
Now, I'm adding pecans.
You can use, again, what kind of nut you like.
Cashews work really well, but I like pecans.
You know how squirrels like nuts.
And then to that, just add some mayo.
Stir that all around.
This makes a nice weekend snack, maybe while watching a football game, or you can take
it to a tailgate party.
We're just going to get these on some English muffins now.
Oh, and it smells good.
I'm sure this is good cold, too.
And there they are, squirrel melts.
These are really nutritious, tasty.
And they are going to be simply delicious.
I'm going to put them in the oven.
Perfecto.
Cheese is all nice and melted.
And the squirrel salad is all heated up.
Squirrel melts.
You must try them.

The next step, tyranny and oppression.
There is no higher calling than toppling government.
These are savage acts of violence.
Tyranny is hard.
We have made violence and bloodshed.
Violence and instability.
The work is hard.
Well, it has been difficult.
Our task is to complete the mission.
To complete the mission, we will continue to hunt down the political and military criminal elements.
Who live in their own United States.
In their own grim image of tyranny and oppression.
Our mission in Iraq is a serious mistake.
It's critical our strategy can be summed up this way.
Privileges of unchecked power.
Radicalism and terror.
Murder in the name of a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom.
Free societies are essentially corrupt and decadent.
This nation will fail.
Failed.
The American people work and fight.
Work and fight.
Urban combat.
They need additional skills.
So do I.
But we have a lot more work to do.
Campaign of murder and destruction.
Chemical and nuclear weapons programs.
Feed radicalism.
And ideologies of murder.
Misery and humiliation.
Murderous ideology.
When the history of this period is written, we'll be remembered as great ruthless killers.
Brutally oppressed.
Car bombers and assassins.
And by exporting terror.
America will not leave.
We intend to stay forever.
Terror. Terror. Terror.
The ultimate triumph over democracy.
We have more work to do.
Take innocent lives.
Desperate.
Evil is not confronted.
For a variety of reasons.
The United States.
Rejects tolerance.
And despises all dissent.

I thank you.

The return of the middle ages.
Once you become paranoid about a massive establishment of some sort that's trying to take over.
And if you happen to be NRA type people who feel oh my god the government is trying to
take our guns away from us.
They are some of the most poorly educated people in the world.
They got their education out of Flintstones.
The Flintstones.


Flintstones. So we're being run by a, you could say, a conspiracy of the dumb.
We've crippled our knowledge base, so people can bomb us any time they friggin' want to.
One nation under an ignorant god.
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.
Yes, friends, actually, we have a tape somewhere of a mentally ill man going on and on and on about how if you see a T at the end of a product, that means that it's satanic.
And if it has a C in a circle at the end on the product name, that also means it's satanic.
That means it's Christian.
No, seriously.
You know, Satanism is a Christian development.
You can't worship Satan without also taking on the whole baggage of Jesus and the apostles and the voice out of the whirlwind and all of that.
So you can't just have the fun of Satan.
You have to do the heavy lifting of the whole thing.
Dr. Held drew that face there on the screen.
I missed it there.
It was the anti-Bob, the reptile-faced anti-Bob image popped up there.
Well, I had a vision of the lost serpent men of Volusia, but fortunately I don't think they saw me.
Nonetheless, that night I limbed the face of anti-Bob, which is now on Dr. Drummond's T-shirt, and I don't get royalty won.
But there it is.
The face from my vision.
Which I seem...
I began to see as though it were in the room with me and I were forced to smell the foul sourness of its sibilant breath as it whispered sinful secrets.
I'll take a bath in the morning, I promise.
Too late.
There won't be much time for that.
You'd better do it tonight.
Yeah, you're probably right.
At least, yeah, at least I'll be clean.

He was the biggest one of mechanic in this whole galaxy.
He wanted to be boss.
That's right.
He could take a spaceship and strip it down to the hell of parts within 27 milliseconds.
That's right.
And she couldn't tell whether it was either there or it wasn't there.
And that's something I just don't understand.
How could it either be there or it wasn't there?
Why isn't there any of it clean?
Well, that's what we call escaping from those cotonic laws.
Yes, escaping from laws.
Is that what you're applying?
Is that what you're applying?
You can escape velocity, but not the need for it.
I suppose it's just as well.
You don't feel the same way.

Dr. Howell's

eye.
Not to be confused with the third nostril,
which is actually located
in a different spot on each subgenius.
I've been interested
to watch people go, oh yeah, it's right here in my third nostril.
Now point to where the third eye, everybody knows your third eye
is this pineal gland back in here.
But your third nostril can actually, on unlucky subgeniuses,
it can be located near the sole in the foot.
And I mean the S-O-U-L part of the foot, not the S-O-L-E part.
It's just such a weird coincidence that both of those organs
have the same sound to their name and are located in similar positions.
But not accidental.
Maybe not.
To say a coincidence occurs only means that two things happen to take place at the same time.
But it doesn't explain why that might be.
And it's our job to look for these connections.
Yes, actually the word coincidence does explain why.
It's why we find them so profoundly,
so profoundly meaningful.
Because we know that they happened twice on the same day.
Hints for one.
Tiny hints designed to make us more kook-like all the time.
So that we can be more like Bob.
And less complacent and content, thinking that everything is okay.
You know there's an enormous industry in this nation
that is churning out day after day at the cost of billions of dollars
the sense of meaning.
But here we are, in 1980,

So, did anybody see that movie, what the bleep, did we know?
You know, that was supposed to be a feel-good movie, right?
It made me feel like puking the whole damn movie.
I have a problem with the connect, you can make these marvelous connections
between quantum physics and mathematics and sappy mysticism.
Those are the connections that aren't there that I was talking about.
But there was a great line in that movie where this one guy was,
he was one of their main pontificators, and he said,
if thoughts can do that to water, think what they can do to you.
What's a big if?
Because thoughts can't do shit to water.
There was this nice routine, this is where I had trouble with,
I started, the movie became a comedy from that point on.
Japanese scientist artist who photographs water crystals,
and if they had love vibes beamed at them, they look like snowflakes,
but if you think mean thoughts at them, they look like a bad Photoshop filter.
Kind of big if.
They look like, water looks like pee if you think bad vibes at it.
So that movie was kind of put together by the Ramtha people.
And Ramtha is a channeler, one of the more famous channelers from the day.
She's getting on in years.
Well, she's a 50,000 year old caveman who speaks through this soft teague blonde
with a lot of makeup on.
And a really good sense of how to play the camera.
After 50,000 years of being a caveman,
you can play to the camera through your channeler really well.
I don't know, friend.
I'm an optimistic person, but I'm afraid sometimes that
dipshit science and new age religion can cause as much brain damage as cable television.
Or, you know, TV.
Or, uh, hard drugs.
Yeah.
Turok, Son of Stone.
Do you remember Turok, Son of Stone?
Oh, never mind.
Oh, I've probably, you know, Turok, Son of Stone was one of the most influential works of literature in my childhood.
Along with Carson of Venus and Carter of Mars or something, right?
Well, those were, John Carter of Mars were books by Edgar Rice Burroughs,
but Turok, Son of Stone were Dell comic books, I think.
Or were they Gold Key?
You liked all that Fortean crap, right?
God, it was, well, it was Indians in dinosaur land.
Yeah, I thought that was cool.
Two cool plains Indians.
I don't know if they were Cheyenne or Comanche or Sioux or what,
but they were some kind of plains tribe and they had wandered into dinosaur land.
Sort of like Land of the Lost, but a lot cooler,
because Turok and his young friend, Andar, were, uh, they were Indians, so they were cool.
Mm-hmm.
And the dinosaur, they called dinosaurs honkers, if you recall.
Honkers.
Well, Steve, now, in the, in the, what era was it that African Americans called white people that?
That, no, those, that was honkeys.
And they say that we're dinosaurs cultural.
And that was the 70s and 80s.
No, me, I am.
No, late 60s.
It kind of went out of style.
Style.
I was last called a honkey on an Indian reservation.
I thought the guy was said, I didn't understand what the word meant,
and I thought he was saying they were dinosaurs.
Right.
And I thought he was gonna laugh.
I thought it was funny.
Yeah, and we stuck you for a triceratops.
Or a steg.
Yep.
No, I'm, uh, but, uh,
Robo-knivin' steg.
Should we be using the public airwaves to talk about comic books that only people over 50 remember?
Uh, and have them open, I thought about in 25 years.
Should is a word I don't like to use.
These are class-based books that everyone over the age of five should know.
If they want to learn Walt Whitman, why not start with Turok?
Well, yeah.
Should is a word I don't like to use.
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.
I, for, I could have looked at the Walt Whitman book, but I liked Turok better.
It had dinosaurs.
Well, what about other aspects of 19th century culture we want to preserve and force down everybody's neck?
Pornography.
Huh?
Their pornography.
We need to preserve the porno of the 650s, 60s, 70s.
Two guys, macho-style Indians, hunting honkers together.
Yeah.
Woo-woo, you know, that kind of thing.
Jempt.
Buff.
Uh.
Betty Page.
Uh, dude, those need to be preserved.
Jugs, bare assets, leg show, barely 18.
All these must be preserved.
You know, these are, these are, these are parts of our culture that are, that will be, that are timeless, really.
