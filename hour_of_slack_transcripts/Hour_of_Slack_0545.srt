1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Oh, I never should have eaten all that chorizo this morning, but we'll just tune the show in and

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,620
let's see if we can get the show online.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,940
They changed the area codes here. All right.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:26,580
We'll connect. Good, it picked up. And it's establishing contact.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,740
Contact. Yes, I can hear the show.

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,120
Connecting. Establishing communication.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, we have, I think, a successful show is now online.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,340
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

9
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,180
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,520
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

11
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,080
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:11,960
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

13
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,320
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

14
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,760
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

15
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,960
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

16
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,640
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

17
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,540
Slave Planet, dear friends, by Radio Alarm Clock from 1967.

18
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,420
Well, actually, friends, Radio Alarm Clock.

19
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,600
just like Strawberry Alarm Clock, only it's Radio Alarm Clock.

20
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,760
That's what now is Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,700
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith were in Radio Alarm Clock,

22
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,420
and that's what's also playing here in the background.

23
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,940
It's an LP, an old LP record that they did, I don't know how long ago,

24
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,260
but listen to this mighty Western-style,

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,460
Avengers-inspired music in the background.

26
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,220
I should shut up, but I won't, because I say instead, friends,

27
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,220
ahem, sir, yes, yes, I say ahem, sir,

28
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,280
and because what a show we have today, tonight, whatever it is.

29
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,220
I'm the guy that's got the radio show on the college station.

30
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,780
I've got some legal documents, guy.

31
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,060
I have a right to Joe Offred.

32
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,560
I got the ESO.

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,020
I...

34
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,840
The cops in Euclid know I have a deadly tabin needle.

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
I've got the John Bartles.

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,140
I've got the mockery and perversion,

37
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,520
and the school district in Euclid gives me the right to have KPFA

38
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,100
and special Dr. Legume tapes.

39
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,220
I've got a deal with the Greys, and I've got the Purple.

40
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,220
I've got double-spaced negative.

41
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,860
I've got a reverse grip lock on the Dobbs head.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,580
I've got the...

43
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,800
Trademark, and I've got the ahem, sir, if you know what I mean.

44
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,300
I'm a privacy case, so we're going to have to talk quietly about that,

45
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,500
but yes, friends, it's true.

46
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,320
It's true, and perhaps wonderful or terrible, I don't know.

47
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,360
We're going to have a Joe Offred special thing.

48
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,720
I think I'll save it for the climax of the show.

49
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,220
I got a tape in from a news station carrying the hour of slack.

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Now, where is that?

51
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,460
Dr. Legume.

52
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,340
Dr. Legume on the Prozac Free radio show a couple of weeks ago,

53
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,680
and they did some call-ins, friends,

54
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,780
and I swear Dr. Legume does the greatest preaching

55
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,080
and funniest preaching job of his career.

56
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,480
The ahem, sir.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,100
The sheer ahem, sir.

58
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,500
It will justify anything, my friends.

59
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,360
It does literally justify anything.

60
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,160
The, uh, the, not just the hints, but the full gospel.

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,100
So, uh, hopefully that catches you up on the news here of the church,

62
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,020
of the subgenius.

63
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,440
Now, let's just listen to this instrumental take us out into some other thing.

64
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
We know not what.

65
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:52,900
Yeah, talk.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,720
Uh-uh.

67
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,060
Uh-huh.

68
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,840
Uh-huh.

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:57,840


70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,440


71
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,100
Uh-huh.

72
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,360
Uh-huh.

73
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,200
Uh-huh.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,340
Uh-huh.

75
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
Uh-huh.

76
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Uh-huh.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:05,640


78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,080
Uh-huh.

79
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,880
Uh-huh.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Uh-huh.

81
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,240


82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,440
Uh-huh.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,600
Uh-huh.

84
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Uh-huh.

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,700
Uh-huh.

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Ooh, yes, very ESO-like indeed, dear friends.

87
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,120
I better pull that old turntable down and...

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
Shut it, guys.

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
These headphones won't even let me reach over to the old turntable.

90
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes, we occasionally use a turntable in this Tarzan's radio station.

91
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:49,440
My kids get after me sometimes because I refer to CDs as records.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,040
Records. They think that that's really old age and embarrassing.

93
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,840
And if I call them albums, they even get mad.

94
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,600
To them, an album is an old black vinyl disc that doesn't play on anything anymore.

95
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,060
But, hey, man, they're all little flat circular things.

96
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,660
They spin around and noises come out.

97
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,320
What is this noise in the background?

98
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,580
Friends, I do have to...

99
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,380
Oh, it's...

100
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,240
It's not the mellow moods of...

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
Oh, it's Cosmic...

102
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
The Cosmic Cats or Cosmic Factory or Cosmic Triad.

103
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,020
Cosmicking out back there.

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,480
Friends, I have a little bit of news.

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:36,520
This is an article posted in September in the Times Journal of London, Ontario.

106
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,780
Oh, excuse me.

107
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,780
That...

108
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,580
You never know what you're going to get when you stick one of these tapes in.

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,980
I suppose I could plan this show or something like that, but wouldn't that be...

110
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,140
Oh.

111
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,900
I don't know what this is, but it sounds sort of promising.

112
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,480
Okay, it's wild.

113
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,400
It's wacky.

114
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,000
It's Bob.

115
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,660
This is a real news item that was in a newspaper in Canada.

116
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,300
Organizers are expecting as many as 200 teens who attend St. Thomas and area evangelical churches

117
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:16,300
to be at Bob or Battle of Believers, a fun time of zany activities this weekend at Camp Fimkin.

118
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,840
Large group activities will rule.

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,180
Saturday afternoon says Faith Baptist Church youth pastor Scott Brush.

120
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,880
But there's more to Bob than may first meet the eye.

121
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,960
The Elgin Christian Youth Network event, sponsored by local businesses,

122
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,000
is also geared to encourage young Christians to look around to see where they may be needed.

123
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,580
It's to encourage Christian kids to stand up and be bold about their faith, says Brush.

124
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,460
Excuse me, friends.

125
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,940
I'm going to check.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,800
Let's go back to the old standbys.

127
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,040
You know, and the Bob participants, it says here in this serious newspaper article,

128
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:06,820
will get their spiritual batteries recharged through praise and worship,

129
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:16,560
guest speaker Brad Ringer, an inner city youth ministry leader, said from Buffalo, New York.

130
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,060
Well, friends.

131
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,740
And the local businesses donated $2,000 to Bob because Bob is going to save

132
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:32,300
and recharge the spiritual batteries of those young Christian youths.

133
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,120
My friends, but I want you to know something very important that you must face,

134
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,480
and that is that the subgeniuses have been watching you, Americans.

135
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,600
Yes, waiting.

136
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,900
And planning and training with the most grim and terrible purpose.

137
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,140
But here and there, oh, comedy, certainly to lift our spirits, as the liberal media declares.

138
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,540
The subgeniuses, oh, the subgeniuses, says the liberal media, are all washed up.

139
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,080
Oh, out-of-date cavemen, gun nuts, nuts, they call us.

140
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,580
Then we think about your hateful slanders, Americans,

141
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,680
and they shall play upon our lips as we introduce the bureaucratic infidels

142
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,880
to their duly appointed rendezvous with eternal torture.

143
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,480
Oh, so Bob is out-of-date, huh?

144
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,320
When your own pink media reports over half of Americans believe the biblical book of the subgenius end times

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,700
shall befall this generation?

146
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:47,340
Oh, practice your weeping, Americans, for this shall be the plague wherewith Bob will smite all the people

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,740
who have fought against Jerusalem and Dallas.

148
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,520
Their feet shall consume away while they stand upon their feet.

149
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,940
Listen up, you evolutionists, bureaucrats, peaceniks.

150
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,880
And their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongues shall consume away in their mouths.

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,000
Zechariah 14, 12.

152
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
The Lord is sore displeased.

153
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,060
The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly despoiled, for the Lord hath spoken his word.

154
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,520
Isaiah 24, 3.

155
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,320
True subgeniuses have real faith.

156
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,720
Family values, my friends.

157
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,620
They do not abandon their issue to socialist daycare indoctrination robot scarecrow setters.

158
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,140
Oh, practice your weeping, Americans, Christians.

159
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:40,420
The school prayer ruling by the satanic mind-control Frankenstein puppet Supreme Court?

160
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,680
Oh, go ahead, sure.

161
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,700
This is but the final insult to Dobbs.

162
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,660
This...

163
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,820
This nation hath known naught but chaos and piqueness since Lincoln, upon orders from his Masonic masters,

164
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:05,920
did most illegally, unconstitutionally, and immorally in rendering void with but a stroke of his bloody pen the private property of patriots.

165
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:14,260
This indeed was the wake-up call for the book of the subgenius believing subgeni.

166
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,880
This was the natural order.

167
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,560
This was the first time the world had ever been converted.

168
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,380
Bob's plan mocked.

169
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,720
And ever since that infamous act, up has been called down.

170
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,600
Black has been called white.

171
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
Evil has been called good.

172
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:43,280
And the madness of orchestrated global war is only one more global war to go, praise Bob, with fearsome persecutions, till at last we greet the reign of the Prince of Slack, our savior.

173
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,440
Bob hath been plotting his most glorious vengeance.

174
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,780
Until now.

175
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,720
South Africa has fallen to the Communists, pledged its allegiance to the Dark One.

176
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,780
It is plain to all with but an ounce of liquor sense that we, we are next.

177
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,180
Some TV whore, choked with Jezebel hate, screeches,

178
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,180
I fear to live in a country with two hundred million guns.

179
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,620
You don't like it, harlot?

180
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,540
You can get the hell out.

181
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,420
Not that there will be anywhere safe to live.

182
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,560
You'll have to hide once the nukes start flying, pink boy.

183
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,940
Thus saith the Lord, behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you, Jeremiah 1911.

184
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:36,640
Satan's mighty armies, the armies of the pink, the armies of the Democrats, the armies of the Republicans, the armies of, yes, the Libertarians and the Peroninaitists,

185
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,660
staffed with moral degenerates, so-called Americans,

186
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,680
are arrayed against the subgenius patriots

187
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,980
as Bob instigates his one-world plot.

188
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,640
Praise Bob.

189
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
Have courage, subgeniuses.

190
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,880
The preordained conclusion to the revolution

191
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,200
is that none but the true subgeniuses across this planet shall remain unslain.

192
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,100
Only the subgenius shall remain unslain.

193
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,740
This planet, purged of filth,

194
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,360
of ungodliness, yes,

195
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,700
of anti-Dobbs,

196
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,620
psst,

197
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,460
hate,

198
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,900
half-assed, pinky-winky, normally hate,

199
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,860
the infidels all,

200
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:36,620
all shall be purged on that great day, X-Day, 1998, July 5th at 7 o'clock in the morning,

201
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,340
when those of us who have our subgenius membership cards in our pocket

202
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,620
will be ruptured up into power and glory upon the space vessels of the escaped goddesses.

203
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,500
Ah, yes, you've heard it so many times,

204
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,640
but, you know, I just love to remind the others,

205
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,560
because I know, subgeniuses, that there are others lurking, listening all the time.

206
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,140
Sure, they monitor us.

207
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,860
The other, the other hates us.

208
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,840
The other writhes in jealousy to hear us bespeak the glory,

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,520
the naked glory.

210
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,100
Of the word of Bob.

211
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
Oh, yeah, they're jealous.

212
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,020
They, and then, you know, funny thing is, at the same time,

213
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,200
they are just so sure that we're going to hell.

214
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm not so sure they're so sure about that, friends,

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,720
and I think you can hear, I'm gonna play this tape

216
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,920
of an amazing, a beautiful witnessing,

217
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,520
and some witlessnessing,

218
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:39,380
done, uh, as Dr. Legume guested on the Prozac Free Health Show there in beautiful Pennsylvania,

219
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,680
I think you're going to, uh,

220
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,820
I think you're gonna like this one, friends.

221
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
And braise, Pop.

222
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,940
91.7 WMUH Allentown.

223
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,580
Doing the work of the Lord.

224
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,040
Yes.

225
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,720
We're here to save your souls.

226
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,320
Friends, neighbors, brothers, sisters, yes, we are.

227
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,160
We can help you, and only we,

228
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,220
because only we,

229
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,520
are gifted with a divine perspective

230
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
to know that which is the word of the Lord,

231
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,700
and that which is blasphemy.

232
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,800
I sense it, children, that someone out there,

233
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
someone out there is disgruntled.

234
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,040
Someone out there is not quite happy.

235
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,680
Someone feels that we are doing wrong,

236
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
because they themselves are confused.

237
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,300
They know not what is the true word of the Lord,

238
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,500
they only know what they desire,

239
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,280
and desire, my friends,

240
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,300
is the quickest and surest path to hell.

241
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,120
So call us back, friends,

242
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,460
and call and get some of that salvation.

243
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,120
We will save you.

244
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,720
We will look beyond our petty differences,

245
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,580
and we will take you into the fold and heal you.

246
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,620
We will make you see with eyes of clarity

247
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,520
as clear as a summer brook

248
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,360
in which swim the fishes

249
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,000
which God has created

250
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,880
for your consumption.

251
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,760
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,

252
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,080
which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,

253
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,560
shall he not much more clothe you,

254
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,600
O ye of little faith?

255
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,520
Then he pointed his finger at Satan and said,

256
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,560
And I know you know the rules.

257
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,380
You've been twisting them to deceive my people for years.

258
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,440
Satan cried,

259
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,440
I'll kill you, Christ,

260
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,860
you and your people.

261
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:34,860


262
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:34,860


263
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:34,860


264
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,280
The demons wheezed.

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
Satan jeered.

266
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Jesus said,

267
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,980
Go ahead, make my day.

268
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,080
God the Father turned his head,

269
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,700
his tears announcing Christ was dead.

270
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,420
The ten count would proclaim,

271
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,100
the battle's end.

272
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,100
Then Satan trembled through his sweat,

273
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,380
an unexpected roar yet,

274
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,360
as God started to count by saying,

275
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,020
Ten.

276
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
Wait a minute, God.

277
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,640
Nine.

278
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,100
You're counting wrong.

279
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,700
Eight.

280
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
His eyes were closed.

281
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,700
Seven.

282
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
His fingers were twitching.

283
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,260
Six.

284
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,280
Was all his light coming from?

285
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,820
Seven.

286
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,400
He's alive!

287
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,880
I'm alive!

288
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,860
I'm alive!

289
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,980
Oh, my God!

290
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:33,980


291
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:33,980


292
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:33,980


293
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:33,980


294
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,080
He is.

295
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,820
He is.

296
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,460
That's one!

297
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,560
He is one!

298
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,080
He is alive!

299
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,520
Forevermore.

300
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,120
He is risen.

301
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,620
He is Lord!

302
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,200
He is one!

303
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,900
He is one!

304
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,080
He is alive!

305
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,640
Forevermore.

306
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,420
He is risen.

307
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,460
He is Lord!

308
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,120
He has won!

309
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,200


310
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,260
Forevermore.

311
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,260


312
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:01,260


313
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,240
He has won!

314
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:02,880


315
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,400
He has won!

316
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400


317
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:03,400

Hello.

Yes.

356
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,040
I believe you have something you'd like to say about Jesus tonight.

357
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,360
Well, Jesus, first of all, plays a very important role in my life.

358
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,240
And let me tell you something.

359
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,860
Jesus is so important to me that I gave my life to Jesus.

360
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,260
What does that mean to you, son?

361
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,340
Doesn't mean a damn thing to me, brother.

362
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:09,920
Why not?

363
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,660
Why should I care what you do with your life?

364
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,500
You know what?

365
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,060
That attitude doesn't get you anywhere in life.

366
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:27,320
I'm not a crackpot sitting at home on the radio trying to call up here and give honest, decent preachers a load of crap.

367
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,760
I just don't understand you, brothers, if that's why I can call you.

368
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,360
All right.

369
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,580
I can't take this.

370
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
You're playing me live on the radio.

371
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,220
I don't want this.

372
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,640
Oh, what's the matter, brother?

373
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,460
Isn't your faith in Jesus strong enough to keep you going?

374
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,080
It's there.

375
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,640
It's there.

376
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,440
Are you afraid?

377
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,780
Are you one of these Christian apologists who are afraid to tell everybody and defend their Jesus?

378
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,520
Let me tell you something about Jesus.

379
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,080
Don't even do that about Jesus.

380
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,180
I don't even want to say anything negative about Jesus.

381
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
What do you know of Jesus, you talking monkey?

382
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,580
Jesus?

383
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,540
Jesus saved me.

384
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,920
To the point where I was down in the dregs of society, hanging out with people like you.

385
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,320
Brother, you couldn't hang around with people like me.

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,580
Excuse me?

387
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,260
You couldn't hang around with people like me.

388
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,500
Oh, well, excuse me.

389
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,980
Well, come now.

390
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,400
Come on.

391
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:16,640
Come on.

392
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,840
Come on.

393
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:17,840


394
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:17,960
Come on.

395
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


396
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


397
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


398
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


399
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


400
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:17,960


401
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,480
Come on.

402
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,480


403
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,480


404
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,960
Tell me what I'm doing here that's so bad.

405
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,460
The blasphemous way you do Jesus, that's what you're doing so bad.

406
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,420
The blasphemous way I do Jesus?

407
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,380
You're doing Jesus right now.

408
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,000
That's right.

409
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,560
I'm doing Jesus right now.

410
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,260
This is incredible.

411
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,460
This is absolutely insane.

412
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,680
No more insane than you and your Jesus.

413
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,840
Your Jesus is just your invisible friend.

414
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,360
You grew up and gave him a name.

415
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,380
Your Jesus isn't the true Jesus.

416
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,100
Hmm.

417
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,800
I'm sorry, friend.

418
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,520
Sorry I can't help you.

419
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,380
I must sign off.

420
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, coward.

421
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,900
Oh, yes.

422
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,740
Oh.

423
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, brothers.

424
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,780
Could you believe the audacity of people who would actually call up here?

425
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,600
Oh, no.

426
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,900
He can't help us.

427
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,220
He cannot help us.

428
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,020
Brother Lagoon, he cannot help us because we help ourselves.

429
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes, we do.

430
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,700
With the strength of the Lord, we help ourselves.

431
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,020
We don't need no namby-pamby church to tell us what to do.

432
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,180
We know the Lord.

433
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,460
We fight with the Lord.

434
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,700
We drink with the Lord.

435
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,040
We are the Lord.

436
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,860
Yes, friends.

437
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,540
Right here.

438
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,140
Come in and kiss the feet of God, my friends.

439
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,040
Phone number 821-3456.

440
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:34,820
This is by doubt, by any definition, by any scoring method, this is an undoubted knockout

441
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,240
of unbelievable intensity.

442
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,340
Yes, the Reverend Dr. Kato Lagoon once again, once again, converting souls, saving the sinners,

443
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,860
saving them from themselves, saving them from us.

444
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,160
Because I don't have to prep with that gun.

445
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,440
But what I know is that the Lord is here to save this world, the world of the dead.

446
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,440


447
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,440


448
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,440


449
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,440


450
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,740
No.

451
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,200
You're my only God.

452
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,680
Yes.

453
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,680


454
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,680


455
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:53,680


456
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:00,620
What do you know of the true Jesus, you talking monkey?

457
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,500
Man, I gotta admit, the first time I heard that line I cracked up.

458
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,300
I laughed til I cried.

459
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,480
This goes against your most basic survival instinct.

460
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,140
But it can be done and terminated.

461
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,140


462
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,140


463
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,140


464
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,140


465
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,140


466
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:26,220
to an advantage. Let the love squirt out of you like a fire hose of molasses. Give him the kiss

467
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,640
of life. Stick your tongue down his throat. Taste what he's been eating and bless his digestion.

468
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,400
Ooze down into his intestines and help him along with his food. Let him know that you

469
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,040
rear his rectum as part of an ineffable whole. Make him understand that you stand and lick it

470
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,400
off his genitals as part of the master plan. Life in all its rich variety. Do not falter.

471
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,100
Let your love enter in unto him and penetrate him with the divine lubricant. Makes KY and Leland

472
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:08,760
feel like sandpaper. It's the most mucilaginous, the slimiest, ooziest lubricant there ever was or

473
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,640
shall be. Amen. And we've decided to send you this message

474
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,020
today. We're going to be talking about the divine lubricant. And we're going to be talking

475
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Ready for a Sunday Introductions

476
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,940
After the beginning, there's

477
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,340
a blessing that heaven has desired In imagem über alle Fac Sund $%l,

478
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Take what you've started and he's credit, the God's gift month avocado.

479
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:59,900
And I believe as you listen to this message that it will just bring such an amount of creative, exciting faith into thy being.

480
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,640
Of course, the word entheo, from enthusiasm, entheo means God in you.

481
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,160
Of course, God gets in us by his word.

482
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,500
We were fathered by the sperma of God's word, the seed of God's word.

483
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,280
We became a child of God, born again through this incorruptible seed.

484
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,480
Of course, faith comes by hearing, and really hearing what you've been hearing.

485
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,280
Through his names, his identifiable characteristics.

486
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,380
They really, he had not revealed himself up to this time.

487
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,620
You see, Dr. Lagoon, this is the kind of preaching our friend the caller listens to.

488
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,120
The kind of preaching that makes no sense.

489
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,380
Hey, that's right, brother.

490
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,860
Not even once.

491
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,060
Not during our broadcast.

492
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,460
Are we?

493
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,780
We asked anybody for money.

494
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,520
But I guess that's what makes a true Christian.

495
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,120
His willingness to part with both his mind, his soul, and his money.

496
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,620
Yes.

497
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,840
We will not ask you to part with your money.

498
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,300
But we will not deny it either.

499
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,860
Because thy, who tithe unto the Lord, shall be as though is the Lord.

500
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,620
Jesus has revealed himself to me from under the hem of his mighty raincoat.

501
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,100
Amen, brother.

502
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Amen.

503
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,940
Do we have any?

504
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,780
Do we have any Christians out there in the audience tonight who don't agree with us?

505
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,940
Do we have any of you false Christians out there who think that we're blaspheming because they don't agree with us?

506
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,860
Is there any out there who wish to kill us for our sin?

507
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,300
Hello?

508
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,300
WMUH.

509
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,560
You're speaking with Jesus.

510
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,540
Greater glory.

511
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
Glory to God.

512
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,900
Greater is he, speaking of God, that's in you.

513
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,020
Speaking of God who's in you.

514
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,800
He's in you.

515
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,500
He's really in you.

516
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,860
You may not be able to feel him.

517
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,780
Slowly.

518
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,480
Moving.

519
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,800
He's always kind of moving.

520
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,040
Oh, Father, let us pray.

521
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:08,540
Father Jesus, we pray that you'll speak your word to these lukewarm Christians

522
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,760
who are out there.

523
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,940
They're in the radio audience tonight.

524
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:17,700
And I'd like you to put a little special anointing upon all the colored people, because they

525
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,560
have a hell of a time.

526
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,560
And I'd like to thank you, God, for guns.

527
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,680
We may protect ourselves from the infidels.

528
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,580
Now, if the Hittites had had firearms, the Bible would have been an entirely different

529
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:33,960
book.

530
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,700
And we preach that book, that book which never was but should have been.

531
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,880
Oh, yes, brother.

532
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,880


533
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,880


534
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,880


535
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:39,880


536
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh, yes.

537
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,840
I don't know if any of you have ever had a touch of the catapult.

538
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,180
If only the Israelites had been given guns.

539
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:51,180
If only God and his wisdom had given automatic weapons to the Israelites then instead of now.

540
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,980
If only the Canaanites had nuclear technology.

541
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,740
Oh, yes, brothers.

542
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,020
Oh, yes, sisters.

543
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, it would have been beautiful.

544
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,600
But the Lord had a different plan, a plan of strife, a plan of hardship, a plan of sorrow.

545
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,560
A plan stained red with blood.

546
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:24,640
The blood of the infidels, the blood of the sinners, the blood of the pious, the blood of the lukewarm, the blood of the homosexuals and the homo sapiens alike.

547
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,720
The monkey boys, yes.

548
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,440
Those who'd walk on all fours.

549
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,480
What is the law?

550
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,380
The law is not to walk on all fours, but yet you would dare.

551
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,480
They're still walking by sight.

552
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,340
And some weird sexual perverseness to get down upon all fours and disgrace our Lord.

553
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,220
What is the law?

554
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Not to endlessly expose the law.

555
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,480
What is the law?

556
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,100
Are we not men?

557
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,300
What is the law?

558
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,400
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

559
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,380
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

560
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,320
Thus, where there is Wotan, there must be Bob.

561
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:22,060
Don't be sloping, don't be mistoking, cause where there is Wotan, there must be Bob.

562
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,580
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

563
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,040
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

564
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,440
Thus, don't give in to the pink, pursue the green ink.

565
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,120
Where there is Bob, there is slack.

566
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,660
Relax, kick back, and count your cash.

567
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,560
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

568
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,560


569
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,560


570
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,040
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

571
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,920
Where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

572
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,080
Thus, where there is Wotan, there also are Slobs.

573
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:22,800
The Pepto-Bismatic Pink Liquid Scheme is making the False Bobbies weak in the knees.

574
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,860
Don't worry, and wait for the fifth of July for the Exes to descend.

575
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,540
We're going to be the last boys.

576
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,240
from the sky.

577
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Where there is Wotan, there also is Frop.

578
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,600
No, no, no, no!

579
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,800
I can't stand it any longer.

580
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,420
No more Wotan.

581
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,880
No more Bob.

582
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,980
It hurts me.

583
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,600
Thus, where there is Wotan, there also is Frop.

584
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,320
Frop as you see it.

585
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,900
Frop for your life.

586
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,060
It's time to start smiting with the smoke of Bob's pipe.

587
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,860
It's linear logic of subgenius jihad.

588
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,920
Cause where there is Wotan, there also is Bob.

589
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,040
Uh, yes, it's so true.

590
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,940
God, that's the most irritating.

591
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,960
John Bartels here has created, I must say,

592
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,660
the most irritating mantra.

593
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,880
Uh, God, what a pure...

594
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,980
...thirsty, hideous...

595
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,240
Thus, where there is Wotan, there also are snobs.

596
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,060
It's time to fight them.

597
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,700
It's time to smite them.

598
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,920
Threaten them with hostile buyouts or simply outprice them.

599
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,840
Leave them shaking like jello in their shoes,

600
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,320
knowing full well that Bob makes the rules.

601
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,820
Uh...

602
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,540
Where there...

603
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,680
Nope, I can't, man.

604
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,200
I can't do that to you again.

605
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,860
I have to wait until they quit doing that.

606
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,460
Ugh.

607
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,180
No...

608
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,460
Nope, nope, nope.

609
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,440
There it's still the...

610
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,000
God, I can't...

611
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,300
It's horrible, isn't it?

612
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,460
Bob!

613
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,060
Ooh!

614
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,580
Man.

615
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,620
New tape from John Bartels there.

616
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,640
Uh, actually, he sent another tape a couple of weeks ago and we lost it.

617
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,320
We lost it!

618
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,180
We found it and then we lost it.

619
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,560
It was...

620
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,980
Oh, it was, uh, amazing.

621
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,360
It should be...

622
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,680
I guess that's all he sent on this thing.

623
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,080
That's a...

624
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,500
Like a six or seven dollar fancy-schmancy cassette.

625
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,480
Well, I can use that for the good works.

626
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,920
The works of...

627
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,100
Of, uh...

628
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,580
That...

629
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,860
What was it we were...

630
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,580
Yes, I have more legal notices in the newspaper.

631
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,340
I've got one from a couple of nurses that are hired and...

632
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,380
An international fam...

633
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,800
Or an industrial family's account.

634
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
And I'm entitled and allowed to explain...

635
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,940
The rules of plastic, or like entertainers, plastic.

636
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,080
But I have another one, a story of the Euclid.

637
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,140
Your hippie police department of the 60s is going to receive his sailors, soldier-sailors,

638
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,600
and entertainers' rights, a book of stamps.

639
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,660
These are all inclusive, price of silver, in combination.

640
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,760
His nurse wants to get a picture of him from the inside out.

641
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,060
Wants him to get used to it.

642
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,620
He's entitled to be plastic in case he bleeds or gets hurt.

643
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,920
And scheduled recovery...

644
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,020
Rules of plastic.

645
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,280
It's a very serious subject.

646
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,140
And it was guaranteed they're going to receive it.

647
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Their hippie police department, under preservation of the 60s.

648
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,560
They stole my sailors' stamps.

649
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,720
They're not midget...

650
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,880
Midget rations.

651
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,160
They're a big guy in the chart.

652
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,660
They're going to do it again.

653
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,000
And they did.

654
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,820
Yes, sir.

655
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,680
I'm the man with the legal notice in the paper.

656
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,700
And I have some more.

657
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,140
I'm having trouble with the local clemency police department.

658
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,560
And I have one from Center for Infectious Disease identifying the police department

659
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
that poured the cup on me.

660
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,360
Then I have a story about black Irish.

661
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,460
And he's Chinese today.

662
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,160
He's registered related to me.

663
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,600
He's in the sport enthusiast.

664
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,820
I'll let you figure it out yourself.

665
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,800
All the way to Perry.

666
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,380
He had some black sport enthusiast celebrity stamps.

667
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,060
I got problems with some celebrity jigs.

668
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,900
Then I got the brawny lad story.

669
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,140
And filthy in the restaurant again where they're not allowed to serve me.

670
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,180
And I have all the way back to grade school.

671
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,300
And a Catholic school.

672
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,500
I went restoration of the moment.

673
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,760
I'm back in school again.

674
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:35,760
And a bunch of cops got me a page on a book with their leptovirus holding a book on me.

675
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,020
Page 13 or 17.

676
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,420
And they're in trouble since the 60s from a Catholic school.

677
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,920
And it's.

678
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,860
The man with the legal notice is in the newspaper.

679
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:54,160
The man with the legal notice is in the newspaper is someone who led a group of people.

680
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,080
And he left messages at a business at which Jesus was working.

681
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,700
I'm talking about the real Jesus.

682
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,320
The one that runs the subgenius factory.

683
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,100
Not the one that the false Christians get so upset about.

684
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,580
But yeah.

685
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,980
Jesus got procured the legal documents guy tape.

686
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,140
Which is.

687
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,040
Oh.

688
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,840
Speak of the devil.

689
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,640
Jesus just walked in.

690
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,660
And he handed me a $10 bill.

691
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,000
You just heard a $10 bill pass the.

692
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,640
That's our weekly income I guess in the church this week.

693
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:28,840
Huh.

694
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,420
Yeah.

695
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,280
I was.

696
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,440
I just played some legal documents guy.

697
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,060
And I was.

698
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,500
I was.

699
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:36,680
Yeah.

700
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,520
Next week we'll get to.

701
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:44,820
The other side of the tape in which our Lord actually converses with the legal documents guy.

702
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,720
Live.

703
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,120
We've been saving that little surprise for you.

704
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,840
And we've also been saving a surprise involving Joe Offrit.

705
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
The awful.

706
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,100
Wonderful.

707
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,200
Whatever he is.

708
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:57,920
The only.

709
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,500
Prophet.

710
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,060
Yes.

711
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,540
Well.

712
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,140
Let's hope.

713
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,360
Not.

714
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,200
So I'm going to play a little.

715
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,900
We're right.

716
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,180
We've almost worked our way over the last.

717
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,220
Since February.

718
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,600
Through the mockery side of Joe's most famous tape.

719
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,880
Mockery and perversion.

720
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,120
We're going to hear just the end of that.

721
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,820
And then a little bit of the.

722
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


723
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


724
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


725
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


726
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


727
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


728
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


729
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


730
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


731
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


732
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,820


733
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:21,900
Little.

734
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,460
Meccano.

735
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:22,960
Joe.

736
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,540
That I put together myself.

737
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,240
And then.

738
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,540
There's going to be a little.

739
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,300
Surprise.

740
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,220
That we've.

741
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,800
Deliberately been sitting on until you had.

742
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,900
Truly felt that you had your fill.

743
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,280
Of Joe.

744
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,780
Someone.

745
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,620
In.

746
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:39,980
An.

747
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,180
Delaney.

748
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,260
Someone.

749
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,260
In.

750
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
I'm singing someone in the Delaney's.

751
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,620
There was this girl.

752
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,600
Whose last name was Delaney.

753
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,800
That.

754
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,080
I guess.

755
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,800
I don't know.

756
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:51,800


757
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:51,800


758
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I grew up with her brother.

759
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,580
From first grade.

760
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,500
To about sixth grade.

761
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,960
And I always had this thing where I wanted to just.

762
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:07,360
His youngest sister up off the ground against her wishes just to make her miserable.

763
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,340
So she'd throw a temper tantrum.

764
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm singing someone in in the Delaney's.

765
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,020
The Delaney.

766
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,140
Someone in.

767
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,360
In the Delaney's.

768
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,220
Someone in.

769
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


770
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,220


771
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,600
In the Delaney's.

772
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,740
And who says white people don't have soul.

773
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,180
But I'm trying to beat a class clown.

774
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,000
See back in the sixth grade I was trying to beat a class clown.

775
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,600
So I could make all the chickies.

776
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,440
Laugh real hard and mess their pants so I could get an orgasm from it and go.

777
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,880
And.

778
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,420
And as I made them start laughing.

779
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,100
As they were laughing I'd be chanting.

780
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,640
Go in in the pant.

781
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,180
Go in in the pant.

782
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,360
Go in go in go in go in.

783
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,460
Go in in the cant.

784
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,240
Go in in the cant.

785
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,960
Go in in the cant.

786
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,280
Go in go in go in go in.

787
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,480
Go in in the cant.

788
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,440
I imagined myself being back there in the sixth grade.

789
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,360
But a big mean ugly perverted monster.

790
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,140
One who's big ugly and perverted.

791
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,280
But he gets the sex when he wants it.

792
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,600
Ha ha ha ha ha.

793
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,980
Your bodies are no longer sacred ladies.

794
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,320
Ha ha.

795
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,500
Too bad this isn't a video tape.

796
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,160
This is only an audio tape.

797
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,440
Because I could show you stuff like um.

798
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,160
Imitations.

799
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,080
An imitation of a pervert eating mints.

800
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,320
He's trying to get them down his throat.

801
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,440
But his throat is infected with uh.

802
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,660
With the AIDS virus.

803
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,080
Or how about an imitation.

804
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,440
Of a pervert running through the.

805
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,780
A fat sadistic pervert running through the forest in a zigzag motion.

806
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,020
How do I know he's a pervert somebody asked.

807
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,840
Well because he's uh.

808
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,820
He's running through the forest in a zigzag motion.

809
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,500
Chasing a short skinny chick.

810
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,000
Bunny rabbits.

811
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,200
Bunny rabbits.

812
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,680
Raping the bunny rabbits.

813
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,320
You know what bunny rabbits I'm talking about?

814
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,260
The playboy bunny rabbits.

815
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,600
Funny rabbits.

816
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,460
Funny rabbits.

817
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:22,460


818
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,540
Anyway.

819
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,280
This is the end of the perversion side.

820
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,980
The next side is the mockery side.

821
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,040
Where I make fun of people who deserve to be made fun of.

822
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,300
So enjoy.

823
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,300
Now friends.

824
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,800

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,420
In a few.

828
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,800
In a.

829
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,780
After a few minutes I'm gonna get into subgenius 101 complete with the dancing.

830
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,480
Uh.

831

Girls and studs and the the uh.

00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,440
Video backdrop and music and so forth.

833
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,520
But um.

834
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,580
But first.

835
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,940
We're gonna stick our necks out.

836
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,240
Uh.

837
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,920
You know there's so many posers in this world.

838
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,480
And so few are the for real weirdos.

839
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,600
You know the ones that.

840
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,680
I mean they ain't faking man.

841
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,080
And uh.

842
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,100
And and we.

Something new for you tonight.

845
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,100
A man.

846
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,540
Yes.

847
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,020
A man or perhaps a god.

848
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,760
Or perhaps an animal.

849
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,940
We we we don't even know.

850
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,700
We are shamed.

851
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,740
Before.

852
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,220
This man Joe Offrick.

853
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,360
Um.

854
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,360

We are but.

856
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,160

And and in.

858
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,020
And for all I know this may be the only free man.

In this in this.

860
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,040
True.

861
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


862
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


863
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


864
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


865
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


866
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


867
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


868
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


869
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


870
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,060


871
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,620
Truly free man in this whole world.

872
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,040
He may be.

873
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,440
Is he mad man or prophet.

874
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:51,980
Anyway.

875
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,860
For the last.

876
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,140
While we've been on this tour.

877
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,480
We've been listening to a tape.

878
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,640
A tape that.

879
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,760

And manager.

883
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,460
Dr.

884
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,100
Jesus devil aqua.

885
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,880
Uh.

886
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,400
Used to sell at his um.

887
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,540
Or at least made available at his his bookstore.

888
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,600
The flying lemur.

889
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,160
Praise the long lost flying lemur.

890
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,200
And um.

891
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,580
He he said.

892
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,460
You guys gotta hear this.

893
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,040
And he puts on a.

894
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


895
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


896
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


897
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


898
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


899
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


900
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,500
He puts on this tape.

901
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,100
We listen to it once.

902
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,460
We listen to it again.

903
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,840
We listen to it again.

904
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,160
And we listen to it again.

00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,480
This man.

907
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,880
And for better or for worse.

908
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,940
I don't know.

909
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,200
Because Joe Offric.

910
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,340
Who is actually the high priest.

911
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,380
Of the temp.

912
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,500
The order of uh.

913
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,340
Dionysus Sabazio.

914
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,120
Okay.

915
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,260
This man.

916
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,460
Is so for real.

917
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,880
That he was kicked out.

918
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,860
By the church of sight.

919
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,900
All right.

920
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,860
And by.

921
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,120
But but this guy is the for real.

922
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,820
Sightness.

923
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,040
The man.

924
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,040


925
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,320
Of the subgenius.

926
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,540
This guy is the for real.

927
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,620
Black metal.

928
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,060
Uh.

929
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:50,980
Aficionado.

930
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,760
Or and he's the for real.

931
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,380
Something.

932
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,280
We're not sure what.

933
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,980
He is not a member of the church.

934
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,960
Of the subgenius.

935
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,440
And what he has to say.

936
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,500
He's not gonna talk for long.

937
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,920
His first time to ever been up in front of a crowd.

938
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,100
But uh.

939
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,420
He.

940
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,740
It it it may offend you.

941
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,080
It may cause your corneas of your eyes.

942
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,360
To just peel back.

943
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,340
In horror.

944
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,980
Or it it may just embarrass you.

945
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:15,920
But uh.

946
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,720
I have a.

947
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,340
Friends.

948
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,760
We have tried throughout the years.

949
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,100
To provide to you.

950
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,480
The quality high weirdness.

951
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,300
You know what I mean.

952
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,120
Uh.

953
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,000
And and and and when we can.

954
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,520
We bring you the real thing.

955
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,660
Like circus apocalypse.

956
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,440
Coming up.

957
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,380
Dr. Lake Neal.

958
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,540
Like I say man.

959
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,380
I feel like a.

960
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,360
A real poser.

961
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,600
Compared to this man.

962
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,720
The great.

963
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,020
Joe Ostrich.

964
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,360
I want you to chant his name.

965
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,120
As he comes on stage.

966
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:40,700
Joe.

967
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,540
Joe.

968
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,540
Joe.

969
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,400
Joe.

970
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,300
Joe.

971
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,920
Joe.

972
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,040
Joe.

973
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,340
Joe.

974
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:45,340


975
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,340
Joe.

976
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:46,600
Joe.

977
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,560
Joe.

978
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,400
Joe.

979
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:48,880
Joe.

980
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,160
Joe.

981
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,720
Joe.

982
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:52,660
Joe.

983
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,320
Joe.

984
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,620
Joe.

985
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,920
Joe Ostrich.

986
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


987
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


988
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


989
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


990
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


991
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


992
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


993
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


994
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


995
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


996
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


997
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


998
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


999
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


1000
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


1001
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


1002
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


1003
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:15,900


1004
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,440
Next one is the Kindergarten Orgasm Dance.

1005
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,780
In the kindergarten I had orgasms.

1006
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,040
Back in Kinder I had orgasms.

1007
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,840
In Kinder-y, in the Kinder-y,

1008
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,420
Back in Kinder I had orgasms.

1009
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,260
The next one is a little song I made up that I sang among friends.

1010
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,940
I was actually on a radio station once singing it.

1011
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,880
It's called Horny with a Chick.

1012
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,680
Yeah!

1013
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,720
Horny with a chick,

1014
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,400
Horny with a chick,

1015
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,720
Horn, horny, horny horn,

1016
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,080
Horny with a chick,

1017
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,340
I'm too sick to get a horny with a chick.

1018
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,460
Horny with a chick,

1019
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,380
Horny, horny, horny horn,

1020
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,560
Horn, horny with a chick

1021
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,980
Horny with two chicks,

1022
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,000
Horny with two chicks.

1023
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,400
The niggas didnt get dawned on me

1024
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:33,400


1025
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,040
Horny a horny horny horn, horny with two ticks.

1026
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,360
I'm too sick to get horny with two ticks.

1027
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,360
Horny with two ticks.

1028
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,360
Horny a horny horny horn, horny with two ticks.

1029
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:00,080
Horny when a chick walks by, horny when a chick walks by.

1030
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:13,640
Orly with a chick, orly with a chick, orly, orly, orly, orl.

1031
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,220
Orly with a chick.

1032
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,880
I'm too sick of it again.

1033
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,580
Orly with a chick.

1034
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,400
Orly with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

1035
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,860
Orly with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

1036
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,420
Orly, orly, orly, orl.

1037
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,400
Horny, horny, horny horn.

1038
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,300
Horny with a chick.

1039
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,200
Yes, Joe Offric, friends.

1040
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,560
Maybe, as we all know,

1041
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:56,560


1042
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:56,560


1043
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,600
as I said in my introduction to him on stage,

1044
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:05,040
he may embarrass, I mean, some people really don't see our fascination with Joe.

1045
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,600
But, you know, I'm a crack pathologist, by trade actually,

1046
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,200
and, you know, within that realm, Joe is a priceless American.

1047
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,820
He really is.

1048
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,740
He, horny in my cants.

1049
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,880
Sometimes I call him cants instead of pants.

1050
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:41,860
Whew, man. Pretty hardcore. It's a glimpse into the soul, so to speak, of a truly other person.

1051
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,980
A person too weird for the Satanists, but not too weird for the Church of the Subgenius, friends.

1052
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:56,160
We were honored to bring Joe to his first public speaking engagement.

1053
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:03,320
And of course, needless to say, one has to wonder if it won't backfire.

1054
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:11,740
Out of all the different people who have performed and preached and so forth in connection with Church of the Subgenius,

1055
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,360
would it not be perfect irony for Joe Offrecht to be the one who

1056
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,260
got invited on Dave Letterman and went over big time and suddenly had his own show?

1057
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,480
And didn't even have to carry his own equipment.

1058
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:37,620
Yes. Yes, and the Lord and I have lately had the intention of starting a band.

1059
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:44,760
We went through several different band names, but the one that we decided on would be Hey Joe.

1060
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,900
We have a band called Hey Joe, which would be

1061
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,640
primarily, well, we'd only do two types of music.

1062
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,920
We'd do Jimi Hendrix songs in Joe Offrecht style, and we'd do Joe songs in Hendrix style.

1063
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,560
We are looking for a Hendrix style. Well, actually, we're not.

1064
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,800
It would probably be our Hendrix, I suppose.

1065
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,020
It's a tough call, but somebody's got to do it.

1066
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,740
What else can I share with you here before we go back into the tapes?

1067
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,380
I did get this interesting little bit of email here,

1068
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,620
which is a list. It's like office graffiti, so to speak.

1069
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,440
But it says, here's a list of the names of Japanese cars,

1070
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,260
minivans and trucks compiled at an automobile trade show in Tokyo last year by Car and Driver magazines.

1071
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,980
And I can't play that music in the background. Oh, forget it.

1072
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,460
Anyway, here's the car. Here's.

1073
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,340
Names of Japanese cars. All right.

1074
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,600

The Mitsubishi Debonair Xceed.

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,800
The Suzuki Everyjoy Pop Turbo.

1081
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,700
The Mitsubishi Delica Space Gear Cruising Active.

1082
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,060
Let's see. Oh, there's a few more here.

1083
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,020
The Mazda Proceed Marvy.

1084
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,080

The D-

00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,840
The D-Diaz Town Cube.

1089
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,680
Go for spin in your town cube.

1090
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,720
Nissan Big Thumb Harmonized Truck.

1091
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,520
The Mazda Scrum.

1092
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,580
The Mitsubishi Libero RVR Super Wild Gear.

1093
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,580
And the Isuzu Giga 20 Light Dump.

1094
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,060
So, I don't know, I think I'd be going for the Mazda Scrum.

1095
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,020
You can really do things with a Mazda Scrum.

1096
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,420
But in the meantime, let's go back.

1097
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,420
Back to KPFA Berkeley and see why Dr. Howell does what he does.

1098
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,760
Perhaps some of you might wonder why I delve so frequently into eschatology.

1099
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,020
Into the study of the beginnings of all things.

1100
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,800
Yeah. What about that?

1101
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,400
Well, are you dissatisfied to think of the early times?

1102
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,180
One crown, cintilla, Spanish for diamonds.

1103
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:53,960
Oh, it just gets me drunk.

1104
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,840
Perhaps you'd be interested in taking my award-winning source in financial accountability and real estate.

1105
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,240
Why do you think they call it land anyway? You know?

1106
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,280
Because that's where you land on.

1107
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,400
And if you follow my course in real estate, you'll land on your feet.

1108
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,980
And you'll land on your feet and run.

1109
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,660
You'll run with the ball.

1110
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,560
You'll run with the ball as you find the right mortgage for you and 23 sources of financing.

1111
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,720
You'll be given checklists for evaluating any property that interests you.

1112
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:29,440
But the most important investment principle you'll ever learn from me is the one I've already shared with you.

1113
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,920
That the egg came before the chicken.

1114
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:40,920
And that God formed the embryos of all creatures out of an embryo which looked a little bit like you.

1115
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,360
Me?

1116
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,840
Like you.

1117
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,080
An embryo.

1118
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,660
I'll sign this.

1119
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,140
And I'll refrag.

1120
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,740
You, dear friend.

1121
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,000
You, the embryo.

1122
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,080
The embryo in Bob's knowledge.

1123
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,280
You are but a tiny...

1124
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,560
You are but Bob's tidbit.

1125
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,880
Until you have seen...

1126
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:22,620
His sacred free information from our delightful sounding subgenius ministry free information course.

1127
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,760
And all you have to do to qualify for this life changing adventure is to write to Bob.

1128
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,500
Yes, just as simple as that.

1129
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,860
Write to Bob and say, Bob, send me that free information.

1130
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,160
And you can write to Bob at this address.

1131
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:47,240
Post office box 140306.

1132
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,840
And 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1133
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,100
75214.

1134
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,140
And they're beautiful.

1135
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,920
The most beautiful post office box.

1136
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:04,240
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1137
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,120
75214.

1138
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:11,080
There's the Baronix Walkery, one of the most unusual dinosaurs ever discovered.

1139
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:18,700
With its gigantic primary digit, it flips a finny meal up into its crocodile-like jaws.

1140
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:29,080
And that's where your money goes when you write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1141
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,760
This is a very dispensable moment here.

1142
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,120
And close behind it, crawling over the land, comes...

1143
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,360
The Church of the Subgenius.

1144
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:35,500
A giant crab.

1145
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,920
A huge crab.

1146
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:37,560
Oh, look at you.

1147
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,620
Which has fooled the simple into thinking it is a religion.

1148
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,000
Just look at its tiny eyes darting about on stalks while it flicks its gigantic claws.

1149
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,100
That is the true Church.

1150
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,640
That giant crab is thinking.

1151
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,280
Go with the flow.

1152
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,280
There he goes, pulling the collar off as he walks sideways.

1153
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,260
Ride the snake.

1154
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,560
Ride the crab.

1155
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,680
Just go with him.

1156
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,080
Ride the Church.

1157
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,280
I'm sure you'll find out what it's all about.

1158
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,480
He will tell you of Bob.

1159
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,660
The great crab.

1160
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:06,660


1161
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,700
I cut off his wind.

1162
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,640
It looked like that, but...

1163
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,240
You must admit, this is a very impressive crab.

1164
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,680
And if you've got to go some way, you might as well go in an unusual way.

1165
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, my God.

1166
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,100
Look at that crab.

1167
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,260
It kind of reminds me of that old movie, Attack of the Crab Monsters.

1168
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,220
Oh, that was a great...

1169
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:22,720
I saw that.

1170
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,260
The guy got his hand chopped off.

1171
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,920
Some people have lots of them, but this just shows what one big one can do.

1172
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,820
One big religious crab would destroy you.

1173
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,460
This is a great story.

1174
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,460


1175
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,460


1176
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,460


1177
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,460


1178
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:35,460


1179
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,540
Oh, gosh, that caller is battling for his very life with this giant crab.

1180
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,540
Who says this is a boring program?

1181
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,020
Yeah.

1182
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,760
How can you forgive you, crab?

1183
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,920
Look, he's struggling with the truth of Bob, which has taken the form of a giant crab

1184
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,540
for this episode.

1185
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,400
Yes, it's Jack Crab, the world's oldest living...

1186
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,880
I know Bob the Ox.

1187
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,440
...kettlefish.

1188
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,660
I mean, cuttlefish.

1189
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,320
I mean...

1190
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,700
And not for what it was.

1191
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,780
You know, shellfish.

1192
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,920
Don't be shellfish.

1193
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,440
And I know the sub-demuses for what they were.

1194
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:05,440


1195
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:05,440


1196
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:05,440


1197
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:05,440


1198
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, you're making him mad now.

1199
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,040
Turn that radio show on.

1200
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,460
I'm gonna tell you about this sub-demus.

1201
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,440
Ah, there, a little calypso crab.

1202
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,240
Look at him go around and around.

1203
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:18,880
He's happy.

1204
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,760
And so should you be, having escaped that big one.

1205
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,440
Yeah, I know.

1206
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,440
And you reward the littlest mermaid.

1207
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:26,420
Topless dancing.

1208
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,220
Now, I'll tell you why you really can become a millionaire.

1209
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,920
Not with a get-rich-quick scheme, but with a simple, sensible, realistic plan for achieving

1210
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,120
for the rest of your life.

1211
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,120


1212
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,420
Let's play Real Estate Corp.

1213
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1214
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1215
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1216
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1217
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1218
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1219
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1220
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1221
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1222
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:35,420


1223
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,320
Real estate.

1224
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:36,960
Real estate.

1225
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,260
Real estate.

1226
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,180
Just get rid of the crabs.

1227
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:44,420
Yes, get rid of the crabs in your life that are pinching your chances for financial forwardness.

1228
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,280
That's right.

1229
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,140
Don't let them pinch shut your wallet.

1230
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,320
The hard shells of those shellfish can easily be cracked, and you can savor the delicious

1231
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,260
meat in the joint.

1232
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:59,900
By writing Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas, are you millionaire material?

1233
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,040
Perhaps you'll be interested in taking my simple quiz and finding out.

1234
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,260
That is the only answer.

1235
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:04,760
You're going to be a millionaire.

1236
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1237
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1238
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1239
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1240
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1241
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1242
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:04,760


1243
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:04,780


1244
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:11,100
Then during the next 12 months, your net worth will increase from $75,000 to $80,000.

1245
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,980
I don't have a net worth.

1246
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,300
Well, you need a net to catch those megalo crabs by the ocean side.

1247
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:25,340
You will learn at your own pace as you live in our tropical retreat, Dining on Crab and Lobster.

1248
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:32,620
Successful investing and money management will help you because you are a busy adult who already has a job

1249
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,940
and can devote only a small amount of time each week to mastering the principles of successful investing.

1250
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,820
I've been investing for 123 years in my...

1251
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,660
Big what?

1252
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,080
Insects.

1253
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,540
Well, not exactly.

1254
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,700
No, they are a sort of aquatic arthropod.

1255
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,140
They're more like spiders than insects, but in any case, they are an aquatic order.

1256
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,900
But if it's interest in insect eating that you have, I refer you to page 500 of my award-winning book,

1257
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
Insect Dining.

1258
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,200
Yes.

1259
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,560
You will all be eating roach crap by the year 2000.

1260
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,220
So you can make that big killing in the stock market.

1261
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,200
Yeah.

1262
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:22,860
Just imagine an easy way to increase the value of your estate by $100,000 or more in a single day

1263
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,260
with almost no significant change in your current cash position.

1264
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,160
But you're wondering how you can do it.

1265
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,220
Yeah.

1266
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,540
I'm wondering.

1267
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm wondering how I can get out of this show gracefully.

1268
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,540
You know, that's how do you get out of these shows gracefully.

1269
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,600
There's not like a little clock countdown.

1270
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,360
I can see a cassette as it's sort of see it.

1271
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,560
Of course, you know, they build these modern day cassette decks with a dark tinted window.

1272
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,120
That makes a whole lot of sense.

1273
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,640
You can sort of see inside, but not good enough.

1274
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:00,580
And that's the way, that's the conspiracy design, conspiracy engineering, friends.

1275
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,520
You can fight that conspiracy.

1276
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:10,620
By sending Bob your attention at box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1277
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,040
Email slack at metronet.com.

1278
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:21,960
Or check our site on the World Wide Web at sunset.unk.edu slash subgenius.

1279
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,240
And you'll see things you've never seen before.

1280
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,100
Oh.

1281
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:29,660
Oh.

1282
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,720
Now you'll discover such a plan.

1283
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,980
Which I call Dr. Howell's Successful Investing in Money Management.

1284
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:42,000
It's already taught thousands of eager beaver yuppies how to achieve financial goals.

1285
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,900
You'll hear many of their stories.

1286
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:54,720
Perhaps like you, they began with skepticism, but are now well on their way to complete financial happiness and orgasmic pleasure.

1287
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,760
They are happy.

1288
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,640
So have one of these bourbon and bong water.

1289
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,660
Or you can have a hot buttered rum martini like I am.

1290
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:13,040
And pretty soon we're going to go up on the balcony and toast Benito Mussolini in a warm glass of grog.

1291
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,920
While all the rest of the little serfs and peons labor down there in the office.
