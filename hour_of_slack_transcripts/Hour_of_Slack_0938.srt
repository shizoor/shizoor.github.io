1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
I see no reason for violence.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,160
Fox.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,800
If however you are confronted you may result in

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,120
SELF-GENIUS

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,100
Bugs.

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,300
Bug sex.

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,040
So now we can hug our fleas and ticks too.

8
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,640
Wet.

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,360
Wet.

10
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,960
Wet.

11
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,340
Wet.

12
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,060
American ticks.

13
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,440
Fox.

14
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,740
Don't kill flies with our nostrils.

15
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,100
Fox.

16
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,920
If you should wake up at about 2 in the morning and hear

17
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,060
Three brisk strokes, followed by two more after a pause.

18
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,300
It got worse and worse. It was driving me crazy.

19
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,340
The last thing he said to me was

20
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,600
Three brisk strokes, followed by two more after a pause.

21
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Thrills. Suspense. Climax.

22
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,060
He's going like a jackass.

23
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,300
Instruments of evil. Cult of evil. Human suffering. The worst kind of cruelty.

24
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,140
Fed. The worst kind of violence.

25
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,680
Pure malice while daring to claim the authority of God.

26
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,800
Power of evil. Goodness.

27
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,880
Evil has found

28
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,260
Conspiracy.

29
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,880
A willing servant.

30
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,400
The source of their nourishment was something called Petroleum.

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,180
Conspiracy.

32
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,700
When reality seems too difficult for us to face.

33
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:03,740
Conspiracy.

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,720
Instruments of evil.

35
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,620
Cult of evil.

36
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,580
Human suffering.

37
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,640
Rationalization.

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
Two-faced.

39
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,880
Power of evil. Goodness.

40
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,980
Remember the boy who failed to make the team?

41
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,380
Who died in vain.

42
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,140
For him, the fault was always someplace else.

43
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,760
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

44
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,520
Cult of evil.

45
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,600
All of us are guilty of

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,320
Conspiracy.

47
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,500
If you hid the truth away, maybe it would turn out to be a lie.

48
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,840
The worst kind of cruelty.

49
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,000
Suppression.

50
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,840
Illness as a way out.

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,260
Too many of us refuse to face reality.

52
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,280
The source of their nourishment was something called Petroleum.

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,540
Too many of us try to escape.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,680
Cult of evil.

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,380
Finding out what the trouble is. That can be found only in the real world.

56
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,620
Better count me out. No, leave me out of it.

57
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,900
Negativism. All those guys rushing around, buttoned up to their chins in blue serge.

58
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,040
Cult of evil.

59
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,640
Sour grapes.

60
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,820
Conspiracy.

61
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,860
Face-saving self-justification deception.

62
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,500
Why?

63
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,140
Cult of evil.

64
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Why?

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,580
Cult of evil.

66
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,240
The conversation was about a dog.

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Back to reality. Back to reality. Back to reality. Back to reality.

68
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,860
Pure malice while daring to claim the authority of God.

69
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,400
That may not be good English, but it makes good sense.

70
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,240
Making our money reach out to cover more of our needings or wantings and luxuries.

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,960
Some of our delightful American privileges of life.

72
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,500
Well, Jane finally got off.

73
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,920
In the American home.

74
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,560
Over and over and over again.

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Ours is a rich and variant land.

76
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,800
Those who sell and all who manufacture what is sold.

77
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,080
But the other five, this one gives you really hot.

78
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,520
Lasting satisfaction.

79
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,060
Wherever we live.

80
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,020
The source of their nourishment was something called Petroleum.

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
For the price which we've loaned it.

82
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,520
Synonyms fluctuate, waver, oscillate, undo.

83
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,700
Wait a minute.

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,020
Too many words mean nearly the same thing.

85
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,220
But still they're different.

86
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,360
Nobody can learn all those words.

87
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to bed.

88
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,220
The source of their nourishment was something called petroleum.

89
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:48,980
Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum. Petroleum.

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,900
Evil has found petroleum, a willing servant.

91
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,140
And by Reverend Norrell Preff at HeavyConfetti.com

92
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:08,740
I heard an error on the Hour of Slack actually when I was listening to it before this program came on.

93
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:17,700
I heard a conversation where they made a reference to where the urine of people at X Day goes.

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,960
And they said,

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,840
they were mistaken in where that urine goes.

96
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,120
And we're going to take a call here.

97
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,200
Hello, you're on the air.

98
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,420
Hi, how you doing Rob? This is Longchamp Cowboy Dave.

99
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,380
I forgot what you were talking about.

100
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
I mean, I forgot what you were talking about.

101
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
Well, I'm never really talking about anything in particular.

102
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,480
No, I mean, there was a singular moment there where it actually kind of made sense to me.

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,060
And then I...

104
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,260
What was the last thing you said?

105
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,960
It was about where the urine goes from X Day.

106
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,720
The actual substance itself?

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,600
Where it goes? Conceptually where it goes?

108
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,940
Well, the watershed in which...

109
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,780
See, you're always a step ahead.

110
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,740
Yeah, in which Brushwood is located.

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,560
And it does not go down to...

112
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,860
Does not go down the Mississippi from there, I don't think.

113
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm pretty sure it goes...

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,320
To the St. Lawrence.

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:04,780
Yeah.

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,640
That's because you used to go...

117
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,000
You're one of those people that used to go to Nelson's Ledges bare naked on various drugs and try to attack the weird Canada geese.

118
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,580
Well, I think Nelson's Ledges does go down that direction.

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,480
I think that's...

120
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,520
That's the watershed for the Cuyahoga Valley and the parts eastward too.

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Yeah.

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,600
They told me that one time when I was being debriefed.

124
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,920
Really?

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,240
Did they give your briefs back after they were done with them?

126
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,260
No, they skinned not only my skivvies, but they removed my actual skinnage.

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,300
And they perforated other parts of my body too and left tiny little transmission devices.

128
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,480
Which I still have to, you know, I have to wash around them.

129
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah, that's...

130
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,340
Can't be easy.

131
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Yeah, Uncle Fester, you know what I mean?

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh, yeah.

133
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,000
Because some of them, you know, and then they're radiologically improved.

134
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,280
So if you stink real bad, they'll pick up on it and then they'll make the signal stronger.

135
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,040
And you might kill somebody in Washington or, you know, France or, you know, one of those other places.

136
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,440
I mean, they try and have, you know, a block out there, a baffle they call it, a psychic baffle.

137
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,840
But, you know, the mechanics are baffling.

138
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,220
I'll say.

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,740
Huh?

140
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,000
I am baffled for one.

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
I am totally baffled.

142
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,180
Well, because, you know, it doesn't often work.

143
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:32,240
If you're trained as a decodified duck debriefer or any, you know, aquatic, you know, any kind of animal like that and stuff.

144
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,580
Because they have trained pet foresters around the world.

145
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,180
They use domestic and other earth-foil animals in their foraging activities and as spies.

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:52,080
And George Bush, our beloved leader, was behind, not behind, but he was somewhere involved in pushing this through in Langley.

147
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,200
Hmm.

148
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,060
Hmm.

149
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,080
So now we don't know.

150
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,000
But it all seems the same, too.

151
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,300
The plot thickens.

152
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,840
Well, it's like the pudding around us, you know.

153
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,380
Oh, yes.

154
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,180
See, you have to, not today, to just survive in the year 2004.

155
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:22,140
You not only have to have a de-equilibrizing, equili-li-li-zing device established somewhere in the back of your corpse close, Mary.

156
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,360
And then down by the medulla and vulva, god, at the base of your skull.

157
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,740
Down by your neck, you have to have one, too.

158
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,980
And when they, you know, like if you get an amber alert, you know.

159
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,500
Or a turquoise alert.

160
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,320
Or, you know, there's a lot of them now.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,160
I mean, not as far as most of them.

162
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,160


163
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,840
Most people know.

164
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,580
But in our codified sense world, which emanates from the dark parts of, you know, those areas

165
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,920
in the metropolitan D.C. area, we can each bring our own colors to the, you know, to

166
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,320
the fray.

167
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,500
Wow.

168
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,280
And I've done that, too.

169
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm going to bring one more panelist on here.

170
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,080
It seems we've got another call that's quite persistent.

171
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,080
Well, no, we've got a panel to hold, you know, the room.

172
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,000
So we might as well get some more guys in here.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,860
Here at 687.

174
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,420
I don't know if we've got enough sheetrock to damage anything important.

175
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,140
You're on the air.

176
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:18,520
Well, you're in big trouble for spraying the bush of freedom with your pee-full, pee-full

177
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,120
emissions regarding the...

178
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,540
I'm just marking my territory, and Rob understands, because he marked his.

179
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,900
Oh, but yeah, but you're trying to say that when a hippie pees at Brushwood, it disappears

180
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,720
off into just ethers or outer space?

181
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,600
I actually know it.

182
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,700
We're saying that it goes straight down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

183
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,600
I would say that it goes into Lake Erie.

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,400
That may sound like some sort of a...

185
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,060
It's not science fiction, because there are different parts of the country and everything.

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,140
No, no, it's the watershed.

187
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,140
It's the...

188
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,420
Like, when you're that close to the Great Lakes, the water goes to the Great Lakes,

189
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,340
I think, and then from there it goes into the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then out into the

190
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,860
Gulf of Newfoundland there.

191
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,800
Oh, water, sure.

192
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,320
No, it goes to batter, yeah.

193
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,040
Oh, but the urine?

194
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,280
To be recycled.

195
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,300
Regular water.

196
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
But we're talking about the urine that comes from subtenuos and hippies out in...

197
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,560
Oh, geniuses.

198
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,080
You're in trouble now.

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,320
We're going to take one more caller here, and...

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,040
Of course, sir.

201
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,380
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,380


203
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,400


204
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,300
But the problem...

205
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,200
1673515.

206
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:12,800
The problem...

207
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,460
De-investigating the urine of a people so poorly endowed with any sort of special or

208
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,480
ancestral genetic background.

209
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,400
Well, you know, the government and the police are changing that by studying the urine of

210
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,860
citizens, and so many employers voluntarily help the government and the police...

211
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,660
Well, that's the vibrational level.

212
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:40,080
...to study our urine and whatever chemicals we might have in it, and in our bank account.

213
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,380
Right.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,820
And so, you know, the average spy is as good as a dog as knowing where you've been.

215
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
I mean, at knowing where you've been.

216
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,360
He merely sniffs the air, and he notices the tell-tale traces of the end of your poolish,

217
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,900
where you've excreted a small amount of urine, which you do every day.

218
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,220
I mean, even after you've excreted as much as you possibly can.

219
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,320
With luck.

220
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,300
With love.

221
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
And with great feeling, too.

222
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,200
Someone wants to get a word in edgewise.

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Hey, guys, someone here got a new caller.

224
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,920
They want to get a word in edgewise, so we're just going to let our new caller say something

225
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,100
here.

226
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,040
What's up with you?

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,500
Who are we talking to now?

228
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,440
This is Albert from Avon Lake here.

229
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Albert from Avon Lake here.

230
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,060
Well, how are you doing, Albert?

231
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm hanging in there.

232
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm rolling a little sushi.

233
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,040
Rolling a little sushi?

234
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,560
Could you make sushi wrappers out of the seaweed from the chlories that the hippies

235
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:27,960
peed in?

236
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,260
Hmm.

237
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,340
I wonder if that would add extra vitamins to it.

238
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,020
Well, you know, mineral content, that's another way we can make money off these urines.

239
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,080
You know, these are the ones that are going to be used to make the urine.

240
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


241
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


242
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


243
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


244
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


245
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


246
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


247
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


248
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


249
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


250
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


251
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


252
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


253
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


254
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,080


255
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,160
These urines are all different flavored as well, and perhaps we can mark them.

256
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,160
Mark, mark.

257
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,360
Well, you know, Bob Dobbs sold that product.

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,040
He marketed Guru P, they called it.

259
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,600
Guru P?

260
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,660
First in other countries, and then very briefly in the United States.

261
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:01,060
The idea was this was the recycled water of the holy men of the subgenius church.

262
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,160
The urine of Christ.

263
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,560
Well, you know, I...

264
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,620
It was actually not...

265
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,220
It wasn't even...

266
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,220
The Lord's word in edgewise from Avon Lake.

267
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,680
Go right ahead.

268
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,900
I used the urine before.

269
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,640
I had poison ivy on my foot.

270
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,000
I peed on my foot.

271
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,600
The poison ivy went away.

272
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,100
And so did your foot.

273
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,340
Urine therapy.

274
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,460
See, at least...

275
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,520
You're one of those people whose detectable sprays are not permitted under government

276
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:24,680
code.

277
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,020
Why do you think they call them people?

278
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,940
Well, of course it's not FDA approved.

279
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,400
This is what the makers of calamine lotion don't want you to know.

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,660
Is there pee in your pool?

281
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,180
Exactly.

282
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,800
Does it turn red?

283
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,580
That's another part of the conspiracy.

284
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,660
If you can urinate on your own foot...

285
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,100
Why buy calamine lotion?

286
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,840
You know, I read in the Grapes of Wrath when they were out in the desert and their car

287
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
broke down and somebody cut himself.

288
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,560
And what did he do?

289
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,320
He peed on some dirt and he packed it into the wound.

290
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,820
And that was all better.

291
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,060
The benefits of pee upon things is known by many people.

292
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,360
There's a health group of crackpot health people who actually drink their own urine

293
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,580
in increasingly large doses.

294
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:01,940
Hey, hey, hey.

295
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm no crackpot.

296
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,900
I pissed on myself, but I'm no crackpot.

297
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,760
That's right.

298
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,460
Well, you know, I'm not...

299
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm not saying it to be gratuitous, but this is part of this health fringe, you know?

300
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,820
And this is what they actually do.

301
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,380
And they'll put like maybe one drop in a large glass and you're supposed to get some benefit

302
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,560
from that because it's everything you missed or something.

303
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,220
Oh, hey, man.

304
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,000
Just gargle.

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,320
You know, who needs Listerine?

306
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,260
Hey, baby, you know, be real.

307
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:25,820
Be natural.

308
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,720
Be the real man.

309
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:34,080
And, you know, for hair pomade, why not just use what God left on the ground there?

310
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,240
Today's modern man has no need for patent medicine.

311
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

312
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:37,440


313
00:12:37,460 --> 00:13:00,100
Hi-oh people.

314
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,640
Are waking up?

315
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,640


316
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,600
It's just a bubble in your face.

317
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:02,600


318
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:02,940
There's why you're there.

319
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:02,940


320
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm talking about as an athlete in Bell million in a introduce new self.

321
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,360


322
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,560
When you're in Mendocino, the most important part is this.

323
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,040
Can you set the same level of imagination?

324
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,400
I mean, how reliable is Listerine?

325
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,400


326
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,400


327
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:15,540
youth and wisdom it is the wisdom pool not knowledge you see knowledge drains away

328
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,780
not like as if from a from a leather bladder or from a commode drifting but as knowledge

329
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:29,440
disappears wisdom inversely appears in its place in in within within the dobbs philosophy

330
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,600
yeah when the heads get too big where are you going to be when your ship fails to come in you

331
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,320
can see them on the horizon there well i'm gonna have my head in santa maria and they're all

332
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,780
heading for a new world but you know where will you be yeah mr smarty pants yeah mr schmister

333
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:53,500
brainiac mr einstein sherlock holmes mr red mugs smells his own nose and tastes his own tongue

334
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:02,640
i mean this is not interdimensional planning for your social affairs folks this is a dangerous

335
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,440
subject they're impregnating our urine

336
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,580
you

337
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,480
know with different types of telltale chemicals that can source you man don't you know you don't

338
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
want to be on the bus somewhere on the rta dunes you know on your way to work or driving in rush

339
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,640
hours you're being sourced man just like in the conspiracy theory or the things coming out of his

340
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:27,980
head in the most it's almost like rape it's identity rape really what they do with your

341
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,680
when you think you're flushing it down those those gleaming porcelain toilets in the restaurant or

342
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,160
whatnot

343
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,300
you're doing more than making sweaters man yeah you might as well just be signing away your children

344
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,960
that's about it yeah yeah as future generations are going down that tube with your with that last

345
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,500
few beers you drank bear partner yeah your mississippi river which way the watershed goes

346
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,740
well geez you know that's important but what happens before it right really gets there you

347
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,580
think the government doesn't work with the uh city water and plumbing and sewer uh sewer and plumbing

348
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,400
uh people oh yeah they filter that stuff yeah detect oh they can check your dna they know where

349
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,300
you've been right they can tell what you're saying just like a little poodle in the heat

350
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,080
i'm predicting that in the future as a condition of getting health insurance or life insurance

351
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,060
you're going to have to have a special uh uh computer inserted into your toilet that's going

352
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,000
to report all the analysis of your urine back to the insurance company so they can know whether or

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,800

367
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,280
part more of the psychic violence

368
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,300
being pooped

369
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,720
poop

370
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,760
perpetrated upon the citizens of this great uh...

371
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,000
what is it well they're trying they are certainly tracking us there's no doubt about that through

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,460
and not in a very personal way they don't have to the computer knows you as well as a dog does

373
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,300
because uh... then they'll know exactly where you're spending your money

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,480
yep and then they'll target you there too oh sure in fact they'll start sending you coupons to those companies

375
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,440
you'll think to yourself did i sign up for something

376
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,140
and yeah they were tracking your dna through the toilet

377
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,300
that's right you failed to urinate on the opt out

378
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,140
into the opt out toilet

379
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,200
you went into the opt in toilet instead

380
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,540
that was all over from there

381
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,360
yes you failed to opt out

382
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,400
they mailed you an opt out statement

383
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,660
didn't you read it

384
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,420
and there it is on your bill the next month anyway

385
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,060
flavors

386
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,240
differentiation

387
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,320
testing

388
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,100
toxic materials

389
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
so on and so forth

390
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,300
transportation

391
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:35,580
transportation

392
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:35,580


393
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
charges that's that's what it really gets me who's carrying around most of the time

394
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,760
you know what i'm saying

395
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,260
then they're going to get you for transportation charges

396
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,920
sheesh

397
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,360
that's right yeah

398
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,700
yeah just for carrying it around inside your bladder for a while

399
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,720
the myth of communism versus capital

400
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,260
i bet you they'll put the x on it

401
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,300
now dave you're not going to go into your pro communist rant now

402
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,500
no i'm just saying the myth of communism versus capital this is this is a corporate state

403
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,020
this is like out of razor bag or one of those other you know movies

404
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,360
yeah

405
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:16,300
you're right it is it's the it turned out in the end the right wing the republicans not the right the far right wingers but the republicans were the communists that the right wingers feared

406
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,400
hmm

407
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,900
the zippers and stuff were supposed to do something

408
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,200
why why live your life that way you know in fear when you could probably just

409
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,880
be like the amish don't use zippers use buttons

410
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,620
exactly

411
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,440
why couldn't they raise chickens and butter

412
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,640
i think they i think they have a point with the way that they live

413
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,960
they recycle they live simply they live in commune they live together

414
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,180
they have nice hats

415
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,140
they're private

416
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,960
their women smell good

417
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,680
their men smell bad

418
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,960
now what did you say about the women

419
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,020
they marry each other's cousins

420
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,640
well

421
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
no sewer system

422
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,000
you gotta lock your

423
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,120
they can't they're urine can't be tracked

424
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,240
that's right

425
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,340
that's right they're off the grid

426
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,320
i think we should all become amish i think they have something

427
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,620
no they're focusing on all the people out of the spotlight they're looking for them

428
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,220
if you're not on a cable hookup

429
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:03,620
you're not on a cable hookup

430
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,400
they still have their way

431
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,660
your kids aren't gonna come home and want nine hundred dollar shoes

432
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,600
they're gonna they're gonna wear the shoes that their brothers hand me down to them

433
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,300
yeah

434
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,260
they're not gonna have to worry about you know uh

435
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,680
the the newest and the greatest and the latest purses and burberry clothes that cost five hundred bucks

436
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,460
their parents they make their own clothes

437
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
that's right out of their own hair

438
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,640
it's true they do

439
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,940
they're quite a thrifty and quite a crafty people too

440
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,140
they use their own pubic hairs to make these huge huge huge dangling sweaters

441
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,600
that the old women wear

442
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,100
which people so are we talking about

443
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,460
the the simple folk

444
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,960
the oh those are the simple folks

445
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,400
the rustics

446
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,800
the ones with the flat

447
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,780
the ones no no the amish

448
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
they're still quite stressed out in their own way

449
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,180
yeah i've i've actually seen some pretty cool things made out of their toenail clippings

450
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,320
made out of what

451
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,280
toenail clippings

452
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,160
oh yeah really

453
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,780
oh yeah

454
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,180
yeah they recycle everything they believe in in in recycling everything back into the earth and reusing everything

455
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,100
what do they do with their toenail clippings

456
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,160
well for one thing it makes an excellent plastic

457
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,600
i don't know how to explain that to you

458
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,940
I was just going to say that.

459
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,760
They can actually melt it down at a certain temperature.

460
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,200
Just like melting down a good old pig's foot or perhaps a sheep's belt.

461
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Urine therapy is practiced quite prevalently in the Amish community.

462
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,860
Urine therapy?

463
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,680
Drinking their own urine, peeing on themselves for different types of ailments.

464
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,040
Everything from arthritis to psoriasis.

465
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,400
What about the celebratory aspects of urinating on each other?

466
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,600
Many times in your Amish villages, folks on a Sunday afternoon when they're not permitted to work

467
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,280
will just get together and eat some pie and urinate on each other.

468
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,160
But I mean, the benefits are more trans-sweet, trans-dimensional.

469
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,460
Transient?

470
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,040
Transience. That's transience, yes.

471
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,560
So I wouldn't want to be one of their children, at least when they're peeing on each other.

472
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Not for too long, make them drink this

473
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,140


474
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,140


475
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,760
There is Оневилия – the wondrous spirit х

476
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,460
which will turn men into slaving fills one of them with.

477
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,460


478
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,440
right,

479
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,060
Um閉

480
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,060


481
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,860
It's not just fish.

482
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,460
But it's all based on a lie

483
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,140
It's what I believe too

484
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,380
Wake up and smell the cheese

485
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,660
There is no way the rest of the world

486
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,980
Will ever take us seriously

487
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,340
We know that we are not alone

488
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,160
I feel high on the ground

489
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,540
I believe

490
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,380
I believe that's what we suck at

491
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:06,940
I believe

492
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,160
Yeah, me too

493
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,720
Oh please, at least don't do this to me

494
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,220
At least don't do this to me

495
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,260
But you promised me that I was gonna experience

496
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
The thing where I didn't have any problems

497
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,960
I thought that

498
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,080
Why couldn't you believe

499
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,480
In this?

500
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,860
Disagreed

501
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,340

Dallas Air Force Base

504
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,760
It's the truth

505
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,400
Our government is conspiring with the creatures

506
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,220
That built the craft

507
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,220
It could be the fifth column problem

508
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,140
Or the masons or the Illuminati

509
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
We have it now

510
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,220
It's our holy grail

511
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,060
I feel high on the ground

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,020

Disinformed

515
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,480
Does the government know this thing is missing?

516
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,660
Probably

517
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:00,840
Probably

518
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,180
In which case

519
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,860
They'll kill you

520
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,480
Dad, you can't deny us our right to be heard

521
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,300
Go ahead and try

522
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,980
My fingers

523
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,080

That's what I'm trying to do

528
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,740
Are you high on the tracks?

529
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,260
A little information can get a guy killed

530
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,240
An edit by self slayer

531
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,300
Get on it

532
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,640
What?

533
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,220
The television screen

534
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,320
Has become the retina of the minds eye

535
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,120
That's why I refuse to appear on television

536
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,800
Except on television

537
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,940
Of course, Oblivion is not the name I was born with

538
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,440
That's my television name

539
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,380
Soon all of us will have special names

540
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,320
Names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate

541
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,800
You can do incredible tricks automatically

542
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,340
Specially designed to

543
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,140
Bob's wife Connie and the con-spiracy

544
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,200
There's obviously a connection there

545
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,420
You seem to have penetrated a simple analog

546
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,300
Right

547
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,140
In the allegory

548
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,100
There's no doubt that the word con in Connie

549
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,980
And the con in conspiracy

550
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,360
All are composed of the very same letters of the alphabet

551
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
You see it is necessary for the subgenius to embrace the word con in the alphabet

552
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,360


553
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,360


554
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,080
And even to have carnal relations with the conspiracies

555
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,540
To a certain degree

556
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,660
Only in the interest of avoiding it eventually

557
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,380
And finding slack

558
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,880
We hate to do it but carnal relations are carnal relations

559
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,900
Somewhere slack has to be obtained where you find it

560
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,580
And what about the rest of the world?

561
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,820
I don't care about them

562
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,040
We don't care about them

563
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,020
We want them to care about themselves

564
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,260
And then through caring about themselves

565
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,960
They can care about us

566
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,240
True subgeniuses

567
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,280
Well they have plenty of things to care about

568
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,900
We know that everyone must love themselves

569
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,240
Before they can love another person

570
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,840
Etc, etc, etc

571
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,560
You know the ones who buy lots of stuff

572
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,980
Well you can do that too

573
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:23,780
If they buy what they want that's the important thing

574
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,720
You're talking about prosumers who are professional buyers

575
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,380
Just like Homer Simpson says

576
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,160
Donuts of the world beware

577
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,500
It's judgement day

578
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,080
Yeah

579
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,300
He didn't say that

580
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,660
What do you mean he didn't?

581
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,620
Well it says that right here in the script

582
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,460
Are you one to challenge the script writer?

583
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,300
No, no, no

584
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,620
That's been done before and those people aren't around anymore

585
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:45,760
Heh, heh, heh

586
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,940
If you know what I mean

587
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,700
Um, also we had an anonymous message

588
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,300
They're out hip hopping in a hot rod

589
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,140
Some callers are gonna come down and I guess they're here now

590
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,700
Ooh

591
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,740
We're going to interview these folks

592
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,140
Did I ever do that?

593
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm right here on the air

594
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,960
As soon as we get on the air

595
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Sure, when you were a big kid you could drive

596
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,580
You could come down to the show

597
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,980
I've heard that if you have at least three shows on your hard drive

598
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,500
Your computer will run faster

599
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,800
Um, it's uh, now the ball gags are placed in

600
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,360
If you downloaded at least three shows from

601
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,320
Well, I mean, Serpent X is as much harder to say

602
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,000
Because I like to just say quiveringbrain.com

603
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
It's more like an education service

604
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,120
If you go to www.quiveringbrain.com

605
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,240
And find the link for the puzzling evidence show

606
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,800
Is that puzzling evidence plus pee show?

607
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,840
Is that the one you're uh

608
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,040
Well, they're all there

609
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,520
Even the ones without pee

610
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,960
Oh

611
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,800
I did

612
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,560
Pee and slack, same stuff

613
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,720
It can be

614
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,400
I just want to know three things

615
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,240
Pee, damn, ass

616
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,980
What does that have to do with anything?

617
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,000
That's what I've got to find out

618
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,540
And that's your challenge

619
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,100
Here at the last waning few minutes of the show

620
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,520
Rewinding the show here

621
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,600
Getting ready for the end

622
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,100
I'm gonna put away my stuff

623
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,240
No, you can't call because you've already called

624
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,100
Because your mom said so

625
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,820
End of show

626
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,700
You're all getting pulled right now

627
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,220
End of show

628
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,000
You have to hang up and call back to call

629
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
I'm uh, I'm gonna vote for the

630
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,220
Pesrio psychotic anarcho-materialist candidate

631
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,240
There you go

632
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,520
Which one would that be?

633
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,840
Bob Dobbs, of course

634
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs

635
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,720
Well, actually, that's a pointless thing

636
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,200
Since, in theory, J.R. Bob Dobbs

637
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,100
Might as well already be Bob Dobbs

638
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,720
Any world overlord for all we would know

639
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,900
Because pretty much every world leader out there

640
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,400
Has Bob's hand up their you-know-what

641
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah, they are puppets for his hand

642
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,940
Operated by his hand up their little puppet chute

643
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,680
That's right

644
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,580
I don't fully understand

645
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,640
Explain to me more

646
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,140
I mean, I know what you're saying, but

647
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,540
What's your opinion of the puppet chute?

648
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,560
I don't like it, uh, you know

649
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,220
It's filthy

650
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
That's how they are

651
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,660
Well, he's talking as if he's had his hand

652
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,620
Up a puppet

653
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,980
As a whole

654
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,540
Chances are, most people have the hand

655
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,120
It's not, well, it's not

656
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,860
The puppet chute is beside the point

657
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,140
The point is the puppet's playing

658
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,380
Not if you're checking the puppet out

659
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,720
How do you cut the strings?

660
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,940
Well, the problem is

661
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,260
Sure, you can cut your strings and flop to the ground

662
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,840
But there's gonna be another puppet

663
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,480
That had been running you

664
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,480
And he's still gonna be run by the guy that's running him

665
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,300
We don't know how far up the line of puppets it goes

666
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,720
But I'm not running any puppets

667
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,700
All the way to the top

668
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,340
I'm gonna have to do a little bit of a test myself

669
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,560
Which indicates to me

670
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,940
That I must be at the bottom of the damn ladder

671
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,280
Maybe, maybe you're not even on the ladder

672
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,820
Well, that's been, that's actually

673
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,320
Was my theory was

674
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,220
If I could just not even be on the ladder

675
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,320
Let's see what happens

676
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,600
And, well, my income dropped a whole lot

677
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,940
But I'm still here, so

678
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,720
That's right

679
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,200
And Ron's not

680
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,840
You may not have all the money

681
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,820
But you got all the slack

682
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,240
And, uh, actually, what time is it?

683
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,780
5.4

684
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,540
5.4

685
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,620
5.4

686
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:00,620


687
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,640
No, friends

688
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,600
It's the end times

689
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,260
Haven't you been watching your televangelists on TV?

690
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,580
But, sir, you know, this has been

691
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,580
Rather a rough year or so

692
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,820
You know, you can get very cynical

693
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,040
And one afternoon I was really feeling cynical

694
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,460
I was on the internet with a bunch of the other subgeniuses

695
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,580
And they, we were all bitching and griping

696
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,080
About the state of the world and the country and everything

697
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,920
And they were going on and on about the usual overblown stuff

698
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,740
Bush is just like Hitler, you know

699
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,520
He hasn't killed the six million people yet

700
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,800
But otherwise, he's just like Hitler

701
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,600
And, you know, I, I, well, what are we gonna do about it?

702
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,920
We're all gonna be thrown in concentration camps

703
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,460
And I said, damn it, if you were serious

704
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,500
If you really honestly believe

705
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,440
That being thrown in a concentration camp

706
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,380
For not being a Republican

707
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Is right around the corner for you

708
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,460
Which a lot of my knee-jerk friends were saying

709
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,340
Then you are a traitor

710
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,540
If you don't go to Washington

711
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,960
And murder the evil president

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,120
Well, needless to say, that's a tricky thing to say in public

713
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,420
But, but, my point was

714
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,140
And they were going, oh, well, that's kind of extreme

715
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,340
They couldn't leave for a whizzo

716
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,920
Which is pretty f***ed up

717
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,400
And, and I said, well, the other option is to find another

718
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
You know, if you don't like it, then leave

719
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,880
You know, go to another country where

720
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,540
I hate to say it, but they have less rules and laws and so forth

721
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,220
And, and a friend of mine said, Stag, I thought you were happier these days

722
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,760
You sound more cynical than ever

723
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,980
He goes, isn't there another option

724
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,460
Besides killing the president or leaving the country?

725
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,660
And I swear to God, it took me about a week of thinking about it

726
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,060
And then I realized that there was a third option

727
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,500
Run for office

728
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,980
If you don't need that

729
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Not me, I think you'd have to be crazy to do that

730
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,160
But that is the other option, you know

731
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,680
And that's the uncomfortable one, isn't it?

732
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,440
And so is the other option

733
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,160
I'm just gonna sit and just tell everybody you know what's wrong

734
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,820
And what should be done right

735
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,380
But it's all a different thing to get off your ass

736
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Yeah, in case any of your bosses are listening

737
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,260
You guys are really cool

738
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,240
Thanks

739
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,560
My mom tunes in regularly

740
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,280
People, yeah

741
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,760
Preaching hellfire and damnation

742
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,260
Will you guys say hello to Andy Goodman for me?

743
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,300
I really miss him

744
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,100
When we see her, we'll say hello to her for you

745
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,140
Okay, thank you very much

746
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,520
And don't forget, some people come to the show and just watch TV

747
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:01,060
And then they say, all three of my brains are somewhat disconnected

748
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,900
Then they say, phew

749
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,900
They have three brains and they watch TV

750
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,920
Right, they have their emotional brain, their intellectual brain

751
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,800
Attacks on Slack

752
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:09,920
Attacks on Slack

753
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,060
There we go

754
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,720
Okay, now what is he saying?

755
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,420
Attack on Slack?

756
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,300
He wants an attack on Slack, yeah

757
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,500
No, no, no, no, the press administration is trying to develop a new tack on Slack

758
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,080
Oh, a new tack on Slack

759
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
A new tack on Slack

760
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Yeah, he's talking about, you know, Slack is on Slack

761
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,920
Oh, I see

762
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,420
He wants to have a new tack on Slack itself

763
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,740
He wants to have a new tack on Slack itself, yeah

764
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,520
I thought he was saying attacks

765
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,800
I'd like a tax break on Slack myself because we never get enough Slack

766
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,120
Well, sir, I'll tell you right now, the Church of the Subgenius does not tax any of its members

767
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,980
We don't believe in tax

768
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,600
Tax is anti-Slack

769
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,040
Very good, very good

770
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,100
I'll have to buy more brochures and hand them out

771
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,160
All you need is your $30 donation

772
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,800
I am a member, thank you very much

773
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,420
Oh, good, good

774
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,720
Andy Goodman

775
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:04,840
I promise you going forward in this administration we will, read my lips, have no taxes in the Church of the Subgenius

776
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,760
There he's doing some liquid Slack right now

777
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,200
That's a promise

778
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,180
And I can keep that promise

779
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,320
It's one I'll not break like I normally or sometimes have been known to have to be

780
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,640
Right now it's 7.20 in the morning in Knoxville

781
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,200
Right

782
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,520
College of hard knocks

783
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:36,340
So, yes, we will be, I think I'm going to put out my platform on my website very shortly

784
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,520
My platform for administration of the Church of the Subgenius into the next 100 years

785
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,600
Wow, that'll be cool

786
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,180
And you can rest assured that in this church your taxes will only go to the church of the subgenius

787
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,180
And they will only go down below zero

788
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,800
We may even pay you money to join this church in the future

789
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,480
Ooh, a tax rebate, a Slack tax rebate

790
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,100
A Slack tax rebate

791
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,980
Thank you, thank you very much

792
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:13,420
An anti-Slack tax rebate that gives you a hedge against the future Slack attacks against you

793
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,700
I can see it now

794
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,460
You don't know when they're going to be coming, those Slack vampires that will be coming around each corner

795
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,300
You'll be slurking and lurking along and there when you least expect it

796
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,400
Slack attack

797
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
Slack attack

798
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:36,040
And now you'll be with your special secret anti-Slack tax rebate from the Church of the Subgenius

799
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:43,480
You can flash that anti-Slack tax rebate and defer that horrible attack against your Slack

800
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,460
In such a way as to cause the monstrous intrusion

801
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,440
To completely destroy you

802
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,980
Many flax are wary of enacting the anti-Slack attack tax

803
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,380
And yet

804
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,940
Yes, we're going to try to be an example for all administrations around the world

805
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,040
For all men

806
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
And what is this whole thing about gay marriage?

807
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:20,420
In the Church of the Subgenius we believe that any kind of creature should be able to marry any other type of creature

808
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,060
Without state sanction

809
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,720
Ah, creature comfort

810
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,860
I could be married to you right now

811
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,140
We're over the airwaves and we don't even know it

812
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,260
And who do we need the state to sanction that anyway?

813
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,720
Certain things like

814
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,720
Was that a fake sanction? Like a teething on the state?

815
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,660
The Subgenius ministers have been marrying people for years

816
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,620
We've married groups of people to each other

817
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,460
We've married things to each other

818
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,420
With short duration marriages

819
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,400
Right, through the law of the law, right?

820
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,400


821
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,560
Through the Universal Life Church

822
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,980
No, through the Church of the Subgenius

823
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,500
Duh

824
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,640
Yeah, you don't need to have any

825
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,540
When I got my kids from the Church of the Subgenius

826
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,120
It says I was an affiliated minister for the Universal Life Church

827
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,440
We just say that to make people feel good

828
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,520
But, you know, we've been giving up our own ordinations for thousands of millennia

829
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,820
Oh, I love it

830
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,040
Is it true that Bob is neither coming nor going

831
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,900
But he's like somewhere in between

832
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,600
Like in quantum physics or something

833
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,940
In a state of indeterminacy

834
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,200
Well, it is true and not true at the same time

835
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Believe it or not, that's kind of a hard concept to address

836
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,640
No, it is

837
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,800
That's actually very, I mean, from what else I've read it seems like it makes perfect sense

838
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
He's sort of in between

839
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:45,200
He balances on the interstitial range between the two counterclockwise vortices of slack

840
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,880
Bob is alive and well in the jungles of the universe

841
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,860
Those are counterclockwise opposite turning vortices

842
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,080
Separated only by a small interstitial range of slack

843
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,480
On top of which, Dobbs dances

844
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,160
For your pleasure

845
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,600
This city known as Bob's Town

846
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,920
That little place called Dobbs Town

847
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,920
Come along with me down to Subgenius Land

848
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,360
Yes, in the secret language of subgenius symbology

849
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,020
We speak to the lesser

850
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,440
The creatures living close to nature

851
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,300
That the ancients felt all things to be interconnected

852
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,100
In an intricate web of being

853
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,000
And there the 60s cycle hogs

854
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,720
Went on and on

855
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,880
We're gonna finish this work in just a little bit

856
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,760
And then we'll give you your regular programming back

857
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm shaving Hal's pelt right now

858
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,700
Woohoo, it feels so good

859
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,060
How much yeti is Hal?

860
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,380
Hal, are you at least 80-90% yeti, right?

861
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,400
I'm afraid so

862
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,340
The physical tropisms are unmistakable

863
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,080
Do you ever wax your pelt?

864
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,440
No, that would be excruciatingly painful

865
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,240
I've waxed my pelt a few times

866
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,040
What's the name of that metal state which lets you meditate better?

867
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:13,940
California

868
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,060
I had a question for the reverend

869
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,340
How may I help you, pig man?

870
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:30,220
Yeah, you know how the popular series X-Files was out on the air and very successful

871
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,420
I was just wondering if they borrowed that from X-Day

872
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:42,420
Oh, well of course, you know, pretty much everything in Hollywood was inspired by J.R. Bob Dobbs

873
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,660
Jokes and gags and funny novelty routines that he would do

874
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,360
Parties and stuff, so yeah, basically it was all ripped off from us

875
00:38:52,360 --> 00:39:00,180
But we don't expect the heathens to believe that sort of thing, so we don't make a big deal out of it

876
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,500
X-Files, X-Day, J.R. Bob Dobbs predicted X-Day back in 1953

877
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,540
He said the world would end in 1998 and it's...

878
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,300
And it's due to

879
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,360
Obviously, it ain't 1998 yet now, is it?

880
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,260
That's right

881
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,200
Yeah, well, you know, the world did end, so I agree

882
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,580
The world ended?

883
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,600
Well, that's a matter of a lot of debate

884
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,840
We just don't know it yet

885
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,100
The fact that there's so much debate makes me think that maybe the world hadn't really ended that much

886
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,500
Maybe the beginning of the end came in 1998

887
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,600
There's sort of like ending in a sort of vacuum

888
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Well, there's...

889
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,060
And it's backwards

890
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:47,320
An increasingly popular theory is that in 1998 the rupture began

891
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,320
And the space aliens started rupturing up people

892
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,620
But they did it like one organ at a time or one personality feature at a time

893
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,460
I lost my blood sugar on X-Day

894
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,360
Another guy lost his insulin and became diabetic on X-Day

895
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,520
Some people lost wallets, some people lost their values

896
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,360
Some lost their memory and their morality

897
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,740
And over the years, if you have...

898
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,920
I mean, are you getting more hair? No, you're losing hair

899
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,860
Are you getting more brain cells? No, those are being ruptured

900
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,080
You're going up to meet Bob piece by piece

901
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,300
As we speak

902
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,160
And even my sperm cell, my sperm cell count, my sperm count is decreasing

903
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,320
That's right, all I found

904
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,180
Well, that means God needs little pig man babies

905
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,960
God needs those sperm cells up in heaven

906
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,940
They were ruptured

907
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,980
I got me one, I got me one piggy baby

908
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,480
You wanna, you wanna say hi, Steven?

909
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,800
You finally did?

910
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,080
Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee!

911
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,160
That's the sweetest thing

912
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,320
And he's going to bed now

913
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,420
I gotta put little pig boy to bed, so I'll call back man

914
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,520
Well, I'm real glad to hear about that

915
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,040
Congratulations!

916
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,480
Congratulations on being a dad

917
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,240
Do you think there's like a future for piggy boy with the state fairs?

918
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,300
Yeah, well I'm trying to corrupt him as early as possible

919
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,180
So he does know how rotten this world is

920
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,820
And maybe he'll be ready

921
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,000
Teach him the value of a dollar

922
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,020
That's right

923
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,660
You all have a good night

924
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,060
Well, you too, thanks for calling, pig man

925
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,680
Thank you, Reverend, and thank you, Synesthesia, we'll see you all

926
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,740
Alright

927
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,000
Do you notice how I said thanks for calling just like I was the host of this?

928
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,720
Hey, you know what, that's fine

929
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,100
You thanked him for me

930
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,420
I'm so powerful I have people to send out thank you cards for me

931
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,620
All that, so

932
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,960
I don't even have to thank people for calling

933
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,560
I'm so jealous of all your followers

934
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,240
You have real mindless followers

935
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,540
Followers?

936
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,080
No, I don't

937
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,800
My mindless followers are all fakers

938
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,060
And they only pretend, they act like they're mindless followers for, you know, just for a joke for a little while

939
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,780
When you try to actually get them to do something like assassinate your enemies

940
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,960
Oh, then all of a sudden they've got an overdue book at the library

941
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,860
See, where are my mindless followers that I haven't seen any in a while?

942
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,680
They're not exactly clamoring to secure resources for me

943
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,840
Well, maybe your mindless followers are just like their god

944
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,640
Imaginary

945
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,200
That's right

946
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,560
But that doesn't, you know, that's never been a problem in the religion business

947
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,200
I am a figment of my own imagination

948
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,500
That's what they say

949
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,280
But you know, if all of a sudden you injured, you stubbed your toe or something

950
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,280
You'd suddenly be in the body again and you wouldn't feel like you were your own god

951
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,380
You'd be cursing me

952
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,440
Simply, simply

953
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,320
Some outside god

954
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,960
Simply an imagination of the injury, the pain

955
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,820
I imagine that

956
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,000
So, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream

957
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,760
Sounds good

958
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,480
Yeah, I think you've got the makings of a first class guru in you

959
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,900
Alright, just point the way to the mountaintop and

960
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,860
Well, no, you don't want to do the mountain, but nobody, none of the gurus really do that

961
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,240
What are you talking about?

962
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,220
They really do the mountaintop

963
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:48,140
They talk about, that's a metaphor, you know, little old ladies and frustrated businessmen love to hear about the mountaintop

964
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,100
The gurus are really guys just like, you know, anybody else

965
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,380
It's like salesmen, you're doing a pep talk and it improves the idiots who can't

966
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,400
I mean the people, nice people who can't improve themselves for whatever reason

967
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,040
Now the true test of the guru is he who can climb the mountain without getting a nosebleed

968
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,500
And...

969
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,200
Well, actually...

970
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,580
No, the real guru is the guru who can not and say he did

971
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,100
That is the real miracle

972
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:27,280
It lies not in the silly displays of magic, but in the belief of the viewer

973
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,280
That is where the miracle takes place, in the lack of understanding in the believer

974
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,560
That is the truth, the people say there's no such thing as miracles

975
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,220
The miracle is the miracle itself

976
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,620
The miracle is that people can believe such dumb stuff

977
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,380
And that's a beautiful story, it's a beautiful miracle

978
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,120
That hits the nail right on the head

979
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:57,480
It brings, you know, some measure of succor to people in this damn tough world

980
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,420
That's right

981
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,240
I have my beliefs, I believe in Bob so solidly rock hard

982
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,440
My hate for Bob proves how that I...

983
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,400
You know, you can't hate something you don't believe in

984
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:11,880
That's right

985
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,840
You gotta really believe in something like a, you know, you can't hate strangers like you hate your family or your loved ones

986
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,180
It's a strange thing to say you can't hate strangers like you hate your loved ones

987
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,760
But it's true, you know

988
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,300
It's true

989
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,620
Most murders are of people that you know

990
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,940
That's right, so...

991
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
Most of the people I killed were people I knew

992
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:34,120
You can do this by playing with yourself every night

993
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,220
I'm playing with myself now

994
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,360
I wouldn't stop and save it just for the night

995
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,320
I find if it's good at night, it must be good all day long

996
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,720
Then, before you go to sleep

997
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,640
Play with yourself some more

998
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Now, a clear statement of what you wish to accomplish following play with yourself

999
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,380
Well, I, I, do I have to...

1000
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,140
I've got to play with myself to know what I've got to accomplish

1001
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,860
It's the only way I can wrench it from my memory, so to speak

1002
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:06,240
And request your subconscious mind to work during the night playing with yourself to achieve your purpose

1003
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:06,640
A super...

1004
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,060
Then I just pull it out

1005
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,600
Like, whole...

1006
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,920
Self...

1007
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,040
So to speak

1008
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,040
A hapless star

1009
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,240
And verily, though I say unto ye

1010
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,680
Were that in something that I said

1011
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,280
Then I say it again

1012
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,720
With that which I said forthwith

1013
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,840
Playing with myself with my pocket stun guard

1014
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,300
To keep me safe from myself

1015
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,480
Because if I get carried away, I could hurt myself

1016
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,780
Well, now, don't run with those scissors, then, then

1017
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,160
And, uh, I'm a Tennessee toothpick of mine

1018
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,640
You can't be too careful

1019
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:41,660
Oh, wow, yeah

1020
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,200
Boy, don't wave that thing around, uh, too close, you know, uh, that's just a...

1021
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,740
And notice it's got a deluxe ink pen attached

1022
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,680
Well, okay, all right, be a show-off

1023
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,520
I can draw in both black as well as red

1024
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,220
Well, some...

1025
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,100
I never had no education myself...

1026
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,320
And look at the way it folds up

1027
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,060
Wow

1028
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,140
And fits in its specially designed pouch

1029
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,360
So smart, so chic, so hip, so pop...

1030
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,240
I call it Big John

1031
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,260
So, how, how you say, incroyable?

1032
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,040
It's a legend in steel

1033
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,860
I salute you on both cheeks

1034
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,360
Mwah, mwah

1035
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,040
Oh, thank you, and now one over here

1036
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,560
This shall be your medal, Medvedev

1037
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,140
And one here

1038
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:22,640
Blackjack

1039
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,900
He wanted me to perform the osculus infandum

1040
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,800
I had to think fast or be forever inducted into his fiendish devil cult

1041
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,940
I don't feel well...

1042
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,000
My fiendish devil cult...

1043
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,840
I think I'd better lie down on the sofa over there

1044
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,340
Uh, call it a fiendish devil cult, if you will, but I can't...

1045
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,840
I call it a birthday party time

1046
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:46,820
You weren't supposed to hear my inward meditation there, but I agree, it does have the semblance of a party...

1047
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,860
Why, it's a mirror butt fantasy with a dragon banging your head

1048
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,120
As I said, I think I need to go lie down over there, I hope you'll excuse me for a minute...

1049
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,700
Futuristic fantasy such as this can't be bought at any price

1050
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,960
David, what would you say if I told you I won $1200 this afternoon?

1051
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,160
I'd say you're mighty lucky

1052
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,920
I can tear my lottery ticket up, I guess...

1053
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,060
Who?

1054
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,620
And I'm going out with you tonight

1055
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,860
But you had a theory about luck...

1056
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,020
I know you've got some cash...

1057
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,780
...a little bit earlier, Colonel...

1058
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,960
And that makes you very attractive to me...

1059
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,780
A theory that the concept of fairness is basically unfair...

1060
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,240
You know that's sincere, I mean it that way...

1061
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:24,820
Okay...

1062
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,400
Security plus, something you can't buy...

1063
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:27,460
Believe it or not!

1064
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,520
A price barrier such as this on these stun guns is broken by Bud K...

1065
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,420
Everything you can buy in a store and a little bit more...

1066
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,760
Hey, how about that, Bud K?

1067
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,620
Believe it or not!

1068
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:45,080
They sell 11th century Mongolian knives for less than 10 bucks...

1069
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,120
Man, they've got some killer...

1070
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,560
Look at this thing, I love this one, man...

1071
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,500
What's that, brass knucks or some horrible...

1072
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,960
It's a sword with like spiked knuckles on the sword, a blade at both ends...

1073
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,660
You know the people who buy this stuff are really big softies with beards who would never ever know...

1074
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,980
They wouldn't hurt a fly...

1075
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:05,200
Yeah, right...

1076
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,420
If they saw a fly on the end of the knife in such a way that all they had to do was just impale it...

1077
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,620
They would just, you know, let it go...

1078
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,180
At least this is what we tell ourselves for our own comfort and reassurance...

1079
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,900
The other alternative is too awful to believe in...

1080
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:25,200
Which is that actual aggressive psychos buy these dreadful and readily available weapons...

1081
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,440
Not big soft...

1082
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,280
Why don't...

1083
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,880
It seems wrong...

1084
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,500
Why don't they market these to the crazy weirdos they'd sell more of?

1085
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:33,980
It's horrible...

1086
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:42,840
There's only a few big softies with weapons that don't want to kill, but it seems like there's lots of people out there with weapons that want to kill...

1087
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,800
One must have the willingness to use the weapon no matter how one is armed...

1088
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,040
This classic favorite becomes a contemporary fad to carry around your black razor...

1089
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,800
Ew, put it away...

1090
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,760
You know, some people are just... they just like to caress the weapon...

1091
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,020
And yet for me, the gas turbo pocket torch packing powerful heat is the only weapon to buy...

1092
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,680
Well, uh, different, uh, spells for different...

1093
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,340
I'm powerfully successful as an assassin with my...

1094
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,080
Three...

1095
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,500
Track down any prey...

1096
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:18,760
Time, time, time, time...

1097
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,660
Evil, destruction, death...

1098
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,180
Death...

1099
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,200
Death...

1100
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,960
Death...

1101
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,160
Death...

1102
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,800
Out of the slime and darkness it comes, it comes, it comes, it comes...

1103
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,360
The unprotected...

1104
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:50,780
Yeti!

1105
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,860
The Unprotected Down

1106

IH supports realmedth

1108
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,120
Happy New Year 2020

1109
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,680
The uninformed.

1110
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,580
The uninformed.

1111
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,100
Peddlers of misery.

1112
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,600
Peddlers of misery.

1113
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,760
Plowing had begun.

1114
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,620
The shunted and unloved.

1115
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,860
Let it begin here.

1116
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,640
The unguided.

1117
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,160
Candidates for the slave world.

1118
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,740
Candidates for the slave world.

1119
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,240
Swelling for a long time.

1120
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:42,240
Take a lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices, add to it ignorance and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

1121
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,660
That tight society of drug addicts.

1122
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,980
Freedom.

1123
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:49,880
Freedom.

1124
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:50,660
Pushing dope.

1125
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:51,660
Personal.

1126
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,420
Pushing dope.

1127
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,400
Personal.

1128
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,180
Pushing dope.

1129
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,160
Personal.

1130
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,900
Pushing dope.

1131
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,020
Personal.

1132
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,320
Plenty of fun and laughs.

1133
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,920
Thriving urge to build and grow.

1134
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,100
If you want to swing, call them.

1135
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,820
Right now, he's got to split.

1136
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,740
But then that thriving urge came welling up.

1137
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,400
Today and tomorrow and tomorrow.

1138
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,100
Could not be contained.

1139
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,800
Under the rolling bulge.

1140
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,600
Suddenly, that's all gone.

1141
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,620
Under the rolling bulge.

1142
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,720
The party is swinging.

1143
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,380
Lay deep layers.

1144
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,200
In a real life tragedy.

1145
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,320
Air of freedom.

1146
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,120
Throw out the sucker bait.

1147
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,960
It's time for the next step.

1148
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,320
Air of freedom.

1149
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,060
That's where the real action is.

1150
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,600
And went to work.

1151
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,580
That's where the real action is.

1152
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,720
And went to work.

1153
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,880
Take a trip from Squaresville.

1154
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,140
It rained all night.

1155
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,100
The pot party.

1156
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,000
It rained all night.

1157
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,680
The trippers.

1158
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,640
New power.

1159
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,360
All gathered in secrecy.

1160
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,340
New power.

1161
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,240
And flying high as a kite.

1162
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:51,480
Power.

1163
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,140
Pony world.

1164
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,360
Power.

1165
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,120
Pony world.

1166
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,320
Power.

1167
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,260
Shame. Arrest. Prison.

1168
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:55,820
Power.

1169
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,900
They can lie.

1170
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,500
Forget it, man, and get with the countdown.

1171
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,800
Shake this square world and blast off for Kicksville.

1172
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,260
But they were wrong.

1173
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,420
No one to interfere with the fun.

1174
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,220
But they were wrong.

1175
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,460
No one to interfere with the fun.

1176
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,740
All this empire building.

1177
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,960
The natural defenses are crumbling.

1178
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,800
The barriers of caution are beaten down.

1179
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,540
Going on.

1180
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,540
See the stupidity of it all.

1181
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,540
Going on.

1182
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,500
See the stupidity of it all.

1183
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,180
Some odds and ends.

1184
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,700
He's having kicks.

1185
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,160
Some odds and ends.

1186
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,480
He's having kicks.

1187
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,140
Some odds and ends.

1188
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:35,340
Some odds and ends.

1189
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:35,340


1190
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,060
Up. Out.

1191
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,240
An odd and n.

1192
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,400
Some odds and ends.

1193
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:40,660
deh.

1194
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,140
But everything that goes up must come down.

1195
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,520
Electric fire.

1196
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,900
The same problems.

1197
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,560
The same responsibilities.

1198
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,660
Electric fire.

1199
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,460
The same problems.

1200
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,120
The same responsibilities.

1201
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,320
Electricity.

1202
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,240
Electricity.

1203
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,280
Electricity.

1204
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,220
Electricity.

1205
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,240
What hath God wrought?

1206
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,240
What hath God wrought?

1207
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:00,900
Burn.

1208
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,280
Burn.

1209
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:01,800
Burn.

1210
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,040
Burn fear of freedom.

1211
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:03,480
Burn.

1212
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,980
Fear of freedom, human endeavor, and a network of wires.

1213
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,140
Me, me, me, me, power possibilities.

1214
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,900
Here was the strength of men's backs, the muscles of their animals.

1215
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,920
Kitch, kitch, katchy, katchy, katchy, katchy.

1216
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,660
The ordinary everyday people.

1217
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,460
Here was power.

1218
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,860
Titanically muscle power.

1219
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,180
Hot power, hot power, gently warming a sleeping child.

1220
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:33,180
Magic power, magic power, man with man, man with man.

1221
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,340
Brilliant power.

1222
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,060
Power to expand, power to expand, power, power, power, power.

1223
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,660
New freedom of the mind.

1224
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,920
Freedom from drudgery.

1225
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,620
Surged forward.

1226
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,180
By Reverend Norrell Preff at HeavyConfetti.com

1227
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,820
There's a lot of class division.

1228
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,940
And this country.

1229
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:12,820
And I would hate to use, you know, ethnic slurs or put downs like po-bucker or so forth.

1230
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,240
Just for people of a lower educational or spiritual level than myself.

1231
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,140
Fig pluckers.

1232
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,480
Humans.

1233
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,620
What?

1234
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,180
Yeah.

1235
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,180
Fig pluckers.

1236
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:22,460
Whatever.

1237
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,960
Bad words like that.

1238
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,380
I don't like pinks.

1239
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,800
Pinks, po-buckers, you know, mediocritans.

1240
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,760
I hate to use that kind of language to describe normal people.

1241
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:32,800
I hate to use that kind of language to describe normal people.

1242
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,420
Normal people and other completely atheists.

1243
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,520
Normal people and other completely atheists.

1244
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,800
The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena.

1245
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,780
The video drone.

1246
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,240
The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye.

1247
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,540
Therefore the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain.

1248
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,700
Therefore whatever appears on the television screen...

1249
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,800
Therefore whatever appears on the television screen...

1250
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,160
for those who watch it.

1251
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,780
Therefore, television is reality,

1252
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,140
and reality is less than television.

1253
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,860
Max, I'm so glad you came to me.

1254
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,360
I've been through it all myself, you see.

1255
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,300
Your reality is already half video hallucination.

1256
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,120
If you're not careful, it will become total hallucination.

1257
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,900
You'll have to learn to live in a very strange new world.

1258
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,400
I had a brain tumor, and I had visions.

1259
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,180
I believed the visions caused the tumor and not the reverse.

1260
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,100
I could feel the visions coalesce and become flesh.

1261
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,140
Uncontrollable.

1262
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:06,240
But when they removed the tumor, it was called Videodrome.

1263
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:17,980
I was Videodrome's first victim.

1264
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,820
But who's behind it? What do they want?

1265
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,800
I want you, Max.

1266
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,960
You.

1267
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,000
Come to me.

1268
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,780
Come to Nikki.

1269
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,860
Come on.

1270
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,960
Don't make me wait.

1271
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,300
Please.

1272
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,300
You are listening to

1273
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,760
the Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1274
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,180
You can get more information about it,

1275
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,280
from, got that pencil ready,

1276
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,580
Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1277
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,000
That's the Northern Ohio branch office, anyway.

1278
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,320
Learn everything at www.subgenius.com

1279
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,960
because time is running out.

1280
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:21,540
There are people in most countries who would like to live in the Republic of the United States

1281
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,600
or the Dominion of Canada where that good oligocole is sold.

1282
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,380
The citizens of our countries are the envy of many people elsewhere

1283
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,240
because of the personal freedom which we have enjoyed.

1284
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,180
Why then doesn't every country adopt a form of free government?

1285
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,100
One answer is that unfortunately there are people and parties in many nations

1286
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,820
who are so greedy for power that they will sacrifice the freedom of their fellow countrymen

1287
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,520
to obtain power for themselves.

1288
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,780
History, even recent history, is replete with such instances.

1289
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,580
That is why the citizens of the Republic of the United States,

1290
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,200
and the Dominion of Canada,

1291
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,960
must be careful to recognize at its very beginning

1292
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,720
any movement to steal or limit their freedom.

1293
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,500
That is not always easy.

1294
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,460
The man who would enslave a free people doesn't begin by saying,

1295
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,580
now I'm going to be your dictator.

1296
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,660
Instead, he probably will claim that he is a devoted supporter of personal freedom.

1297
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,200
But all the while he will support policies that weaken and undermine personal freedom.

1298
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,280
Such a man will deny any totalitarian aims.

1299
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,560
But free citizens must not be deceived

1300
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,580
by such denials.

1301
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,200
Apparently it is a cardinal principle of every sincere totalitarian

1302
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,220
that he is justified in lying,

1303
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,280
if such lies will advance his plans.

1304
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,820
In these times, no public figure,

1305
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,840
and no party or organization supporting such a person

1306
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,760
can be accepted without careful consideration.

1307
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,060
Every public figure and organization must be carefully scrutinized.

1308
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,420
And if their real aims are to limit or to destroy our freedom as individuals,

1309
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,040
they must be opposed and defeated.

1310
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:06,260
Now and in the fractions of eight years I'll be worn-out even more,

1311
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,420
with the
