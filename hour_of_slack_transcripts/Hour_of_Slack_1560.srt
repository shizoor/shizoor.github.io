1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,500
From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,820
All right, Mac.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,660
You got it?

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,260
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,120
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,360
Handle it gentle now.

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,120
All right.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,320
I've got it.

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,760
Here.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,640
All right.

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,900
One, two, four, three.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,920
The subgenius.

13
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,140
Power of the subgenius.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,580
I'll crawl in first.

15
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,240
Good, though.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,680
Yeah.

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,520
Okay, now, let's get to work.

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:30,880
Here.

19
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,440
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.

20
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,240
Six grenades.

21
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,720
Yeah, that ought to do it.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,640
Here we go.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,840
Here we go.

24
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:28,660
Here we go.

25
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,120
Here we go.

26
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,300
Here we go.

27
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,620
Here we go.

28
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,620


29
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,620


30
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,620


31
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,260
We're walking overtime.

32
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,980
We're walking overtime.

33
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,520
We're walking overtime.

34
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,140
We're walking overtime.

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,780
Ah, yes, praise the Fantastic Plastics who did that song over time.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,980
If you ever get a chance to see them live, their show has great visuals.

37
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,980
Meanwhile, we're still at the 9th Megafist Temple Lodge in Stangsville, Texas,

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,280
not in the WCSB Cleveland studios, and I could do reruns and will later,

39
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,540
but when possible, we'd rather present recent call-ins to Radio Synesthesia.

40
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:34,440
And these particular show clips were recorded January and February 2016 with host Dr. Sinister.

41
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,560
No topic is too strange or abstruse.

42
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,500
And hello, you're on the air.

43
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,440
Oh, I was wondering if I was on the air yet.

44
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,000
Anyway, oh, I'm sorry. I don't talk like this right now.

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,720
Hey, how you doing, man?

46
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,640
Not too bad. How are you doing?

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,280
I'm dysfunctional.

48
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,520
I just put down.

49
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:58,640
I'm brought in by Curtis Lee Mayne, one of the seven generals in the seven generals in May.

50
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,460
I like, or I think it was General Walker who attacked it.

51
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,640
The U.S. Post, believing that he was going to save us from communism,

52
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,560
and he was the inspiration for Jaxie Ripper, General Ripper, and Dr. Strangely.

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,900
That's right. A real American.

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Yep. Something we all aspire to, especially nowadays.

55
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,480
And there's so much division and complicated mathematics involved in something or another, I guess.

56
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,700
I don't know.

57
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,720
You know, and not to mention the fact that, you know, all of decorum has just gone out the window.

58
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,360
I mean, people actually fight in the war room now.

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,760
Oh, I heard there was a big builder-buyer meeting somewhere in Andorra or something like that.

60
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,920
And one of these secret Illuminati leaders of the world broke wind loudly as they passed the cafeteria window.

61
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,820
Well, that is...

62
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,940
I guess maybe it was just, you know, slumming or something.

63
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
No, it was a cafeteria here, but of course it was for the slaves, you know.

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,760
Well, crop dusting the slaves in the cafeteria is one of the initiation rituals.

65
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm sorry, but that was a male prescription.

66
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,400
I could just see one of these windbags doing just exactly what you said.

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah, I may have a big target on my back for revealing that Masonic secret, but...

68
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,900
Well, I don't know.

69
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:21,900


70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,360
Well, as long as you know the three fingers are the...

71
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,840
What is it again?

72
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,280
Something that's on a handshake or something, right?

73
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,520
There are a few secret handshakes I've learned over the years.

74
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,400
A few secret passwords, signs and countersigns.

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,400
Yeah.

76
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,920
Yeah, I remember a lot of those.

77
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,960
They take them away from you as soon as they...

78
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,440
Responsibly, of course, they take them away from you.

79
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,460
But they be giving to you.

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,320
Mm-hmm.

81
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
It's some new edict or something.

82
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
Some platform.

83
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,180
Mm-hmm.

84
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,520
Yep.

85
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
Hey, we got another caller here.

86
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,320
Let's see what this person has to say.

87
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,140
You're psychic, you know?

88
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,760
You're on the air.

89
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,140
Hi, Dr. Sinister.

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,240
Welcome to the program, Reverend Stang.

91
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,600
Yes, I.

92
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:13,040
Well, we were talking briefly about, you know, Illuminati initiation rituals and secret handshakes.

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,720
Yeah.

94
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,600
And we just, we kind of imagined this, a real top leader, you know, perhaps with a few bodyguards walking by.

95
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,760
And it's built by Vader Meadey somewhere in Slovenia or Arctic land.

96
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,900
You know, someplace way far out there.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And he breaks wind loudly as he passes the cafeteria window.

98
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,460
But there's, you know, the cafeteria, of course, wasn't for one of the most powerful men in the world.

99
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,480
But as you know, that's the secret of the secret masters.

100
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,600
Those rubber pants they were.

101
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,820
Well, actually, they're...

102
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,020
Well, yeah, that was a...

103
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,240
That was a great...

104
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,520
As a matter of fact.

105
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,900
I don't know.

106
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,060
I don't know where to buy rubber pants anymore.

107
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,900
We based our rubber pantsuits on some of the Illuminati lower echelon ones.

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,200
But I've forgotten all the secret handshakes.

109
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,340
Well, don't you need to use some of those handshakes to, like, unzip certain valves and things that look like, you know...

110
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,440
Well, I used to when I was a Bobby, when I first joined the cult.

111
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,080
I had to...

112
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,260
I actually had to stand behind Bob and unzip his pants and stuff like that for it.

113
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,300
Just to prove that I was faithful and loyal and trustworthy.

114
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,260
But I haven't had to do any of that stuff, you know, since I kind of rose up in ranks.

115
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,840
And nobody's heard from Bob.

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,240
And somebody had to, you know, countersign the checks.

117
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,760
You know, right?

118
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,480
Well, I thought that's when you and Bob and Connie got married.

119
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,380
Not got married.

120
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,020
What is it?

121
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,480
You cohabitated someplace near St. Louis.

122
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,340
No, I never...

123
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,120
I mean, you tried to divert the Mississippi with the power of your mind.

124
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,840
And you were arrested by the Oricon Police.

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,180
Police.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,600
At least the flags are the ones we're talking about.

127
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,940
How do I...

128
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,700
We've got a new political party for subgeniuses.

129
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,080
To make Dobstown great again.

130
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,240
And I think both of you guys will get behind it.

131
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,340
Just because of the name.

132
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,120
The Loudly Complaining Party.

133
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,960
I could get behind that.

134
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,720
Although, I do have some...

135
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,020
What about...

136
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,560
It'd be like...

137
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,720
It would be like all political stupidity rolled up into one huge clique of whining assholes.

138
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,900
Whatever happened to the...

139
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,500
And the whole point of it is...

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,540
My one-cent solitary complaint...

141
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:33,980
Why?

142
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,860
It can be quoted easily.

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,260
...express your anger.

144
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,840
And that's all.

145
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,220
That's it.

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,400
That's the whole point of the Loudly Complaining Party.

147
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,860
Whatever happened to the...

148
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,320
Just to show people how mad you really are.

149
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,940
Whatever happened to the Patriot Psychotic Anarcho-Materialist Party?

150
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,580
That didn't feel as good.

151
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,700
That was a little too sensible.

152
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
I see.

153
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,560
A little too, you know, gender-specific.

154
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,260
Gender-specific?

155
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,020
It was probably the most general.

156
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,880
Patriot Psychotic Anarcho-Materialism encompassed almost all extremism and middle-of-the-road.

157
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,580
As long as you left us alone.

158
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,360
That was the problem.

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,360
But the prattling prey bobs of positivity had to go and sweeten it up and make it nice.

160
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,360
So I'm just saying...

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Just cut all the...

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:21,900
Just cut all the crap.

163
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,120
It's the Loudly Complaining Party.

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,080
That's what we do.

165
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,640
We're always going to do.

166
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,740
Whenever there's work to be done in government, we will simply loudly complain.

167
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:39,420
And I bet you we get re-elected because that's what everybody wants is to loudly complain.

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,300
The louder the louder.

169
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:51,600
You need to release all these pent-up emotions that are created by government and capitalist lobbies and compliments.

170
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,080
You know, the over-the-hill handshake, the old under-the-sideways-button-removal technique.

171
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,840
Yeah, the under-the-arms sniffle.

172
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,020
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
So these guys have been at it for a long time.

174
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,420
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,260
I got tired of going to those meetings.

176
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,680
Of course.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,060
I'm just, you know, I've quit hanging out with the secret rulers and Bob's friends.

178
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,800
I just can't handle it.

179
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
I'm not cut out for that.

180
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
I don't have the right haircut.

181
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,740
Right here?

182
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,780
They laughed at me.

183
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,900
They laughed at me.

184
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,000
Nobody has.

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,760
You know, they pranked me and made fun of me.

186
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,900
It's like, well, okay, if you don't want to subgenius sacred scribe around, I'll just come to these parties.

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,380
So I did.

188
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,220
I guess they didn't want to subgenius sacred scribe around.

189
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,440
Well.

190
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Well, maybe it was like cursive writing in the old days.

191
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,040
They didn't really want...

192
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Actually, I really do have a bad cold.

193
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,420
I'm probably not going to want to stay on for long, guys.

194
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,440
You don't have a sump pump now that you're taking care of?

195
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

196
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:09,380
I called you up in order so that everyone hearing the sound of my voice now will get the cold I have.

197
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,480
I did this a couple of years ago.

198
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,940
It was so contagious that just over the radio waves, people caught the cold.

199
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
Well, Charles...

200
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,700
Believe it.

201
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:20,980
Believe it.

202
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,040


203
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,040


204
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,760
You don't want it.

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,600
You do not want this particular winter cold.

206
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,420
This is infectious radio here.

207
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,680
Yeah.

208
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,360
And I'm just a...

209
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:37,080
Like this one kid said to me in Fort Worth when I was 10 years old.

210
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,940
Well, heck, Smith, you're just a bucket of snot.

211
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,080
And I quote.

212
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
That was...

213
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,880
They called me Smith then.

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,960
Snot bucket.

215
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,040
Snot bucket.

216
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,040


217
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,340
Bucket Smith.

218
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,500
Yeah.

219
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,020
So, snot bucket Smith.

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,040
It was accurate.

221
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,280
And it is accurate again.

222
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,520
If I could find that guy now, I'd say,

223
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,160
Sir, Sirah, you were right.

224
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:10,040
Standing there as a crossing guard in sixth grade, fathers in fifth grade, you were right.

225
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,560
I was a bucket of snot.

226
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,940
And you will too, B1, for just being this near to me so I could say that.

227
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,060
Gotta spread the love, man.

228
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,920
My favorite part about getting sick is spreading the disease to others.

229
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,460
Me too.

230
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,080
I love that.

231
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
Well, I've been pretty nice.

232
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,880
I mean, all I did was get on one radio show that would spread it to.

233
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,600
And it's a college station without a really huge reach.

234
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,720
So, unless we put it on the internet or something.

235
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Oh, that's right.

236
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,240
The internet.

237
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,260
Oh, man.

238
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,080
People in Germany are going to be getting sick.

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,120
Oh, yeah.

240
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,200
Oh, yeah.

241
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,080
Oh, yeah.

242
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,540
Oh, yeah.

243
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,160
Oh, yeah.

244
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,240
Oh, yeah.

245
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, yeah.

246
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,720
Oh, yeah.

247
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,020
Oh, yeah.

248
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


249
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


250
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


251
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


252
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


253
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


254
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,020


255
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,400
It just sucks me from having kind of a tubercular nature.

256
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,940
That's why I just expel some earth there during that cough.

257
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,080
You said you have a tubercular nature?

258
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah.

259
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,820
Don't we all in some way or another?

260
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,840
Consumptive.

261
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,600
We really think about it.

262
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,660
Doesn't it all make sense now?

263
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,560
You sound like you're sounding better than normal.

264
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,180
Yeah.

265
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah.

266
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,000
I've laid healing down.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000


268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000


269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000


270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,940
power on you. It's not in my

271
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,000
hands, it's in my feet,

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,120
but it works at great distances

273
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,980
and I can point

274
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,500
it pretty much like a turret of a gun,

275
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,480
like a whip around on one of them

276
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,440
and Humvees and stuff like that.

277
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,920
I've gotten quite good at it

278
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,960
on my hand. You know what's funny? Today I saw a train

279
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,040
with a whole bunch of

280
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,340
Humvees on it.

281
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,980
One of the train

282
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,840
cars was stacked with

283
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,000
like two layers high

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,900
of Humvees.

285
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,240
I just wonder if it made you think twice

286
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
or if you noticed it

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
and it was like out of the ordinary.

288
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,240
Well,

289
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,860
most things make me think more than twice.

290
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,160
Think what?

291
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,860
More than twice.

292
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,620
Thrice even.

293
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,800
I've certainly

294
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
think things multiple times.

295
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,320
I sort of know what you mean. There's times

296
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,360
when I'll think of something and then later on

297
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll think about it again and I'll think about it

298
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,460
some more and then I start

299
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,440
getting really confused.

300
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,400
And I go back to the story.

301
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,600
Now I know what you're talking about.

302
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,520
That was so much simpler. That first thought I had.

303
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,980
I'll just ignore all those complications

304
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,720
that I layered onto it.

305
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,380
I'll stick with that first simple thought.

306
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Simple thoughts.

307
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,200
Which I think was along the lines of

308
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,920
I think I'll have a beer now.

309
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,320
Something like that.

310
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,480
You think twice about it

311
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,840
and you go, no, I shouldn't have a beer.

312
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,520
Then you think again and go, but wait, why not?

313
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,420
Then, you know,

314
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,400
it snowballs.

315
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,360
The next thing you know, you're drinking the beer anyway.

316
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,800
So why not just

317
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
go back to go and

318
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,500
as Bob said,

319
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,300
too much is always better than not enough.

320
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,800
It's not true.

321
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,200
It sounds so great.

322
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
I think you're inferring that

323
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,060
thought is a form of sickness.

324
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,900
Bob taught that

325
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,140
it is. That in fact,

326
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,320
if you can break thinking and break

327
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,300
your habit of thinking and simply

328
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,480
react instantly.

329
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,180
But pure

330
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,780
instinct.

331
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,620
Surfing the luck plane entirely.

332
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,020
You may end up in jail,

333
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,440
but you'll be more like Bob.

334
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,740
I don't know if that's good.

335
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,300
Try it and find out.

336
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,860
Kids, go ahead.

337
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,820
I remember when he was 11.

338
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,180
It says on everybody's subgenius minister

339
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,300
card that the church is not

340
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,680
responsible for his or her actions.

341
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,020
That's right.

342
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,680
Point there.

343
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,280
That's my way of

344
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,380
my raison d'etre as well.

345
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,640
Rationality and then

346
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,660
uh,

347
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,160
I don't know. Hey, how do you guys like my new

348
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,780
phone? I got a brand new phone.

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,840
I mean really new. I got

350
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,500
it Friday.

351
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,040
I haven't dropped it in the toilet once

352
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,720
yet. Sounds alright.

353
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,960
I can't hear you guys

354
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
any better than normal even with it on

355
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
speakerphone and with it.

356
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm plastered against my one good ear,

357
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,200
but I would think you could probably

358
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,860
hear me better.

359
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,280
You sound okay.

360
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,860
I noticed that as I get older,

361
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,800
I have to look down much further when I

362
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,240
watch myself make peepee monsters and stuff.

363
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,200
And I was my glasses always fall in the

364
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,560
toilet.

365
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,700
As I look down.

366
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm surprised,

367
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,120
Gabe, with a nose like yours,

368
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm you'd have to be bending over pretty

369
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,240
far for me to get over that hump.

370
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,480
That's what I was trying to say.

371
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,740
Hey, there's a kind of a crook,

372
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,460
a hump thing, kind of a dick.

373
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,080
Dave, for the radio listeners who don't have

374
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,960
vibraphones, Dave has kind of a Dick Tracy like

375
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,340
nose.

376
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,200
He looks kind of like if Dick Tracy was an

377
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,860
Indian and and balding.

378
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,620
Hmm.

379
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,820
Remember about always.

380
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,660
It's important to know.

381
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,340
Never saw that until you mentioned it.

382
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,600
Were they tonight on what?

383
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,860
Whereas I look more like the Dick Tracy

384
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,180
character, prune face.

385
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,000
Good old prune face.

386
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,420
Doesn't wear a beard so you can't tell.

387
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,780
So it doesn't look that bad.

388
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,260
There's also a slight demonic thing going on there.

389
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,600
How would you put it?

390
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,160
Um, demonic thing too going on.

391
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Demonic mnemonic.

392
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,680
Demonic mnemonics.

393
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,980
Oh yeah, man.

394
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,060
That's that's subject well worth exploring.

395
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,160
Demonic mnemonics.

396
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,100
Hell has a long memory.

397
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,760
Discuss what?

398
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,100
OK, if there was a doctor, if there was a

399
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,560
radio synesthesia movie, a big budget movie

400
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,860
directed by, say, the Coen brothers who would

401
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,100
play Doctor Sinister?

402
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,720
I don't know.

403
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,000
Um, I mean, ideally Johnny Depp, but he's too

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,280
short.

405
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,860
If if if Ivan Stang was right, if if if I was

406
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,240
going to be a character and then of course

407
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,360
Johnny Depp would have to play.

408
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,780
Seymour Interrelated with Michael Gibson

409
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,080
I've made from the movie.

410
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,080


411
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,900
Okras as a textbook

412
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:32,920
genealogy.

413
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,840
He's young man but rather than

414
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,160
George 이것

415
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:44,700
cled in P shit as in Bill

416
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,000
よو

417
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,320
now

418
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,600
Nothing.

419
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,880
I could play myself.

420
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,980
Yeah, yeah, that would be the best way to go.

421
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,780
I don't know.

422
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,400
No, no, that never works.

423
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
I don't think any famous actors really look that much like me.

424
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
Let's take another caller here, though.

425
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,140
216-687-3515.

426
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,340
I knew he was going to change the subject.

427
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,020
I knew that he would change the subject.

428
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,800
That was why I did that.

429
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,820
Hello, you're on the air.

430
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,920
Dr. Sandberg?

431
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,920
I've heard that Sinister has a slightly, you know, potterish...

432
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,620
I'm Edwin Brody.

433
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,020
Edwin Brody as Dr. Sinister.

434
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,520
That's it.

435
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,240
Dr. Sinister.

436
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,520
What's up, skeptic?

437
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,260
This is the management.

438
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,520
The management.

439
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm the management.

440
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,500
Robert Anton Wilson has come back from the grave?

441
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,100
He used to post as, well, the MGP,

442
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,640
which people assumed was the management,

443
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,900
but it really meant the midget.

444
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,940
No, no, I'm the management.

445
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,580
I'm the management of the show, actually.

446
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,320
I'm calling in to let you know that

447
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,740
I've been speaking with the consultants.

448
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,740
It's okay if you're a midget.

449
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,340
No, he's my manager.

450
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,840
That's right.

451
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,120
He's like my agent, you know.

452
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,820
It's a new year,

453
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,020
and there's going to be some cuts

454
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,100
because that's what consultants do.

455
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,780
And I don't know if they've told you,

456
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,640
but they're cutting some of the phone lines,

457
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,840
you know, from four to three,

458
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,880
and maybe three to two.

459
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,780
Going to have to have some lean times here.

460
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,600
You know, we need synesthesia to go lean this year.

461
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
Well, I've been going...

462
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,100
I've been pretty lean on the callers

463
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,260
for more than a year now.

464
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,200
I know.

465
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,020
Does that mean I get to hang up now?

466
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,960
We need to bring those callers back in.

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,640
We need to stop the lameness.

468
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,420
We need good entertainment

469
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,140
for the airwaves, the CSB,

470
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,880
and all the listeners of Cleveland State, right?

471
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,060
That's true.

472
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,200
That is certainly true.

473
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,660
Right.

474
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,320
We need management with energy.

475
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,480
If only we could be louder and funnier or something.

476
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,800
We need change.

477
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,560
So, how are we going to change it around this year?

478
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
We need big, bold ideas.

479
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,120
Bold ideas.

480
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,820
Okay.

481
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,080
Right, Chief?

482
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,640
I mean, sure.

483
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,880
Big, bold ideas, huh?

484
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
Oh, you're...

485
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,820
Old Christmas balls.

486
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,260
Don't be afraid.

487
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,180
We need big ideas and...

488
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,760
Different, fuzz and different.

489
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,640
That's what we need.

490
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,180
Indifference and fuzz.

491
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,780
Yeah, you see, when people call in,

492
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,600
they want to hear more.

493
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,940
They want to hear more than indifference.

494
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,440
They want to hear alacrity, alarm.

495
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
They want to hear...

496
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,360
Subversion.

497
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,800
They want to hear people crying out in the wilderness.

498
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,520
Or they just want to talk about being drunk.

499
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,880
That's just so much to a lot of people.

500
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,400
Falling asleep right now.

501
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,020
I need some bigger, better ideas.

502
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,700
Well, let's make use of the four phone lines while we have them all.

503
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,940
Hello, you're on the air.

504
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,280
Hello.

505
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,260
Welcome to the program, Mark.

506
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,840
Yeah, good to talk to the subgeni again.

507
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm not on the air anymore.

508
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,340
Reverend Spade,

509
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,460
okay, first, I was very moved by the...

510
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,380
your father's, you know, elegy

511
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,160
that I heard on the previous program.

512
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,700
That was...

513
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,180
He really did a great job of...

514
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,360
writing up his...

515
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,560
something to read upon his own death.

516
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah, I can see where you got your sense of humor

517
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,540
besides the Fireside Theater, of course.

518
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,340
Huh?

519
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,280
I said...

520
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,640
I can see that you got a lot of your sense of humor from your father.

521
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,220
And of course, you know, the other half from the Fireside Theater.

522
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,360
Yeah, two totally separate sources, believe me.

523
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,100
Mm-hmm.

524
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,300
I don't think he ever heard of the Fireside Theater.

525
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,220
And to tell the truth, although my father was a dues-paying subgenius

526
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,500
and proudly displayed his excuse and doctorate on the walls of the house here,

527
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,140
I don't think he ever once listened to the hour of slack.

528
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,140
Huh.

529
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,460
Not once.

530
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,760
My mom did a few times, although it was a bit disgruntling.

531
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:53,980
Mm-hmm.

532
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,800
I have a niece.

533
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,960
Out of everybody in my huge clan,

534
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,580
I have a niece who appreciates the hour of slack

535
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,820
and radio synesthesia.

536
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,260
She might even be listening right now.

537
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,940
Well, we all appreciate you having a niece for crying out loud.

538
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,060
He's got these body punches.

539
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,380
Well, I guess we're not...

540
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,240
We're so thankful for it.

541
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,120
Did anybody even listen to this boring, terrible radio?

542
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,840
It's just...

543
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,200
You're so charitable and kind.

544
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,320
Well, it's just because I have both my fingers in both my ears

545
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,860
and in my nose as well and stuff

546
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,680
that I'm not exactly understanding what you're saying.

547
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm falling asleep.

548
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,120
Wake up, wake up.

549
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,720
Come on, come on, snap out of it.

550
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,420
I did have a question for you, Reverend.

551
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,920
As a Texan, what do you think of Ted Cruz?

552
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,020
Ted Cruz?

553
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,460
Well, I'm not really one to ask

554
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,480
because I'm not really a Texan.

555
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,640
I wasn't born here.

556
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,020
I only grew up in Texas from the age of 5 to 40-something.

557
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,220
And then I became a nice old Ohioan.

558
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,640
But like most Texans,

559
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,380
I think Ted Cruz is something out of a Stephen King novel.

560
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,020
But so are...

561
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,680
All of his competitors.

562
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
So, you know, it's nothing new.

563
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,120
Let me put it that way.

564
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,640
It's certainly nothing new.

565
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,040
I think most Texans are intelligent, educated people,

566
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,340
but they're all in hiding.

567
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
They've mostly been in hiding

568
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,120
because the other half of the Texans are so unbelievably violent.

569
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,800
Jesus.

570
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,900
I'll say one good thing about Ted Cruz.

571
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,660
He has the integrity to tell one of those dreamer kids,

572
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:41,900
yes, I will...

573
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,860
I would try and have you deported.

574
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,060
Said it right to her face on camera.

575
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,200
Ted Cruz is not stupid.

576
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,940
What does he mean?

577
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,860
He's capitalizing on his Hispanic heritage,

578
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,340
but he's really born in Canada

579
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,180
and he wants to deport everybody tomorrow or something?

580
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,140
Oh, what's even worse,

581
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,520
I heard he actually likes Nickelback.

582
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,780
This is what I'm talking about.

583
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,980
This is a big idea.

584
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,980
A presidential candidate who likes Nickelback.

585
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,920
I like Ted Cruz,

586
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,820
and as I'm getting older,

587
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,440
I'm really seeing the point.

588
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,040
Of his policies,

589
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,160
I really think it'll make America great again.

590
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,940
Well, they play all kinds of...

591
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,060
I think they'll make America great again.

592
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,000
...metal and rough metal

593
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,360
and everything in these right-wing stations.

594
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,460
Now, they're trying to activate a segment of the population

595
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,480
that might believe everything.

596
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,820
Let's move it right.

597
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,820
Hey, we want to be fair and balanced here.

598
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,780
Make America great.

599
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,100
No, we don't want to be fair and balanced.

600
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,060
We just want to go slightly right.

601
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,360
Well, see, that's difficult to understand.

602
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,500
Most of those people...

603
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,380
People have already had prefrontal lobotomies,

604
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,020
you know, throughout their entire careers.

605
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,480
They, like, chip out little tiny teeny-teeny pieces

606
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
one at a time until finally

607
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,520
the whole article is channeled into the speech.

608
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,940
If America goes any further right,

609
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,200
we're going to go right over the cliff.

610
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,240
Yeah.

611
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,220
Yeah.

612
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,120
That's...

613
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,780
Yeah, that's...

614
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,000
You know, I heard the leader

615
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,720
of the white supremacist organization

616
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,160
that inspired the shooter in South Carolina

617
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,100
is actively campaigning for Trump.

618
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:11,840
Huh.

619
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,720
Wow.

620
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,540
That is not good.

621
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,600
Geez, they won't get to shoot people anymore

622
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
than they just did in every location

623
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,160
where he was.

624
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,360
Great, Donald Trump.

625
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,960
That doesn't mean he subscribes to the beliefs

626
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,280
of all of his supporters.

627
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,020
Not that he would deny any of those beliefs.

628
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,760
He speaks at a fourth-grade level also,

629
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,520
according to a new analysis by the Boston Globe.

630
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,300
The gay people came out of the closet.

631
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,180
Finally, dumb people are coming out of the closet.

632
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,660
It's...

633
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:40,740
It's...

634
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,480


635
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,480


636
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:41,820
It's time.

637
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,340
The stupid people came out and said,

638
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,420
I'm damn proud to be stupid.

639
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,860
Being smart just gets you killed quicker.

640
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,060
And I'm...

641
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
I'm okay with being stupid.

642
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,240
And I'm proud of it.

643
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,220
And I don't trust them smarty pants.

644
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,620
Dare to be stupid.

645
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,640
Because I don't understand them.

646
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,760
And I'm proud of that, too.

647
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,460
And, uh...

648
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,720
And it works, you know.

649
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,540
That's going to...

650
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Thanks to the internet.

651
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,220
Yeah, I...

652
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,200
I had to say one more thing about them

653
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,300
and then I'll let you go.

654
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:10,820
Um...

655
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,440
Okay, uh...

656
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,400
He...

657
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,840
Uh, yeah.

658
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,740
He was, uh...

659
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,920
At some campaign event

660
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,880
and he was talking about, like,

661
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,400
other candidates lying about him.

662
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,120
And, you know,

663
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,980
I have a young daughter.

664
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,100
Whenever she tells a lie,

665
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
she gets a spanking.

666
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,220
Um...

667
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,620
My two comments about that are,

668
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,260
one, that's another reason for me

669
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,160
to despise the guy

670
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,280
because I'm really against

671
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,100
corporal punishment.

672
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,920
And, two,

673
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,200
if Ted Cruz got a spanking

674
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,580
every time he told a lie,

675
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,800
he'd have to be hospitalized.

676
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,320
That would be a good thing, I think.

677
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,620
I think he should be spanking

678
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,160
right across the forehead right now.

679
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,460
I think he should be spanking

680
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,860
with a delicate feather, of course,

681
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,260
so I don't sound like I belong

682
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,140
in the, uh...

683
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,100
in the salt mines.

684
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,340
Okay, um...

685
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,640
At the end of the gravy train

686
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,820
right where the Petri types live.

687
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,040
Okay, I want to type the phone line

688
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,140
so I'll let another caller, uh,

689
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,500
have a chance to come in.

690
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,240
Uh, talk to you guys later.

691
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,960
Happy New Year.

692
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,000
Thank you, Mark.

693
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,100
The selfless and moneyless

694
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,240
enough money, Mark.

695
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,340
Dr. Sinister, I've got a great idea.

696
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,640
All right.

697
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,960
What if we have a synesthesia parade?

698
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,100
A synesthesia what?

699
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,460
Parade.

700
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,120
A parade?

701
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,740
Right down your favorite avenue

702
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,020
in the greater Cleveland area,

703
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,020
you can...

704
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,140
Not a really hot-looking

705
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,620
major red, some stuff like that?

706
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,120
Parade.

707
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,220
And you can finally get

708
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,140
the notice that you are deserving of.

709
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,260
Everybody loves a parade,

710
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,320
except for the people

711
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,960
who would be using that street

712
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,480
ordinarily at the time

713
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,700
that the parade is taking place.

714
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,740
Well, you know...

715
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,020
Hundreds of poor mom-and-pop stores

716
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,480
have had to forward a meal

717
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,360
and have to serve them.

718
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Again, because of the synesthesia,

719
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920
Dr. Sinister parade.

720
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,040
Yeah.

721
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,040
So skeptic.

722
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,000
Who should play Dr. Sinister

723
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
in the synesthesia movie?

724
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,040
No money, Mark.

725
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,340
It's really irrelevant at this point

726
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,000
because I'm not doing my job

727
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,920
as your management

728
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,720
unless we take this global.

729
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,160
We have to expand.

730
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,600
We have to have progress.

731
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,020
We have to have...

732
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,700
Content floss.

733
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
Really push forward.

734
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,020
Okay.

735
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,840
It's international.

736
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,640
Content floss as Dr. Sinister.

737
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,320
Content floss?

738
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,340
Is it...

739
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,420
Content floss as Dr. Sinister?

740
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,800
When are you going to book

741
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,400
your first huge guest?

742
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,080
I mean, just huge guest.

743
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
You got to get him out.

744
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,680
Or her.

745
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,360
Or it.

746
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,960
I don't know.

747
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,140
You got to get somebody big.

748
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,060
Somebody really big, huh?

749
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,900
I mean, huge.

750
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:27,960
Huge.

751
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,020
Huge.

752
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,120
Why don't you see

753
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,720
if you can get Governor Kasich

754
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,040
with his rampant neofascist ideas

755
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,180
to come on and defend himself

756
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,320
about all of this?

757
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,720
Sometimes he done lied

758
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,500
to all the people

759
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
of the great state,

760
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,660
of the Buckeye State,

761
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,800
on the Great Lake of Ohio.

762
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,580
I...

763
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,180
I don't know.

764
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,780
I just, you know...

765
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,060
I don't know.

766
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,180
That would be a great pick.

767
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,280
That would be...

768
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,500
That would be funny

769
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,720
if we got the governor up here,

770
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,780
but I seriously doubt

771
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,260
that's going to happen.

772
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:00,500
Can you get Lenny Kilmeister

773
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,160
on this week?

774
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,360
Can I get what?

775
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,960
Lenny Kilmeister.

776
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
I heard he's doing big things.

777
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,720
Lenny Kilmeister.

778
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:09,980
He's...

779
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,120
He's...

780
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,480
He's...

781
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,480


782
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,480


783
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,900
He's...

784
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,240
He's not available

785
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,600
for interviews.

786
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,540
That's just...

787
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,440
Just call his agent.

788
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,860
Well, yeah,

789
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,000
you don't know that.

790
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,080
A little persistence

791
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,200
pays off here, okay?

792
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,640
I heard he was

793
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,580
in a mental institution.

794
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,500
There'd be no way

795
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
you could get in touch with him

796
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,580
unless you're family

797
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,120
or something.

798
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,500
Well, maybe...

799
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,460
Okay, maybe I had

800
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,020
the wrong information.

801
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,860
It's happened before.

802
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,460
I'm sorry.

803
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,760
Well, it's...

804
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,460
The next best thing here...

805
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,880
Hello, rubber city.

806
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
It's very popular now, isn't it?

807
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,600
Motionable.

808
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,560
This is Lenny from Motorhead,

809
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,920
which serves you right anyway.

810
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,480
And you're in Cleveland,

811
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,420
which serves you right anyway.

812
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
You're listening to WCSB,

813
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,280
which serves us all right.

814
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,120
Anyway.

815
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,900
So there we go.

816
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,840
There's you.

817
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,540
I knew you could do it.

818
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,820
I knew you could do it.

819
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,900
This is why I'm getting

820
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,000
a big bonus this year.

821
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,340
I've been working

822
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,200
for Optimist Prime Consulting

823
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,040
for a long time,

824
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,880
and I knew it would come through.

825
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,060
This is...

826
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,720
This is a big bonus area.

827
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,960
I knew I could...

828
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,880
More than meets the eye.

829
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,320
Within a...

830
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,860
Marvin meets the eye.

831
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,520
I think that sounds like a name

832
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,560
for a really cool woman.

833
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,820
Marvin meets the eye.

834
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,180
Marvin meets the eye.

835
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,240
No, no.

836
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,080
You're talking about his boss,

837
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,020
Optimist Prime.

838
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,620
I'm talking about my bobs, too,

839
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,820
and there's plenty of them

840
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,240
leading them this side of the screen

841
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,260
if you're so out of it.

842
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,020
Well, this is not Dixon

843
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,680
or some kind of, you know,

844
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,200
semantics class or something.

845
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,880
They have to shoot

846
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,500
when the rain is clear

847
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,940
and blow smoke

848
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,180
or anything else you can find.

849
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,840
You know,

850
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,980
once upon a time,

851
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,220
blowing smoke up someone's butt

852
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,020
actually was a form

853
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,700
of medical treatment.

854
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,620
No, it wasn't.

855
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,480
And we probably not talk about that.

856
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,820
No, that's true.

857
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,240
That's taboo.

858
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:51,680
That's...

859
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,560
See, there you go

860
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,600
for as far as, you know,

861
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,440
your needs of having

862
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,720
a better show or whatever.

863
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,560
They used to think

864
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,260
it would revive someone

865
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,100
if they had just...

866
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
If they had just drowned.

867
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,800
Well, if it was black smoke,

868
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,380
it was no.

869
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,280
If it was white smoke,

870
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,200
it meant a new pope.

871
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,420
A black smoke

872
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,980
indicates a new poop.

873
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

874
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm a child.

875
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,300
I'm a child.

876
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,820
I'm a real child.

877
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,580
I'm a child.

878
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,180
Hey, you know,

879
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,440
the pope poops in the woods.

880
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,200
Just like the bear

881
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,800
in the necklace

882
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,580
and the holy motel mount.

883
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,000
You remember,

884
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,960
I think it was a bear

885
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,060
would whiz in the water

886
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,460
or something

887
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,300
and then it would drink the beer.

888
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,800
And that was like

889
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,860
their theocracy

890
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,480
or something

891
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,140
and their religion.

892
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,880
Bear whiz beer.

893
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,340
But like everybody else,

894
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,020
they all had the...

895
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,720
Why is it yellow?

896
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,560
By a well-armed militia

897
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,940
passing itself off

898
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,540
as a local Gestapo unit.

899
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,180
Yep.

900
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,900
I'm sorry.

901
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,220
Can we get

902
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,600
Crispin Glover on the air?

903
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,720
I don't think so.

904
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,380
There you go.

905
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,400
Crispin Glover

906
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,600
as Dr. Sinister.

907
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,500
That's perfect.

908
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,220
I don't think that'd work.

909
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,360
Crispin Glover

910
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,280
would make the perfect

911
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,080
Dr. Sinister.

912
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,340
He was born to play

913
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,260
Dr. Sinister.

914
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,180
I don't think so.

915
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,600
Why?

916
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,320
I don't think that would work at all.

917
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,100
Because he was not born

918
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,800
of humankind.

919
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,580
He's tall.

920
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
He's skinny.

921
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,080
I'm not skinny.

922
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,920
But, you know,

923
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,040
slowly going to pot.

924
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,720
Yeah.

925
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,180
Yeah.

926
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,260
So...

927
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,360
Dr. Sinister's not pink.

928
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,800
What the hell are you?

929
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,600
Yeah.

930
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,600
And he's aging.

931
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,680
Crispin Glover

932
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,320
would be perfect.

933
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,560
He's too old.

934
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,160
He's still efficient.

935
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:21,540
I mean,

936
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,420
just think of the mileage

937
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,140
you can get out

938
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,300
of having somebody else

939
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,920
play yourself.

940
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,200
You wouldn't have to go places

941
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,720
and just think

942
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,840
if he's cold for you.

943
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:28,940
He's probably only about

944
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,740
50 or so.

945
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,120
Yeah, that's a lot older than me.

946
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,160
He's only about five or six.

947
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,860
Yeah, about five.

948
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,620
Okay, okay.

949
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,720
We're getting close.

950
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,360
Can we get

951
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,580
Sweetass Sassafras

952
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,300
on the airwaves?

953
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
You'll have to contact

954
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,060
Sweetass for that.

955
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,740
I, you know,

956
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,760
maybe you can reach out

957
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,700
to his booking agent

958
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,320
and we can make

959
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,940
something happen.

960
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,660
Maybe like a

961
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,420
two-for-one deal.

962
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,320
I actually...

963
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,820
We've got to get

964
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,960
outside the box here.

965
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,300
You know,

966
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:51,940
we've got to start

967
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,760
generating some interest.

968
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,620
He actually made

969
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,100
a guest appearance

970
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,800
a couple years ago.

971
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,580
I think the only way

972
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,180
to do this

973
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,200
is to regenerate interest

974
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,460
and combine all the

975
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,060
ideas expressed tonight

976
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,740
and perhaps launch

977
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,780
their counter

978
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,580
as a candidate

979
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,960
of us to keep

980
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,380
complaining

981
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,480
as long as possible

982
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,280
with Fan Party.

983
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:09,900
Yeah,

984
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,760
the loudly complaining

985
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,480
party.

986
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,040
Well, I...

987
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,600
...or nominated, perhaps?

988
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,140
Well, I belong to the...

989
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,220
I belong to the

990
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,560
Nuclear Apocalypse Party.

991
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,880
Nuclear Populist?

992
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Nuclear Apocalypse.

993
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,260
should have one, right?

994
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
I said, you know,

995
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,120
my one...

996
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,420
the one plank

997
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,020
in my presidential platform

998
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,260
is the promise

999
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,120
of nuclear annihilation

1000
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,480
for all.

1001
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,360
The Green Apocalypse?

1002
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,060
That sounds

1003
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,580
pretty PC.

1004
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,100
The Green Apocalypse?

1005
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,640
No, I said nuclear.

1006
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,760
We went into things

1007
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,200
again.

1008
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,100
There was the past...

1009
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,380
Anyway,

1010
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:39,880
speaking of...

1011
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,940
speaking of apocalypse,

1012
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:41,960
you have been warned.

1013
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,480
Give us a call here,

1014
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,100
216-

1015
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,660
now, if you're from

1016
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,120
the SDS,

1017
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:45,660
15.

1018
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,780
You can talk about anything.

1019
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,780
And what is the current time?

1020
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
What is the current time,

1021
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,900
I was wondering?

1022
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,520
So...

1023
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,860
1134.

1024
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,400
1134.

1025
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,140
1134.

1026
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,320
I get scared.

1027
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
You're living in the past,

1028
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:57,800
Stang.

1029
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,780
1034, God.

1030
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,280
I get it.

1031
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,620
If it was 1492

1032
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,500
all over again,

1033
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,400
he'd be one of the first

1034
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,620
barbarians to conquer.

1035
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,160
I mean,

1036
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,000
we'd have to...

1037
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,340
There's the same

1038
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,860
belief systems

1039
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,340
and everything involved there.

1040
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,300
Senator,

1041
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,380
can you give away

1042
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,840
a new snowmobile?

1043
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,580
Yeah.

1044
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,640
I could give away

1045
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,300
a whole fleet

1046
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,080
of new snowmobiles.

1047
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,000
I think that if you had

1048
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,220
enough interest,

1049
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,540
we could have, like,

1050
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,920
a sweepstakes going on

1051
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,840
of some sort,

1052
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,740
and the person

1053
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,160
who comes up

1054
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,440
with the best idea

1055
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,560
to promote the show

1056
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,860
for this year

1057
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,920
would win a snowmobile ride

1058
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,860
to co-host

1059
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:39,860


1060
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,900
the show with you.

1061
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,620
What do you think about this?

1062
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,320
That sounds like

1063
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,260
a great idea for a contest.

1064
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,580
You see?

1065
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,660
You gotta think outside the box.

1066
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,220
You gotta be a problem solver.

1067
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,620
You gotta have ideas.

1068
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,140
How are you gonna...

1069
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,800
Doesn't it matter

1070
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,060
if there's not good ideas?

1071
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,500
I mean,

1072
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,280
we all have, like,

1073
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,420
Stan was saying earlier,

1074
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,540
that ideas are like snowballs

1075
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,960
that just keep rolling downhill

1076
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,720
and getting fatter and fatter

1077
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,960
until they can't move anymore.

1078
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,300
Wouldn't that be

1079
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,100
a similar situation

1080
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,720
if we had too many ideas?

1081
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,740
No, they really have to do

1082
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,380
a lot of thinking

1083
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,060
first off.

1084
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,360
Man,

1085
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,240
if I think too much,

1086
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,040
the place will start burning.

1087
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,760
Yeah.

1088
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,860
Well,

1089
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,600
you can feel that stuff, man.

1090
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,420
It's like smoke's

1091
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,300
coming out of your ears.

1092
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
Maybe in North Korea,

1093
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,320
because didn't they just have

1094
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,700
a big test over there

1095
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,200
of some sort?

1096
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,340
They're getting really excited

1097
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,540
about synesthesia, right?

1098
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,820
That's what that whole test

1099
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,220
was about?

1100
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,100
Yeah.

1101
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,440
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

1102
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,060
Kim Jong-un and I

1103
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,120
are good buddies.

1104
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,300
Right.

1105
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,400
I mean, you can get him

1106
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,440
to explain, perhaps,

1107
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,820
the nuclear program there

1108
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,220
and some of the civil rights issues

1109
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,680
or human rights issues

1110
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,520
they have and everything.

1111
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,100
You'd be made for life

1112
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
and you'd all be your, like,

1113
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,880
worshipers and stuff.

1114
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,980
You'd stop worshiping Stan

1115
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,120
and you'd start worshiping you.

1116
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,700
We'd put you on a pedestal

1117
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,080
just like we put him on one.

1118
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,280
And then we'd start

1119
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,080
making fun of you.

1120
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,240
No, I wouldn't actually

1121
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,820
allow myself to be put

1122
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,360
on a pedestal.

1123
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,500
I would put a decoy

1124
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,100
on the pedestal.

1125
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:07,980
Yeah.

1126
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,720
Well, maybe we could all copy,

1127
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,980
you know, the haircut

1128
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,400
of Kim Jong-un.

1129
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,120
I mean, it's a pretty

1130
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
good-looking cut, you know.

1131
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,440
It's fashionable.

1132
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
It's very fashionable

1133
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,940
in North Korea.

1134
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,260
In fact, I think it's the only

1135
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,100
haircut allowed by law.

1136
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
That's what I'm saying.

1137
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,900
Maybe you could, you know,

1138
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,220
sport a new look yourself

1139
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,460
and kind of come in

1140
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,280
and change it up

1141
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,240
and maybe make your guests

1142
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,540
wear the same haircut.

1143
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,980
Have, like, a parody thing

1144
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,400
going on.

1145
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,680
I don't know.

1146
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,480
Yeah.

1147
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,600
There goes the other button.

1148
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,420
Yep.

1149
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,480
I guess they know

1150
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,640
the strike zone right now,

1151
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,720
so if you guys want to,

1152
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,880
you know, you can duck

1153
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,900
under the console there.

1154
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,900
I don't know if it's going to help.

1155
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,140
Duck and cover.

1156
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,460
I really like to come up

1157
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,440
with something here

1158
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,060
for the new year.

1159
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,300
I'm looking forward

1160
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,080
to lots of laughs

1161
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,180
and lots of drive-by callers.

1162
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,080
You have come to the wrong place,

1163
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,500
my friend.

1164
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,020
But there was a time

1165
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,500
in this glory day.

1166
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,640
There was a time.

1167
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,800
I remember that time.

1168
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,700
I remember that time.

1169
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,240
And you know,

1170
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,900
I don't want to talk.

1171
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,920
Callers, you know,

1172
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,120
I don't want to talk.

1173
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,320
I don't want to talk.

1174
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,420


1175
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,500
They would come in

1176
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,020
and do their shtick

1177
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,420
and, you know,

1178
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,640
Bernie would do

1179
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,560
a drive-by call

1180
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,320
and stun the world

1181
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,240
with what he was saying.

1182
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,640
And then,

1183
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,160
just as soon as he came in,

1184
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,220
he'd disappear.

1185
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,640
And I said,

1186
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,600
who is this guy?

1187
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,620
Who is this guy

1188
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,360
running this show

1189
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,620
who's got all these

1190
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,760
great callers calling in

1191
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,960
and just keeping everybody

1192
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,760
on the edge of their seat?

1193
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,720
What's going to happen next?

1194
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,660
No, this show

1195
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
has really devolved.

1196
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,840
This is all about

1197
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,340
de-evolution.

1198
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,600
Well, you know,

1199
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,620
the stock market

1200
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,500
went through a recession

1201
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,200
or a depression

1202
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,120
in the 30s,

1203
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,880
but it bounced back.

1204
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,220
And now,

1205
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,400
look,

1206
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,800
things are doing great.

1207
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,180
So, take that,

1208
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:41,860
that,

1209
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,040
you know,

1210
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,240
you go down

1211
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,060
for a little dip

1212
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,840
and then you come

1213
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,960
right back up

1214
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,080
and you're stronger

1215
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,600
than ever.

1216
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,960
And you give it

1217
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,500
that good old

1218
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,240
college try.

1219
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,580
That good old

1220
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,380
college dropout try.

1221
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,260
Well, you know,

1222
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,400
there are many

1223
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,560
dropouts who have

1224
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,820
succeeded in life.

1225
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,460
Mm-hmm.

1226
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,060
Cliche,

1227
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,960
but Bill Gates

1228
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,700
is a dropout.

1229
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,920
That's right.

1230
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,080
I was.

1231
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,100
You see?

1232
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,320
There are success

1233
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,880
stories out there.

1234
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,900
We can make this happen

1235
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,600
for Sinister 2016.

1236
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,540
Synesthesia,

1237
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,840
super great.

1238
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,200
We got big plans.

1239
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,640
Big plans.

1240
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,580
So, what you're saying

1241
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,680
is every much as...

1242
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:19,800
Huge plans.

1243
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,500
Huge.

1244
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,740
It's going to be great.

1245
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,580
Well, there you go.

1246
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,460
Huge plans.

1247
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,980
So, we...

1248
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,240
Yep, we are going to spend

1249
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,380
more time than ever

1250
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,160
this year talking about

1251
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,520
all the people

1252
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,280
who used to call in.

1253
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,080
Oh, yeah.

1254
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,440
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,020
Yuppie.

1256
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,160
You have massive

1257
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,440
lesions on the brain,

1258
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,400
a congenital

1259
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:37,860
dysflexion,

1260
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:37,860


1261
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
and then something like...

1262
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:39,840
Oh, yeah.

1263
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,300
Yeah, but that guy,

1264
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,840
he disappeared quickly

1265
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,400
after causing

1266
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
all kinds of havoc.

1267
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,160
Don't you remember?

1268
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,580
Oh, yeah.

1269
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,220
I miss Master Sean.

1270
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,100
Well, it's Master Sean now.

1271
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,180
Well, masturbating Sean.

1272
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,200
He'd always ask us

1273
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,940
to play sex music.

1274
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,600
That's what he's

1275
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,060
about, right?

1276
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,400
Actually, Princess,

1277
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,620
we and I owe

1278
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,080
a lot.

1279
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,560
We owe a great debt

1280
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,820
to masturbating Sean.

1281
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,760
When he would call

1282
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,760
in saying,

1283
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,300
oh, yeah,

1284
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
oh, yeah,

1285
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,240
oh, yeah,

1286
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,140
all the time.

1287
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,840
Some said,

1288
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,400
well, he's masturbating.

1289
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,420
But we said,

1290
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,880
no, it's a mantra.

1291
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,880
He's reciting his mantra.

1292
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,420
He's an ascended master.

1293
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,820
And we started...

1294
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah, he wasn't saying,

1295
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,820
oh, yeah.

1296
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,360
He was saying,

1297
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,000
oh, yeah, come on.

1298
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,640
Whenever we were

1299
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,940
in a stressful situation,

1300
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:29,860
we'd start going,

1301
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,400
oh, yeah,

1302
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,440
oh, yeah,

1303
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,360
oh, yeah.

1304
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,440
And it worked.

1305
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,360
It was a great mantra.

1306
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,400
There's a kind of

1307
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:37,720
language

1308
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,340
based on the

1309
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,700
oh, yeah mantra

1310
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
of the great

1311
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,840
masturbating Sean.

1312
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,180
I can't prove it

1313
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,240
or illustrate it,

1314
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,960
but it is a language

1315
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,040
and it does exist.

1316
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,220
See, in all this time,

1317
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,040
I thought it was just

1318
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,640
some kind of like

1319
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,340
a pigeon Spanish.

1320
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,060
Can I make a really big

1321
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,340
idea presentation?

1322
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:00,920
I'm going to have to

1323
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,620
get off the phone

1324
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,860
because my cold

1325
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,460
has caused me

1326
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,220
to need to get off the phone.

1327
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:06,800
All right.

1328
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,320
I'm going to say,

1329
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,680
goodbye.

1330
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,460
Well, thank you for your call.

1331
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,960
Thank you for everything.

1332
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,940
I appreciate all the things

1333
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,500
you've all done for me.

1334
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,460
Yes.

1335
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,360
Thanks for your reference.

1336
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,420
All the little people

1337
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,340
have been so,

1338
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,260
and so,

1339
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,520
and I must

1340
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,960
slowly fade away

1341
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,060
and say goodbye

1342
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,480
and finally.

1343
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,280
And hello,

1344
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,840
you're on the air.

1345
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,400
I think we should take over

1346
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,640
some public land.

1347
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:33,780
Yes.

1348
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,500
Let's take over

1349
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,240
some public land

1350
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,380
that we can't take care of.

1351
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,380


1352
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,380


1353
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,500
Let's take over

1354
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:37,500


1355
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,320
Yeah.

1356
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,260
We're toy guns,

1357
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,000
so they're shooters.

1358
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,100
Seriously.

1359
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,260
Yeah.

1360
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,960
You can only,

1361
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,540
you can only,

1362
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,520
you can only get away

1363
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,320
with that if you're white

1364
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:47,920
in this country.

1365
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,140
Well, we could pretend

1366
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,600
we weren't,

1367
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,560
and they could pretend

1368
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,120
to kill us,

1369
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,800
but it would still be

1370
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,380
the same thing,

1371
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:52,980
only different.

1372
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:53,760
If they,

1373
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,620
if they even had

1374
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,560
a slight suntan,

1375
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,720
they'd be labeled terrorists.

1376
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,740
And they would have been

1377
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,540
shot dead without

1378
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,420
any kind of trial

1379
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,500
or anything.

1380
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,180
Have any of you gentlemen

1381
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,700
ever heard of the white train?

1382
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,940
The white train?

1383
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,860
No.

1384
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,120
No.

1385
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,200
By the way,

1386
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,380
I am against

1387
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,880
the kinds of racial disparities

1388
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,120
we have in our justice system.

1389
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:11,460
No, it's not.

1390
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,420
It actually was a train

1391
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,220
and all the cars

1392
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,960
were painted white

1393
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,920
because it carried

1394
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,500
nuclear,

1395
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,580
you know,

1396
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,940
nuclear weapons.

1397
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,260
Nuclear stuff.

1398
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:19,940
Weapons.

1399
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,940
Probably the best way

1400
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,400
to put it.

1401
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,140
Nuclear weapons

1402
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,280
or just nuclear materials?

1403
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,760
Nuclear weapons.

1404
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:25,760
Nice.

1405
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,880
Which they stored out

1406
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,260
in,

1407
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,780
around Warren, Ohio.

1408
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:30,820
Ooh.

1409
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,460
Ah, Warren, Ohio.

1410
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,200
That's Princess

1411
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,340
We Are Doe's hometown.

1412
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:34,920
Warren, Ohio, man.

1413
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,580
We'll have news.

1414
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,940
Well, there's an airport

1415
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:37,380
that's big.

1416
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,720
There's an airport

1417
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,380
nearby, too, there.

1418
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,920
Howland Air Force Base,

1419
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,000
which is,

1420
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,400
it's a lot of weird

1421
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,760
howls.

1422
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,500
You know, it's funny.

1423
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,640
I've been through Howland

1424
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,220
and I didn't know

1425
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,280
there was an Air Force Base there.

1426
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,320
If the FBI stops you,

1427
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,280
that'll mean

1428
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,320
they're trampling our freight.

1429
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,240
I knew about Wright-Patt,

1430
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:51,880
but I didn't know

1431
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,720
about Howland.

1432
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,440
It sounds like

1433
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,320
he's losing his marbles.

1434
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,820
I lost my marbles

1435
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,260
years ago.

1436
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,300
I have no idea

1437
00:43:59,300 --> 00:43:59,680
where they are.

1438
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,440
I used to play marbles

1439
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,320
all the time as a kid

1440
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,780
and then the other day

1441
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,540
I was going through my stuff

1442
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,240
and I couldn't find

1443
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,020
my marbles anywhere

1444
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,660
that were lost.

1445
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,000
Let's incite Warren.

1446
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,240
Get the nukes.

1447
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,260
Then go to the Grand Canyon.

1448
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,640
Take over that

1449
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,680
wildlife refuge.

1450
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,500
And we can do it, man.

1451
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,820
You know, I think maybe...

1452
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,620
We can get away

1453
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,920
with anything, basically.

1454
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,100
You know, we could just...

1455
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,020
We could just turn Warren...

1456
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,860
We could just turn Warren

1457
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,940
into a wildlife refuge

1458
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,660
and nobody would know

1459
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:27,980
the difference.

1460
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm joking.

1461
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:31,660
I'm joking.

1462
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,680
It would be an improvement.

1463
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,200
You know, I jest.

1464
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,660
I jest.

1465
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,500
Actually, I have some

1466
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,220
Warren roots myself.

1467
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,420
Some Warren G. Harding roots,

1468
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,300
whatever the hell that means.

1469
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,120
The war on God.

1470
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,360
That's my roots.

1471
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,760
Yeah, Warren.

1472
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,580
Warren against everybody.

1473
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,860
Warren the other Americans.

1474
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,600
Warren, Warren.

1475
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,380
Why not?

1476
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,580
Let's go for it.

1477
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,220
Yeah, why not Warren?

1478
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,200
We can do anything.

1479
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,360
Yeah, and why not Warren?

1480
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:58,720
Warren.

1481
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,620
We're going to go

1482
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,200
with these powers down there.

1483
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,800
We should go in

1484
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,580
and abrupt them

1485
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,560
and, you know...

1486
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,740
Oh, well.

1487
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,320
Oh, well.

1488
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,380
Oh, well.

1489
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1490
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1491
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1492
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1493
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1494
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1495
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1496
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1497
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,380


1498
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,100
God, I missed something

1499
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,320
and it goes on well.

1500
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,020
Here's where we're going

1501
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:12,840
to take a second here

1502
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,240
to remember

1503
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,520
all those people

1504
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,340
who used to call in.

1505
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,240
Buda, you still there?

1506
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,960
Stang, you still there?

1507
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,860
I'm still here.

1508
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,560
Dave, you still there?

1509
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,940
I'm still here.

1510
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,600
Buda's still here.

1511
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:24,860
All right.

1512
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,700
I think Stang got lost.

1513
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,500
Stang got lost.

1514
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,060
Well, not all who wander

1515
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,680
are lost.

1516
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,320
Oh, you said not, huh?

1517
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:30,960
Yeah.

1518
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,040
But yeah, it was just...

1519
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,560
What were we talking about?

1520
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,520
And right now,

1521
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,140
you are on the air.

1522
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,800
Why, Dr. Sinister,

1523
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,240
you picked me up first

1524
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,560
for the first time ever.

1525
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,340
That's because you, uh,

1526
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,780
you don't first come

1527
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,660
for a serve, as they say.

1528
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,380
So, welcome to the program.

1529
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,700
Reverend Stang,

1530
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,380
welcome to the program.

1531
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,420
So, what's new in your world?

1532
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,220
Well, I'm already

1533
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,200
in the end

1534
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,320
to the television thing.

1535
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,160
Remember last time

1536
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,680
I talked to you,

1537
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,280
I was afraid

1538
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,240
I was turning normal.

1539
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,140
Guess I've started

1540
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,040
watching television.

1541
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,600
What, regular television commercials?

1542
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:08,980
Mm.

1543
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:09,820
Oh, yes.

1544
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,460
Oh, yes.

1545
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,640
I already got burned out on it.

1546
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,060
My favorite commercial

1547
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,020
was the one for the drug.

1548
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,640
Now, this is great.

1549
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,220
This is how great

1550
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,040
pharmaceutical technology

1551
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,980
has gotten, all right?

1552
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,920
If you are all strung out on heroin

1553
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,380
or strung out on Oxycontin,

1554
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,520
or you're addicted to opiate painkillers,

1555
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,360
right now the pharmaceutical industry

1556
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,960
has a pill for you.

1557
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:30,940
All right.

1558
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,760
You can keep on taking your opiates,

1559
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,380
and you don't have to worry about

1560
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,700
getting constipated from them.

1561
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,120
But, you know, I'm not going to be constipated from them.

1562
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:36,980
Because now,

1563
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,820
now there's a pill you can take

1564
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,080
that will relieve your opiate-induced constipation.

1565
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,980
So you can be a junkie and still poop.

1566
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:45,920
It is possible.

1567
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,660
I was just very disappointed that they,

1568
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,140
I was just very disappointed that the commercial

1569
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,340
didn't include the poop emoji.

1570
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,820
...painting in blue

1571
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,140
with the squishy, squeezy blue paint on.

1572
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,800
Why are they,

1573
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,560
why are they not using the poop emoji

1574
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,380
in these commercials?

1575
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,300
That's what I want to know.

1576
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,760
I mean, how awesome is it that there's an emoji,

1577
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,260
there's an emoji just for poop?

1578
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,960
Brown paint people would throw up,

1579
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,520
but the blue gets the idea across,

1580
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,480
because it's really squeezing out fast.

1581
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,000
Hey, I started this show off with,

1582
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,220
with a whole bunch of poop songs.

1583
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,740
Yeah, this is, this is our thing here.

1584
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,220
This is, it's a great time to poop.

1585
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,840
There's never been a better time to poop than right now.

1586
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,620
Hello, you're on the air.

1587
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,240
Good news for people with credit problems.

1588
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,040
Welcome, No Money Mark.

1589
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,020
If anybody knows about credit problems, it's you.

1590
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,120
Yeah, well, let's not get into that tonight.

1591
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,920
But I'm not sure I,

1592
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,340
I have a topic this week.

1593
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,160
I remember hearing about a rapper who is a flat earther.

1594
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,020
The flat earthers are still a thing.

1595
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,700
No topic, Mark.

1596
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,060
No topic, Mark, yes.

1597
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,920
How you doing, Reverend?

1598
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,580
Great.

1599
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,660
I just, it's good to finally hear some drops

1600
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,680
from Bob's Burgers on your show.

1601
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,860
What would that be?

1602
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,120
Well, I mean, you know,

1603
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,460
I mean, you know, some stuff from,

1604
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,640
from the Fox News animated sitcom,

1605
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,180
which has a main character named Bob,

1606
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,960
which was, I was wondering why I'd never heard anything

1607
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,760
from that show on the subgenius hour before,

1608
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,680
and tonight I did.

1609
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,540
What was it that you heard tonight?

1610
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,840
Somebody else sent it in.

1611
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,440
I have no idea where those clips come from.

1612
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,580
Isn't that the same show they played last week?

1613
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,920
Yes, because we have not been receiving,

1614
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,040
I'm not saying you didn't send them,

1615
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
but we have not been receiving the,

1616
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,660
the new hours of slack that have been sent in.

1617
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,480
Or they're not being put in the special,

1618
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:34,860
the special box.

1619
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,760
I do not know what the situation is.

1620
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,840
Well, listeners to Synesthesia would have heard

1621
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,060
this week's hour of slack last week on your show anyway.

1622
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,300
So it's a moot point in Cleveland.

1623
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,260
That's right.

1624
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,120
That's right.

1625
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,180
It was a pretty good show though.

1626
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,780
But yeah, I don't, I actually,

1627
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,960
I think that the collages that No Money Mark is talking about

1628
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,660
came from some other artiste,

1629
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,700
I think Cool Hand Chris,

1630
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,560
and I wouldn't recognize,

1631
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,000
I think Cool Hand Chris,

1632
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,040
and I wouldn't recognize clips from TV shows.

1633
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,020
In fact, there have been times when I've been really embarrassed

1634
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:14,200
because I used lines that I thought a subgenius had come up with.

1635
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:19,120
And I only thought that because I was so ignorant of pop culture television.

1636
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,780
You know, it'd be like a famous TV ad line.

1637
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,400
And I wouldn't know any better.

1638
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,100
I think it was original and treat it that way.

1639
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,040
Well, maybe it was like the case of,

1640
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,040
like the case of Newton and Leibniz,

1641
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,280
both inventing calculus independently of each other at the same time.

1642
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,980
Right, except that Leibniz was ready to share the honor

1643
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,740
and Newton was paranoid.

1644
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,080
Right.

1645
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,700
Well, you know, he was hoping he might be able to use it

1646
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,940
to finally turn lead into gold.

1647
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,600
Never got around to it though.

1648
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,400
Isn't it funny how the super geniuses of all ages are also the craziest?

1649
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,960
Well, you know, the whole idea of alchemy and transmutation,

1650
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,420
of one metallic element into another,

1651
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,780
that was a very ancient idea.

1652
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,480
And little did he know that all it takes is a nuclear reaction to turn lead into gold.

1653
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,820
And for the price of three tons of gold,

1654
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,080
you could turn one ton of lead into one ton of gold, maybe.

1655
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,440
I don't know.

1656
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,020
Not cost effective exactly, but it could be done.

1657
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,700
Well, it's funny that this guy who's sort of almost intuitive,

1658
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,620
who's intuitive the mathematical patterns inherent in gravity,

1659
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,180
for instance, among other things, life as well,

1660
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,780
also was convinced that the world was going to end at a certain year

1661
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,520
because he had calculated all the numbers in the Bible.

1662
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,300
Gosh, it sounds like somebody else I know.

1663
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,480
The smartest guy in the world in the year 1700

1664
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,080
believed that the Bible was literally correct all the way through,

1665
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,500
and that was it.

1666
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,300
Guy who gets clues from religion about when the world is going to end.

1667
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:05,680
Boy, that sounds like somebody else I know.

1668
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,760
Well, and I also invented the calculus,

1669
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,600
but I didn't know that somebody else had already done it,

1670
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:15,940
so it was kind of a waste of time.

1671
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:19,840
I didn't even bother to take credit.

1672
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,380
I felt embarrassed that I didn't know that it already existed.

1673
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,500
Darn. Beat out once again.

1674
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,720
I know my calculus.

1675
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,840
Every time I could come up with a really good original gag,

1676
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,700
Futurama would use it, but that week.

1677
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,400
That's just they were reading my mind, which I know they weren't.

1678
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,780
But it was a good sign.

1679
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,560
Well, you know, some jokes just write themselves.

1680
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,400
Some jokes just write themselves.

1681
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah, some presidential campaigns just write themselves.

1682
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,560
Speaking of which, did anyone watch the debate Saturday night?

1683
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,580
I saw a little bit of it, actually.

1684
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,520
I lost interest in that, too.

1685
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,280
Well, that was, you know, I don't have cable,

1686
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,720
so if it's actually on one of the broadcast networks,

1687
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,180
then, like, that's all I'm going to get to see.

1688
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,320
Yeah, right. I was just saying,

1689
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,480
I had to go over to my Republican buddy's house to watch the debates.

1690
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,680
Because no Republican is going to not have cable

1691
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,220
because they need to have their Fox News.

1692
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,380
Otherwise, they wouldn't be Republicans.

1693
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,620
I don't know.

1694
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,680
Well, I don't like to, you know, generalize.

1695
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,860
You know, it's like without Fox News,

1696
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,740
we wouldn't know about all those baby parts being sold.

1697
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,200
Well, without the conspiracy, there'd be no reason for Bob

1698
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,780
or the Church of the Subgenius.

1699
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,540
We owe our existence to the conspiracy of the normals.

1700
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,620
That's right. That's right.

1701
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,520
The conspiracy of stupidity.

1702
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,760
It is.

1703
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,560
Which doesn't just, you know, let's say,

1704
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:56,560


1705
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,500
let's face it, Republicans aren't the only people who fall into that category.

1706
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,300
Of course. Of course.

1707
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,800
But, you know, one thing that...

1708
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,620
And we're about to prove tonight.

1709
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,260
Right. And it was a wise man I know who once said that, you know,

1710
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:15,040
the really insidious thing about the conspiracy is that it's not even self-aware.

1711
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,720
It's the conspiracy...

1712
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,280
It's not even known as a conspiracy.

1713
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,000
It's the conspiracy of...

1714
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,140
It does everything automatically.

1715
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,460
Right. It's just stupidity in force. It's...

1716
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,540
The mail that sticks up will be held.

1717
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,100
It's just hammered down.

1718
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:27,700
Yeah.

1719
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,940
If you're a hammer, there's nothing stupid about that.

1720
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,740
Everything looks like a nail if you're a hammer.

1721
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,100
If you're a nail, yeah.

1722
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,340
It's back in that little hole, buddy.

1723
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,960
So, yeah, man, I played some heavy metal in honor of Flint, Michigan.

1724
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:45,720
Ugh.

1725
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,140
Seriously, that's...

1726
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,960
I was enjoying the music when I heard of it.

1727
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,880
That's the new heavy metal capital of the world now, Flint.

1728
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,380
How about...

1729
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,520
Well, you know, that's...

1730
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,340
That's only the one that we know about.

1731
00:53:58,940 --> 00:53:59,420
That's the...

1732
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,060
Right, right.

1733
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,560
Well, there's also Sebring, Ohio, but Flint is bigger.

1734
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,120
No, they used to say, you know...

1735
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,760
If it wasn't a really old house like mine, you probably got lead pipes.

1736
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:14,220
There may be lead pipes, but depending on the quality of the water coming into your house, it may or may not be an issue.

1737
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,380
If you put the wrong...

1738
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,260
Right, they use special water that has...

1739
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,120
Yeah, no, if you put the wrong treatment chemicals in it, then it can cause the lead to start leaching out, and that's what happened in Flint.

1740
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,860
The water...

1741
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,640
See, it's all chemistry.

1742
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,600
Black Alpena.

1743
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,500
They say the...

1744
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,600
Black Alpena stuff, they finally led to chemistry.

1745
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,360
You gotta start somewhere.

1746
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,320
Yep.

1747
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,640
Why not try turning lead into gold?

1748
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,220
Hell, the Church of the Subgenius turned damn near anything into slack.

1749
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,200
That's right.

1750
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,360
Well, that's the thing about the Church of the Subgenius is we have the advantage of Bob...

1751
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,120
J.R.

1752
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,840
Bob Dobbs on our side, all right?

1753
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,760
And, you know, he is...

1754
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,200
There's...

1755
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,300
He surfs the luck plane, but he is also like a black hole.

1756
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:54,620
Yeah.

1757
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1758
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1759
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1760
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1761
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1762
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1763
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1764
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1765
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1766
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1767
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:54,620


1768
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,620
But he's different from a black hole.

1769
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:56,900
Yeah, a black hole.

1770
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:02,660
He's a black hole with another side, because the luck will... all the luck in the universe is eventually gonna end up coming to him.

1771
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,820
Maybe it's good luck.

1772
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,080
You're right.

1773
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:11,860
Maybe it's bad luck, but ultimately, it's gonna be compressed into that high gravity, and it's gonna come out, and the pressure is so great.

1774
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,140
Neutron star...

1775
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,660
Yeah.

1776
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,900
Neutron star density luck.

1777
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:21,660
Right, so the pressure is so great that it's no longer good luck and bad luck. It's just luck, and that's just what comes out of it.

1778
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,340
And sucks in...

1779
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,220
You know...

1780
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:24,780
Good and bad.

1781
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:32,720
You know, Jesus Christ said that he was the Alpha and the Omega, but J.R. Bob Dobbs, he is simultaneously the mouth and anus of the universe.

1782
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,240
How's that for your Alpha and Omega, huh?

1783
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,560
Oh, we had a little phone malfunction there. Can you repeat that, please?

1784
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,400
No, it was the punchline of a joke, and I probably shouldn't repeat it.

1785
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,320
Ah, okay. Hey, that could be said for this whole program, week after week, of course.

1786
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:52,860
Yeah.

1787
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,200
Yeah, I've been repeating it, but...

1788
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,280
I've been repeating it myself, anyway, on to other states.

1789
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,740
You've really got nothing better to do, huh?

1790
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,280
That's it.

1791
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,180
Might as well go and sniff some glue.

1792
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,060
Yeah.

1793
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:12,060
Maybe, you know, I played some poop songs this week. Maybe next week I'll play some glue sniffing songs. There are actually some very good songs out there about sniffing glue.

1794
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,260
I can't remember any myself, offhand.

1795
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,680
Well, that's because you sniff too much glue.

1796
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,780
Could be. I can't remember any of the songs about marijuana or codeine or anything.

1797
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,200
Just...

1798
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,360
Just because people sing about it doesn't mean you should do it.

1799
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,640
Don't try this at home, kids.

1800
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,180
If everybody else jumped off a cliff, would you do it?

1801
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,520
Actually, you know what? I might. I might.

1802
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,240
Would you do it, Maul?

1803
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:42,680
I think I actually probably would. If literally everybody else were jumping off a cliff, literally everybody, yeah, I probably would, too.

1804
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:53,260
I might wait a while. I'd probably enjoy having the whole planet to myself for a little while, but then eventually I'd realize I can't survive on my own, then I'd jump off a cliff, too.

1805
00:56:53,840 --> 00:57:03,660
My friend, Paul Mabridis, when he was young, his dad said, well, if everybody's gonna jump off a cliff, would you do it, too? And he goes, Dad, I'm the one who gave him the idea.

1806
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,280
Oh! That's clean living.

1807
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:14,640
Copyright 1969, Paul Mabridis. But you can still use it on your dad.

1808
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,420
Will do.

1809
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,080
When he asks you if you're gonna jump off a cliff, too.

1810
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,040
Yeah.

1811
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,240
If that's the only way I can get laid, Dad, you better believe I'm gonna jump off a cliff, too.

1812
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,240


1813
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:33,360
Oh, yeah, and the best thing is while you're in free fall, you know, it's like that's, you can, that's the, if that's the only way you can get laid when you're in free fall off the cliff, you know, you're having sex in zero G's then.

1814
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,520
If jumping off a cliff is the only way you can get laid.

1815
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,080
Well, back when I was in high school, my dad would go, you're just wearing your hair long just to be like everybody else.

1816
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:51,640
I was going, no, I'm wearing my hair long in the probably vain hope that something will help me get laid.

1817
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:59,540
Like all I've been bragging about or getting and I still don't know if they were just bragging or for real.

1818
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,140
I keep my hair short so I can look like everybody else. It's hip to be square.

1819
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,580
Well, it also doesn't scream out, bust me, please.

1820
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,360
Yeah, it's all about camouflage, you know.

1821
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,080
Well, I was kind of a parent.

1822
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,120
I remember I, I, I,

1823
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,300
I was still in Texas.

1824
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,460
Yeah, I had long hair when I was a kid living in suburbia up in northeast Ohio.

1825
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,620
Yeah.

1826
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,480
And boy, you know, I noticed cops got a lot nicer to me once I cut my hair.

1827
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,400
Oh, everybody's nicer if you look respectable.

1828
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:28,980
Yep, yep.

1829
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:38,760
I, I, up until just recently, I've been, whenever I was out driving around here in rural Texas, I'd keep my hair tucked up inside my hat.

1830
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,140
But it finally sunk in that everybody my age in rural Texas has long hair.

1831
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,260
Hmm.

1832
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,500
You know, they just finally figured, they figured out that it was cool around 1980 or so.

1833
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,880
Yeah.

1834
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,320
And have kind of, the old ones stuck with it.

1835
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,640
Of course, the young ones are all have bald head and have a little goatee.

1836
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,080
Life was cool in the late 90s everywhere in the big cities.

1837
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,820
You wait long enough at the side of the river and eventually the whole world will float by.

1838
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:12,480
Yeah, man.

1839
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,180
All right.

1840
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,660
Well, folks, that is all the time we have for this program.

1841
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,240
Thank you very much for calling in Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Reverend Ivan Stang, Domani Mark.

1842
