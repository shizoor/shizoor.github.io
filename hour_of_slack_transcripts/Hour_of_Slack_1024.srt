1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm getting worse.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Doctors say they're basketball fans, and Michigan State battles with PR News.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,980
Lawyers say Bob had little chance of winning.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,760
Reverend Jesse Jackson climbed the side of the St. Peter's Dome before he killed nine people, then himself.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,520
Authorities demanded Pope John Paul start a lottery to help brain-damaged PR News, Washington.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,720
The Self-Genius Powerhouse.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,460
What are they trying to prove, anyway?

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,100
Beats me.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,400
Hello there, I'm George Putnam.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I'd like to begin with a fact.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
A simple yet shocking fact.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
It is this.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,420
A flood tide of filth is engulfing our country in the form of newsstand obscenity.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,980
It is threatening to pervert an entire generation of our...

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
American children.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,300
We know that once a person is perverted,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,200
it is practically impossible for that person to adjust to normal attitudes in regard to sex.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,180
Yet, much of this material has been described as an illustrated, detailed course in perversion.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
I've been feeding off and

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:30,860
Foi-

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,620
Fem brothers.

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,240
The

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,580
By the time legs first became parallel,

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:37,740
let alone any part of me,

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:37,880
none of us knew how to carry.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,740
And that crew,

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,120
was endangering all our troubles.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:59,980
investigate stangs,

29
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,780
And here he is.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,960
But not of an hour of slack.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Not even of a minute of slack.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:15,460
Nay, but rather of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from WREK Atlanta.

33
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:24,420
Actually, this is the Thanksgiving Subgenius Executive Banquet from the Pom Poms right here in downtown Berkeley.

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,940
And we aren't wherever he said at all.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
This is in Berkeley.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,440
And not this time won by the good reverend Susie the Floozy.

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,040
But a mental classic by her co-pod was the Lymph Node Institute.

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,260
Toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot.

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm Doc.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,840
And?

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,660
I'm Bugsy.

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,020
We're going to discuss the brain this evening in the interest of the magic dancing giants above us.

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,220
It's funny because your brain will fill in gaps as needed, especially when you're receiving everything through your ear holes.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
All of these can be prepared in the morning.

45
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,860
So if you hear any extra noises, it's just a...

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,300
It's always a help for the hostess on her own.

47
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,000
The subliminal dancing giant.

48
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,820
We're not really, as far as you know, hammering.

49
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,120
Anything into your brain.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It's for your benefit.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,620
Let me get a visual here.

52
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Yeah, Dobbs, this is...

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
You know who this is.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to get to the point.

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm going to get to the point right now.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,340
You and me.

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,620
A.M. P.M.

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,800
Market Street.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Be there.

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,540
Buy me a Frosty.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
Maybe a hot dog or a Tquito.

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,740
We'll sell this right now.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,900
We'll see who's doing some quote-unquote slacking, if you know what I mean.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
What we want to do is...

65
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Talk about what happened.

66
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,580
Sure.

67
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
November 22nd, 1963.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,740
I'll tell you what happened.

69
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,540
That's when a good old Walter Three Toes Johnson came in and pitched a perfect game.

70
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,180
You know what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,120
Yes, I do.

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,800
Good.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
Now let me get to the point once again.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,500
Pizza Hut versus Domino's.

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,720
Go.

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
That's not the discussion of the year.

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes, it is.

79
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,480
I was there.

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Wait.

81
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,320
Yes.

82
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,720
Okay.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm a new caller.

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I am a new caller.

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,860
He was here.

86
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,340
He was there.

87
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,080
Is Don Joyce there?

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,360
He has a very useful voice.

89
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,120
Not the prettiest sight.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,080
Don?

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,020
The Nash Rambler's here.

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,800
Who's he?

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,460
Because he isn't, if you don't mind.

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,060
Okay.

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,220
Excuse me, Mr. Isn't.

96
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes.

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Question for you.

98
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,820
Yes.

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,340
Go ahead.

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,620
I've heard some past shows.

101
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,640
I think you sound like a young man.

102
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,360
You're doing well.

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,740
Are you doing some kind of herbal supplement?

104
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah, I am a young man.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,560
Don?

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,100
And he's pulling the eyepiece over the rearmost position.

107
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,660
Okay.

108
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm a very young man.

109
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,240
Adjusting opticular resolution.

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,220
Are you trying to say some pedophilia stuff there?

111
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,400
He's not trying.

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
He's not trying.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,340
No, no.

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm just out of high school.

115
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,320
Don.

116
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,820
Don.

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,000
Don.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,220
You've got to be at least 62.

119
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,360
Let's just be honest here.

120
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,660
No.

121
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,660
I just graduated from high school.

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,000
Don.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
Three, four years ago.

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,720
You sound like some sort of game show host, first of all.

125
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,540
As you know, traditionally, they usually range about 40 to 62.

126
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,740
All right.

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,860
Are these the types of callers you get on your show?

128
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes, Mr. Dobbs.

129
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,300
Is this all there is?

130
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,380
Is this all there is?

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,020
We're ready to talk about the Kennedy assassination and the next day in the Church of the Sun.

132
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,540
Sorry.

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,120
You are incorrect.

134
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,680
Never in the history of the world have the merchants of obscenity, the teachers of unnatural

135
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,640
sexism...

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,180
...acted.

137
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,420
...had available to them the modern facilities for disseminating this filth.

138
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,600
And cheese.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,460
And still more cheese.

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,060
High-speed presses, rapid transportation, mass distribution, all have combined to put

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,860
the vilest obscenity within reach of every man, woman, and child in the country.

142
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,460
And that fresh vegetable platter that looks like an artist's palate with its vigorous outdoor

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,060
color.

144
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
Your mixed salad.

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,000
So simple, apparently, but actually a combination of various shades of green and contrasting

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,380
textures.

147
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,320
Stuffing.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,020
Yeah.

149
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,800
Stuffing.

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,380
Yeah.

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,540
Cram the stuff real tight.

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:12,980
Together.

153
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,020
It's paradise.

154
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,840
It's delicious.

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,560
This is the legal ID for the subgenius Thanksgiving.

156
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,280
No!

157
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,840
No.

158
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
89.3.

159
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,840
And did you know that we're also...

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,500
We're also carried in Alaska and London, England.

161
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,340
Wow.

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,180
I didn't know that.

163
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,800
Right now.

164
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,980
Amazing.

165
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,480
Do we know those numbers?

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,620
I don't have them right on the tip of my desk here.

167
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,080
Of course we can be found all the time at kpfa.org.

168
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,800
It's her uncle.

169
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:47,360
So remember, you have a lot of people in Alaska and England who have never heard of this group,

170
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,900
this cult, this organization, this foundation, this church, whatever the preferred term is.

171
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,100
What?

172
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,600
You've never heard of it?

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,020
That's right.

174
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,960
So you're speaking to...

175
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,420
What planet are they from?

176
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,300
You are hardly preaching to the choir here.

177
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
You are preaching to the completely ignorant.

178
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,500
That makes no difference.

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,100
I think Reb Stang has got to...

180
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, who are you going to take offense to there?

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
He's doing the spirit of...

182
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,140
All right.

183
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,520
Go ahead.

184
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,020
If the Holy Spirit is possessing Reb Stang, he has to try to tell the truth of that.

185
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,700
It's not a Holy Spirit at all.

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,280
It's nothing but the pressure from my flunads down below.

187
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,720
Well, the same thing.

188
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,000
It's my claim, crime, and urge that Bob Fried admits.

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,980
He said, Reverend Stang, take your pants off.

190
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,240
Go forth, stand on car hoods, and preach.

191
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
I didn't do it.

192
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah, have you not seen the tape of that on the Internet?

193
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,420
I remember him when he asked you that.

194
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,440
He said, you would be rich if you did that.

195
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,060
We put out an old video tape of Stang's pants leaving his body, and it's on the Internet.

196
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,440
It's been on there for like eight years.

197
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,660
Bob's been a good subgenius.

198
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,920
You know, subgenius was the second website ever.

199
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,560
You disobey Bob.

200
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, you do?

201
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,600
Yeah, he says slack off, so you go to work.

202
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,560
Before there were webs or sites or any of that stuff,

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,560
people that were beginning that process came to the subgenius church and said,

204
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,360
can we borrow the word?

205
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,220
Because there was so much of the word.

206
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,720
And they said, you can be the content or content.

207
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,300
And also, if you want, you have to beg for it,

208
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,580
but I'll tell you the story of why Bob gets shot in the movie Fight Club.

209
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, really?

210
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,060
Hyperimmunization, that's what we call it.

211
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,600
He was shot in 84 in the night of slack.

212
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,540
Yes, he was.

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
And Michael Pepe was there in a three-piece suit.

214
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,620
I was there.

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,300
And afterwards, the whole story was given to me under hypnosis

216
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,840
because I'm losing parts of that brain.

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,660
I think that's the kind of thing we only can talk about.

218
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm just trying to sort out all these voices.

219
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,400
This college radio stuff is just nonsense.

220
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,900
Right now, Reverend Stans, you are covering all of northern and central California.

221
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,320
All of Arnold Schwarzenegger's breadbasket.

222
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,960
Hey, there's a red-headed girl here in Palais.

223
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't even know about her.

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,680
I don't know about her.

225
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:52,980
I don't know about her.

226
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


227
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


228
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


229
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


230
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


231
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


232
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


233
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,640
Girl in Galeo?

235
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,160
Girls?

236
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,840
So has Reverend Funny Name called in yet?

237
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,220
Yes.

238
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,660
Her name is Kim.

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,780
The caller?

240
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,420
Is that the caller?

241
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,860
Where is Dr. Howell?

242
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,060
Her name's Kim.

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,520
I hate sitting next to her.

244
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,940
I have her off.

245
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,480
Has anyone stopped to think about J.R. Bob Dobbs

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,500
and to thank him and give thanks on this day of thanks that has just been given?

247
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Too late now.

248
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,740
He's not listening now.

249
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, actually, he might be.

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,100
So bend over and pray to Bob Dobbs.

251
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,520
Well, look.

252
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,000
And the caller has bent over.

253
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,180
So, Bob, bend over and pray.

254
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,000
And display him whatever it was that you have to give thanks.

255
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,820
The most private part, his wallet.

256
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,620
Say, Bob, thanks for you.

257
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Hey, tell Kim to stay.

258
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,900
Thanks for being there, Bob.

259
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,300
And other insects.

260
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,860
Thanks for ignoring me, Bob.

261
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,120
Thanks for not torturing me as much as you could have.

262
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,380
And also, beautiful listening audience from over here.

263
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,440
What an amazing opportunity here to speak to the lowerarchy of the sub-genius church.

264
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,460
Think how great you have it compared to what it could be.

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim.

266
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,400
And so...

267
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,440
I only worry that I know too much.

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
I should know less, actually.

269
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh, yeah.

270
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,420
You wish you knew.

271
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,600
They all say...

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
They all think they know too much.

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
If I could only...

274
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
You don't know nothing!

275
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,920
I know.

276
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
I know that very well.

277
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
Oh, if only we could know anything, though.

278
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,560
That is the goal of every true world religion, is to truly know nothing.

279
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,060
That's why I keep it here.

280
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,120
Because then you can initiate something.

281
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
In fact, you don't even need much.

282
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,880
Once you really know nothing, very little will get you off.

283
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,480
Yeah.

284
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,360
I try to know as little as possible.

285
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,860
Then every movie you haven't seen before, every book you haven't read before...

286
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,760
They're so good.

287
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,640
Everything is just...

288
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,980
Until you see what it is.

289
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,360
Yeah.

290
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,440
A number of doctors have worked there.

291
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,640
The scope slows down.

292
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,260
So try...

293
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,380
Even go out there and mess with that movie or that book.

294
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,740
Yeah.

295
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,220
Just...

296
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,460
If you can learn to get off on nothing, you've got it made!

297
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,620
That's right.

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
You don't have to go to the movies.

299
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,380
This is a picture of a major American...

300
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,940
problem.

301
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,000
An ugly sore eating away at the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall.

302
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,980
It's one of the commonest causes of death, pain, and unhappiness.

303
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,180
There's nothing too mysterious about it, really.

304
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,040
Work.

305
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,120
Such suffering needn't be.

306
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,100
As in this case of one man's fight, his fight against work.

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
What's the matter with you?

308
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,540
Why does a man act like this?

309
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,920
Boom!

310
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,300
Burn that day.

311
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,640
At the office?

312
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,900
Responsibility?

313
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Boom!

314
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:20,900
Boom!

315
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,180
Doesn't look good.

316
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,900
The gnawing, the burning.

317
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,020
Various drugs.

318
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,680
Acid.

319
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
What you think has no bearing whatever on your condition.

320
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,320
The acid's working nice.

321
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,580
Go deeper.

322
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,540
You've got to face up to reality.

323
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,540
So you vomit.

324
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,840
That irregular bulge there.

325
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,460
Problem from work.

326
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,940
Get the kind of food and medication that helps relax it and takes the bite out of the acid.

327
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm talking about feelings, not thinking.

328
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,380
Not logic.

329
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,260
Emotions.

330
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,500
Now, wait a minute.

331
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,740
That still spells jerk to me and I don't like it.

332
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,020
Only a complete idiot would act that way.

333
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
A complete idiot.

334
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,500
I don't care about anything.

335
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't ever let me forget that.

336
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,860
And I'm paying you for medicine, not a bunch of crazy theories.

337
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
Do something about it.

338
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,720
Does a man really have to buy love, pay cash for it, acting like a machine instead of a human being?

339
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,160
That's right.

340
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
Ball me.

341
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,840
Down, down, down.

342
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,100
Life can be worth living down at the office.

343
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Yes, that's right.

344
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,440
How about it?

345
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,860
Are you crazy?

346
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,900
I'm going to die.

347
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm going to die.

348
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,420
I'm going to die.

349
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm going to die.

350
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm going to die.

351
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,340
I'm going to die.

352
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,760
I have a name tag that I wear to my job at the mall

353
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,220
It says, hello, my name is Paul

354
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,260
We have a chain store called Hot Topic

355
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,620
Next to the place that sells cheese pretzels

356
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,280
They sell alternative wear

357
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,580
I wanna work there

358
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,720
Cause I'm a sucker

359
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Sucker

360
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Sucker

361
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,800
Hopelessly suburban

362
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,700
So many fat ladies with their babies

363
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,500
And their hairstyles from the 80s

364
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
I have to kiss their asses

365
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,300
If I wanna keep my job

366
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,580
See the youngsters, just like gangsters

367
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,760
Answering their pagers

368
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,860
When their mommies call

369
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,880
Let's do some shopping, get there early

370
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
Go downstairs and get a slurpee

371
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,320
So much to do here

372
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,480
In my special world

373
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,040
Sucker

374
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
Sucker

375
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
Sucker

376
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,640
Sucker

377
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,140
Sucker

378
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,500
Sucker

379
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,260
Sucker

380
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,080
He's a big sucker, he's a big fat sucker

381
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,180
He's a big sucker, he's a real motherfucker

382
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,800
He's a big sucker, he's a big fat sucker

383
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,980
He's a big sucker

384
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,660
He's a big sucker, he's a big fat sucker

385
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,780
He's a big sucker, he's the real motherfucker

386
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,380
He's a big sucker, he's a big fat sucker

387
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,480
He's a big sucker, he's a real motherfucker

388
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,480


389
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,480


390
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,660
Where do you want to be today?

391
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,740
I don't care just as long as it comes on a plastic train

392
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,040
I cruise around in my Japanese car with my butterball girlfriend

393
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,540
And a 40 answer

394
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,100
I have a name tag that I wear to my job at the mall

395
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,860
It says hello, my name is Paul

396
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,200
The Bean Weevils did that song, friends, from their one album

397
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,480
called The Bean Weevils.

398
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,480


399
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,780
The Bean Weevils, see beanweevils.com

400
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:57,600
Which we bought from Bean, the CD that is,

401
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,300
when we saw his band in San Francisco at the Ask Dr. Howell show

402
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,100
at Café du Monde just before we did this five hour Thanksgiving

403
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,560
subgenius business banquet on the Over the Edge and Puzzling Evidence shows

404
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
on KPFA in Berkeley.

405
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
With Don Joyce of Negative Land and Doug Wellman, Puzzling Evidence,

406
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:28,360
mixing up us guests, Dr. Philo Drummond, the original Overman,

407
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,620
Pope Michael Pepe, Dr. Howell Robbins, Princess Wee Argo,

408
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,940
and the callers, and yours, truly Reverend Ivan Stang,

409
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,260
and that's mostly what this particular hour of slack

410
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,160
and several future ones will be.

411
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,240
Except for all of the remixed collage musical cut-ups

412
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,040
by Reverend Norell Preff,

413
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,660
which is most of the collages in this show

414
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,540
that are longer than 33 seconds.

415
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,640
And for the PR news,

416
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,120
and the collages shorter than or equal to 33 seconds,

417
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,840
which are mostly by Mr. Fernanda Ndele Mer.

418
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,760
Friends, the background music is by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers

419
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,980
from Blue Marble right now.

420
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
That's their CD.

421
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,780
That's Ryanetics.com.

422
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Praise the guitar tech skills of Reverend Jimmy Ryan

423
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,060
and his brother, Johnny.

424
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,060
You don't need money.

425
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, a little bit.

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,380
Well, you need to stay awake.

427
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
Send in the money to Bob.

428
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs, that is.

429
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,060
Not one of these false bobs.

430
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,360
There's a lot of false bobs running around.

431
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,880
False bobs.

432
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,900
As was predicted.

433
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
In Book of the Subjeans.

434
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,120
He said, didn't he?

435
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,240
He said, there shall come many like unto me.

436
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,120
But if they froppeth not,

437
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,600
and die.

438
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,660
That's what I was thinking.

439
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,740
And if they have not the verticulitis of me,

440
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,660
then there are false bobs.

441
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,120
And he said, kill him.

442
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Because if it ain't,

443
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,920
if it ain't really Bob,

444
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,780
then they deserve to die.

445
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,660
Then he can't die.

446
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,160
Right.

447
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,900
But he was killed anyway.

448
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,900
He was killed for you.

449
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,800
He couldn't, yeah.

450
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,620
No, he was killed by.

451
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,340
He didn't die for you,

452
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,980
but he was killed for you.

453
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,260
By puzzling evidence.

454
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
Puzzling evidence killed him for you.

455
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,440
Yeah, I know.

456
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,860
He did it for you.

457
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,120
And yet you just walk about your daily life

458
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
just thinking, oh, well,

459
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,440
I'll just buy this stuff and work this job.

460
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,820
They don't stop and think,

461
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,360
puzzling evidence killed Bob for me.

462
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,340
Reverend Stang, when you think about that,

463
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
you cause yourself,

464
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,080
you cause yourself to black out.

465
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
So most people can't think of that.

466
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,940
We ask them not to think of that.

467
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,460
Certainly not right now.

468
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,920
It's too big.

469
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,440
At 1.15 in the morning.

470
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,280
It's too big for 1.15 in the morning.

471
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,860
It's too big for most people's hearts to take.

472
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
Or their minds.

473
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,340
It's too big for my mind.

474
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,760
I just shut it down.

475
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
It's like the whole universe.

476
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,220
It's such a huge idea of slack.

477
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, it just takes in,

478
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,880
it makes the rest of the world go,

479
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,800
the rest of the world seem like Bambi.

480
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,500
The rest of the world is Bambi.

481
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,140
A cute little doe.

482
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,100
A beautiful doe.

483
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,120
Compared to the,

484
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,080
a weird doe.

485
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,080
A weeeearrrr doe.

486
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,040
It's the abnormalities are corrupting.

487
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
Also, didn't Bob say,

488
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,480
let there be frop?

489
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,740
That was another thing.

490
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,160
Oh, wait a minute.

491
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,620
Reverend Stang, I'm going to take,

492
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,040
I'll have a frop Zip-de-lops.

493
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Quick, run over there and grab,

494
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,580
I need some more of a sanctity.

495
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,820
Don't get your lips close to it.

496
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,800
Do it twice.

497
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,780
Okay.

498
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,600
Okay, Reverend Stang,

499
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
now you and I can talk at a more reasonable pace.

500
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,060
This is something I enjoy in the show.

501
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,280
The rhythms of the show always give you a better opportunity

502
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
to have more.

503
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,820
This show is great.

504
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,560
It's a really good show.

505
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,520
You want to hit a show, man.

506
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,120
Take it more.

507
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,420
More.

508
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah.

509
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm going to have a frop.

510
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,300
I can't get enough.

511
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,200
This stuff is great.

512
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,820
You know, I got some new CD from Negative Lands.

513
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,700
I just want to talk about the church and JFK's murder.

514
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,680
Kennedy Day went right by and I hardly even noticed.

515
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,920
I was shooting at turkeys.

516
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,440
Weren't we all?

517
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,860
The thing is, when you start studying the documents,

518
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,580
you start to think about Bob's assassination.

519
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,820
It opens up such a huge can of worms.

520
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:57,460
The next thing you know, you're studying pornography and drugs and all kinds of terrible criminal activities.

521
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,060
I have for years asked that people not give a hoot about who killed Bob.

522
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,240
It just doesn't matter for us.

523
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,200
Get a life.

524
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,840
Move on.

525
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,040
What?

526
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Bob's dead?

527
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,340
Nothing.

528
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
We all killed Bob.

529
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,260
Why not?

530
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,440
No.

531
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,940
Why?

532
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,860
After all, it was you and me.

533
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,040
That's it.

534
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,440
That's what Bob said.

535
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,460
Somebody said.

536
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,760
Let me please introduce myself.

537
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,880
So we were trying to tie in the 60s to Bob's death.

538
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,800
At least I was in my mind when I stood up too quickly there.

539
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,640
Nothing, of course, was done.

540
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,760
Princess We Are Doe is here in the studio tonight.

541
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,780
She is a descendant from her spaceship.

542
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,420
She is a descendant from her spaceship.

543
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,420


544
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,920
She is a descendant from her spaceship.

545
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:42,920


546
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,640
She is the queen of all the unidentified flying objects, which unfortunately doesn't

547
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,120
do us a whole lot of good.

548
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,300
We can't identify them.

549
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,620
And you must remember, comrade, proteins are weapons too.

550
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,460
Yes, comrade.

551
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,760
I must have taken that to Doc's office.

552
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Must be suspicious.

553
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,220
Yeah, we will cover the pool of blood, but not right now.

554
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,320
Yeah, leave it uncovered.

555
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,940
Do you want to give a plug for your show?

556
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Take that salty smell.

557
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm going to give it to you.

558
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


559
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


560
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


561
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


562
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


563
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


564
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


565
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:12,900


566
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,920
You should give a plug for your show on your college station.

567
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Well, the Subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack originates in the heads of the subgeniuses

568
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:36,000
and then makes its way on to several stations, all of them found at www.subgenius.com.

569
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,920
There are the one-eyed ogvorbis shows.

570
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,880
There are the miscarrying MP3 shows with the most amazing sound effects.

571
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:42,880


572
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:42,880


573
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,160
There are the millions of legs that run right up your pants leg and bite you.

574
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,960
Is that Slack?

575
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,840
Perhaps it could be for you.

576
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,260
We won't know until you try.

577
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,040
Now, will you?

578
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,440
Or are you chicken?

579
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,820
We've got you coming and going.

580
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,880
We assault you with so many contradictory messages that sooner or later, your brain

581
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,160
breaks open wide and you say, okay, just shut up.

582
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,260
That's how it worked in those days.

583
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,000
The insidious picture of the publication.

584
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
But the way they were going about it, it was a very, very long process.

585
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,880


586
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,880


587
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,880


588
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,880


589
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:12,880


590
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,180
I think the only way this show works is we have to walk up these spooky 13-step stairs.

591
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,680
I have to go check the tape.

592
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,260
The tape?

593
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Really?

594
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,720
The tape?

595
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,660
Violin and bird guitar.

596
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,480
What?

597
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,120
Well, uh, you fellas better go on up and get completely wasted.

598
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,100
Thanks, Dad.

599
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,820
Mm-hmm.

600
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,060
Come on, Wally.

601
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,940
Warren?

602
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,160
I don't think at all.

603
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,680
Mom and Dad.

604
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,300
Putting me down.

605
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,340
Because I must.

606
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:38,940
Well?

607
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,380
Well?

608
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,700
Mom and Dad.

609
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,880
Weirdos.

610
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,860
Podstock.

611
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:42,860


612
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:42,860


613
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:42,860


614
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:42,860


615
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,680
smokers, and speed freaks.

616
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,340
Phonies.

617
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
You don't understand.

618
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,180
Don't be weirdos.

619
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,280
We knew you were something aimless and unreal.

620
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,760
I wasn't.

621
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,900
Come back. Come back aimless and unreal.

622
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,220
I've tried many times.

623
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,760
My first dream split each other.

624
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,880
So that each may find his own thing.

625
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,020
And I didn't.

626
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,760
Well, where is this thing down?

627
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,540
Mother has remained behind me.

628
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
A second ago, she gently touched my thing.

629
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,180
Sex on the streets.

630
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,420
In every major city from coast to coast.

631
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,840
And get ready for a shock.

632
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
Planning to use.

633
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,320
Planning to use.

634
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,880
Rotten, filthy, lascivious.

635
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,940
Junk.

636
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,520
Junk.

637
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:27,980
Junk.

638
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,580
Junk.

639
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:28,820
Rock.

640
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,180
Rock.

641
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,460
Rock.

642
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,740
Rock.

643
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,060
Rock.

644
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,320
Rock.

645
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:30,500
Rock.

646
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,620
Rock.

647
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,660
It's the beat.

648
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
It's the beat.

649
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,280
Beat.

650
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,860
Beat.

651
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,240
Beat.

652
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,680
Beat.

653
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:36,980
Beat.

654
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,020
You can get beat.

655
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,660
Beat.

656
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:38,880
Beat.

657
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,140
Beat.

658
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,320
Beat.

659
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,660
Teenage girls.

660
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,080
Beep.

661
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,320
Beep.

662
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:42,520
Beep.

663
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,620
Beep.

664
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,180
Beep.

665
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,760
Beep.

666
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,320
Beep.

667
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,000
Beep.

668
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,220
Beep.

669
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,840
Beep.

670
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,840


671
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,840


672
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,840


673
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,840


674
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:48,840


675
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,640
Beep.

676
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,380
Jungle.

677
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,480
Beep.

678
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:51,680
Beep.

679
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,300
Bir Boler.

680
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,720
Stir erwem.

681
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,460
Stir erwem.

682
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,980
Stir erwem.

683
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,440
Stir erwem.

684
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,300
Brendan Belladio.

685
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,460
Bir boler.

686
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,780
Bir boler.

687
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:00,860


688
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:00,960
Bir boler.

689
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
Bir boler.

690
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,080
Bir boler.

691
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:12,840
Bir boler.

692
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,380
Sex on the streets.

693
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,840
Norrell Preff, friends.

694
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,760
www.heavyconfetti.com

695
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,060
From PR News in Washington,

696
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,700
ongoing public with a terrorist threat to New York's subway system.

697
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,300
Economist expected labor because of labor.

698
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,360
It does suggest workers, even though those workers did not work.

699
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,480
Economist expected PR News.

700
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,620
On Wall Street 51022.

701
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,060
The House of Representatives has narrowly approved six new PR News in Washington.

702
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,560
The Warren Commission met.

703
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,800
They never even called.

704
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,540
So did you guys go do it?

705
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,660
Did you guys do what you had to do?

706
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,260
And so in 1965, Garrison was in Washington, D.C.

707
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,400
That's the way the show is sometimes, folks.

708
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,760
You have to do it by yourself.

709
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,440
You're sitting there listening,

710
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
and you're thinking,

711
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,320
these guys just don't do it for me.

712
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,580
I mean, these guys just talk and talk and talk.

713
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,340
That's all they do.

714
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,800
Who the hell cares?

715
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,980
It's like six, ten, eighteen guys talking.

716
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,420
Who the hell cares?

717
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,640
Sometimes a female.

718
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,900
Well, and then, of course, the callers fly or the phones fly.

719
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,460
And he was left out in the Alaskan wilderness by himself

720
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,660
as his plane's motor failed.

721
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,640
And he said,

722
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,720
in this wonderful shot where the cameraman dropped his camera and shot up

723
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
and caught Alan Dulles with a six-floor window in the background saying,

724
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,280
you'll probably not know what happened here in your lifetime.

725
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,820
It was like a setup.

726
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,560
Yeah, the JFK thing's wonderful.

727
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,200
And now it's passed from history into myth.

728
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,940
There is no truth anymore.

729
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,860
There was once.

730
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Something happened in that place.

731
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,740
But there's no sense looking for it now.

732
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
You're crazy out of your mind.

733
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,400
You don't know if anything is real.

734
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,520
Anything.

735
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,600
The reality of reality is not reality.

736
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,160
It's just too much.

737
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,200
What's real?

738
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,820
What's not?

739
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,800
When you stand out in Healy Plaza and there's Robert Grodin

740
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,260
selling his little books like, what does he sell?

741
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh, like that one?

742
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,260
The one underneath the book is like Venus.

743
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,540
The one underneath there is like Robert Grodin.

744
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,800
The one underneath the book.

745
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,720
It costs nothing.

746
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,800
Big old table.

747
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,960
What is a coffee table?

748
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,000
Pictures of Bob.

749
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,380
Yeah.

750
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,360
And properly you would they create an order.

751
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,860
That's the first book of the century.

752
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,940
It's brought too many times.

753
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,420
Please.

754
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,200
We go on.

755
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,380
You're over from PR news in Washington.

756
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm the strongest in South Asia in 100 years.

757
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,500
The Bush administration is releasing of its flu pandemic.

758
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,620
Workers who actually produce the vaccine would be hospitalized.

759
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:08,620


760
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,520
With the illness.

761
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:15,400
Former president Jimmy Carter says faulty Democrats circulated in the past year and a half.

762
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,960
About 1500 union machinists broke down early today.

763
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,900
Machinists in Los Angeles.

764
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,600
Tens of thousands of machinists trapped in the mountainous region of Los Angeles.

765
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,340
In fact, for PR news, I'm already in Los Angeles.

766
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,220
Thousands of machinists in Florida.

767
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,660
On Wall Street 610-635-58.

768
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,460
US military officials say at least

769
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,100
PR news died in Washington.

770
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,120
Now turn that thing on.

771
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,780
You can do this five hour show.

772
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll tell you.

773
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,820
I knew Bob for what he was.

774
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,280
I knew the sub-demics for what they were.

775
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,040
I'm not repeating myself.

776
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,740
Then you are opposed to kidnapping the space man.

777
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,400
This one's closer but I don't know if it's that better.

778
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
No, we are only opposed to killing.

779
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
The headphones are universally bad.

780
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,000
And every other kind of debris.

781
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,280
You know, Bob's promise says that on July 5th, 1998, when that day finally comes,

782
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:20,080
that you, the sub-genius, will be given great power over the pinks and normals.

783
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,740
What will you choose to do with that power, friend?

784
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,080
Will you choose to just wantonly slay the normals?

785
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,720
Your old fifth grade teacher who embarrassed you that one time?

786
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,300
Are you going to kill her?

787
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,720
Are you going to torture her for years?

788
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,260
Or set up a robo-beast that will terrorize her crippled body forever?

789
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,600
Are you?

790
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,000
Friend, are you going to think twice and think how these creatures can be used?

791
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,300
Don't waste your slack on vengeance for years.

792
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,440
Are you renting out these sub-genius hideous creatures?

793
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,980
You know, the hideous creature depends on what your dreams are, my friend.

794
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm not going to do that.

795
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:07,700


796
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,960
If you have hideous dreams, then that's what your creature will be like.

797
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,560
If you have purdy dreams, then you'll have that sex goddess or whatever it was that you had in mind.

798
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,920
So you better hope that you have pure thoughts.

799
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:32,340
Are you going to be asleep when next day suddenly comes upon you like a thief in the night or in the middle of your day?

800
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,600
It's November 22nd, 12, 20 in the afternoon.

801
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:35,860
Are you going to be ready?

802
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,500
Are you going to be thinking about some monster?

803
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,580
JFK, Mr. Trump.

804
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:37,680
JFK, Mr. Trump.

805
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,840
The monster movie you saw.

806
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:47,160
And then forever you'll be trapped in the world of that monster movie or that bad commercial or that bad date you were on.

807
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,080
Instead, when you should have been at church, weren't you being mobbed?

808
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,480
Which, by the way, can happen in a bar.

809
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,580
Is that a one little mob sound guy?

810
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,500
Sounds like a one-man army.

811
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,360
That's that pull-my-finger guy.

812
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, that's the governor.

813
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh, man, it's the pull-my-finger guy.

814
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,600
All right.

815
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,900
This week's great, hilarious, new, trendy.

816
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,980
Your comrade.

817
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,300
Pull-my-finger guy.

818
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,580
See if that makes any difference.

819
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:14,640
Okay, that one's over.

820
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,760
I was told maybe.

821
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,320
Next.

822
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,280
300,000 volts of electricity.

823
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
Get it all fooling around.

824
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,020
And give it up.

825
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,940
Living hell of another world.

826
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,880
The man in it.

827
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,560
Earth is always painting things.

828
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,680
Break it down.

829
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,180
Break down.

830
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,660
Burst into flame.

831
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,200
Come up.

832
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,320
Hit another jack.

833
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,200
And the fire starts to burn.

834
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,540
And the fire starts to burn.

835
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,660
And the fire starts to burn.

836
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,620
And the fire starts to burn.

837
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,920
Freaky boys jamming.

838
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,740
Free me.

839
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:45,820
God.

840
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,580
Here come the funk.

841
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,580
Horrible monster.

842
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,920
Insolent, ungodly monster.

843
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,240
Is she ready?

844
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,300
Isn't he handsome?

845
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,500
It was all in your mind.

846
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,060
Let me out.

847
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,980
Let it go.

848
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,000
Let it go.

849
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,560
Let it go.

850
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,300
Let it go.

851
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,300


852
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,300


853
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,340
Must let it grow.

854
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,660
Only thus can the whole evil be destroyed.

855
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,660
Give me my toys.

856
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,460
Power.

857
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,200
Productive.

858
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,480
Programmed your brain.

859
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,520
We pump it up.

860
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,260
Release her.

861
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,580
Romantic, isn't it?

862
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,420
Shut up.

863
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,360
And sit down.

864
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,440
Skin.

865
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,420
Sublimated.

866
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,640
Take it outside.

867
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,840
Take your.

868
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,760
Take your.

869
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,500
Take your.

870
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,840
That was interesting.

871
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,460
Time to rock.

872
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,560
Wonderful.

873
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,160
You've got a spot.

874
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,460
Must learn to obey.

875
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,320
You.

876
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,500
You will like to make love to me.

877
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Young and beautiful.

878
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,780
Norrell Preff.

879
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:44,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm beating cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev following the weekend's massive PR news.

880
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:50,700
In India, the Prime Minister says more than $110 in federal aid for victims in India, killing 30.

881
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,500
No.

882
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,960
President Bush caused hundreds of deaths.

883
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,560
He's, uh, and, uh...

884
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,800
The President will be on hand for today's reopening of PR News in Washington.

885
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,580
I believe that this nation should commit itself.

886
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,400
Wave on.

887
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,920
Shot and killed.

888
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,060
Enjoy the smell of tear gas.

889
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,720
Heavy.

890
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,100
Definitely heavy.

891
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,140
Anything with monosodium glutamate.

892
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,580
I can't talk and start making.

893
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,400
Tricky dicky.

894
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,540
I met the Kray twins once.

895
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,680
Compared to most successful politicians, and I've come across a few in my time,

896
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,380
they were rank amateurs.

897
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll give you an aphorism.

898
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,320
Politics is legalized crime.

899
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,840
Or crime by consent.

900
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,640
Uh, you're dripping ice cream on your suit, sir.

901
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,660
Oh, yes, damn.

902
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,600
I've discovered I'm a psychopath.

903
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,500
Rubbish.

904
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,520
Caught with their pants down.

905
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,740
America means business.

906
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,320
Think about it.

907
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,740
When doors are opened and closed in the world today,

908
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,000
the orders come,

909
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,340
from Washington.

910
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,100
The watchman watches in vain,

911
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,820
unless the Lord guards the city.

912
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,840
It's attributed to St. Francis de Salle,

913
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,160
but of course it comes from Psalm 127.

914
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,600
Kindly meant, I'm sure.

915
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,620
An interesting quotation.

916
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,100
Kennedy put it into the speech he was going to deliver in Dallas

917
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,280
the day he was hit in the head by a bullet.

918
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,120
Half his brain blown across the street.

919
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,940
That's America.

920
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,400
Temptation Island.

921
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,860
Temptation Island.

922
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,920
Everybody has been burned before.

923
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,100
Plastic Assassin.

924
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,220
I'm not too fond of the Americans lately.

925
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,600
The Americans are like the ancient Romans.

926
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,960
They have exactly the same kind of bad,

927
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,700
bad taste.

928
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,840
They see nothing unethical in wishing to dominate the world.

929
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,660
Kennedy wanted to go to the moon

930
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,080
because he was an idealist.

931
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,320
Johnson wants to go because he's a vengeful bastard.

932
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,260
Why didn't somebody shoot that great big cow-punching Texan slob instead?

933
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,760
I've got a good face, a good bum, and that's it.

934
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,700
I work for the government.

935
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,260
I kill people.

936
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm an assassin.

937
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,360
Come on.

938
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,320
Love my good love.

939
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,820
Yeah, come on.

940
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,820
Love my good love.

941
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,240
I guess it just doesn't feel right.

942
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,600
Everybody can justify murder.

943
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,120
The other fellow's on the other side,

944
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,660
and the other fellow's holding a gun.

945
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,820
The other fellow's going to kill us if we don't kill him first.

946
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,260
I need to go to the bathroom.

947
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,780
I need to go to the bathroom.

948
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,080
Jerusalem, 1961.

949
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,740
The state of Israel put Adolf Eichmann on trial for war crimes.

950
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,640
He was convicted and executed.

951
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,580
I thought I can defend was actually a pretty good one.

952
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,120
I was obeying orders.

953
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,980
What are you people trying to do to me?

954
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,920
Who the hell are you people?

955
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,860
I knew perfectly well what the bomb was for.

956
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,020
It wasn't to finish the war.

957
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,220
The war was as good as over.

958
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,460
It was to keep the Russians in their corner.

959
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,300
To make sure the USA came out on top.

960
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,840
Everyone understood it.

961
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,720
J. Robert Oppenheimer especially.

962
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,180
Sheer arrogance.

963
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,860
Oh, my dear fellow.

964
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Temptation Island.

965
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,620
I tried to find my own Nirvana by gazing at the constellations.

966
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,320
He's paranoid.

967
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,520
It's just very sad.

968
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,880
Norrell Preff, friends.

969
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,200
Speaking of the Kennedy assassination, friends,

970
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,020
the ultimate sacrifice can now be yours.

971
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:13,680
Actually, the book Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman is out now.

972
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:23,340
And I have been waiting for this book for, well, I've known Lamar Waldron for about 17 years.

973
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,740
And that's how long he's been working on Ultimate Sacrifice.

974
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,380
It was finally published in hardback.

975
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,400
By Carol and Graff Publishers.

976
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,860
And you can find out all you need to know at a website called

977
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,560
UltimateSacrificeTheBook.com

978
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,480
One word.

979
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
Ultimate Sacrifice The Book.

980
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,420
Ultimate Sacrifice.

981
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
John and Robert Kennedy.

982
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,460
The plan for a coup in Cuba.

983
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,620
And the murder of JFK.

984
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,380
Friends, it's a whole different story.

985
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,960
It's a whole different look at the Kennedy assassination than what you may be used to.

986
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:11,100
I can't even begin to go into the depths of the research and all of that.

987
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,420
Because this is the hour of slack.

988
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,360
And the Kennedy assassination isn't slackful for everybody.

989
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,580
But I've been around it for a long time.

990
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,680
And this is, you know, if you're really seriously looking for answers,

991
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,360
I, you could, you,

992
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,980
you should definitely check out Ultimate Sacrifice.

993
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,200
The case is not closed.

994
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,040
But this one comes close.

995
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Ultimate Sacrifice The Book.com

996
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,980
Uh, by the good Lamar Waldron and Thomas Hartman.

997
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,000
Praise God.

998
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,420
Wherever you are, however you are, this is the BBB.

999
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,920
The BBB News.

1000
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,840
Today the US Senate have been torturing prisoners.

1001
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,520
BBB News.

1002
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,540
The United States has said that it's bad.

1003
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,880
An Iraqi Deputy Interior Minister had been paralyzed by three people in Hunan Province.

1004
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,520
Others had had their skin peeled off during the BBB.

1005
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,660
The French Parliament has approved violent unrest in a number of French cities and towns.

1006
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,240
The Interior Minister told Parliament that he was beaten and stabbed in the capital, Tunis.

1007
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,780
The Tunisian government has denied that it was behind the organized United Nations attack on Wednesday.

1008
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,200
China says it's producing more than 100 million doses of bird flu,

1009
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,380
and is producing more than 14 billion human deaths from bird flu in a day.

1010
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,360
The US government's announced it intends to take the grisly Interior Secretary, Gal Norton,

1011
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,680
off its list of endangered secretaries.

1012
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,640
hazardous

1013
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,840
zu

1014
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,520
Butts, butts, butts.

1015
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,640
One of the last remaining uneaten helper monkeys.

1016
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,380
Monkeys, monkeys.

1017
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,960
The helper monkey's monkey.

1018
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,640
Monkeys fly out of my butt.

1019
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,000
Rabbit, each sprout.

1020
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,880
Reminded me of some damn funding technicality.

1021
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,700
That figures.

1022
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,940
Community outreach bullfish.

1023
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,320
So.

1024
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,240
Bulltish.

1025
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,460
What language was that in?

1026
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
Friends and each other.

1027
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,520
I was just too full of bulltish.

1028
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,900
Bulltish?

1029
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
Have you just had it with all the bulltish?

1030
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,400
Can you feel?

1031
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,820
You don't look bulltish.

1032
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,520
I'm not bulltish.

1033
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:13,680
Yes.

1034
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:19,800
Sometimes I have to go through these guys and reverse the reverse cuss words

1035
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,740
so that they'll be suitable for the internet X-rated version.

1036
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:24,920
Innumerable.

1037
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,820
Yeah, but nobody...

1038
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,540
See, this show comes pre-cleaned.

1039
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1040
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,700
If you just talk about the bulltish,

1041
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,440
you have to go through and reverse that tish sound

1042
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,280
so as to make it suitable for the internet.

1043
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,580
Are you saying you want to listen to John Tish?

1044
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,120
No, no, no, no, no.

1045
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,940
It's a reverse psychology is what I was trying to use and get some...

1046
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,940
But out here in Dealey Plaza, the dew is forming.

1047
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,240
It's six in the morning.

1048
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,440
I began writing a biography...

1049
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,440
Dealey Plaza?

1050
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,520
I thought this was...

1051
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,820
That's where we're shooting from today.

1052
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,140
Oh, Dealey Playa.

1053
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,760
Oh, you're right.

1054
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,440
Oh, jeez.

1055
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,160
I just...

1056
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,760
In my mind, I...

1057
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,920
Yeah, I know.

1058
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,080
There are all these different crossovers of subgenius...

1059
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,280
It really is.

1060
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,480
My mind is not my mind.

1061
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,100
No.

1062
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,400
My mind is not my mind.

1063
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,720
No.

1064
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,320
My mind is not my mind.

1065
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,700
Oh, and look at the little minds dancing now.

1066
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,040
Step to your left and move towards the black freestanding panel directly in front of you.

1067
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,840
And they are looking in the little mind...

1068
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,820
Right there, right in front of you.

1069
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,220
They're using the mind mirror to see themselves dancing.

1070
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,700
At or around the point.

1071
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,000
And now up.

1072
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,560
There we go.

1073
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,680
Now they're just hitting the roof.

1074
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,120
Oh!

1075
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,260
Oh, that's got to hurt.

1076
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,220
Low-hanging stalactites.

1077
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,320
Too many thoughts about candy.

1078
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,820
Now, more than ever...

1079
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,780
Put your head down, Governor.

1080
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,400
Your mind is...

1081
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,480
It's a battleground.

1082
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,120
And continue with the stills from a home movie taken by Dallas businessman Abraham Zekruder.

1083
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,260
The invading armies of normalcy have already dug in on the beachhead of your desire for acceptance.

1084
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,960
And before I was done, after the seven years of work on this project, now we're in our eighth year.

1085
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,600
And secure with food pay.

1086
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,200
I was doing my own investigation based on all the new documents.

1087
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,460
As the president was shot.

1088
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,640
I was standing across the street from Supreme.

1089
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,980
Yes, you too can learn to edit without splicings.

1090
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,980
Which is, not coincidentally, perilously close to your slack reserves.

1091
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,240
Fabian, did you hear that?

1092
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:16,520
Oh.

1093
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,740
Bend over and empty out those slack reserves, kids.

1094
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,200
Nope.

1095
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,420
Bob's here!

1096
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,160
Do you hear me?

1097
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,340
Oh!

1098
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:23,340


1099
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,760
Ah!

1100
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,340
Ah!

1101
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,180
Freeze, Bob!

1102
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,540
Ah!

1103
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:25,880
Ah!

1104
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,680
Ah!

1105
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,120
Ah!

1106
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,320
Ah!

1107
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,920
Bob's here!

1108
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,300
Ah!

1109
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:29,720
Ah!

1110
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,540
Bob is the drug!

1111
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,940
It's the Bob show, kids!

1112
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,040
Fabian!

1113
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,680
Bob!

1114
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,940
Can you hear me over the microphone?

1115
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,620
Bob!

1116
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,000
Bob.

1117
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:40,640
Bob.

1118
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:40,860
Bob.

1119
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,740
They all ask whether you can hear them over the microphone, and you can't.

1120
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,840
But you always say you can.

1121
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,100
This is moral decay!

1122
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Yeah, sure, we can hear you.

1123
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,740
Moral decay!

1124
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,300
So, uh, then you'll chop this show up and play it on your show, huh?

1125
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,500
Uh, well you'll get that meat, Bob.

1126
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:55,500


1127
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,540
Just like a chop shop.

1128
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,840
Well there was ONE cut.

1129
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,080
Oh well, bred, yeah...

1130
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,080


1131
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,080


1132
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,820
MY dear friend and our great leader, Bob

1133
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,440
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob

1134
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,300
его

1135
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,840
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1136
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,200
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1137
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,480
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1138
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,620
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1139
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,940
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1140
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,280
My dear friend and our great leader Bob

1141
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm treating prisoners humanely.

1142
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,000
This is just the first step in the development of inhumane treatment of prisoners.

1143
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,380
They're expected to...

1144
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,920
adhere to the president for quite some time. On Wall Street 610-514-624-1218, this is PR.

1145
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,540
A white spokesman says today's attack on lawyers could imperil efforts to protect the U.S. from PR

1146
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,860
news in Washington.

1147
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,720
Wall? Honey, I've been thinking. Oh, June, you just don't do things like that.

1148
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,340
Well, I don't think. Oh, June, just don't throw wet towels.

1149
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,340
Oh, osteoporosis. Why wait? Why wait? Fortunately, bone loss can be osteoporosis.

1150
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:09,580
Osteoporosis proven to help bone loss and fractures of the spine. Why wait?

1151
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,800
Okay, and track 14. Now we're advancing into the Christmas part of the show.

1152
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,040
Tubular bells. Yeah. Carry on, gentlemen. I have to take a pee.

1153
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:26,020
Pee on. Pee on. I tried to quit peeing years ago.

1154
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:34,300
I became a breatharian. You know, I must have tried 150 times, and it just always gets the best of me.

1155
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,520
I always end up falling back, you know.

1156
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,480
It doesn't make any sense. I just can't seem to stop.

1157
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,600
Penis. It's like it's got this. He is such a peer.

1158
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,240
It's got this hold on me. He pees every day.

1159
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,020
It's got a mind of its own. Bob, can't you free me from peeing?

1160
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,360
I suppose that could happen, but why would you want to?

1161
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:10,540
Because, really, is that time not what's perhaps one of the most relaxing times you have during your pathetic, hairy day?

1162
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,720
Oh, friend. Oh, working friend.

1163
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,420
Just a moment of serenity.

1164
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,520
I've had better.

1165
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm to face charges of treason.

1166
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,620
The White House's current chief economic advisor has agreed to acquire 21...

1167
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,220
$1.5 billion in cash for about $63.08.

1168
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,280
The federal agency says it has a huge annual financial report today.

1169
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,540
Uganda's main opposition leader pledged he would be Alan Greenspan.

1170
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,100
And will be guided solely by the political influences.

1171
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,120
Greenspan gives Palestinians medical B.O. in Newark.

1172
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,060
His arrest comes after more than three weeks in the job.

1173
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,360
If convicted, Greenspan could face the PR penalty.

1174
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,260
On Wall Street, 4217-2203.

1175
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,140
12-6.

1176
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,900
The Senate has rejected PR News in Washington.

1177
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,840
March of premature babies.

1178
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,320
March of premature babies.

1179
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,520
But still, no one knows premature babies.

1180
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,540
Let's find the premature baby together.

1181
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,940
For information, visit prematurebabies.com.

1182
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,520
Peace in the Pacific.

1183
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,140
Oh, I'm freeing that from the internet.

1184
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,820
I'm very sorry to die.

1185
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,100
And then they stole that idea from the last action hero.

1186
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,100
The whole thing went down the tube.

1187
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:31,480
Oboe.

1188
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,380
Fresno.

1189
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,700
What's your decision?

1190
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,420
Oboe.

1191
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,260
This guy has been overcome by the mushrooms of Fresno.

1192
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,400
Is that like the OEA guy?

1193
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,060
Yeah.

1194
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,700
Oboe.

1195
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,760
This guy lives eight blocks from the guy that stole the lectern.

1196
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,120
What?

1197
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,960
Victor Cantu, that son of a...

1198
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,460
That pink, pink conspiracy duke.

1199
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,600
False subgenius.

1200
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,120
Jackass!

1202
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,560
Poop.

1203
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:01,620
Oh, shit.

1204
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:02,780
Shit.

1205
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,980
You're a fucking child.

1206
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,560
Is there a good idea I can speak to him?

1207
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:05,920
But...

1208
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,400
Who's Bob?

1209
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,680
Bob.

1210
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,100
Bob.

1211
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,840
Hey, hey.

1212
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,120
Bob is Phil in the black.

1213
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,260
No, no, no.

1214
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,760
Skip him down.

1215
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,520
Who is Bob?

1216
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,460
What is Bob?

1217
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,040
Bob.

1218
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,680
Who is Bob?

1219
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,500
How about Frank?

1220
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,000
Yes.

1221
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,320
Is he there?

1222
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,680
What's the answer to that question?

1223
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,920
You'll be in extreme danger every minute.

1224
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,900
And loving it.

1225
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,320
And loving it.

1226
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,160
That lady forgot the trigger for about one minute!

1227
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,840
Okay.

1228
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,660
Hey!

1229
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,580
I saw that thing run up in your

00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:44,580


1231
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,100
That was me.

1232
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,060
I'll never forget it.

1233
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,160
Doc.

1234
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,160

00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,120
What you believe?

1237
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:27,520
And once again, the authors of Mindscape and Grindhouse have triumphed over the authors of Evil and Run.

1238
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,420
Norrell Preff, friends.

1239
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,420
www.heavyconfetti.com

1240
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,260
On PR News in Washington, I'm taking the pain-killing drug.

1241
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,160
Germany's new foreign minister has been pounding Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today

1242
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,580
to improve relations between Germany and the United States.

1243
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,420
Be quiet!

1244
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,040
Federal prosecutors have wrapped up shopping.

1245
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,620
This holiday season, President Bush will be shutting down South Dakota's state government

1246
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,960
to try to build momentum for his PR news.

1247
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,660
Mr. Bush says he wants temporary legal working status.

1248
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,140
The president says Internet shopping may help reverse the gay culture in some American seminaries

1249
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,880
and lead to an even greater PR news in Washington.

1250
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,920
Here's a PR news program.

1251
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,140
The PR Corporation created Congress more than 30 years ago.

1252
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,200
The idea was Congress doles out money to PR radio stations.

1253
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,920
PR's broadcasters.

1254
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:34,340
The PR Corporation's

1255
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,920
own

1256
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,080
PR

1257
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,580
and PR.

1258
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,600
We are constantly confused.

1259
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,680
PR, it's fun.

1260
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,940
If it's not, it should be.

1261
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,520
Crazy.

1262
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,560
You can say that.

1263
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,480
Guys are crazy.

1264
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,140
And that guy in there is a

1265
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,060
viral ass attack.

1266
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,680
Hi.

1267
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,760
Hi.

1268
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,220
How are you?

1269
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,520
I see you outside the ship.

1270
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,160
What's wrong?

1271
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,200
I keep...

1272
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,920
I could swear I hear the ghost of Michael Pepe.

1273
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,700
It's just an illusion.

1274
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,920
It's freaking me out.

1275
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,400
Does that happen to everybody?

1276
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,680
Yeah.

1277
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:07,740
Exactly.

1278
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,440
As the ship turns, as we leave the atmosphere,

1279
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,940
you'll appear to see Michael Pepe near you.

1280
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,500
That's gross.

1281
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,720
I'm not coming...

1282
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:17,940
Hello?

1283
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,900
Is that what they call space puny?

1284
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,180
I've heard of that.

1285
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:21,440


1286
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,400
Hey, hey, hold on.

1287
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:22,920
Hold on.

1288
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:23,640
Hold on.

1289
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:23,860


1290
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:24,400
Hold on.

1291
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,480
Hold on.

1292
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1293
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1294
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1295
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1296
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1297
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,480


1298
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:24,780
Six seconds.

1299
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,100
Hit my knee with a hammer.

1300
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,320
The caller is feeling that right now, too.

1301
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,320
I just got out of rehab.

1302
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:29,920
I'm here.

1303
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,640
I'm getting drunk.

1304
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,440
No, there's no rehab, caller.

1305
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,740
It simply has to wear off.

1306
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,820
Caller, is that you?

1307
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,780
Diesel, um...

1308
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,440
I'm Carl.

1309
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,140
No, that's not him.

1310
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,800
I just want to...

1311
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,020
I just want to...

1312
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,040
Hey, caller, we thought you were the caller for a minute.

1313
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,800
I am the caller.

1314
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,280
Is that caller?

1315
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,560
I just have an unusually good quality phone.

1316
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,200
Where can people get information on this reference, dang?

1317
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,940
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

1318
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,540
Of course, the subgenius website.

1319
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,420
Subgenius.com.

1320
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,160
Subgenius.com.

1321
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,480
Yeah, man.

1322
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,220
I'm sitting here in Dobstown

1323
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,800
waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1324
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,040
Well, I'm sitting...

1325
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,480
Here in Dobstown

1326
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,040
waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1327
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,300
Well, it's a little bit of resistance,

1328
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,120
but you know the pamphlet will keep them deaf and dumb.

1329
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,580
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

1330
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,940
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

1331
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,460
I'm sitting here...

1332
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,580
You can see my long hair

1333
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,020
and my Rastafari hair

1334
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,680
whirring everywhere.

1335
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,740
Is that Rastafari?

1336
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,200
Yes.

1337
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,540
Rastafari number five you're wearing?

1338
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,680
I love that.

1340
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,480
It's not the ganja weed.

1341
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,840
Oh, it's Fropman.

1342
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,540
And we have no need for all his squares.

1343
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,380
Fropman.

1344
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,500
Fropman, yeah.

1345
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,440
Yeah, Smokey Frop.

1346
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,420
So I'm putting up resistance,

1347
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:00,960
but I know...

1348
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
No, Bob Dobbs got no stairs.

1349
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,820
Man, it's a hit.

1351
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,700
I know it's a hit.

1352
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,540
Yeah, it's a hit, man.

1353
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,340
I'm sitting here in Dobstown

1354
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,960
waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1355
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,180
Waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1356
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,180


1357
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,180


1358
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1359
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,660
That's what I'm doing, man.

1360
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm sitting here in Dobstown

1361
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,760
waiting for the Bob to come.

1362
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,080
Where is the Bob now?

1363
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,120
See the Bob now.

1364
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,500
Putting up resistance,

1365
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,640
but I know he's going to leave me

1366
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,920
deaf and dumb.

1367
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:34,680
Deaf and dumb.

1368
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,360
That's right.

1369
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,240
When the Bob comes,

1370
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,540
he'll leave me deaf and dumb.

1371
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,800
I feel so good all over.

1372
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,720
Jimmy Cliff, don't hear us.

1373
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,120
What we are doing.

1374
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,900
To his song.

1375
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,880
No, he won't give a shit, man.

1376
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,660
He's with Bob smoking the ganja from.

1377
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah, yeah, he must be smoking ganja.

1378
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,180
With the Bob in the Learjet.

1379
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,340
With the Bob in the Dobstown in the Learjet.

1380
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,660
Yeah, with the Dobstown.

1381
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,480
Oh, look, there's Werner Erhard over there.

1382
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,020
Werner, Werner, how you doing?

1383
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:00,380
Werner, yeah.

1384
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,380
Look, it's Jimmy Swaggart.

1385
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,040
He's over there with Bob.

1386
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,780
Oh, Jimmy Swaggart.

1387
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,200
There's Earl Roberts.

1388
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,720
There's Ronald Reagan.

1389
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,020
Look what we're doing with Bob.

1390
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,020
G. Gordon Lee.

1391
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,140
Omar Gaddafi.

1392
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,680
Dancing.

1393
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,020
Oh, my God, look at Tower of Duty.

1394
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, God.

1395
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,140
Oh, my God.

1396
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,820
Oh, my God, there's Walt Disney.

1397
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,020
They were all just frozen when they came back.

1398
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,680
That's right.

1399
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,460
We should all have been here.

1400
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,280
Here's the White House.

1401
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,500
Here's the White House.

1402
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,060
The Glass Madness did that song, friends, from 1980.

1403
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm accused of helping PR.

1404
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,700
President Bush has departed from the White House.

1405
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,420
The U.S. military says Dick Cheney's tainted.

1406
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,600
Bob admitted he struggled to figure out what was going on in his head.

1407
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,020
Confused for a while.

1408
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,880
On Wall Street 310-545-64.

1409
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,540
Al-Qaeda in Iraq is accused of illegal PR news.

1410
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,240
Washington.

1411
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,920
I can see the monitor wherever it stands down the studio.

1412
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,880
He's answering questions from the caller at this time.

1413
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,080
Do you have an appetite for bone meal?

1414
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,440
I have an appetite for donuts or beef jerky.

1415
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,740
I like bacon.

1416
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,000
Hi.

1417
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,040
40 minutes.

1418
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:14,920
Serve bacon.

1419
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,480
Bacon pie.

1420
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,120
I can see that.

1421
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,900
Some sweet potato pie.

1422
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,360
Man.

1423
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,060
Just one of the greatest broadcasts in history lined up.

1424
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,080
Bacon pie.

1425
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,900
Mmm, bacon pie.

1426
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,180
Man.

1427
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,280
When was the last time you had a steaming bacon pie?

1428
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,900
Last night.

1429
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,360
But now, I'm fine.

1430
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,520
Sweaty bacon.

1431
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,120
Cucumber sticks.

1432
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,300
Bacon Jesus pie.

1433
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,000
Carrots sticks.

1434
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,820
Well, if you won't let me go, I guess I'm going to go.

1435
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:38,860
Fine.

1436
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,820
Juicy old bacon Jesus pie.

1437
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,500
Okay, please speak with us now.

1438
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,640
Just like Ma used to make down.

1439
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:44,060
Don't.

1440
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,280
Don't.

1441
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,880
The old bag.

1442
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:45,800
Don't.

1443
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1444
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1445
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1446
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1447
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1448
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1449
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1450
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1451
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1452
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1453
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1454
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1455
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1456
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1457
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1458
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1459
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1460
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1461
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1462
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1463
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:45,800


1464
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,320
We're hearing you.

1465
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,180
We hear everything.

1466
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,960
It's just that we can't talk to everybody.

1467
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,400
Reverend Stans made her hang up.

1468
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,280
It's your fault.

1469
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,660
Well, he's not paying attention.

1470
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:54,820
Who?

1471
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,360
What?

1472
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,380
Never mind.

1473
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,340
Go on with your diatribe.

1474
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,740
Somebody said something about, yeah, I can't.

1475
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:01,580
Don't.

1476
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,920
It's just, I get this pep-sick with the bacon.

1477
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,580
Is anybody listening?

1478
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,560
Yes.

1479
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,080
We had a delicate female caller trying to get through.

1480
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,860
They're so rare.

1481
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,380
So rare.

1482
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,120
So rare.

1483
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,760
And we just ignored her, basically.

1484
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,100
The good.

1485
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:14,660
Oh, dear.

1486
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,100
But then again, she probably wasn't.

1487
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,940
You've got to speak up.

1488
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,780
Maybe we, yeah.

1489
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:24,280
And also, maybe we should just let Queen of UFOs speak to her when she comes back.

1490
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,900
I don't think she was part of the cult.

1491
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,780
And calls 8484425.

1492
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,580
All the better.

1493
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:28,960
There she is again.

1494
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,960
Please do call back, dear.

1495
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,560
I hope that.

1496
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:30,620
Please do call back, dear.

1497
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,820
But she's not part of the cult.

1498
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,840
I would much rather speak to people who are not.

1499
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,660
We'd like to have you.

1500
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,060
Like me.

1501
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,440
I don't want you.

1502
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,340
People who are a part of the cult have already sent him.

1503
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,460
That's singing to the choir, babe.

1504
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,620
They're used up.

1505
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,400
They're burned out.

1506
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,320
They're all flashed.

1507
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,400
Their little souls are inside these aluminum containers inside the rocket ship, ready to go.

1508
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,020
You have to go to the children.

1509
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,280
Well, actually, they're still in my basement.

1510
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:53,940
I'm sorry.

1511
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,440
We heard this before.

1512
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,760
I was trying to make it sound a little more exciting.

1513
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,920
Yeah, go ahead, please, and join us as we dance around the radio show floor.

1514
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:09,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm developing nuclear weapons in a facility in Russia.

1515
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:17,980
The White House has fired explosives at Congressman John Murtha after the Pennsylvania Democrats blew themselves up.

1516
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:23,240
A U.S. commander says another two turds failed to break through a bag on Wall Street.

1517
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:25,340
810-712-1222.

1518
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,260
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan says.

1519
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,440
This is PR.

1520
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,920
Steve reports on the effort to fund preschool for all Democrats.

1521
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,720
He's gathered a million billion proposed poor preschool programs.

1522
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,520
President Bush says he supports Russia's proposal aimed at keeping Iran in Russia.

1523
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:50,780
Today, directivist Rob Reiner, strapped with explosives, continues asking for more than $5 at two Shiite mosques in Cuba.

1524
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:57,000
Human rights experts with the United Nations say they will not visit PR News in Russia.

1525
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,040
Ugh, unbeliving the Democrats.

1526
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,560
Put the dream börner before me.

1527
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,880
Be careful, we'd all be killed.

1528
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,120
We're not afraid if they built this newspaper.

1529
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,620
I couldn't believe it, or not even breathe.

1530
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:25,980
And 對不對õ JIM maleno?

1531
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:26,200
We don't have the lineup that would be afraid of nothing.

1532
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:26,200


1533
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:26,460
Please ...
