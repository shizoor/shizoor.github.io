1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Yeah, feel that bump on Bob's dome.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's see, Bob.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,440
Oh, hey, that is a good one.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:05,920
What happened?

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,860
The subgenius hour of slack.

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,320
Toward an inexplicable horror.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,760
Something too ghastly to face.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,360
So let's not.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,400
Instead, let's walk down this shady lane.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,700
Putting one foot after another.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,720
The way to proceed.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,820
The best way out of anything is straight through it.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,920
And so we're going to go straight through another show for you.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,820
In a series of prize-winning Bobcasts.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,380
Familiar to college radio and dyspeptic late-night listeners.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:27,380
So let's get started.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,640
Well, make up your mind.

18
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,080
It's another hour of slack.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,700
Slack.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes, recording here at Wisteria on July the 6th.

21
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,020
That's true, ladies and gentlemen.

22
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,200
Which was not really supposed to exist.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,800
The post-X-Day day, if you believe that sort of thing.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,620
That calendrical fake news.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,660
There we go.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,240
Since X-Day did not happen, it can't be after X-Day.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:06,460
It must be, perforce, before that great day when the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne.

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,160
And the quick and the dead shall be judged aboard the saucers.

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,100
Well, they've already been judged if they're on the saucers at all.

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,620
And they've been judged well and good.

31
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,940
It's just like the Christian great white throne ceremony.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
Which is just for the sake of the ceremony.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,300
Since everybody there is guilty and has to go through the smoking door on the right.

34
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,520
Does his name appear in the book of life?

35
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,160
No, Lord.

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,180
No name ever appears here.

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,160
Then depart from me into the eternal flames prepared for Satan and his fallen angel buddies.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,380
And here's Saturday sketching.

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
And here's the last one.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,320
If this is indeed Saturday.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
Shatterday we call it.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,460
And our hopes have been fractionated into a thousand shards.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,540
Number one, recuperate from Friday.

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,980
Still working on that one.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,440
Is that done?

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,400
There's a few. A few have recuperated.

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
We're recuperating.

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
Most of them are still...

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,680
De-be-cu-perating.

50
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,340
Yeah, they're still super-rating.

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,180
Baptism in Pond, 2 p.m.

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,460
At 2 p.m. we will baptize the faithful in the waters of old Sequaw's lair.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,040
Those brave enough to brave those waters.

55
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,640
Or willing enough to receive the icy benediction of cool embrace of water on a ragingly hot day.

56
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,060
The problem is getting past the wall of ticks to the water.

57
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,560
Yes, well there are plenty of ticks.

58
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,340
There are plenty of ticks in the forest and you don't want to tick them off.

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:09,940
Seriously, there are quite a number of these arachnids and they're all snapping their jaws in anticipation of a blood meal from you, oh faithful listener.

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,080
The other thing today...

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,100
Oh, it says costume or not party.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,220
I have a feeling...

63
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,960
That's your clothes optional...

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,800
Mostly not, no.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
No, so you can...

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,220
Costume or dress like a slob...

67
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,620
If anybody bothered to wear a costume or isn't already wearing a costume...

68
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,420
All right.

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,180
All the time.

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,420
Okay, that's the...

71
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,200
Because some of them are.

72
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,640
That's what used to be called the ball.

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,720
Yes, there was a ball back then.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,700
The costume, it was a ball.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,820
And there was a feast, but that was already this morning.

76
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,860
The feast of St. Swithin's Day.

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,100
Well, we try to keep up.

78
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,960
And the important thing, the Bulldada auction.

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,620
Exactamente.

80
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,660
The Bulldada auction will come up in all its savagery and splendor.

81
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,680
After the baptism in the pond...

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,200
I guess so.

83
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:16,260
We will reassemble our afflicted powers and troop back here to Caffeinas, where we will start putting on display and on sale the treasures of time, subgeniuses donations for the Bulldada auction.

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,360
You can see just a few of the samples here on the desk.

85
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,180
Yeah, the exploding death robot should be really popular.

86
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,060
On the other hand, we still are taking donations.

87
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:39,760
If you have things which you would like to see auctioned off for the greater glory of Bob and his church, you may donate them up to and during the time of the Bulldada auction.

88
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,580
And the Bob burning late tonight.

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
I have seen the effigy auction.

91
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,240


92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,500
Bob himself will burn like a torch to illuminate the true path.

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,520
So, there. That's all. That's our future set out for us.

94
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,540
The subgenius, Otto Daffay.

95
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,600
Although, you know, it still could be X-Day.

96
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,980
Any second X-Day could happen. Any second. Are you ready?

97
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,160
We like to say that in our disappointment every July 6th.

98
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,240
One must be ready.

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,620
If only it would happen.

100
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:28,740
They're always telling us in San Francisco, oh, the big earthquake is coming any day now. Be ready. Have your earthquake preparedness kit.

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,180
I did get one yesterday. A 7.1.

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,300
Wasn't that in lower California?

103
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,840
Yeah, yeah, southern California.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,540
In Los Angeles.

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,760
Right. So, it doesn't matter to you, the northern Californian.

106
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,640
Well, I am sure my dinosaur collection is safe.

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,760
But, at any moment, those two plates could let go.

108
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:58,260
And with an enormous crash, the vanity of man could come tumbling down and be swept away.

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,660
Especially one good earthquake under Silicon Valley. That's what we all hope for.

110
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,520
But, this still hasn't happened.

111
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:14,520
And the only reason I mentioned it is one is always told to prepare and be safe.

112
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,360
But, one may never prepare adequately and there is no safety.

113
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,260
Only a silly propagandistic illusion.

114
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,180
Wouldn't you agree, Reverend Stang?

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,440
So that the exists in their fire and fury could appear any nanosecond.

116
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,300
What's really fun is when somebody decides a city needs to be evacuated.

117
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,160
As if that were possible.

118
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,500
In the next 25 minutes.

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,500


120
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,420
Lower Manhattan must be thoroughly evacuated.

121
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,780
Right.

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,020
Well, the last time the mayor of Houston said,

123
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,840
Everybody get out! This hurricane's coming!

124
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,260
People were trapped on the freeway for days.

125
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,780
And he only meant Hurricane Carter.

126
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,960
Yeah, the hurricane never came, but a lot of people got injured on the traffic jam.

127
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,580
So, there you go, kids.

128
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,560
There's no escape.

129
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,920
You can't get away.

130
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,860
You can climb up onto your attic and then onto your rooftop.

131
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,600
And the helicopters will just fly by.

132
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,520
Sticking their, pilots sticking their tongues out at you, waving.

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,840
If you live on the edge of an active volcano, you can have a safety plan.

134
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,240
But you can't have safety.

135
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,220
Well, here we are.

136
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,780
And there they go.

137
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,060
Yes, once again.

138
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,240
The saucers flying away from us.

139
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,180
Back into the void.

140
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,360
Empty handed.

141
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,540
They didn't lift up any subgeniuses that we know of.

142
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,180
No.

143
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,960
Although I'm going to be really mad if I find out everybody else outside of this camp got ruptured.

144
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,140
Only the suckers that paid money get left behind.

145
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,140
That would be, that would be a pisser.

146
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,680
Thanks, Bob.

147
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,000
Thanks, Obama.

148
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,680
Now let's, uh.

149
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:09,980
Thanks, Obama.

150
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,960
Thanks, Philo.

151
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,400
Thanks, Philo.

152
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,420
Thank you.

153
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,800
Thank you, Bob.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,020
Thanks.

155
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,020


156
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,020


157
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,100
It's okay.

158
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,100


159
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,100


160
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,100


161
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,100


162
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,240
So—

163
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,400
Yeah, go on.

164
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,640
Philo ran off.

165
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,520
He's already gone.

166
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,780
He tends to leave suddenly like the Lone Ranger.

167
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,840
Who was that masked man anyway?

168
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,520
Well, we got one new subgenius today, only he's a really old one.

169
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,120
Oh, really?

170
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,620
Reverend Sosodotta from years past.

171
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,360
Oh, he's—

172
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,240
He has returned to the fold.

173
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,260
Very good.

174
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,900
And is he going to be at the baptism?

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,780
I don't know.

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,440
Below the fold?

177
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,620
I don't know.

178
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,680
There'll be lots of folds visible at the baptism.

179
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,380
That's true.

180
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,980
Vertical wrinkles, the amazing lack of elasticity of the human frame after a certain number of years.

181
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,680
Quite spectacular to view.

182
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:08,640
And these epidermises contain the doctors of the church, the saints that you see all about you,

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,600
who have made all of this possible.

184
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,960
Saints, taints.

185
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,820
The taints of the church.

186
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,680
Irredeemable.

187
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,480
Taint Paul.

188
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,580
Taint Hal.

189
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,460
Taint Philo.

190
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,880
Taint Peter.

191
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,200
Taint here.

192
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,540
Philo taint here.

193
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,040
Philo's taken off.

194
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,780
For the wild fruit of Kentucky.

195
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,200
Of Kentucky.

196
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,820
Yeah, back where he is.

197
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,300
He's got to mow his graveyard.

198
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes.

199
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,340
He actually has a graveyard.

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,560
The old family cemetery.

201
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,140
It's on his property.

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,080
He has a graveyard of humans.

203
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,820
I have a graveyard only of shellfish.

204
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,040
And many other creatures.

205
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,080
Millions of them.

206
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,920
All kinds of animalcules from the bottom of the ancient sea.

207
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,960
Well, we do have the robot skeleton and the alien skeleton and the devil skeleton.

208
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,940
Yeah, I thought you said the same thing.

209
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:11,940


210
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,560
You had a devil skeleton in there.

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:13,980
Yeah.

212
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,600
It's got a long tail with a little...

213
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
A barb at the end.

214
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,220
Yeah, a barb.

215
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,900
A biffid barb of hell.

216
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,760
Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,300
Yeah.

218
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:23,940
Yep.

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,820
And, uh...

220
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,500
Are you interested...

221
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,720
Oh, it's old Mr. Scratch, all right.

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,460
Uh, Hal, you'll find it interesting the devil's jaws in two parts like a bug's mandible.

223
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes, well, you see...

224
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
Sideways and up and down.

225
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,820
They have the ability to pull in one...

226
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,600
One...

227
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,020
The side of one jaw, uh...

228
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,600
Alternately with the side of the other jaw.

229
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,860
Just like the...

230
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,660
Crotolid snakes and like the Tyrannosaurus, uh...

231
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Rex, whose jaw was in two pieces and had two separate sets of muscles to pull...

232
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,500
Them back...

233
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:00,840
Here we go.

234
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Apart and in tandem.

235
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,000
Demonsaurus Rex.

236
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,760
Oh, also interestingly, the...

237
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,840
The fossilized Cretaceous devil has a heart.

238
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,120
A cold, hard heart bone.

239
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I've never seen any other creature with a heart bone.

240
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,900
It's even shaped like a heart.

241
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,620
It does don't pull out that stake that's, uh...

242
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,440
Stuck through it.

243
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,920
Yeah, heart bone and it has a...

244
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,240
What do you call a penis bone?

245
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,820
A baculum.

246
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Or a bacula.

248
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,980
Like a bear or a walrus.

249
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,760
Or a raccoon also has this penis bone.

250
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,500
Yeah, my dad has swizzle sticks made of all of those things.

251
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,620
He does?

252
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,060
Yeah, the walrus bone is big enough to...

253
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,860
Kill somebody with.

254
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,060
Ah.

255
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,720
And it's got scrimshaw on it.

256
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,340
What a murder weapon it would be for Inspector Poirot.

257
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,620
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,680
The scrimshaw walrus pizzle murder.

259
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, the walrus pizzle murder.

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,480
Monsieur, I accuse you of an abominable crime.

261
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,640
Jack the...

262
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,740
Pizzler.

263
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,660
Mm-hmm.

264
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,460
Uh, well...

265
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,260
So, well, we'll display all of those next, next day.

266
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,260
In the Museum of Curiosities.

267
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,360
The Cabinet of Wonders.

268
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,880
At Subgenius Headquarters.

269
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,960
The impregnable fortress.

270
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
Yeah, but the fortress actually...

271
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Bob actually did make the fortress pregnant.

272
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,600
So you could say that it was a pregnant fortress.

273
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,320
There were giants in the earth in those days.

274
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,680
Yeah.

275
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,900
And they moved these huge stones to build the lofty tower you see before you.

276
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:59,560
A couple of days, of X days ago, Bob actually had forcible sex with the back end of Potter Nostril's car.

277
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,880
TMI.

278
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,260
And he and Petal were in the car at the time, trying to get some privacy.

279
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,740
And suddenly Bob was at the back of it, just humping away like crazy.

280
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,780
And didn't it, like, a few months later, had a little Volkswagen or something?

281
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,620
It's a little small D4 broken car.

282
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,660
Yes, Bob's pipe strikes again.

283
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,000
Bob's tailpipe, that is.

284
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,180
It kind of wrecked your car in the process.

285
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,720
It's an old gypsy legend.

286
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah.

287
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,360
Yeah.

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah.

289
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,800
Give it back.

290
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,100
Bob's horrible little bastard bought her children.

291
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,560
That's how Bob tells your future.

292
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,560
He reads your palm, your tea leaves.

293
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,220
And writes your muffler.

294
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,920
Leaving it all split open.

295
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,600
Sopping.

296
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,100
Gross, huh?

297
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,260
Oh, is this the Wolfman dance music?

298
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,880
The victorious dance of Ilonka the Proud at the gypsy camp.

299
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,500
Oh.

300
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,120
You know, she runs off with Professor Lampini's Circus of Horrors.

301
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,360
Yeah, but she doesn't want to make it with the hunchback guy.

302
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,380
Not after she discovers his hunched condition.

303
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,740
It's a very sad scene.

304
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,140
Right.

305
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah, she's all, he's real cute.

306
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,740
And she likes him up until she sees the hump.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,460
Yeah.

308
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,900
Yeah.

309
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,660
That's a surefire.

310
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,080
But then she falls in love with the Wolfman.

311
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,880
Which is exceptionally irritating to the hunchback.

312
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,900
To be turned down and then she goes for the Wolfman.

313
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,740
Right.

314
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,560
It's not like he's all that great of a catch.

315
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,580
Certainly self-absorbed.

316
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,220
Moaning and bitching about his werewolf destiny all the time.

317
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,100
24-7.

318
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,840
Yeah, he does really feel, Lawrence Talbot feels very sorry for himself.

319
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,020
I've said it before.

320
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,480
In his case, he's psychologically.

321
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,260
He's psychologically identifying with the oppressor.

322
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,040
He thinks he's one of the humans, but he's one of the monsters.

323
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,940
He thinks he's one of the humans that something happens to.

324
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,260
And he's on the side of the humans when the monsters have their conspiracy going.

325
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,820
I know a whole lot of subgeniuses that have that same problem.

326
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,020
They think they're human.

327
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,540
Or they think they can pass.

328
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,320
So they identify with these humans instead of with their monster brethren.

329
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,100
That's Stockholm Syndrome, you know.

330
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,020
Yes.

331
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,680
Fall in love with your captors.

332
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,300
Because what else can you do?

333
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,640
It's just a thing that happens when the humans surround you.

334
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,340
The thing next to exit.

335
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,540
No, honestly, I'm surprised.

336
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,440
If it's a mummy, I'm sure they must have been forced to get rid of it by the wave of...

337
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,420
I have a feeling...

338
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,280
... social judgment.

339
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,980
Probably when the gang of young American Indian movement guys shows up going,

340
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,040
You can't have this sacred relic here.

341
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,540
That's when the owner goes,

342
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,120
Look, let me show you something, guys.

343
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,600
He opens up the case and he goes,

344
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,060
It's paper mache, okay?

345
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,080
This never was.

346
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,940
We never had any of your ancestors in here.

347
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,900
This is a fake.

348
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,120
I'm surprised anybody ever falls for it.

349
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,560
I suspect that myself, actually.

350
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,380
It's hard to tell.

351
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,080
I mean, it's so far gone.

352
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,300
It might as well just be paper mache.

353
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,180
Yes, a mummy.

354
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,980
It's supposed to be well preserved.

355
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,880
The whole point of a mummy is you preserve...

356
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Well, the baby really looks bad.

357
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,040
This rotted, crumbled thing.

358
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,700
Well, the baby mummy...

359
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,900
The mummies in Guanajuato...

360
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,980
... are in better condition.

361
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Yeah.

362
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:11,660
Well, I don't get the impression that anyone really intended to mummify this person or paper mache model.

363
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't know.

364
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,760
I don't know.

365
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,460
It's just a, what is it?

366
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,220
You know, from the...

367
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,060
But I do know this.

368
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,400
Make your own conclusions, ladies and gentlemen.

369
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,780
I know where the switch is for all the lights at Carlsbad Caverns.

370
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,560
Uh-huh.

371
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,780
It's one switch.

372
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,000
It can shut off all the lights.

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
All the lights down there.

374
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,480
A ranger foolishly showed us that.

375
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,600
We were the last people to leave.

376
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,600
And we said, hey, what does it look like when it's completely dark in here?

377
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,520
He goes, oh, let me switch it off for a second.

378
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,460
I saw where he reached behind a bench.

379
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
And there was the lights off.

380
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,280
So...

381
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,560
I saw where he reached last year.

382
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Next time we go to Carlsbad Caverns, Hal...

383
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,940
Yes.

384
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,620
We...

385
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,080
We plunge everyone into Cimmerian blackness.

386
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:08,160
Well, first we smuggle some phosphorous or glow-in-the-dark ghost outfits in there.

387
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,800
Gotcha.

388
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:16,620
So that we can be dressed up as Indian, the spirits of angry Indian medicine men...

389
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,400
Yes.

390
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,620
...who are haunting the cave.

391
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,520
So, first we plunge the place into darkness.

392
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,600
Then we, in our cohorts, rise up...

393
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,740
...from behind stalactites or mites or whatever and go...

394
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,700
...going...

395
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,520
...and hope there's not a good guy with a gun.

396
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,140
Well, what if there's...

397
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,220
Because that's always the problem.

398
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:51,260
...panicking, running into the walls, falling into crevasses, impaling themselves on stalactites.

399
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,520
I asked the ranger, do kids ever hide out in here?

400
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,280
And he goes, oh yeah, oh yeah.

401
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,360
He goes, not long ago, these two boys hid in here when they didn't reckon on us turning the lights off.

402
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,240
And it stays 50 degrees all the time down there.

403
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,780
So, yeah, they were scared boys the next morning when the rangers came back.

404
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,380
When the rangers came back laughing.

405
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,240
Yeah.

406
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,840
Well, nobody knew they were there when...

407
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,200
Surely they have cameras and stuff.

408
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,460
Pioneers.

409
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,520
There's plenty of light in there when the lights are on.

410
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,700
Colored lights.

411
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,540
Oh no, they say they're not colored.

412
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,280
They go, these aren't...

413
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,940
Believe it or not, those rocks really are blue, pink, and so forth.

414
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,960
Down there.

415
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,180
That's gorgeous.

416
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,760
I've been in Carlsbad Caverns nine times.

417
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,960
And if anyone wants to see it after next X Day, you're welcome to come to my escape planet.

418
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,580
Where I will have Carlsbad Caverns in the Grand Canyon.

419
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,680
We'll just stick it in the Grand Canyon.

420
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,160
How's that?

421
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,560
I just thought of that.

422
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,860
But you know, it'll be easy.

423
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,720
You just ask Mom to do it.

424
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,140
You don't even have to ask.

425
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,920
It just happened.

426
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,000
It already knows.

427
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,960
And maybe that's why we haven't been ruptured.

428
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,940
Because it knows we still have to do it.

429
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,820
Dirty, dirty, dirty little minds.

430
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,900
We're not going to let these subgeniuses on our beautiful escape saucers.

431
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,820
As long as they're still stuck in the mud plain.

432
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:44,100
Their minds filled with lustful thoughts of desires and sex and coffee.

433
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,120
Speaking of which, I would...

434
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,540
No, I don't need another coffee.

435
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,240
You were thinking of it.

436
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,160
Thinking of coffee.

437
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,020
No.

438
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,580
Well, we need somebody else up here, don't we?

439
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,480
We could always use another voice here to throw more light on the subject.

440
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,160
And we do invite anyone who feels like coming up.

441
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,700
Like perhaps you, Lord Reverend Angry Larry, could take up microphone number three.

442
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,000
And make this duo a trio.

443
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,720
That was the curse.

444
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,260
The accursed...

445
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, that's why I turned it down.

446
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,220
Oh, oh, oh.

447
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,940
It's not doing anything now.

448
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,360
Well, something's doing something somewhere.

449
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,900
Because we're managing to continue after the fact.

450
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,920
And I gather you brought that to quiet your microphone stand.

451
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,940
A wonderful maneuver which prevents those telltale sounds leaking through.

452
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,000
Which indicate equipment being moved.

453
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,000
And we even have the wonder of the headphones here.

454
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,880
Something which in other years was not an option.

455
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, no.

456
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,500
I was wearing the headphones yesterday.

457
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,960
But with Philo's Magna whatever he had up here, this giant whatever.

458
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,620
The Magna woofer.

459
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,120
Yes.

460
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
It was in the way.

461
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,980
It's the thing that keeps his heart going.

462
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,460
Or what do you...

463
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,420
It is his heart, basically.

464
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,300
It's the low frequency modulator.

465
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,700
He doesn't actually have a human heart, Philo doesn't.

466
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,580
He has some sort of overman thing.

467
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,220
One of the rewards he got for working for the phone company for so many years.

468
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,580
No, no.

469
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,880
He got that at Dobstown.

470
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,940
The phone company takes away your real heart.

471
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,440
And so, Philo was able to replace it with an overman heart.

472
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,340
With some kind of a bell heart.

473
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,920
Yeah.

474
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,580
Yeah.

475
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,060
Ooh, there's that breeze.

476
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,320
Yes.

477
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,880
A cool evening breeze on a warm flowery shore.

478
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:11,340
And while we're in this breezy breezeway here at the Church of the Subgenius broadcast,

479
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,920
we are approaching one hour before the baptism.

480
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,420
Remember, this vital ceremony will be held at the church of the subgenius broadcast.

481
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,420


482
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,720
And it will be performed at 2 p.m. at the Pond.

483
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,520
This is a sleepy X-Day.

484
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,440
Snorefest.

485
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,640
Sausage snorefest.

486
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,120
Beautiful...

487
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,400
Snorefest night.

488
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,740
Snorewood, Ohio.

489
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,620
But hey, what did you guys think about the clown show last night?

490
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,200
That was quite impressive.

491
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:42,740
The...

492
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,700
The erupting clown.

493
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,680
The wiener mobile jumping over two flaming cars.

494
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,560
Three flaming cars.

495
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,600
I did not think that I would ever see such a...

496
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Such a marvel.

497
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,400
It was...

498
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,740
Well, they certainly built...

499
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,560
Took their time building up to it.

500
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,120
Well, yeah.

501
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:58,740
As always.

502
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,760
Well, they had to find three people that would donate their cars for them to jump the

503
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,780
wiener mobile over it.

504
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,200
Yeah.

505
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
While the cars were...

506
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,120
Of course, not the real wiener mobile, okay, please.

507
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,480
So...

508
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,380
It was a replica of the wiener mobile.

509
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,080
Yeah, we don't want to...

510
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,020
We don't want to get hung up by Oscar Mayer.

511
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,320
No, there is a life-size wiener mobile out somewhere on the nation's highway.

512
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,540
It's a replica.

513
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,540


514
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,540


515
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,540


516
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,540


517
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,540


518
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,840
It's a replica.

519
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,860
There are several of them.

520
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,040
They actually just posted a thing where they're looking for drivers to where you can drive

521
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,580
one around.

522
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,220
It doesn't have to be a midget like the original little Oscar.

523
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:28,780
No.

524
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:28,780


525
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,380
Yeah, no.

526
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,420
There's one in Dallas and I think there's one in Cleveland.

527
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,180
There may be.

528
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,500
There's one in Detroit and at the Henry Ford Museum that's there.

529
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,180
Oh, right.

530
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,560
Right next to where you can buy Oscar Mayer hot dogs, which I don't recommend.

531
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,040
One of the worst hot dogs I've ever had.

532
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:46,820
Really?

533
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,360
It's like a big slab of bologna.

534
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,340
It's terrible.

535
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,980
Make mine Nathan's.

536
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,260
That's my personal favorite brand.

537
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,320
They're full of garlic.

538
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh, yeah.

539
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:04,020
The actual Safeway house hot dogs are pretty good.

540
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,420
The best thing of their kind.

541
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,840
Hot dog.

542
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,120
Hort dog.

543
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,020
They're large and...

544
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
Well constructed.

545
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,880
What can I say?

546
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:30,540
What one wants in a hot dog is present in these, nor is the price excessive.

547
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,000
And the bulldada will happen after the baptism.

548
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,860
Yes, it will.

549
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
The bulldada will happen after the same.

550
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,240
We could do one now.

551
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,500
We could.

552
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:43,840
We could.

553
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,560
Well, there's...

554
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
Except there's no button.

555
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,040
You need to...

556
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,460
I don't want to go on.

557
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,460


558
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,460


559
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, please don't say this.

560
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,280
There's nobody here with money because I offended people yesterday.

561
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,680
The crowd to be here and refreshed from the immersion and the purgation.

562
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,160
Well, who wants to buy this robot?

563
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,640
Me.

564
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:07,280
Well, you can put in your bid early with your privileged position here, but the point

565
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,840
is we've got to do it when the...

566
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,500
Although, the clown said that they bought a bunch of stuff.

567
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:12,980
Emotional moment.

568
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,560
It's right.

569
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,400
I think.

570
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,180
The clowns want a big penis.

571
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,780
Oh, yeah.

572
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,420
It's here, too.

573
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,820
It's here.

574
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,360
If they're here, they can bid on it.

575
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,980
A big wiener head.

576
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,600
There it is.

577
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,940
It's just the head.

578
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,880
It really looks beat up.

579
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,560
It looks like it has been through hell.

580
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,180
It has been beat on so much.

581
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,400
And mostly by dames, actually.

582
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,240
I used to bring that to the subgenius conventions.

583
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:55,180
There got to be a regular tradition of female takeovers that often involved violence.

584
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,740
And I would sometimes put that thing on to be kind of the scapegoat.

585
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,860
The diffuser.

586
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,240
Well, just to lure them.

587
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:10,980
If they could beat on one dickhead, they'd feel better and they'd leave the rest of us alone.

588
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,720
Well, I must say that.

589
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,060
The padding on the inside is considerably.

590
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, wow.

591
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,760
But where the nose goes.

592
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Yeah, no.

593
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,780
You don't have a whole lot there.

594
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,420
No.

595
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,720
There's tiny little slits for eyes on the underside.

596
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,840
Which makes it look like some kind of a Toho character.

597
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,360
Like this would have fought Godzilla.

598
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,320
Matango.

599
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:30,960
Or Gammon.

600
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,540
Well, it looks a bit more like.

601
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,520
Attack of the mushroom people.

602
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,900
It looks like it would fight big man Japan.

603
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:36,980
Right.

604
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,460
Like you pictured this.

605
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,520
Like, ho, ho, ho.

606
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:39,940
Yeah.

607
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
I'm not being racist.

608
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm just.

609
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,540
Yes.

610
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,080
Yes.

611
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,140
You must be familiar with the attack of the mushroom people.

612
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,680
Yeah.

613
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,180
A.K.A.

614
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,940
Matango.

615
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,940
So if any children go, what is that?

616
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,080
It's a mushroom man.

617
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,180
Oh, okay.

618
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,620
I have one of those.

619
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,980
I can say, I'm President Trump's crotch.

620
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,620
Oh, yeah.

621
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,900
No, not nearly this big.

622
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
No, but it supposedly is like a.

623
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,700
She described it as like the mushroom character in Mario Kart.

624
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,560
Mushroom.

625
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,300
But lives on.

626
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,680
On the island.

627
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,580
Yeah.

628
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,720
Mushroom headed and stumpy.

629
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,560
Strangely.

630
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,580
Stumpy the clown.

631
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,160
Right.

632
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,480
But be a little deformed.

633
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,060
A little asymmetrical fellow.

634
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,840
Whose water that is.

635
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,400
Stumping along on the campaign trail for 2020.

636
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,440
Well, yeah, it's a kind of a liability if you've got a.

637
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,080
He's.

638
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,260
A.

639
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,160
Special.

640
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,380
Recognizable.

641
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,240
Weenar.

642
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,740
Bill Clinton had that problem because he has vitiligo and it's spotted.

643
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,320
Just like Michael Jackson.

644
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,040
Yeah.

645
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,120
And others.

646
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,780
Oh, now we know.

647
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,580
I got a certain piebald condition.

648
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,260
Professor pressure.

649
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,540
How do you know about that?

650
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,520
The spotted leopard.

651
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,440
Well, that didn't mean you have it all over.

652
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,060
You know.

653
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,280
Yeah.

654
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,180
But you just kind of assumed.

655
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,500
And you know what happens when you assume.

656
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah.

657
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,560
You assume to the head of the class.

658
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,340
I tell you what we will ask him when he comes back.

659
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,480
Do you have a spotted pack?

660
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,820
Do you have a spotted packer?

661
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,720
If you pecker spotted like your hands.

662
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,180
I don't mean to be asked something too personal.

663
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,040
Because Princess we has this thing that she believes that your packer may be spotted.

664
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,020
Oh, really?

665
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,740
Well, I didn't realize.

666
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,280
We were going to get this.

667
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


668
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


669
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


670
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


671
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


672
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


673
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


674
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


675
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


676
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


677
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,280


678
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,120
We're having inspections at 5 o'clock.

679
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,820
At the baptism.

680
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,220
Say, all right, drop them.

681
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,460
Let's see if you're speckled.

682
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,560
This and other mysteries will be revealed at that time.

683
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,460
If you have the Michael Jackson disease.

684
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,360
Right.

685
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,640
The Michael Jackson Pollock 5 disease.

686
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,400
So it's coming up, folks.

687
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,500
Set your chronometer for a little more than an hour from now.

688
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,760
So we have this cool ray gun up here, too.

689
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Yes, from the estate of the late president.

690
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,420
Yeah, for all I know, batteries should make noises and light up.

691
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,920
This doesn't explode.

692
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,360
I don't think this right here goes to the robot.

693
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,520
The robot.

694
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,320
Okay, bopper in there.

695
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,480
This is interchangeable technology, ladies and gentlemen.

696
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,360
This car is full of clowns.

697
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,480
It's been made by beings of an extraterrestrial origin.

698
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:48,960
Uh-oh.

699
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,800
Or Japanese.

700
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,400
Celestials.

701
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,140
I could probably put batteries in this and we'll see if the batteries want to blow up in this, too.

702
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,700
Yes, that might be a good idea.

703
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,440
Charge it up with power to spare.

704
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,500
We've got... I got the...

705
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,540
Here's some of those ones that... I think with these ones...

706
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,240
Here's some more-than-kind batteries.

707
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:09,480
Yes.

708
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,060
Oh, no, actually, those are the ones I took out of this recorder.

709
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,540
Right.

710
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,560
They're probably about half... half powered.

711
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,460
Oh, you don't want to put any half-hearted, half-spent batteries in.

712
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,820
Well, these ones are the ones that were on fire yesterday, so I'll try these.

713
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,360
Oh, well, they've all been traumatized.

714
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,980
You're putting in an array of the walking wounded of the battery kingdom.

715
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,520
Okay.

716
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:37,980
Those were violated that were put in the non-functional robot and began to heat up because they were ready to...

717
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,420
Oh, man.

718
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,500
Oh, shit.

719
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,480
There's some... there's some definite corrosion in here.

720
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:41,640
Oh, yes.

721
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,500
Just a little bit.

722
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,680
Acid has etched its way through the cover.

723
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,640
Did these come from... did you find these out when you were looking for fossils?

724
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,700
I found those in... yeah, basically in my basement.

725
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,300
Oh, right.

726
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Just shake them out and we'll dispose of them properly.

727
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,660
Hey, don't be a wiener.

728
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,060
You may already be a wiener.

729
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,560
You may already...

730
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,800
Remember, marijuana is a match.

731
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,400
Maryland is the flame and LSD is the bomb.

732
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,300
LSD is the bomb.

733
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:23,180
Yeah, they used that tape on the WCSB PSA collection.

734
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,960
I hear that almost every week.

735
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,700
Wow, that was...

736
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,020
That was definitely terrible.

737
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,780
Reverend Agri Larry is planning to do the...

738
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,260
I'm not sure I want to see that.

739
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm not going to be around to see how an alien does a ray gun.

740
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,700
We might as well.

741
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,900
These are inferior ray guns.

742
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:54,860
These are made with your non-space age polymers that you... that earthlings seem to tack onto

743
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,760
everything that...

744
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,600
Extruded plastic.

745
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,660
The kind of disintegrating gun that is slowly disintegrating.

746
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,060
Yes.

747
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,280
In the basement.

748
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah.

749
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,420
Let's see where the other end is supposed to go.

750
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,780
Oh, there it is.

751
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


752
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


753
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


754
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


755
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


756
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


757
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


758
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


759
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


760
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


761
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:07,780


762
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,980
Oh, not that one.

763
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,120
Well, we'll know in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, whether this alien device can

764
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:21,260
be reactivated since it's going to be offered in the Bull Donna auction later in the afternoon.

765
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,960
You know, it's funny.

766
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,240
Now that Philo's not here irritating me with this little noise maker, I miss it.

767
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,980
Yes, of course.

768
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,040
He's nice.

769
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,620
We will all remember that next year.

770
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,120
He's nice.

771
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,140
That rascally...

772
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,740
That rascally Philo.

773
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,720
Yes.

774
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,560
He's left us with...

775
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,300
He's wistful for his presence.

776
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,020
Well, if you ask Reverend Lucy Van Pelt, I can be just as annoying if you wish.

777
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,260
Oh, that's a...

778
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,200
I believe you.

779
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:51,660
I...

780
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,080
Oh, oh, okay.

781
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:54,700
Here, let's see.

782
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,280
Why do these batteries...

783
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,540
Okay.

784
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,520
The battery chamber itself could have been fused and melted, but we'll now try to activate

785
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,140
the gun.

786
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,660
To...

787
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:07,940
Oh, okay.

788
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,540
I'm just not the same as I used to be these X days.

789
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,600
How so, Reverend Stang?

790
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,400
Well, this is like the next to the last day.

791
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,000
I still haven't hung up that big vinyl Dobbs head.

792
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,080
I was wondering where that was.

793
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,440
We have a projector, but I haven't bothered to plug it in and point it at a wall.

794
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,620
Oh, oh, look at that.

795
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,360
There's another storage, battery storage area here.

796
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,860
I see.

797
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,220
And those batteries also are long past their prime.

798
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,220
From an older era.

799
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

800
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


801
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,880
Maybe they all have to work in conjunction with one another.

802
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,100
So, you really have to load that thing up with battery sets, so...

803
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,380
For sure.

804
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:54,580
Yeah, that big vinyl Dobbs head is at the bottom of that blue case there behind us.

805
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,460
We never did...

806
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,280
We never did...

807
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,680
But we got the big eyeball back there.

808
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,100
That's a good change.

809
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,380
The giant eyeball that eternally watches.

810
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,120
Yeah.

811
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,840
Okay.

812
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,980
Okay.

813
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
Oculus Aspicidnos.

814
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,520
Tenebrarius in Tenebris.

815
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,500
Oh, wow.

816
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,900
They won't come out, eh?

817
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,640
It's like it's, it's attached in there.

818
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,780
Like something, maybe it was.

819
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:30,620
Almost as if there's something on the other end pulling in the other direction.

820
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,820
Yeah.

821
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,360
Give it a good yank.

822
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:35,880
Well.

823
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,920
rattling around in there. It's just not

824
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,500
letting go.

825
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,500
Where's the pair of pliers?

826
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,080
Pliers. Or a thousand tiny

827
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,520
fingers. Yeah, oh!

828
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,380
It appears to be loose in there, but there's something

829
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,020
When you pull it, there's something

830
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,800
pulling back.

831
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,280
Well, uh, who's

832
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
the master here? Give it a big

833
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,540
pull. Give it a yank.

834
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,240
Some little gremlin's gonna come out

835
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
hanging on to that. Oh yeah, there's somebody

836
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,860
there's someone on the other end.

837
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
Love some little arm holders.

838
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,300
There is a man out on the wing.

839
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,100
What the heck? She wants to get some

840
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,040
white underwear. It might be

841
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,980
best she get them in asbestos.

842
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,060
Alright? Might better get them in

843
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,020
asbestos. And I'm teasing now,

844
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,660
of course. Don't

845
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,980
wear asbestos.

846
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,740
It might get

847
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,160
be harmful to your breathing.

848
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
First I want to remind you that in the last days

849
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,040
there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can

850
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,840
think of. Scoffers,

851
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,220
mobsters,

852
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,780
mockers, and blasphemers.

853
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,580
An organization of

854
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,540
sneering

855
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,940
scoffers.

856
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Scofflaws.

857
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,180
If you will.

858
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,100
Battery had swollen

859
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,980
up. An abnormality.

860
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,060
Oh yeah. All strapped in my

861
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,500
suit. Nonetheless,

862
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,940
we're going to charge it with a pure

863
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,900
battery and see if it can be

864
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,820
revived. These were all death

865
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,120
traps. Everything we're selling at

866
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,000
the Bulldog auction is

867
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,780
hazardous. Possibly.

868
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,840
They're still testing

869
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,940
this one example of

870
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,280
alien weaponry.

871
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,080
Revan

872
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,660
Stang, that woolen cap

873
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,940
seems like it might be warm on

874
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,820
this hot day.

875
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,920
I feel whole, though.

876
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,600
I see. He feels reunited

877
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,760
with his helm. I see.

878
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,540
Well, one must feel

879
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,160
reunited with one's

880
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,000
helm.

881
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,160
Yeah. Well, you

882
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,600
should know.

883
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,760
You often wear a crown.

884
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,080
Not often enough.

885
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,760
An easy-wise

886
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,260
head that wears

887
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,540
a crown.

888
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,680
Nope. This ray gun

889
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,040
is... Is defunct,

890
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,960
eh? It looks

891
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,860
good. Or it didn't come back.

892
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,960
But all it needs is sound

893
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,020
effects. Mounted on the wall of

894
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,100
your den. And that one plug

895
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,940
in that, you know, adds ray gun.

896
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,640
In fact, you draw a little line

897
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,100
from where the gun is in the

898
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,500
picture to where you want it to

899
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,480
appear to be shooting. Unless the batteries that were on fire

900
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
yesterday are default, are

901
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,540
bad now. It could be they were

902
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,740
thoroughly contaminated by

903
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,520
their momentary exposure

904
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,100
to the bad robot.

905
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,900
Oh, yeah. We're going to be auctioning that little zombie.

906
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,680
That bobblehead

907
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,580
zombie. He's kind of

908
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,840
bobble arm. It's a whole body.

909
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,800
It's not just a head. He's a bobble body.

910
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,360
Yes.

911
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,200
One bobble arm and a bobble.

912
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,040
He has a full body bobble going on.

913
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,880
A reanimated corpse. A revenant.

914
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,520
One of the walking dead.

915
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,640
What do we hear for this little

916
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,000
walking dead toy? Are you starting

917
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,960
the auction? Well, this is

918
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,040
just an example. One of the many things that we

919
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,400
will be... I just thought I'd

920
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,600
throw that and see if anyone noticed.

921
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,020
I'm asking because I have been

922
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,780
asked by so very many people

923
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,380
when it's starting. Yeah.

924
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
Well, after the baptism...

925
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,840
The baptism is in an hour

926
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,900
but we...

927
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,600
All in

928
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,800
good time. In the fullness of

929
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,780
time, as Hal would say.

930
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,780
Yeah, we've got lots of time since

931
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,820
the aliens didn't arrive yesterday

932
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,720
and Bob's prophecy

933
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,800
didn't ring true again.

934
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,560
Yes, the

935
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,940
time seems

936
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,860
all wrong where these

937
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,740
matters are concerned.

938
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,280
But, yeah, so now we've got

939
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,720
time to kill.

940
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,480
Time to murder

941
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,260
and create.

942
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,860
Yeah, where's that

943
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,920
clock stabbing dagger?

944
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,500
Well, then, it's right on the front of that pulpit there.

945
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,720
Well, that's just a model.

946
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,620
It's a great model!

947
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,640
Yeah, but we need

948
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,200
a bigger... we're going to need a bigger

949
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,060
clock killing dagger. We're going to need a bigger

950
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,900
clock killing dagger. Okay.

951
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,580
You're going to need a bigger boat.

952
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,220
We need to harpoon

953
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,280
Big Ben.

954
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,200
And that big bully.

955
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,120
In the pond, known as

956
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,820
Leviathan.

957
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
The giant behemoth.

958
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,140
The fire-spitting monster predicted

959
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,060
in the Bible.

960
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,020
His core, a seething

961
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,540
mass of lethal radiation.

962
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,200
Oh, Princess Wee,

963
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,420
since the world didn't end,

964
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,440
you understand what that means.

965
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,120
No, I don't understand

966
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,340
what that means. You're going to have to spell it out for me.

967
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,860
You still have to do Starwood.

968
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,060
Oh, damn!

969
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,600
Yes.

970
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,020
A whole lot of us still have to do Starwood.

971
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,080
That's the largest

972
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,980
unfairness that I've experienced.

973
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,560
Another week of slack.

974
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,420
That we're sentenced to.

975
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,220
Sentenced to

976
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,520
yet one more week of slack.

977
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,780
Darn it.

978
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,120
If only we could go back to that

979
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,780
comfortable anti-slack

980
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,540
we're used to.

981
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,540
Yeah. Chores.

982
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,940
Normal, ordinary chores. Yeah.

983
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,880
Laundry, dishwashing,

984
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,860
yard work. Getting the house sold.

985
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,200
Enough of all this partying

986
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,400
and orgying and

987
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,640
inebriating

988
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,680
and so forth.

989
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,380
Exactly.

990
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:15,740


991
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,100
Oh, that's auction stuff.

992
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,160
Oh, Reverend Watney

993
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,020
Falk's book,

994
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,860
The Blasphemera.

995
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,260
It's in the auction.

996
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,080
The Blasphemera.

997
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,820
It is a great

998
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,120
book.

999
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,220
Yes.

1000
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,480
Great?

1001
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Well, it's great to be...

1002
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,120
I might as well kill myself now if I've achieved greatness.

1003
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,540
Well, I meant great in size.

1004
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,540
It is a great tome in size.

1005
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,540
It should have saved me ten years ago.

1006
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,280
It's a thick one.

1007
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,120
Yes. So that's good.

1008
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,260
We've got three things to auction

1009
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,020
that don't have deadly

1010
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,780
exploding batteries in them.

1011
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,300
Some people pay extra

1012
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,340
for the booby traps.

1013
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,740
But these are...

1014
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,760
Don't speak metaphorically.

1015
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,580
There are.

1016
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,280
Oh, yeah, but that's metaphorically.

1017
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,140
Yeah, they probably won't...

1018
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,360
They'll only explode metaphorically.

1019
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,400
They are decorative objects.

1020
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,680
They'll only blind you metaphorically.

1021
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,560
They simply cannot be switched on.

1022
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,280
And you go and get a metaphorical

1023
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,920
tetanus shot afterwards.

1024
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,040
They're decorative objects.

1025
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,820
Do you think it's all right?

1026
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,140
Oh, wait.

1027
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,260
I have a new lyric.

1028
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,720
To leave the boy...

1029
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,240
To leave the dog when we go shopping.

1030
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,660
No, when we go to X Day.

1031
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,400
Oh.

1032
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:38,780
Yeah.

1033
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,980
To leave the dog here during X Day.

1034
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,980
Yeah, I think it's all right.

1035
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,320
Do you think it's all right?

1036
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,640
I think it's all right.

1037
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,460
I think it's all right.

1038
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,560
But it wasn't.

1039
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,620
He still got out.

1040
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,340
She got out.

1041
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:57,800
She got out.

1042
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,920
Our girl dog got out.

1043
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,180
Yeah.

1044
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,620
But they caught her.

1045
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,280
But he slept through it.

1046
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,160
Idiot.

1047
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,280
He's not a rebel.

1048
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,280
He's just an idiot.

1049
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,120
That's us, friends.

1050
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,980
Hal, would you hold that sign up?

1051
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,160
It's right in front of you.

1052
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,840
That cardboard sign.

1053
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,960
Truer words were never spoken.

1054
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,640
And you know, the person who spoke it

1055
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,880
didn't recognize the truth when he said it.

1056
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,580
He just...

1057
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,260
He was Argus Fox.

1058
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,200
He was sitting up here at a loss for words.

1059
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,380
And he just suddenly goes,

1060
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,980
I'm not really a rebel.

1061
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,460
I'm just an idiot.

1062
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,160
And he said it with such vehemence.

1063
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,080
I thought, that's the subgenius condition.

1064
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,440
Let's face it.

1065
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,080
You know, let's get real.

1066
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,760
As Bob said, but isn't it okay if we're only offending dumbasses?

1067
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,460
Yeah, I think it's all right.

1068
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,400
Yeah.

1069
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,120
Yeah.

1070
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:03,200
Yeah.

1071
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,560
I think it's all right.

1072
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:03,800
I think that's...

1073
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,260
She thinks it's all right.

1074
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,000
But it's okay if we're only defending dumbasses.

1075
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,420
I think that was what he said.

1076
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,080
That was...

1077
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,020
There was some big...

1078
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,120
No, offending dumbasses.

1079
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,300
There was a big PC stink a few years ago.

1080
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,960
And that was Bob's take on it.

1081
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,200
It's okay if we're just offending dumbasses.

1082
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,980
Of course, that's a very offensive thing to say.

1083
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,460
That is.

1084
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,220
But it's direct.

1085
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,240
And he's got a point.

1086
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,200
And yes.

1087
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,160
It is okay.

1088
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,920
Not only is it okay, it's our bound Bob given duty to offend dumbasses.

1089
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,680
That just proves if they're offended, it proves they're the dumbasses that we've...

1090
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,660
You know, that's the test.

1091
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,020
It's an intelligence test.

1092
00:45:51,380 --> 00:46:00,280
When subgeniuses are applying the intelligence test, man, if you can't pass that, that means

1093
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,540
you are lower than a subgenius.

1094
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,820
Of course, some of our...

1095
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,620
If you're below a subgenius...

1096
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:14,700
Some of our numbers, such as Dr. Howell and good old Friday Jones, worked out that the

1097
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:21,720
word subgenius actually can be taken as other than a genius.

1098
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,600
Above or below or around.

1099
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:31,000
You know, sideways or just a tunnel right through the middle.

1100
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,520
Okay.

1101
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,260
So...

1102
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:40,180
And that's the exception by which we had both Friday and Dr. Howell.

1103
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,280
Correct?

1104
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,720
Well, yeah.

1105
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,380
They managed to bamboozle us into convincing us they weren't geniuses.

1106
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,700
Simple behavior observations will reveal that anyway.

1107
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,720
Sub.

1108
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:56,460
Beneath.

1109
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,380
Eventually.

1110
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:58,860
Other than.

1111
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,260
Aside from.

1112
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:00,560
Yeah.

1113
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,040
But not mensa.

1114
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,520
You can't be in mensa and Church of the Subgenius at the same time.

1115
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,560
You can't.

1116
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,500
Can't do it.

1117
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,420
We do have a cure.

1118
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,340
Yeah.

1119
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,300
We have a cure.

1120
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,020
You can either...

1121
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,460
She wants the cure, Reverend Stein.

1122
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:16,820
Yeah.

1123
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,340
Well, there's two approaches.

1124
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,200
Okay.

1125
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,180
One is the ball-peen hammer.

1126
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,760
One...

1127
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,380
Well, it's kind of a laying on of hammers.

1128
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,140
It's a...

1129
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,420
You'll forget.

1130
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,900
You won't remember it.

1131
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,220
It'll hurt for a minute.

1132
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,800
And the other one, of course, is just drugs.

1133
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,280
Plain, ordinary liquor will do it.

1134
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,040
Don't need anything fancy.

1135
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:46,620
We've got proof all around us of geniuses who've now become saved subgeniuses, although

1136
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,280
their livers are almost gone.

1137
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,760
Their brains at least now qualify.

1138
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,780
Geniuses don't need livers.

1139
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,100
I didn't get that.

1140
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,780
Geniuses don't need livers.

1141
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,580
Or was it don't eat livers?

1142
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,520
I thought it was eat livers.

1143
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,340
Don't eat livers.

1144
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:01,900
Don't eat livers.

1145
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,620
Don't eat livers.

1146
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,620


1147
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,620


1148
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,620


1149
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,620


1150
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,540
Well, subgeniuses don't need brains.

1151
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,020
But they do eat brains.

1152
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,800
Don't need no livers.

1153
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,740
Or perhaps a six and a half dozen of the other, as my brother used to say.

1154
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,280
Remind me not to have any more of that allergy.

1155
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,120
No more allergen?

1156
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,000
No, I can't.

1157
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,700
The pollen is just not...

1158
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,040
I can't handle it anymore.

1159
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,020
I used to be able to.

1160
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,840
I used to be able to handle everything.

1161
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,580
The excess had been rupturing bits and pieces.

1162
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:32,780
I don't know.

1163
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:32,780


1164
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:32,820
I don't know what else is.

1165
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,380
My energy is I think what they took last year.

1166
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,140
Well, actually they took...

1167
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,300
I don't even want to go into what they took last year.

1168
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,640
But now look at me.

1169
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,740
A wisp.

1170
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,720
A shadow.

1171
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,500
A pathetic shard of a once man.

1172
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,640
Now dear, you're not a wisp or a shadow.

1173
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,200
No.

1174
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,720
No.

1175
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,320
No.

1176
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:57,420


1177
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:57,980
No.

1178
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,180


1179
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,340
Look at me.

1180
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,340


1181
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:58,340


1182
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,400


1183
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,200
I've created my own bubble cell and my own body, individually suffering the pain of a

1184
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:13,380
hundred billion pains, each pain being distinct and worse than the last, and every cell has

1185
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:22,360
this pain of 100 billion pains multiplied by that number of cells.

1186
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:25,000
It's probably a hundred billion cells in my body.

1187
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,360
Maybe 6.

1188
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,160


1189
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:35,040
Internal intestinal flora and fauna aren't real happy either.

1190
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,000
They all have indigestion.

1191
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,200
So imagine that.

1192
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,120
You're very bowel bugs having indigestion.

1193
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,680
And insomnia.

1194
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,680
Twitching all night long.

1195
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,440
That's messed up.

1196
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,200
Yeah.

1197
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,840
Yeah, man.

1198
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,980
So yeah, hurry up, X-Day.

1199
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:54,780
Come on, Bob.

1200
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,560
Where's the fountain of youth?

1201
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,200
It wasn't any of those pills I thought it was.

1202
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,300
Or exercise.

1203
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:12,400
I've discovered the hard way that that which does not kill me makes me weaker and weaker and weaker.

1204
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,580
Age is one of those things.

1205
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,240
Just all by itself.

1206
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,300
Just simply growing older.

1207
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,060
Damn it.

1208
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,820
You know, I was sitting here going, I don't have anything to talk about.

1209
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,040
But then I realized, yeah, I do.

1210
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,980
My health.

1211
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,720
Problems.

1212
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,980
I'm an old man.

1213
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,980
That's all old people talk about.

1214
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,340
Their ailments.

1215
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,700
Damn it.

1216
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,780
My dang pups are barking.

1217
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,080
It's not interesting, dear.

1218
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,720
My lumbago's acting up.

1219
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,060
I know there's a storm coming in.

1220
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,100
I can just feel it.

1221
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,780
You can feel it in your bones.

1222
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,720
And they talk to me through the fillings in my teeth.

1223
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,000
Do you feel it in your lower spinal series?

1224
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,780
Mm-hmm.

1225
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,820
When the storm clouds are forming?

1226
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,760
No, actually, I don't.

1227
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,500
But my sister does.

1228
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,940
She calls me up and says, storm's coming.

1229
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,720
She's right.

1230
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,820
However, she's in a women's prison in Texas.

1231
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,460
Boy, I've learned a whole lot about the criminal law justice system that I never expected to.

1232
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:19,740
As our public defender said, most families never have to deal with a murder trial.

1233
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,240
Man, it's just, it is pretty serious.

1234
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:25,900
He's right.

1235
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,080
Well, you find out all kinds of things.

1236
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,920
Insurance companies won't insure a house owned by a felon.

1237
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,520
You can't get insurance.

1238
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:45,260
My sister had to give her house to her son so that we could continue to insure it in case it burns down while she's gone.

1239
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,960
Dang it.

1240
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,180
Oh, I've got funny letters, too, that I left most of them at home.

1241
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,220
But I got one I was going to read.

1242
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,120
The things I don't want to smell anymore.

1243
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,140
Things I don't want.

1244
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,920
Things I don't want to hear anymore.

1245
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,500
And things I don't want to see anymore.

1246
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,080
When you're in the most boring and uncomfortable place in the world.

1247
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,080
An interesting document.

1248
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:14,720
You end up writing a lot of letters to your sarcastic loved ones in pencil.

1249
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,500
And coloring in coloring books.

1250
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,200
She reads about three novels a day.

1251
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,520
Let's see.

1252
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,200
Musings.

1253
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:37,500
There is no one in this new dorm that I've met yet that I can converse with.

1254
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,240
Nothing other than the usual.

1255
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,380
What's for chow?

1256
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,380
Have they called mail yet?

1257
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,620
In case you didn't know, the world is full of terrible human beings.

1258
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,540
I realize they aren't all terrible.

1259
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,180
But I despise people more than ever now.

1260
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,600
Oh, here's her.

1261
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,120
Things I don't know.

1262
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,480
Things I don't ever want to hear again.

1263
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,440
The constant sound of fans.

1264
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,840
I know how she feels.

1265
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,600
That's off the chain.

1266
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,020
That's what's up.

1267
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,920
She wants to be with you.

1268
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,140
She just doesn't know how.

1269
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,560
It's got her feeling some kind of way.

1270
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,460
It's got her feeling some kind of way.

1271
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,360
Oh, another one.

1272
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,940
I'm finned to go.

1273
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,100
Things I don't know.

1274
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:28,100


1275
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:28,100


1276
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,740
Things I don't want to see on a daily basis.

1277
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,360
Number one, ass crack.

1278
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,080
Pants under the ass cheeks.

1279
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,280
Hence the ass crack.

1280
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,640
Guards.

1281
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,720
Yellow lines to walk in.

1282
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,680
Razor wire.

1283
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,180
And women.

1284
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,400
Even ones that look like men.

1285
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,060
Things I don't want to smell anymore.

1286
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,100
A. The chow hall.

1287
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:05,440
B. Twenty different kinds of commissary food all being, quote, cooked at the same time.

1288
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,560
The farts of a hundred and two women.

1289
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,680
Hey, boys.

1290
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,320
Her bunkie wants to know if we know any men she can write.

1291
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,500
Interested?

1292
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,700
In answer to your question,

1293
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,740
no, she is not in the least bit attractive or interesting.

1294
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,060
No, she does not have money.

1295
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,800
Yes, she will probably talk dirty.

1296
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,680
Yes, she is looking for a savior,

1297
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,420
although she claims to believe in Jesus.

1298
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,420
So doesn't she have one already?

1299
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,500
What else could she need?

1300
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,240
It boggles my mind that people who claim to believe they have a savior

1301
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,340
or an afterlife of eternal bliss

1302
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,080
are the ones who are not.

1303
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,300
They are the most afraid of death.

1304
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,620
Death doesn't scare me.

1305
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,120
Dying is a concern, but not death.

1306
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,480
Well, she's been dead.

1307
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,460
She has actually...

1308
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,560
uh...

1309
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,920
She's been...

1310
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,360
She's already been there.

1311
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:13,400
Yes.

1312
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,540
Yeah. She's like the...

1313
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,220
What's her name in Peaky Blinders?

1314
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,620
The matriarch.

1315
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,360
She was actually had her head in the noose

1316
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,320
when the pardon came through.

1317
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,720
And she...

1318
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,460
She said, you know,

1319
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,040
I've already been there.

1320
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,880
There's nothing else you can do to me.

1321
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,360
Huh?

1322
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,540
Yeah. Yeah.

1323
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,680
Yeah, my sister says that is her.

1324
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,960
Nearly to die can be good medicine.

1325
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,940
Yeah, my sister is like the professor

1326
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,080
on Gilligan's Island.

1327
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,140
And the people

1328
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,300
are amazed that she...

1329
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,760
She remembers the words

1330
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,120
to all the songs

1331
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,760
in her head.

1332
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,720
She won't sing them, but she can

1333
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,760
recite them and then the other girls

1334
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,280
sing them.

1335
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,560
She...

1336
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,600
She knows...

1337
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,780
They were flabbergasted when she described

1338
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,560
where Israel is.

1339
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,080
She had to explain

1340
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,840
why Robin Hood

1341
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,800
doesn't just go get a gun.

1342
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,320
She had to explain

1343
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,540
that this country,

1344
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,800
the USA,

1345
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,940
was not always English speaking

1346
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,240
white people.

1347
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,020
They did not know

1348
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:38,640
that.

1349
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,100
So,

1350
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,720
this...

1351
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,900
She has to

1352
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,840
explain the Star Wars movies to them

1353
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,460
constantly.

1354
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,200
Why'd they do that?

1355
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:54,460
Well,

1356
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,620
you know,

1357
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,480
it's...

1358
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,140
It's...

1359
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,600
I mean, she's been...

1360
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,620
She had a regular job out in the world.

1361
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,260
She'd been passing,

1362
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,560
like we all do.

1363
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,080
But they were regular,

1364
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,640
ordinary,

1365
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,680
ignorant Pobuckers that,

1366
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,660
you know, could read something.

1367
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,160
Regular pinks, not the extreme...

1368
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,340
Right, regular pinks,

1369
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,260
not the extreme...

1370
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,200
The victim Pobucker...

1371
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,300
God! And yeah, they do divide up into

1372
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,940
gangs, and she ended up hanging out with

1373
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,740
the Mexicans, mostly,

1374
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,840
because they didn't seem to have as big of a hang-up.

1375
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,760
It was like they didn't really care

1376
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,720
that much.

1377
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:38,900
And, uh...

1378
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,060
But you don't get to be friends

1379
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,800
with anybody for long, because everybody

1380
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,540
gets moved around, and they're constantly

1381
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,560
shuffling them.

1382
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,960
In order to get a pillow,

1383
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,660
she has to have a special

1384
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,880
doctor's visit. To visit

1385
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,180
the doctor, you have to sit on a crowded,

1386
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,060
un-air-conditioned

1387
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,600
bus to

1388
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,600
Galveston. On a hard,

1389
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,860
un-cushioned seat, the bus

1390
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,840
bumps and bumps the whole way.

1391
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,160
Yeah, it stops at all the other prisons in between,

1392
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,920
so it takes all day long.

1393
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,000
And that's just to talk to a

1394
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,920
doctor, and say, I really

1395
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,640
need a pillow.

1396
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,800
That's the only way to do it. It's like the

1397
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,380
system of control.

1398
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,280
They remind you every

1399
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,860
step of the way that

1400
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,900
you are a bug.

1401
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,820
Yes, little girl?

1402
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,440
They also have to be subject to a humiliating

1403
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,100
search, just when they leave

1404
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,060
and when they return. Oh yeah, any time

1405
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,980
you go out or come back, or even when

1406
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,100
we go to visit her. You get a visit!

1407
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,960
Yeah, she then has to

1408
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,080
be, you know, get

1409
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,860
a humiliating search. Strip searched, not just a search.

1410
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,460
Strip searched. Yeah.

1411
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,560
Yeah. Over and done.

1412
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,880
They make it as humiliating as possible.

1413
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah. It's just constant

1414
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,980
reminders. Oh, we're gonna

1415
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,320
have to head down to the pond.

1416
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,740
That's right. Skip back. It's time.

1417
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,840
Yeah, we have to go.

1418
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,020
It's, it's, uh... In 15

1419
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,640
minutes it will be a two-zone... It's time for the

1420
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,040
trek to the pond. I predict there will be

1421
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,880
four people standing on the bank

1422
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,280
and two in the water. It may take a moment to get set up.

1423
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,900
Don't we have room in our vehicle

1424
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,000
to take people if people can't walk

1425
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,900
that whole way? People, yeah, people, sure, but

1426
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,000
this... Subgenii, I

1427
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,940
meant subgenii. People, yeah,

1428
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,440
people, sure, but this... Listen to me.

1429
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,080
If there are subgenii that can't make

1430
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,860
the walk but want to be in

1431
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,060
the Bobtism, don't

1432
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,180
you think we could bring a few? Yeah, it's a long way.

1433
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,940
It's a long way. It's all the way down

1434
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,900
at the swimming hole. It's a long

1435
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,740
way to Tipperary. We have a vehicle there.

1436
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,820
Uh, there are only three

1437
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,780
seats being used out of

1438
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,720
four,

1439
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,380
and then you can probably... Okay, bye.

1440
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,180
Okay, bye.

1441
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,180
Okay, bye.

1442
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,220
Okay, bye.
