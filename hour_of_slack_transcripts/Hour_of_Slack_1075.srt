1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm dreaming of the subgenius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm dreaming of the subgenius power of SWAT.

3
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,400
And in the next few, we are traveling through time.

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,980
Yes, we are delving deep into the past of the subgenius church.

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,880
And it's seeing exciting and terrifying memories and things you never knew before.

6
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,100
Are you ready?

7
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,720
Because it's going to be quite a trip.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,780
It's been quite a trip for me, friends.

9
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,140
We're doing this for the Maybe Logic Academy online course.

10
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,080
A course in how to run your own mind control cult, do's and don'ts.

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,800
And history of the Church of the Subgenius, the first 100 years.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,360
Honest.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,420
If you don't believe me, check out maybelogic.org.

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,320
Anyway, friends, we've been studying the events of the years of 1981.

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,380
And 1982.

16
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,020
And 1980.

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,560
And 1980.

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,140
The early years when we first encountered our dear, dear friends.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Such as Palmer Freedies of Lies.

20
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,300
A dead wellman of puzzling evidence.

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,620
St. J. King.

22
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,580
St. Byron Werner.

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,660
Pope Sternodox Kiekefer.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
St. Janger Hypercletes.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,820
And the great Snavely Eklund.

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,100
And so forth, friends.

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,540
Yes.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,600
Well, so join me as we go in this episode.

29
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,020
Back.

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,940
In time.

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,480
To the year of 1981.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,520
The time of the first world subgenius convention.

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,460
Which luckily was filmed professionally by Larry Silkus of Showtime's What's Up America.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,660
That's why some of the audio actually sounds pretty good in these.

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,020
And, friends, the spirit was so high.

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,880
And so were we, I must admit, in some cases.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,160
Not all of the doctors survived.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,920
Those early years.

39
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,440
Some lost their faith in Bob.

40
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,980
Some lost their love of Reverend Stang.

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,880
Some just simply died.

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,500
Quite a few have died since then.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,080
It's a shame.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,700
Anyway, friends.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,000
You will see and hear in your mind's eyeball.

46
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,440
The fervor and the intensity of the early subgenius.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,520
Which will last many years.

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,560
When Bob was new to us.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,020
And we had just rediscovered our own inborn slack.

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,100
And so.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,960
Friends, won't you join me as we pull the lever back on our machine?

53
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,640
Our Wayback Machine.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,100
And watch as the calendar pages fall away.

55
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Night and day flap like a giant black wing.

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,640
and we watch the seasons wheel and pass in reverse

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,860
going back, back, back to the year of 1981

58
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,100
and the beginning.

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,380
So actually this was in November 2021 and 22,

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,960
the day of the John F. Kennedy re-assassination

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,100
and the 1981 first World Subgenius Convention in Dallas.

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,520
Put your hands, put your hands, put your hands

63
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,520
But what is there is killer, man, killer.

64
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,820
It would be breaking our brain cells asunder.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
We'll mix it in the water supply at the convention.

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,460
I think we should put it in the hamburgers that we give away.

67
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,820
Oh, Doug, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,280
The Trillade.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
You, Jim, you'll have to pardon Doug.

70
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,640
His mind is completely gone.

71
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,380
He's gone since the convention.

72
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,540
He still thinks it's going to happen.

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,500
He doesn't realize that it's already happened.

74
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,420
The convention will be a great success.

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,540
I can see it now.

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
300 men dressed as Bob, men and women with Bob masks

77
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,060
marching down the main street straight to Dealey Plaza.

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,600
Oh, we'll have a limousine with a Jesus and a John Kennedy inside.

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
And his dreams get more and more bizarre every day.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,740
We'll have everyone shoot at it.

81
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,460
Really?

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,020
We'll have a lot of real guns.

83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,880
Oh, it will be wonderful.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
The froth in the water.

85
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,680
Tell Doug to send lots of tapes.

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,240
That's a perfect idea.

87
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,180
And Kool-Aid.

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,900
We'll force everyone to drink Kool-Aid.

89
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,540
Buck will bring the Kool-Aid.

90
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,040
Buck has a...

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,520
I should mention, friends, for the sake of clarity,

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,940
that back in those days, I was Doug Smith.

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,380
There were too many Dugs in the church.

94
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,080
There's also Doug Wellman of Puzzling Evidence.

95
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,240
And so I became Ivan.

96
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,600
So this is the big time.

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,540
So this is the World Subgenius Convention.

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,420
Six or seven guys standing around with their eyes half open.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,440
Why don't you guys sit here and pick in the notes.

100
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,120
Get a thumbs up there.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,060
So this is the big time.

102
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,060


103
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,620
Big deal.

104
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,880
Well, whoop-dee-doo.

105
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,700
Poo-dah, poo-dah.

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,600
Okay.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,640
None of them are the real Dicks, but we have to have all those Dicks on hand.

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,660
Just in case.

109
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,480
You mentioned it's too big and there's more people than we expect.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,040
And if we don't have anything left to do, we'll pass out the Dicks.

111
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,880
And let them all have a...

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,240
Well, these Dicks only last about five minutes,

113
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,940
but they will get their taste of it.

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,220
It's like they have a Bob Dick.

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes, indeedy.

116
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,400
And what do you think?

117
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,600
Doug, do you think it would be a poor taste to put Bob Dicks on everybody?

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,720
And more especially than that, the Bob Dicks we can forego,

119
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,360
but what about putting Bob Heads on 50 to 150 people,

120
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,800
carting them down to Dealey Plaza for 15 minutes?

121
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,460
That's all the time any of us have to record the scene.

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,780
15 minutes.

123
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,300
Hell, that's four Super 8 cartridges.

124
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,620
It's a change and a half in an Aeroflex.

125
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,780
So, I say, yeah.

126
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,420
What do you say, Doug?

127
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,700
I mean, here in Dallas, Dealey Plaza is sort of a sacred place,

128
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,040
but most people have forgotten who that guy was that got shot there.

129
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,880
And like me, they didn't even know where it was.

130
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,820
So, you know, now they will.

131
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,640
They'll know that Dealey Plaza is where 500 Bobs shot the President.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,780
And the pictures of the 500.

133
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,980
And Bob shooting the President.

134
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,360
And I want to know what part you want to play in this.

135
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,540
I mean, Doug, this Dealey Plaza thing, you haven't said anything about it, hardly,

136
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,320
except for the black cardboard limousine

137
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,900
and wanting to do some separate shoots earlier in the charade.

138
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,300
But, I mean, surely you must have a role in this.

139
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,340
This is like a damn passion play.

140
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,320
How much of the convention is ready, Dr. Drummond?

141
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,020
How much of the convention is actually ready?

142
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,140
It's about 72.8% ready.

143
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,420
It's Friday night at 6 o'clock?

144
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,140
72.9.

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,320
But if nothing else, I can get the big piece out.

146
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,320
Focus up on the face, please.

147
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,700
So I had a good time with you in Dallas.

148
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,480
What a guy.

149
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:37,860
What a guy.

150
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,020
What a guy.

151
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


152
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


153
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


154
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


155
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


156
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,040


157
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,180
I thought there was going to be 20 people here tonight.

158
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,200
I didn't know who.

159
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,500
Like, aren't they, huh?

160
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,880
Maybe there won't be anybody.

161
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,540
We won't even go.

162
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,120
I mean, earlier I've been thinking, I've been, you know,

163
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,820
there couldn't be too few people.

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,240
But now I'm thinking, I hope there is, you know.

165
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,640
I hope there's very few people.

166
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,540
Yeah!

167
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,260
Where did the mix board go?

168
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,680
Subject is panel discussion.

169
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,280
Yeah!

170
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:02,840
Yeah!

171
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,960
Woo!

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,540
Two microphones to every garage.

173
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Two tickets.

174
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,940
Two tickets in every amplifier.

175
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
Let's have a stereo.

176
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,860
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,400
27 doctors for Bob.

179
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,500
Waylaid by the conspiracy.

180
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
27 doctors for Bob.

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,720
Woo!

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,820
Take one down and smash him!

183
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,380
26 doctors for Bob on the wall.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
It's ultra meaningful.

185
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,060
Is Arnold Palmer here tonight?

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
Arnold's not here.

187
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,580
But I thought you'd look.

188
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,400
Good.

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,380
My name's Sterno Doxon from Little Rock, Arkansas.

190
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,400
Puzzling evidence representative Doug Wellman from...

191
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,960
Oakland, California.

192
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,740
Deep in the heart of San Francisco.

193
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:53,540
And we represent a segment of myriad doctor bands abounding now from coast to coast.

194
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,100
Have you been getting news on doctor bands?

195
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,980
Doctors for Odin, doctors for Wotan, black and white Oakland doctors for Payne,

196
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,560
doctors for Bob, the Arch Emulators.

197
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,280
There's Devo who's stolen everything.

198
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,260
Quiet!

199
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,540
Has life been bending you over lately, brothers and sisters?

200
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,900
Has it been your night in the barrel for the past few months?

201
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,700
Have you been down so long it looks like up to you?

202
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Well, the problem is not a lack of Jesus.

203
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,080
No!

204
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
The problem is not a lack of Yahweh.

205
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,740
No, no, no.

206
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,260
The problem is not a lack of the Reverend Mayer.

207
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,260


208
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,260


209
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,260


210
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,940
No, no, no.

211
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:37,940


212
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,260
The problem is not a lack of God.

213
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


214
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


215
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


216
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


217
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,260


218
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,220
A problem is a lack of slack.

219
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,860
A lack of slack!

220
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,900
A lack of slack!

221
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,820
A lack of slack children.

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,940
The conspiracy is all around you.

223
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,700
It surrounds you.

224
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,340
It's in these walls.

225
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,320
Look at that paneling.

226
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,940
Ordinarily that would be conspiracy paneling.

227
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,380
Conspiracy floorboards.

228
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,720
And ass-deadening conspiracy chairs.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,860
But tonight those chairs, those grins, that faithful.

230
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,240
The Beef Street negorzea that sleム판 ресignashni Donald Trump have to leave this dinner

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,240


232
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,240


233
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,240


234
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,420
It belongs to Bob!

235
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,900
It's Bob's flower!

236
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,060
It contains slack!

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,520
It delivers slack up until you lay barely!

238
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,780
Give me a slack!

239
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,800
Slack!

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Give me another slack!

241
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
Good God almighty!

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,660
Come forward young man!

243
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,960
The voice is normal speed.

244
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,860
It should be normal speed on this recording.

245
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,720
If the batteries are still...

246
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,620
Yeah, here in Texas everything's 10 times tough.

247
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, anybody who knows how to play high school...

248
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,900
Ha ha ha!

249
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,380
Ha ha ha!

250
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,800
Ha ha ha!

251
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,140
Oh, hell no!

252
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,600
We're here at the beginning of the subgenius.

253
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,120
Tape on your situation.

254
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,540
And you!

255
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,400
You!

256
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,380
Dear overmodulated friends are here on the right channel.

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,160
But does that stop us?

258
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,340
No!

259
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
It doesn't stop Doug Smith.

260
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,720
You'll be able to hear on the exciting left channel.

261
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,800
The sound of the music.

262
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,720
The sound of the music.

263
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,220
The sound of the music.

264
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:18,980
The sound of the music.

265
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,300
Thanks to Ggasm, to your area.

266
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,680
In the background,

267
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,420
Dr. Philo Turner on saxophone.

268
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,640
Ivan Stang on speech.

269
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,840
Paul Riddies.

270
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
Palmer Vides.

271
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,520
On bass guitar.

272
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,240
The unknown man.

273
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,520
The unknown musician on lead guitar.

274
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
And Mr. T. Ggasm himself.

275
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,100
Unconsciously inside the bass drum.

276
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
The unknown man.

277
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,740
The unknown man.

278
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,480
The unknown man.

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,860
Now I'd like to...

280
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,360
Ha!

281
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,140
What?

282
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,020
No!

283
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,620
Ha!

284
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,720
Ha!

285
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,560
Ha!

286
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,360
Ha!

287
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,120
Ho!

288
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey!

289
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,140
Ha!

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,800
Ho!

291
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,280
Ho!

292
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,420
Now we're really about to have a little

293
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,580
If you were in the night first,

294
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,380
This giant doctor's for somebody's jam.

295
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,340
This giant doctor's for somebody's jam.

296
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,220
Yeah, everybody here is a registered medical practitioner of the black arts.

297
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,500
It delivers slack up unto you, lay barely.

298
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,840
Give me a slack.

299
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,940
Slack.

300
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,260
Give me another slack.

301
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,160
Slack.

302
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,220
Good God almighty.

303
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,680
Come forward, young man.

304
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,760
Stand before me.

305
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,520
This young man was never a wayward sinner, no.

306
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,720
This young man was always in a state of grace.

307
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
But there was one thing wrong.

308
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,000
He was brought up in the world of the conspiracy.

309
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,300
Yes, Bob had to fight the conspiracy in this boy.

310
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,740
Bob had to struggle to get inside this boy.

311
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,300
Tonight, tonight I'm going to lay hands on this boy and give him slack.

312
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,020
We finally shifted gears and we are back.

313
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,440
We've got the giant Bob head taped to the back of the Bob mobile.

314
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Stacked full of some genius equipment.

315
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,500
And...

316
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,640
The overman is in the trunk.

317
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,320
Ha ha.

318
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,140
Waiting.

319
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,720
Waiting to be revealed.

320
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,720
At the height of glory.

321
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:48,420
As the subgeniuses from all over the world congregate and file, single file, down Main Street, Dallas, Texas to Dealey Plaza.

322
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:57,660
Where they will carefully and with restricted respect fornicate upon them.

323
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,520
The...

324
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,520
Grassy knoll.

325
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:00,940
Ha ha.

326
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,680
Ha ha.

327
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,180
Oh, that is.

328
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,740
Look at that.

329
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,360
Ah.

330
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,920
Ah.

331
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,600
What does it say?

332
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,980
Rock Wang.

333
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,140
Odin Wotang.

334
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
I believe that the message got through to our children out there tonight.

335
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,500
And that's why I came here was to try and influence our young persons.

336
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,960
To try to better this young man, of course.

337
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,540
To say, say it without saying bye.

338
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,860
Praise Bob, brother.

339
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,220
Praise Bob, brother.

340
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,940
Praise the Lord.

341
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,900
That's right.

342
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,580
When you were there on the block.

343
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,180
It was weird, man.

344
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,600
Because I was just laying there.

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,660
It was like every refrigerator you had ever opened in your life.

346
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,400
It was Tom, Bill, and Bruce.

347
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,880
The problem with the subtenues is they don't pay well.

348
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,880
I don't think the Cadillac that I got was good pay.

349
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,800
I mean, that by itself is...

350
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,240
I can get a Cadillac.

351
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,820
The business already got me three Cadillacs.

352
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,100
I don't care about that stuff.

353
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,180
What I'd like to know is the TV dinners and the room with the fair mama while I'm here.

354
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,640
Is that supposed to be money?

355
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,880
Or is that something that I...

356
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

357
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,980
You get a room with a store that?

358
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,500
Yeah.

359
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,640
Oh, God.

360
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,240
Yeah, I'm sorry.

361
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,140
They're paying for it?

362
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,280
No, not for you.

363
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,040
Not for you.

364
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, but for the camera, yes.

365
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,080
They're paying for it.

366
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,100
They're paying for it.

367
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,260
Ugh.

368
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,360
Wow.

369
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,420
For low Arnold Palmer's first words, his first utterances were...

370
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,840
Yeah, well, I'm real glad I flew down from Oregon for this, you guys.

371
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,680
Yeah, I'm real glad.

372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,940
I think I'm going to get fired from my job for taking off the whole last half of the league.

373
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,200
Big deal, right?

374
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,960
Yeah, I'm so glad to be here.

375
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,940
I mean, it's like...

376
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,000
Thanks anyway, Doug.

377
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,220
Yeah, where's Bob, Doug?

378
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Many people may wonder, who is Gebrog Fram?

379
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,800
What is his message for humanity today?

380
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,900
What is the difference between Gebrog Fram, for instance, and Jehovah One?

381
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,200
What's the difference between Gebrog Fram and he, Gebrog Fram?

382
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,100
How come we always talk about Lotan instead of Jehovah One?

383
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,980
How come we always talk about Lotan instead of Lotan?

384
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,960
I mean, what kind of Otan is that?

386
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,540
How come all you people pay $10?

387
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,700
It's a stupid question.

388
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,200
No, I can't wait for the convention.

389
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,080
I can't wait for the convention.

390
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,760
It's wonderful.

391
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
Well, I'm going to go to the store.

392
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,560
Put Jim down on the Xeroxes.

393
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,240
I'm going to go to Smeet for a 14-year-old.

394
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:52,680
Are you ready to receive Slack, child?

395
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,520
I do.

396
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:54,960
I'm ready.

397
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


398
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


400
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


401
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


402
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


403
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


404
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


405
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


406
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


407
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


408
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


409
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


410
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


411
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:54,960


412
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm ready to receive Slack.

413
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,300
Stand there before him.

414
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,300
Come this way.

415
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,500
Boys, is this young man ready for Slack?

416
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
Is this man ready to receive?

417
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,680
Come forward.

418
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:05,680


419
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:05,780
Follow him.

420
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,080
Come here.

421
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,320
Come here.

422
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,380
Come here.

423
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,980
All of you, come here.

424
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Yes, you.

425
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:12,840
And you.

426
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Hold still, young man.

427
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,240
Hold still.

428
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,320
Stay right here.

429
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,040
Stay right here.

430
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
When we lay hands on this boy, look for the spirit of the conspiracy to leave the room.

431
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:24,940
I don't know.

432
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


433
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


434
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


435
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


436
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


437
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


438
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


439
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


440
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:24,940


441
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,220
I don't know.

442
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,520
I don't know.

443
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,100
But stand next to him and hold his arm.

444
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,920
This might be violent.

445
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,340
Give me that.

446
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,080
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, take his other arm.

447
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,920
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, the force will be violent.

448
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,640
It's not a fit site for children.

449
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,820
Take off that mask, son.

450
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,360
Are you ready, boy?

451
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,380
Hey, Douglas.

452
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,300
What?

453
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,000
What?

454
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,680
What?

455
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,760
What?

456
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:54,920
What?

457
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:54,940
What is going on?

458
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,160
Watch your eyes, ladies and gentlemen.

459
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,060
When the conspiracy leaves this boy, this room will be cleansed, but I'm not responsible

460
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,500
for the forces unleashed.

461
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,720
You saw Raiders of the Lost Ark.

462
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,180
And when a Nazi scum opened that artifact and they were turned to wax, you saw the end

463
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,900
of the devil's reign.

464
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,340
And when Ernest Borden had melted before your eyes, that's nothing compared to the force

465
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,660
of the conspiracy.

466
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,500
But the force of the conspiracy always yields to the force of whom?

467
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,240
Bow.

468
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,640
To the force of whom?

469
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,460
Bow.

470
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,940
To the force of whom?

471
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,500
Bow.

472
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm gonna lay hands on this boy.

473
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,240
Are you ready, son?

474
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,960
Silence, please.

475
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,400
In the name of all conspiracy,

476
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,760
McDonald's French fries,

477
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,740
Trans Am T38 with those white mag wheels,

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,500
and chrome reflecting glass buildings,

479
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,900
leave this boy!

480
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,860
Now, hit it!

481
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
The power of Bob!

482
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,320
The sacred power of Bob!

483
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,280
Will the pipe bring this boy back? Yes!

484
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,760
The force of the conspiracy is strong,

485
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,480
but the force of Bob is stronger.

486
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,700
A pop on the Bob pipe will free this boy!

487
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,580
He rises! He rises! He's filled with the spirit of Bob!

488
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,600
Say hallelujah! Say hallelujah!

489
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,480
Say hallelujah!

490
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,200
Say hallelujah!

491
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,620
Raise your hands!

492
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,280
Raise your hands, children!

493
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,780
Raise your hands!

494
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,080
It looks like your problems are all over.

495
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,700
I bet.

496
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,880
Well, it looks like there's nothing left to do but calm down.

497
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,520
It was a weird, strange experience.

498
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,300
I wasn't expecting it.

499
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,780
And now, though, I accepted it.

500
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,120
Yes.

501
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,420
Now, was that a good rant?

502
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:57,720
You can.

503
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,220
But I thought it never did.

504
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,140
I thought this subjeaned shirt was a lie.

505
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,740
That never gave me industrial consultation

506
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,900
or exorcism of the demon Negi.

507
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,920
But I found out I was wrong.

508
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,380
Through the love and the hate of Bob.

509
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,700
We'll see.

510
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,280
We'll see.

511
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,500
We'll see how long this transformation lasts.

512
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
We'll see if people should spend their money for this.

513
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,220
We'll see if it's as useful to you as your high school diploma.

514
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,320
Yeah.

515
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,880
We'll see.

516
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,680
Whatever.

517
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,500
Go to high school in bedroom slippers.

518
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,660
Yeah.

519
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,640
Free shoes.

520
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Clemio Clemish clan.

521
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,900
Clemio Clemish clan.

522
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,120
I'm speaking in tongues.

523
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,260
Is this doctors for Bob or some cheap imitation?

524
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,260
Or is this doctors for Bob that blows the reed out of even toy saxophones?

525
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,900
Or is this an entirely different bunch of doctors?

526
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,300
It doesn't really matter what kind of doctor.

527
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,360
I mean, there's general practice.

528
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,480
There's no general practice.

529
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:24,580
There's nurse.

530
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,460
There's orthodontist.

531
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
There's orthopedist.

532
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,020
There's podiatrist.

533
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,040
There's pediatric.

534
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,900
There's pederast.

535
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,540
There's all kinds of guys to fix up what you need.

536
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:46,060
But really, you've got to ask yourself, is it the doctor you need or is it just the pills?

537
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,400
Wouldn't the pills be fine?

538
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,380
I mean, that way you don't have to go sit around in the waiting room and hope Dr. Chad

539
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,480
that neighbor can get to you.

540
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,540
You don't have to talk to all the dumb nurses and write him a chat.

541
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,580
You can just sit at home and get those pills for the video.

542
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,320
Really, that's all you need.

543
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,740
I will lend the pills.

544
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,040
The pills, well, it might help you get a better attitude.

545
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,000
That's the whole difference behind the medical situation.

546
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,940
We're not prepared to consult with you about it until we've talked to your bank.

547
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,360
You said truly you must lead the, you know, the treatment.

548
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


549
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,360


550
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
The child is the father to the man.

551
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,660
Which man?

552
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,120
The man, man, the man.

553
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,860
The man, the man with the plan to stick it to the man.

554
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,520
Hey, there's the man.

555
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,300
Well, officially, Philo, any comments before the end?

556
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,340
Just waiting for the transfiguration.

557
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,900
Oh, sorry.

558
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,980
The transfiguration is tonight.

559
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,260
It's tonight.

560
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,420
It's going to happen to me in just a few short minutes.

561
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,500
You're going to behold the transfiguration on that stage.

562
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm going to perform the transfiguration on that stage.

563
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm going to come on demure.

564
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,620
I'm going to start off leading the plot gently.

565
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,320
And before I'm done, I'm going to have this crowd knuckle walking from here to Palestine.

566
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,080
All right.

567
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,280
That's the kind of word I like to hear.

568
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,000
You'll wait and see what happens tonight.

569
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,400
I will be talking in tongues.

570
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,420
Hey, are we ready?

571
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,120
How many tongues?

572
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,500
Yeah.

573
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,120
Doug.

574
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,680
Hi.

575
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,080
Hey.

576
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,520
Hi.

577
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:13,980
Hi.

578
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,380


579
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:14,800
Hi.

580
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,180


581
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,300
Hi.

582
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,360


583
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:16,580


584
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,280
Hi.

585
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,460
Applaus for Doug and technicians on set.

586
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,240
You're the hosts of the last episode ofечноaco, less towards the end time.

587
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
Don't get ALEX down.

588
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:37,960


589
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,760
He had a great time.

590
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:38,780


591
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:38,860
See you soon.

592
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,320
All right, pal.

593
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,640
Not too late.

594
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,940
We don't get too busy in a long time, do we?

595
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,560
There we go.

596
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:46,800
Thanks, everyone.

597
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:46,800


598
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:46,800


599
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:46,800


600
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:46,800


601
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:46,820


602
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:46,960
Yeah.

603
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,440


604
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,440


605
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,440


606
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,200
My crew and I are just enjoying what we're seeing on everything and no real changes.

607
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,720
All right.

608
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,340
We're going to come back and catch a couple of snow cold sunshades.

609
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,800
I can't.

610
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:23,660
$300.

611
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,880
That pill's too big.

612
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,180
Kill me.

613
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,540
Listen, you'll hear laughter in your head.

614
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,940
That pill's too big.

615
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,640
It'll choke me.

616
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,220
It'll kill me.

617
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:32,920
No, no, go ahead.

618
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,380
Go ahead.

619
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,800
It'll hurt.

620
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,200
It'll hurt.

621
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,700
I did it.

622
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,140
I did it.

623
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,840
All right, all right.

624
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,480
I'll break it up.

625
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,420
Hey, this pill tastes, it tastes, it tastes kind of good.

626
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,120
In fact, I'm starting to feel pretty good.

627
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,400
Whoa.

628
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,600
There's Bob.

629
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,320
There's Bob.

630
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,400
Bob, he's been here all along.

631
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,700
Yeah.

632
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah.

633
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,820
Yeah.

634
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,120
That's right.

635
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,980
The one-take rhythm killers, the music haters, the jackasses, the shitty Beatles, also known

636
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,420
as Doctors for Bob, the men of covenant men.

637
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,440
Jehovah One made a covenant with us.

638
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,960
He's met a mighty man, mighty healer.

639
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,080
That's his name.

640
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,860
Oh, Robert.

641
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,040
Oh.

642
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,760
Doctors for Bob.

643
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,040
Doctors for Bob.

644
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,700
Doctors for Bob.

645
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,940
Doctors for Bob.

646
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,700
Doctors for Bob.

647
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,620
Doctors for Bob.

648
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,300
Doctors for Bob.

649
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300


650
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300


651
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300


652
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300


653
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,900
Doctors!

654
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,260
Doctors!

655
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,880
...the uber-divers.

656
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:15,240
That's right, and a lot of you people who haven't spent enough money yet can talk Philo about getting the foot gland operation.

657
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,300
He is doing that during this convention.

658
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,980
He was a little bit drunk last night.

659
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,840
There will be numerous of our doctors who are present for gland escaping.

660
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,280
Another clinic has just been recently constructed in Dallas.

661
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,440
You no longer have to pay the expenses of flying all the way to Malaya.

662
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,820
The one that was burned down in Little Rock is well on its way to being rebuilt.

663
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,700
Thanks to your donation.

664
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,100
But we can always use more.

665
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,960
But in the meantime, if you really think there's something wrong with the clinic,

666
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,140
there's something dreadfully wrong with you.

667
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,700
Well, we're the person managers.

668
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,700
We're there to help the masses of the ill people, the sick, the deflated, the tired people.

669
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,480
And it's not the pills, it's not the prescriptions, it's not the doctors with the little rubber hammer who play.

670
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,920
Well, they're making the music of heaven itself.

671
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,540
Conservative. Clean out the...

672
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,360
Well, the tubes and things that you have.

673
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,280
The tubes that are plugged up.

674
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,300
Maybe by having a little bit too much money on you.

675
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,920
Yes, you can unplug those tubes.

676
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,320
We can sit down.

677
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,200
It won't take more than a half hour initial session.

678
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,560
You can fill out one of the applications for us.

679
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Fill out our credit application.

680
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,480
You'll walk out of here with a bucket of pills.

681
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Yeah, a bucket of pills.

682
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,180
A big, big pill.

683
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,320
They're big pills.

684
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,040
They're little pills.

685
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,040
We got little tiny pills.

686
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,940
Some of the pills, some of the pills you can drag over the wall.

687
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,200
You can pour them out into a glass of water or a glass of coke.

688
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,040
Some of the pills you have to put in other places besides your mouth.

689
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,440
Some of the pills, well, some of the pills you just put them in your shirtline.

690
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,700
Keep them near your heart and all that.

691
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,920
Some of the pills, well, they're dangerous.

692
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,040
And you should operate machinery on those pills.

693
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,900
What do all those pills have to do with that?

694
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,780
Well, it depends upon if you're talking about the buckets of pills or the quarts of pills.

695
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,260
Like we're talking about, and what we mean by a bunch of pills is not like half a bathtub full of pills.

696
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,940
It's the half of reality of those rotten buckets of pills.

697
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,120
And we're talking about it not being much fun when Johnny Law comes here and takes them pills away.

698
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,280
So we're talking about like these pills that we're talking about.

699
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,680
It's called the more.

700
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Very simply put, the bunch more theory.

701
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,120
In other words, if you send us a little money now, we guarantee you'll get a bunch more later.

702
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,760
Not a little bit more.

703
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,840
Not too much.

704
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,540
Not a lot more.

705
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,140
Not just a quarter of the whole thousand bathtub pills, cut to the ring mark with money.

706
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm talking a bunch more money.

707
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,560
I'll give you the money.

708
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,080
Raise the money.

709
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:10,620
And when the word of Bob becomes nothing but worn out cliché, that's when we'll get a whole bunch more.

710
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,480
If you'll meet us behind the park closet, I'll thank you, my son.

711
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,300
Oh, yes.

712
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:15,980
Thank you.

713
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,940
We'll give you the money tomorrow.

714
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:17,920
Thank you.

715
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:27,040
One of the folk has just thrown a large handful of pocket change at the doctors.

716
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,960
Others are falling asleep.

717
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,780
Now the doctors are throwing the money.

718
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,920
They're launching the herds of the common metal peasants.

719
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:58,780
Over in the corner, a journal or someone is writing a dollar bill and passing it from doctor to doctor.

720
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,320
The doctors are smoking the dollar bill.

721
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,260
They say the smoke, the souls are going up to heaven.

722
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:45,440
Then they say some sign saying Halloween, Ils

723
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,440


724
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,040
The bloody head of John Kennedy is being rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

725
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Wonderful.

726
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,880
Yes, I can see that the bloody head of John Kennedy is being rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital.

727
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,000
Leaving at the spot.

728
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:06,060
Memorial Motorcade here, 18 years to the day after the sneaky head was still alive in Dallas.

729
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,780
How many members are there?

730
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,820
There's two men.

731
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,140
Any other misconceptions?

732
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,960
What do you do with the money?

733
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,260
There's three members.

734
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,240
Nobody knows the name for Slackman's children.

735
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,000
Bob.

736
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,540
I'll tell you what, nine-tenths of the continent of Asia have not yet heard the word Bob.

737
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,380
These people need to be told that Bob's name is Bob.

738
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,500
I've talked to Eflin in 65 different languages and this takes five minutes.

739
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,360
It's Bob.

740
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,440
It's Bob's pills.

741
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,040
It all comes together.

742
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,880
And what do the exes have to do with us?

743
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,300
Well, the exes have brought these invented pills down.

744
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,640
There's an exes in there.

745
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,660
I can see two.

746
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,640
I can see the exes.

747
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,120
I want to know about the exes.

748
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah, there they are.

749
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,000
It's not a manner of liking exes or disliking them.

750
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,920
It's a problem.

751
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,960
It's obeying them.

752
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,440
Or not finding them.

753
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,040
Find these problems.

754
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,500
You know, your place on the nine-tenths of the continent of Asia.

755
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,920
You guys are a band of doctors, right?

756
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,440
Right.

757
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,240
We're actually three different bands.

758
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,160
Okay, there's three different bands represented in this case.

759
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:35,720
Doctors for Bob is historically the father band, spawning an unlimited number of other doctor bands,

760
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,600
which this fad of genius music is making us a lot of money right now.

761
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,080
And that's my primary motivation for being here.

762
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,040
Bob has nothing to do with this.

763
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,580
Yeah.

764
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,080
Bob has very little to do with everything.

765
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,120
And a lot to do about this.

766
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,180
So, I haven't brought this in my life.

767
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
What about our link-loader's daughter who did ask us and jumped out of a window?

768
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,560
No comment.

769
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,920
Oh, yeah.

770
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,580
I'm crying.

771
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,340
I'm crying.

772
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,120
I'm crying a lot.

773
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,580
I'm crying a whole lot.

774
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,020
I'm crying so much too.

775
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm crying a lot, lot.

776
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm crying a real lot of much a whole lot.

777
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,060
I'm crying so much it's filling up buckets.

778
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,520
It's filling up my house.

779
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,600
It's filling up my yard.

780
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,460
It's filling up the streets.

781
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,140
The whole city's a river.

782
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Because I've been crying a lot.

783
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,940
Yeah, there's lots of water around.

784
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,120
From the tear-drops.

785
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,560
They've been squirting out of my head.

786
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,440
I think I'll cry a hundred more tears.

787
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,460
Yeah, I think I'll cry a hundred tears.

788
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,180
I think I'll cry a hundred more tears.

789
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,940
In the last minute and a half.

790
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,460
Oh, now it's one second every second.

791
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,500
96 tears.

792
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,980
They've squirted out of my head.

793
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,800
Oh, my head's been squirting tears a lot.

794
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,020
Then I turn around and it's squirting a lot more.

795
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,160
Oh, I've been crying 96 tears.

796
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,300
And it's flooded the town.

797
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,340
Now we're floating out.

798
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,000
Now we're in the ocean.

799
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,100
And we're floating around.

800
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,600
And a lot of tear-drops.

801
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,400
Because you left me.

802
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,700
And it's your fault, bitch.

803
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,220
You left me.

804
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,840
You flooded the world.

805
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,740
It's your fault.

806
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,760
You have the lives of millions on your conscience for the rest of your life.

807
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,260
Because you left me.

808
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,500
And I've been crying a lot.

809
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,580
And it's flooded the world.

810
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,180
Oh, mama.

811
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,000
Look, I'm so mad at you.

812
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,880
I could just piss.

813
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,040
But if I piss some more, then it'd flood the rest of the world.

814
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,440
So I'm crying.

815
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,100
And I keep on crying.

816
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,240
And now it's your fault.

817
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,620
And all those people are dying.

818
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,180
Oh, I'm crying.

819
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,600
And baby, you can just go jump in the lake.

820
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,840
Because I've been crying, crying, crying.

821
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,520
And don't come back no more.

822
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,260
I'm not sure you've been crying.

823
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Oh, I've been crying 96 tears.

824
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,380
96 million if you're playing on 96.

825
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,800
Oh, 96 big tears.

826
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,900
I cried 96 real big tears.

827
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,920
I cried 96 big old giant tears.

828
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,260
You remember that tear I cried?

829
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,520
You remember that big old tear I cried that time?

830
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,080
That was one of the 96 tears.

831
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,660
All those tears.

832
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,540
And then I cried that other time.

833
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,700
That back at that time when I was crying a lot.

834
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
I cried one big old tear.

835
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,300
And it was the 96 big tear.

836
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,200
I cried that day or that minute or that second.

837
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,180
Because I was crying a lot.

838
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,040
I didn't keep track of all of them when I cried.

839
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,840
But it was that one tear.

840
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,400
That one big old giant tear.

841
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,800
That one tear that just made my head split open when I cried it out.

842
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah, I split my brains out and my head was open.

843
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,000
And I cried that one giant big old tear.

844
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,920
That was the tear that I sent back.

845
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,320
Because it was big.

846
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,900
Too big for me.

847
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,940
Or too big for Smith and Jones.

848
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,760
That one big old tear.

849
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
Because I always thought I was crying.

850
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,140
And it took me two days to pass that tear.

851
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,180
Oh yeah, and I'm not lying.

852
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,760
I passed that big old tear.

853
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,620
And I split my head and ripped it open.

854
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,860
Because I was crying a lot.

855
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,460
And now this next line is going to be the end of the song.

856
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,740
Oh yeah!

857
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,680
Well, now that we're here in Potato Land,

858
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,680
why don't we go searching for some of the things

859
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,600
we couldn't find back in the real world.

860
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,060
Ah, the convention.

861
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,360
If I could control time,

862
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,720
I'd be right back on that stage

863
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,020
with Doctors for Wotan.

864
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,900
With our five guitarists and horn section

865
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,420
and three synthesizers and two drummers and

866
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,740
inspired madness.

867
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,480
And my true calling, of course, is the church.

868
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,420
And the church is, let me assure you,

869
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,920
making lots of money now.

870
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,760
I, Reverend Stang, took the money from the convention

871
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,580
and absconded with it.

872
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,440
I went to Bolivia with the convention money.

873
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,860
And the foundation has been pretty much broke ever since.

874
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,440
I've left my post at Sacred Scribe,

875
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,460
and let young John Pretorius take over.

876
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,780
It's tough.

877
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,440
I mean, we literally do burn Sacred Scribes out.

878
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
We burn them out about a year at a time.

879
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,820
And I was about burnt out.

880
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,340
So I've spent all the money.

881
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm back in Dallas.

882
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,820
And I was supposed to be an overman by now,

883
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,640
but that didn't happen.

884
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
Still haven't had my third nostril open.

885
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,660
But they did do some of the surgery.

886
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,600
Philo did a little bit during the last Doctors for Wotan practice session.

887
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,300
Or practice.

888
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,680
We've never practiced.

889
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,220
Doctors for Wotan has never practiced.

890
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,160
We have only recorded albums.

891
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,340
And we have, we've just recorded our 17th album.

892
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,440
This time using the new Japanese cheap synthesizers,

893
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,280
the Casios or Taseos or whatever,

894
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,780
that Allsupgenius is now on,

895
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,180
along with their tape recorders.

896
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,860
Yeah!

897
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,320
Hey.

898
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,560
Okay, where's my...

899
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:29,880
What?

900
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,780
Wow, Doctors for Wotan.

901
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,560
Album number 18.

902
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,120
Yeah, we're glad you could all make it tonight.

903
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,540
Dr. Wotan over there is shooting up.

904
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,300
We're gonna have some Doctor time.

905
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,480
We're gonna be healing and cutting.

906
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,640
We're gonna be hurting and screaming.

907
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,900
We're gonna be a-fropping and a-cutting.

908
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,560
Yeah.

909
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,860
We know the Frop Lord's with us.

910
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,600
Yeah, hey, there's the Frop Lord number 6 down there,

911
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,360
just in from Tibet.

912
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:58,740
Ha!

913
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,140
Yeah, same to you, Frop Lord number 6.

914
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,620
The convention is over.

915
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,640
The peoples are dead.

916
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,720
The conventions are over.

917
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,180
The allegations are done.

918
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:25,420
And could it be your Hall is set?

919
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,720
I think I can.

920
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,500
I think I can.

921
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,160
I think I can.

922
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,100
I think I can.

923
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,640
I think I can.

924
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,280
I think I can.

925
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,520
I think I can.

926
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:34,600
I think I can.

927
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


928
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


929
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


930
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


931
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


932
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


933
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


934
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


935
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


936
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


937
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


938
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


939
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


940
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:34,600


941
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:44,640
I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can.

942
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,720
Hey, I hear a tank delay.

943
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,180
I think I can.

944
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,760
Sandy, you can be anything you want to be when you grow up.

945
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,700
Sandy, you can be a fireman or you can be Spider-Man.

946
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,300
Or you can be a politician.

947
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,720
Or Sandy, you can be a terrorist and hurt people very much.

948
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,300
You can be what you want.

949
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,400
You can be what you want.

950
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,440
You can be what you want.

951
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,240
You can be what you want.

952
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,920
You can be what you want.

953
00:41:44,060 --> 00:42:04,560
You can be what you want.

954
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,080
You can be what you want.

955
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,860
Are you afraid to look at the green

956
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,320
It's like a soapbox.

957
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,320


958
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,320


959
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,500
and Bark, yeah.

960
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,500


961
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,500


962
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,500


963
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,500


964
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,240
Aw, that sounds definitely the most powerful voice Bondadors have ever heard.

965
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,720
yeah, I'm going to win.

966
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,940
Take law into your own hands.

967
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,500
It's fun, fun, fun.

968
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,580
And for a good cause.

969
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,400
Is that paid for by the Church of the Subgenius?

970
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:00,120
We demand that Roman law be replaced by German law.

971
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,560
And they accompanied their promises with music.

972
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,480
Martial music that was appropriate for millions of loose-stepping Germans.

973
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Music that began with a fanfare and thundering drums.

974
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,620
Music that inflamed people with wild patriotic fervor.

975
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,440
Music like this march played by a Nazi stormtrooper band.

976
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,120
Doctor!

977
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:04,680
Doctor!

978
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:04,680


979
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,560
I barely even remember being on stage.

980
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,120
It's all like a dream.

981
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,460
And, uh, I drove home literally in a trance.

982
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,620
From Dallas.

983
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,800
As you can well imagine.

984
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,480
That much input in that short of time.

985
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,860
Probably couldn't be endured

986
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:31,980
Probably couldn't be endured.

987
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,460
Probably couldn't be endured.

988
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,460


989
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,280
by anyone less than an apprentice overman or overwoman,

990
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,320
as the case may be, over hermaphrodite,

991
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,560
of which that species, I'm sure,

992
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,340
were represented by more than a few examples.

993
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,740
I haven't had that much cerebral stimulation since I don't know when.

994
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,420
But Bob was there. Bob was all over the tapes.

995
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,100
You never hear Bob's voice,

996
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,540
yet we can't release the tapes that have Bob speaking

997
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,280
because of the voice print problems.

998
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,340
But the reenactments are on the way,

999
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,860
and Bob, at the convention, Bob did possess the living bodies

1000
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,020
of many great doctors, subgenius doctors,

1001
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,360
Jane of Hypercletes, Sternokekever,

1002
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,720
even myself for a very short time.

1003
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,180
Almost all of us were at different times possessed by Bob,

1004
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,360
and every now and then something we say on those tapes

1005
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,180
is not being said by us, it's being said by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1006
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,500
and believe you me, being the vessel for the voice of Bob

1007
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,400
can wear you out quicker than running a subgenius convention.

1008
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,120
It can wear you out quicker than taking the drugs

1009
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,860
that show up at a subgenius convention,

1010
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,680
which, by the way, I did not do until the convention was over.

1011
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,060
There is nothing like being possessed by Bob.

1012
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,800
It is horrible, and it's wonderful.

1013
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,540
I mean, look at me.

1014
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,540
I've been able to abscond with all the bucks and spend it all

1015
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,220
and come back safe and sound,

1016
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,700
and all the subgeniuses think it's fine.

1017
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,680
Because, yes, I deserve it.

1018
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,040
It's true.

1019
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,560
I deserve all the money that the convention made.

1020
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,300
Well, I can't even go into any detail on that.

1021
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,300
Just such a resounding success.

1022
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,340
So unbelievably financially successful

1023
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,440
that surely, you know, the mark of Bob was just spurting all over it.

1024
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,880
And I believe that it's important

1025
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,360
that there be a subgenius convention in your area.

1026
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,380
In your area.

1027
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,080
All I can say is gut blowout unprecedented.

1028
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,400
That was the absolute...

1029
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,720
greatest...

1030
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:04,920
party that I have ever attended in my entire existence in this life.

1031
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,640
And I can only hope that the next convention will equal it.

1032
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,580
I don't see how it possibly could.

1033
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,780
Just from that point of Doctors for Bob being accepted as well as we were

1034
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,540
blows my mind.

1035
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,920
And we've never had a receptive audience,

1036
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,660
much less an appreciative audience.

1037
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,400
And to see, to actually see...

1038
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,760
The power of Bob kept me on my feet.

1039
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,660
I only committed suicide once during the entire convention.

1040
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,320
Was risen from the grave.

1041
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,080
Oh, God, you should have been there.

1042
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,180
But you will be there.

1043
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,240
You are there on the tape.

1044
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,860
When will we be sued?

1045
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,780
And which city will sue us?

1046
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,780
The answer to these and other questions here probably will never be answered.

1047
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,700
And are we protected by the fact that we're now in the uprising?

1048
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,560
Or are they going to nail us in?

1049
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:57,660


1050
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:57,660


1051
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:57,660


1052
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,180
I'm going to be there anyway for my house.

1053
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,280
My little air-con.

1054
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,080
Hey, hey, this, this Subgenius convention is great!

1055
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,780
Hey, I work for People Magazine!

1056
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,500
I'm going to get you guys in there.

1057
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,580
For sure.

1058
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,960
You'll be big stars!

1059
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,060
And you'll make lots of money!

1060
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,780
Subgenius audience, audience!

1061
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,420
Irritation techniques!

1062
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,880
Total success!

1063
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,540
The Bob Fendi Prize!

1064
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,360
Well, aren't you going to ask us about Elvis?

1065
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,060
Yeah.

1066
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,320
The mega-fifth temple lodge of the Church and Subgenius of Little Rock, Arkansas.

1067
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:49,440
One of the original schisms that was manifested in the first blight of dobsable energy to descend upon central Arkansas.

1068
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,040
Which has been referred to by Bob himself as the savage mind of the country's interior.

1069
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,660
The first temple was burnt down.

1070
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,340
The first temple was burnt to the ground Bob.

1071
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:58,640
Right.

1072
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:07,440
Radical, the R.D. conspiracy, which we'll go into later, threw a firebomb into our first mega-fifth temple lodge, burned it to the ground.

1073
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:20,100
So we aligned ourselves immediately with the first feces temple gog of Dobbs Orthodoxic, and the first whiskey-glorp church, and the first drug abuse church manifested by a chemical engineer, Radon T22.

1074
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,700
So this explains our involvement in the Dallas Clinch.

1075
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:27,660
And the journeys that have taken place.

1076
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:36,640
Across the boundaries of the many states that were eliminated and have brought Texas and California and Arkansas together in an unholy triad.

1077
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:48,980
Can bring about this power that we're talking about to bring us unlimited slack in the form of $100 bills, $1000 bills, and some such, you know, solid gold nine irons.

1078
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:57,460
I'm currently the sacred scribe, just temporarily, of the Church of the Subgenius.

1079
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,420
I'm going to get out of the position as soon as I can, because we burn the sacred scribes out very quickly.

1080
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,040
Sad, isn't it?

1081
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,020
Sad.

1082
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,480
Sad.

1083
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,640
Sad.

1084
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:17,880
Sad.

1085
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:20,600
Sad.

1086
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,240
Sad.

1087
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:21,240


1088
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:21,320
Sad.

1089
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:22,880
Sad.

1090
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,480


1091
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,480


1092
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,480


1093
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:23,640


1094

1122
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,180
Oh, it's the head!

1123
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,080
You're going to burn!

1124
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,920
The bleeding head!

1125
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,200
The Marla Palmer!

1126
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,060
That's what head!

1127
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,900
Now you can launch!

1128
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,560
You can launch your bleeding head at Tramino!

1129
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,260
You can skyrocket your head at Jack Nicklaus!

1130
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,500
You can fling your head at Sonny Fono!

1131
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,860
You can curl your head at Diddy Amin!

1132
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,180
You can launch your head at Ronald Reagan!

1133
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,060
You can launch your head at Arnold Palmer!

1134
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,300
But if you don't launch the head at Arnold Palmer!

1135
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,440
If you don't launch the head at Arnold Palmer!

1136
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,080
You're going to burn!

1137
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,120
As Bob said to L. Ron Hubbard in the letter,

1138
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,300
he said, L. Ron, sure they may be bleeding,

1139
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,780
but their money is green!

1140
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,600
And this is all he knows!

1141
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,880
That the word of Bob comes through,

1142
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,720
even in the time of pain.

1143
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,580
We're not asking for one penny for ourselves.

1144
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,860
If we get dollar bills,

1145
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,440
hell, we'll tear them up!

1146
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,980
But it's the gift of the world!

1147
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,180
You need to hear the word of Bob!

1148
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:12,840
Roman!

1149
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:13,980
Roman!

1150
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,040
Do you scan us on your view screen?

1151
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,420
Yes, Earthman, I see you.

1152
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,640
This means only one thing.

1153
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,300
You have decided to take the easy way out.

1154
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,600
No, Roman.

1155
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,360
We have fought you to a standstill.

1156
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,460
And we will go on doing it as long as necessary.

1157
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,440
If you try to figure out our position,

1158
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,680
you are wasting your time.

1159
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,740
None shall escape me.

1160
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,940
I shall find a way to rid this Earth planet

1161
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,520
of humans.

1162
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,100
No!

1163
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,600
No!

1164
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:47,380


1165
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,660
A human will not give up this Earth of ours.

1166
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,560
But let me ask you something else.

1167
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,860
What do you have to fear from us?

1168
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,420
I want to know!

1169
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,980
I want to know!

1170
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,700
I want to know!

1171
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,960
Mind control on out of control.

1172
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,060
I want to know!

1173
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,480
Tell me about it!

1174
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,500
Well, some people say,

1175
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,460
you can't have two people talking at one time on those tapes.

1176
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,780
That's right, we can't have two.

1177
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,140
Can't have three!

1178
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,260
We've got a habit of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten, ten, alone, no more.

1179
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,300
Can't have three!

1180
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,200
I saw you back there not swimming in my sea

1181
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,720
Bet you you dogs leave everywhere

1182
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,980
The power of Dobbs!

1183
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,700
This microphone is healed!

1184
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,500
Healed by the powers of Dobbs!

1185
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,800
The microphone is healed!

1186
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,520
Is that Dobbs over there?

1187
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,860
It's Lee Dobbs!

1188
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,800
We have reports that Dobbs is here tonight in flesh, ladies and gentlemen!

1189
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Is that Dobbs?

1190
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,320
Is that Dobbs on your foot?

1191
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,160
Is Dobbs right on your foot?

1192
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,260
I got this word, I saw Dobbs!

1193
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:27,960
Is that?

1194
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,940
There's Dobbs, he's over there on the wall!

1195
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,300
It's Dobbs, there's a whole bunch of him back there!

1196
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,640
It's the Dobbs!

1197
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,760
The doctors do not need to know!

1198
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,680
Not to walk on all fours!

1199
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,540
The doctors defy the law!

1200
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,320
The doctors walk on all fours!

1201
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,760
The doctors do not need to know the law!

1202
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,760
Elijah could bring fire down from the sky in the eyes of men!

1203
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:04,360
David's mighty men were shielded from death by the covenant!

1204
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:13,200
Bob, Bob, though some people may maintain that the head is filled with plastic medical tubing

1205
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,760
and pumping fake theater blood,

1206
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,880
and that's just a theory though, that's not true!

1207
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,420
and wagulating, it's not true!

1208
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,440
Other people that might claim that it's the bleeding torso that demands recognition,

1209
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,820
that's not true either!

1210
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,780
Right, and we maintain that it is the head!

1211
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,980
There's a church that deals with the head,

1212
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,860
and it's not bloody but now rotting!

1213
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,400
A rotting pussy head as opposed to a seven!

1214
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,280
Hello!

1215
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,480
Really?

1216
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,140
Hello!

1217
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,540
One of our mottoes, wounded head good, heel head bad!

1218
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,220
Well, you are now listening to...

1219
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,440
Wounded head good, heel head bad!

1220
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,400
...the interview with Palmer Readings,

1221
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,840
Palmer Readings!

1222
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,480
Doug Weldwin, and Sternodon himself, who did most of the talking.

1223
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,600
Is this what it sounds like inside a subgenius's head?

1224
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,620
The big subgenius conference is going to be happening, the convention, the subcon.

1225
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,660
And I wouldn't be able to either if I was, if the convention was in Oakland,

1226
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,500
and I was cutting glass here and starving to death.

1227
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:37,840
I'm cutting glass in Oakland, I'm just starving to death.

1228
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,180
It's cold, it's wet outside.

1229
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,820
I wish I had a little more time to think about it.

1230
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:44,820


1231
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:44,820


1232
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,660
I'd take the money and get on an airplane.

1233
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,540
I'd ride that sucker and I'd ride, ride, ride.

1234
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Ride to Dallas, Texas, the subgenius convention.

1235
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,260
Get together and praise Bob.

1236
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:12,340
Ride to Dallas, Texas, and join all the subgenius's, praise Bob for the job.

1237
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:28,380
I'm cutting glass in Oakland, I'm trying to make a buck.

1238
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:33,420
Hoping if I keep going I'll increase my luck.

1239
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,140
I'm hoping and I'm praying that things get better fast.

1240
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,020
If I don't improve, I don't know if I'm gonna last.

1241
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,800
Oh, I'm cutting glass in Oakland, I'm just starving to death.

1242
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,980
I'm cutting glass in Oakland, hoping for Dallas, Texas.

1243
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,760
Hoping that I get there before the X's.

1244
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,340
Cutting glass in Oakland, trying to make a buck.

1245
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,280
Hoping to improve my luck.

1246
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,340
I'm cutting glass in Oakland, trying to make a buck.

1247
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,380
Well, I won't be there in Dallas, November 22.

1248
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,220
You know I got a lot of things to do.

1249
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,360
Hoping and I'm praying that I'll crawl from this hole.

1250
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,880
Before them dice begin to roll.

1251
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:50,400
Subgenius in Dallas, Texas, on November 22.

1252
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
I won't be there, celebrate with them.

1253
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,460
I hope you are.

1254
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,620
Because this is the hour of slack,

1255
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,360
and it's the Church of the Subgenius,

1256
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,040
and our new official Post Office Box,

1257
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,200
it's the old Cleveland Heights Post Office Box.

1258
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,080
The Texas-Austin office had to move.

1259
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:30,240
So now we're at Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights,

1260
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:33,140
Ohio 44118.
