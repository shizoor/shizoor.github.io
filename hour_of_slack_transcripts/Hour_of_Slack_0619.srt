1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,200
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,920
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,600
The subgenius.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
Hour of sweat.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,320
What?

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,460
Actually, the cattle mutilation, according to Tom Warner,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,040
were done by the same two old guys who did all the crop circles.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,460
The 13,000 crop circles.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,440
Praise the old guys.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,020
They practiced.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,980
Praise the two old British farts.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,820
They practiced in the U.S. on their vacations doing the 20,000 cattle mutilation.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,880
And all they used was a board and a piece of string.

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,320
Back to the full hell of riotous radio picnic.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,580
Back to your tangent mouth, doctor.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,260
They already talked about liquid chicken in the last three hours.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,320
Well, you know, chicken gristle.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,020
Chicken gristle is the...

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,120
The important cornerstone of today's financial markets.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,940
But something more important historically should be discussed.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,300
This is the 23rd of January.

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,900
And, of course, on the 22nd of January,

23
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,980
the Bourbon King Louis XVI was executed in what is now the Place de la Concorde.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,700
And in 1984, on that date, that same date,

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs was assassinated at the Victoria Theatre in San Francisco.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,220
This is the anniversary of these important historical events.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,460
Wasn't it a big news day today?

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,440
Yes.

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,240
Yes, so much news that one's cranium felt tightly congested with it all.

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,100
And now you're operated.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,880
And you have the Pope in Cuba and you have the Unabomber in San Diego.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,540
The Unabomber was at the last game show.

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:54,000
And the Reverend Unabomber will be at the final X-Day celebration, July 5th, 1998.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,660
We're starting to talk about events coming up, friends, on this show.

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:05,860
I'm going to let Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence and Phineas Narco explain the upcoming very large devivals,

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,000
the last devivals in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, and other things.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,300
So, have you got a question for us today?

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,260
Because we've got a big show and a lot of stuff, so don't hold us up.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,220
State short question, please.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,920
Just exactly.

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,260
Government.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,760
State short question.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,080
Government.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,060
We've got...

45
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,240
Don't know.

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,600
Phineas Narco's injecting himself with amphetamines.

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,640
What are these new blue buttons?

48
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,440
Don't touch those.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Those are collar-alert blue buttons.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
You've heard of Star 69.

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,340
Well, this will bring the collar right into your living room.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,540
Don't hit the star sign.

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,580
And especially don't hit the pound sign.

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,380
I do.

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,540
Or you'll pick up an extra pound each time, and the poundage can be stifling.

56
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,720
The poundage can be foreboding.

57
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,260
It can weigh you down.

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,120
Not if you can make it to May 15th.

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,980
Oh, I'll hit somebody.

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,620
Get that pound.

61
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,220
I'll get it.

62
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,180
Hello?

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,460
What's on May 15th?

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:02:59,940
I don't know.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,360
I don't know.

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm on.

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

68
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,880
March 15th.

69
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,220
What's on March 15th?

70
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,640
It's getting...

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,680
It just got a month closer.

72
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,860
What's on March 22nd?

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,460
Two months.

74
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,200
No, no, no.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,960
March 15th.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,740
March 22nd.

77
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,680
Yeah, and it won't be here.

78
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,860
It'll be up in Seattle.

79
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,900
Well, you know, February 5th, there's the Aerial Act run by John Law, and I, Dr. Helen

80
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,420
Dowling, will be there to comment on the proceedings and to bask in the adulation of...

81
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,040
And where is that?

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,120
You should tell everyone.

83
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,640
Well, I would, except I had the little card with all the info on it.

84
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:27,640


85
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,440
But I think I left it in the car, or maybe they used it to roll up a...

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Whoops, I shouldn't have.

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,980
Hey, wait a minute.

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,660
I'm on the radio.

89
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,080
Roll a T-shirt, I think you meant.

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,220
Yes, exactly.

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,840
Just so.

92
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,840
And so...

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,620
Roll some coffee.

94
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,560
Coffee?

95
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,140
Oh, if I only had coffee in a roll.

96
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,740
Oh, just wish you...

97
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,880
A little collar coffee.

98
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,760
Well, yeah.

99
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,660
Which is pretty good.

100
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,620
It goes through the filter here.

101
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,260
Collar coffee is all right.

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,660
And then it turns into the...

103
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,360
It needs to be filtered with all the filth that they...

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,360


105
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:51,600
Oh.

106
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Now, Doug, can we turn it here?

107
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Be completely serious.

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,260
Okay, I'm...

109
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,560
Okay.

110
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
Somebody can be completely serious on the show.

111
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,780
Did you really assassinate Bob Dox?

112
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,700
Yes, I really did assassinate Bob Dox.

113
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,640
And as Hal said...

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,360
How long ago was that?

115
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,100
It was on this evening.

116
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,020
It was in 1984.

117
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,140
It was in...

118
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh, my gosh.

119
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,360
So long ago.

120
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,660
We're so old now.

121
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,760
Not today.

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
This is the morning after that day.

123
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,000
The morning after.

124
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,520
That day was the 22nd of January in 1984.

125
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,700
At the Victoria Theater, right across from now the lab.

126
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,340
That was 13 years ago, and the prophecy was that 13 years from the death of the E-pop,

127
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,640
the E-pop...

128
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,140
30Xs would arrive, as foretold.

129
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,340
Only now...

130
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,900
So where will you be on X Day, Connor?

131
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,960
I don't know yet.

132
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,700
July...

133
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,480
You don't know yet?

134
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,980
Time is coming up fast here.

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,620
It sure is, and you'll be making any points after that.

136
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,140
You always make anything...

137
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,720
Nice kid back in 1998 at 7 o'clock AM.

138
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,040
Well, I'm going to be outside.

139
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:43,920
I think you know...

140
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,860
Outside, well it's a good idea.

141
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,920
Might as well be outside.

142
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah.

143
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,840
Can't hide by going inside.

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,140
Avoid shards of flying glass and...

145
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,540
Can't hide?

146
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,880
...giant timbers blowing past.

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,240
asymptotic recording

148
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,340
So much...

149
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,600
You might as well get in the bed and pull the covers up right over your head.

150
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,520
That's a good idea, too.

151
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:55,720
Well, they're not powerful.

152
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,420
your bed will go with you to the pleasure saucer and you'll be ready. You might enjoy having a bed

153
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,220
there because it's hard and the metallic adamantine metal from far away that those saucers are made of.

154
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,300
We're not kidding either. Yeah. We've been having great arguments actually. It's a lot like

155
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,640
some of the other religions where all of the church fathers have been getting together lately,

156
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,300
Hal, myself, Philo, Ivan Stang, everybody, arguing about just what will happen. Will it just be a

157
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,540
world in which only the subgeniuses disappear, giving more jobs to other people? Oh, but the

158
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,120
subgeniuses are the ones who go on to the better world. Of course, but I mean this mortal

159
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,980
shuffled coil that's been shuffled so many times, I think would be turned into black dark ash.

160
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm sorry. Well, you know, with that you have the same problem as in the Christian

161
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,960
revelation because even though there's supposed to be this total destruction,

162
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,300
afterwards there's a thousand years of peace. Now that means there has to be something left

163
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,400
unless it's the peace of pure oblivion. And I can see that. I can see all the pinks and

164
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,340
normals sinking back into peace after all the sub-gum-demeys are gone. They'll be bang like sheep

165
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,840
lining up for the slaughter. As we subgeniuses, oh yes, don't say nay because they are going to,

166
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,100
they're going to move into special pens. Is this your room? Even though they make

167
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,020
themselves, there's some hope. All these guys are moving equipment into my room here.

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,760
It's all the food from the last three hours is all being moved into my room.

169
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm going to throw it around too and then show Hal the tape.

170
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah, well, we have to go over those tapes in special session.

171
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,820
So there won't be a show after X-Day?

172
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,020
No, there won't be a show after X-Day because both of us will be gone off to the...

173
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,000
We are talking about, there's a practice for this happening in Seattle in March.

174
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,980
Seattle? Is that an athletic study?

175
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,780
Well, there's another different Portland aspect of it too.

176
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,880
Actually, we'll be looking at Portland on Saturday.

177
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,640
That'll be March the 14th.

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,160
That's Saturday, March the 14th in Portland.

179
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,520
And we will be looking at Sunday, March the 15th.

180
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,600
We wanted to secure a date for...

181
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,320
This is in Seattle, Washington.

182
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,540
You mean you can't secure a date, you poor fellow.

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,900
Well, we looked at Friday the 13th, but we thought we'd give a revival, a proper day of Sunday.

184
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,780
Good idea.

185
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,460
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

186
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,460
We'll be there.

187
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,600
Sunday, Dr. Hal.

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,200
We will.

189
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,660
Phineas Narco will be involved.

190
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,560
Phineas Narco?

191
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,740
Reverend Ivan Stang.

192
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,180
Okay.

193
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,780
He's a real...

194
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,280
Sternodocs.

195
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,380
Sternodocs will be there.

196
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,920
Oh, I will.

197
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,840
I think Tyler may have to return to that.

198
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,460
Three of the...

199
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,180
Jayner will be there?

200
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,560
Three of the original Doctors for Bob will be performing.

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, Doctors for Bob.

202
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
We have to get Jayner to come in.

203
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,380
Only traditionally, you must make Jayner travel by bus to Seattle.

204
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,120
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,700
We were thinking of packing him under the bus.

206
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,580
In the Greyhound area.

207
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,820
An interesting bus.

208
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,860
He has to sleep on the bare floor of somebody's hallway for the whole week.

209
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,060
Actually, he has his own secret lab deep within the confines of a Greyhound bus.

210
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,940
We have to make him sleep in somebody's kitchen.

211
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,640
In the morning, when they come to throw the wet coffee grounds into the wastebasket, they hit his head.

212
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,100
And Grey is Bob, it's not my kitchen.

213
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,620
He will leave unidentified spoo in the shower.

214
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,120
Yeah, well, not get into that, which is actually true, and therefore liable us to mention that.

215
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,260
Yeah, no, it's true, though, and it's been saved by people who own that shower, and it's been put into a sealed bag, and we should auction it off.

216
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,240
We're going to do a kind of Jurassic Park kind of thing in...

217
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,380
Oh, darn.

218
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,820
Grey's future generation.

219
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,500
Well, come out of my output.

220
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,360
You're not plugged in here.

221
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,080
Future generation.

222
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,780
Look, there's so many things going on.

223
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,580
This life of radio gods stuff is neat.

224
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:42,880
Some of the genetic samples represented by the Janer spoo, and the Janer spoo contains the complete DNA sequence, which will allow us to recreate an entire new generation.

225
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,840
Oh, my God, quick.

226
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,720
We've got to figure out a way to kill this stuff.

227
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,880
Well, uh...

228
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,340
You're saying this on the first episode, don't you?

229
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,960
I know, I know.

230
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,420
See, the more Hal says, the more it becomes true.

231
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,260
It's the hundred-headed Hydra.

232
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,240
Up off one beetle head, two beetle heads grows, and then...

233
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,480
Too many heads!

234
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,780
There are so many heads in here, I'm going to have to stop.

235
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,460
I'm going to disconnect temporarily and just see if I can get to the bottom of this.

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,520
Eight heads is a pair.

237
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,220
Okay.

238
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,300
Is everything all right?

239
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,100
There's only...

240
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,720
Let's talk about the pair.

241
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,600
We might have to...

242
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, we could...

243
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,680
No, no.

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,580
You know what happens?

245
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,420
The not recording...

246
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,220
That's a very subgenius rule.

247
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,240
Last week, we had...

248
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,260
We had Reverend Kirk Steiner on here.

249
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,960
What were you saying?

250
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
An amazing rant.

251
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,940
Half-hour rant he had.

252
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,700
It was not recorded.

253
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,760
Reverend Kirk Steiner.

254
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,800
Which Ivan Stang pointed out to me at a Doc's Doc in 1981.

255
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,280
He said that it was his experience that the best stuff never gets recorded.

256
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,880
The best stuff never gets recorded.

257
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,420
And I had to admit, last weekend that happened.

258
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,700
Hey, this could be a really good show if we didn't record it.

259
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,420
You know, speaking of recording, at the pre-X Day drill,

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,280
I know that Popus Lilith Von Frumensch in Seattle, Washington,

261
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,340
did record the entire event and has put together a six-tape compilation.

262
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,580
Oh, I'd like to see that.

263
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,640
That you can order.

264
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,020
It's a six-tape compilation.

265
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,680
What I'm going to do over the air, right?

266
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,040
Right now, and this is the Reverend Otis F. Otter from the Mobile Outreach Ministry.

267
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm going to give you that address where you can order all these tapes.

268
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,360
All right, folks, get ready to take it down.

269
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,860
Get ready and get your pen and paper ready.

270
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,000
Get your winky-dink crayon.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,700
And winky-dink.

272
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,500
Tiddly-winks.

273
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,780
And you're going to draw this address on the TV now.

274
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes, you are.

275
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,640
And here is the address for you people out there.

276
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,060
Help little winky escape from the pirates.

277
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:24,280
This is at Fool's Press, 1122 East Pike Street, number 769, Seattle, Washington, 98122.

278
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,220
That's Fool's Press, 1122 East Pike, number 769, Seattle, Washington, 98122.

279
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,220
And what you need to do is write to the popess and ask her for copies of these tapes.

280
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,020
Just take a deep sniff of that healthy mountain air.

281
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,240
Everybody's looking for a pair of dentures that got knocked onto the floor.

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,460
I'm sure they're all right.

283
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,540
We wouldn't step on them.

284
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,480
Not knowingly.

285
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:54,940
At any rate.

286
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,780
It just requires a brisk scouring with some steel wool to get those carpet fibers out from between the incisors.

287
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,860
Well, we seem to have driven out our compatriots completely.

288
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,140
It's a rather touching situation.

289
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,320
Ooh.

290
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,120
Ooh la la.

291
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,660
Dr. Howell getting touched.

292
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,140
Mmm.

293
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,720
It's a beautiful thing.

294
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
But, but, but.

295
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,180
Oh, oh, oh.

296
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
You've got to hear this.

297
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,300
You've got to hear this.

298
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,340
I mean, Bob is prominent all over the earth.

299
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,140
And what you're doing is exactly what Bob would want you to do.

300
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,720
You have the name of Bob and you're ministering in his name and you're helping people.

301
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,560
That's the subgenius helping out right now.

302
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,500
No, no, no, no, no.

303
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,140
I'm ministering in the name of Jesus Christ.

304
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,700
Yeah, but you don't know.

305
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,640
You're covering it up as Jesus Christ.

306
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,400
But really, subconsciously, you haven't been awakened to this subgenius level yet.

307
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,780
You don't know it, but you really are ministering in the name of the subgenius.

308
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,240
You know, I'll bet.

309
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,560
If you and the people of the Partridge family temple ever got together along with the Electric Hellfire Club,

310
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,940
you people could eat cotton candy and hostess Twinkies all day long and really party down.

311
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,360
Well, yeah, that sounds fun.

312
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,160
Not.

313
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
Retardation is an airborne mental virus.

314
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,800
It travels from the infected brain out of the flesh and into the receptors of the unsuspecting victim.

315
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
Retardation is more dangerous.

316
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,260
Than any other virus known to man for several reasons.

317
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:36,520
One, it has quantum properties and can therefore be transmitted through devices such as television, radio, and even through our precious computers.

318
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,220
Two, the retardation virus is seductive and will use everything in its arsenal to infect you.

319
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,040
Money, power, sex, drugs, love, while not exclusively the property of the disease,

320
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,320
are often used as bait by the retardation virus to lure you into itself.

321
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,320
The retardation virus is a

322
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,140
The retardation virus has created the world's biggest evil, a program known as organization.

323
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:11,540
These are traps laid by groups of retardation viruses in order to recruit fresh brains and incorporate them, much like the Borg, into their collective.

324
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:23,320
The virus uses a basic pyramid scheme ripped off from the ancient Egyptians and refused to accept criticism of their retardation from anyone below them in the Matrix, as to preserve prior accomplishments and to inhibit the destruction of the human race.

325
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


326
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


327
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


328
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


329
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


330
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,320


331
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,860
Et cetera.

332
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,100
the program, by those who are wise to its process.

333
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,240
From STEVILLE, the Center for Advanced Research, this explains everything.

334
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,820
Then you can hear all the

335
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,580
Yeah, well, you know at least here on our station we are not censored and we are completely free if we want even to use such words as

336
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,100
Or even

337
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,820
Well, I'm not sure that you can say

338
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,360
But what we usually say we get around that we have a softer way

339
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,080
just don't say

340
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,700
Yes exactly just like that so

341
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,180
uh without refuge from the specter of censorship they're also evil spirit that uh more of a little

342
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,800
speaking dance dishrag over the proceedings oh how horrible look at it yes they may not

343
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,880
have ectoplasm you can see right through it oh yes here's a speaking device ah yes the things

344
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,420
ow oh that one really jeremy jimmy jones don't worry about it

345
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,740
you should be worshiping jesus instead of performing this evil pagan ritual

346
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,680

362
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,040
well of course we are it's july 5th 1998. where are we

363

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,600
i don't know if i can get that day off together facing the terrors of nature

366
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:53,900
those early brothers understand why people don't want to run quicker to progress of course after

367
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,120
x-day the bobbies not the bobbies but the pinks will just keep keep going to their jobs even

though their jobs are nothing burnt out husks well you see examples of this even today isn't

369
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,180
it awful when you read the story about some schmuck who suddenly inherited a billion dollars

370
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,980
but he decides to keep going to work

371
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,160
but he decides to keep going to work

372
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,160


373
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,180
just to collect his paycheck and hang around with his fellow workers

374
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,480
they wouldn't know what else to do and all those checks get put in the drawer where i can't get them

375
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:27,400
and uh it's a terrible thing no it's not a dream i wish to high heaven it were a dream

376
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,680
but it's real all too real you'll have to lock him up again

377
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,060

405
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:10,040
wreck to be in with the ice cold lemonade and vacuum cleaners burning man is a great place to live

406
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,000
Man, it's sold out, man.

407
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,380
Man, yeah.

408
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,480
Burning things suck!

409
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,000
Just like that subgenius church.

410
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
All those churches sell out.

411
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,440
Now, now, let's keep these sentiments to ourselves.

412
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,440
They used to be cool, man.

413
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,580
And then they raised their price from $10 to $20 to $30 for membership.

414
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,620
I can't even afford that.

415
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,740
Well, if you were one of the elite archons, you needn't pay a penny.

416
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,060
Indeed, they pay you.

417
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,480
There goes Hal's sedan chair off at high speed.

418
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,660
Watch how I can open this baby up.

419
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,140
I'll make these fellows run for their money.

420
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,700
Hey, go, bobbies, go!

421
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,340
That's one of the best parts about being a subgenius lower archie is the eight bobby sedan chairs we have.

422
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,460
These little starveling, sniffling bobbies need someone to feed them up.

423
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,020
I'd get to wear all these clothes that have feathers on them.

424
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,720
Yes, and buttons.

425
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,800
And my youthful hose, well saved, is stocking.

426
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,860
Boy, you know, that'll be quite a gathering of the old clan there.

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
But what are these blue buttons?

428
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,780
Not since 1984.

429
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,780
Knocking at your door.

430
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Oh, there it is now.

431
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:28,080
And now, ladies and gentlemen, tonight's hymn from one of the truly great preachers of all time, Mr. Johnny Cash.

432
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,120
Mr. Johnny Cash.

433
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,800
Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.

434
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,700
I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at.

435
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,660
Got the number 13 tattooed on my neck.

436
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,420
When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red.

437
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,480
I was born in the soul of misery.

438
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,500
Never had me a name.

439
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,080
They just gave me the number when I was young.

440
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,900
Got a long line of heartache.

441
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,620
I carry it well.

442
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,120
The list of the things I've done.

443
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,120


444
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:54,020
lives I've broken reach from here to hell. Bad luck wind been blowing at my back. I pray

445
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:06,280
you don't look at me. I pray I don't look back. I was born in the soul of misery. Never

446
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:20,160
had me a name. They just gave me the number when I was young. I was born in the soul of

447
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:36,000
misery. Never had me a name. They just gave me the number when I was young. They just

448
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,260
gave me the number when I was young.

449
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,840
Gave me the number when I was young

450
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh, we all done it there, friends.

451
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,000
I know you.

452
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,800
I've seen you.

453
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,980
I've been bird-logging that stuff.

454
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,380
I know about that stuff.

455
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,600
And your mother, all I wanted was a lousy drink of water.

456
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,980
I wasn't asking for that wallet.

457
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,040
I said water.

458
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,820
A lousy drink of water.

459
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,560
Sorry, Dave.

460
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,740
It was just a misunderstanding.

461
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,760
Well, friends, I want to tell you who done it.

462
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,000
Who has been doing what you've been listening to?

463
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,460
Oh, where's my back?

464
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,120
Background music tape.

465
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,680
There's DK Jones in the background.

466
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:48,120
And a whole bunch of KPFA subgenius show.

467
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,220
The show, actually, more than an hour, less than a show.

468
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,040
A very recent one from this year, January 23rd.

469
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,200
In fact, with Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Phineas Narco,

470
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,020
and Reverend Otis Otter as a guest.

471
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,140
We.

472
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,420
We've.

473
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:13,120
With bits and pieces dropped, dribbled and drabbled in from Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

474
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,800
There'll be quite a bit more of that coming up with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith

475
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,640
and Princess We Are Doe that night from WCSB in Cleveland.

476
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,140
A Johnny Cash song there was actually taken from Reverend Ed Strange's Prozac Free Radio.

477
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,540
What?

478
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,980
Yes, that did it.

479
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,880
It's all right when I hear the music.

480
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,640
Since you're undoubtedly going to hear the music,

481
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,060
I doubt if you're going to be all right.

482
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,160
Uh, yeah.

483
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,180
Cool.

484
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,660
You can't run from your own bunghole.

485
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,680
Um, the Swingin' Love Corpses from the Chicago Subcon in 1992.

486
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,480
Live recording, doing their classic downbeat riffs in a minor key.

487
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,840
We've got coming up, Melba comes alive.

488
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,180
Some telephone sociological experimentation done by,

489
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,700
uh, Brother Russell from, uh, his CD Melba Comes Alive.

490
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,960
Um, we heard a little bit of, uh, Bob Larson and we'll hear more.

491
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,260
Oh my gosh, the phone's ringing.

492
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:15,980
Hold on just a second.

493
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,380
Huh?

494
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,600
What?

495
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:16,840
What?

496
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,420
What?

497
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:17,980
What?

498
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,440
What?

499
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:18,900


500
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,320
What?

501
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,080
What?

502
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,100
What?

503
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,100


504
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,160
What?

505
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,160


506
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,160


507
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,160


508
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,160


509
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,160


510
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,180
What?

511
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


512
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


513
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


514
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


515
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


516
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


517
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


518
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


519
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


520
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


521
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


522
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


523
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


524
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


525
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


526
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


527
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


528
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:20,500


529
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,120
Um, I didn't do anything bad after that phone call came in.

530
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,760
Um, okay, what else?

531
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,260
What other, um, I guess that's it, friends.

532
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,060
I guess that's, uh, it's, this is, uh, an all other subgenius show, show.

533
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,640
Oh, on side two of show, we'll hear quite a bit of the, uh, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

534
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,800
show from WREK with, uh, a real good rant about the luck plane by Dr. P. Ellis and,

535
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,800
um, uh, some, some more wonderful speculation about X Day.

536
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,700
It's so exciting, you know, as to the time I, at this speaking, I think it's about 130

537
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,940
some odd days, uh, till X Day.

538
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:13,880
I, I haven't, uh, it, oh man, man, it's, it, it's kind of scary in a way, you know, it's

539
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,540
gonna be a big change, a big change.

540
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,540
Are we gonna be able to handle the pleasure, we the subgeniuses, are we gonna, and you

541
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,920
know, we have to practice.

542
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,660
That's why we have the X Day.

543
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:24,780
Dr. P. Ellis.

544
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,220
Dr. P. Ellis.

545
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,220


546
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,540
Dr. P. Ellis.

547
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:25,540


548
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,780
That's why we have the divivals.

549
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:26,960
Dr. P. Ellis.

550
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,380
That's why we have the parties, friends.

551
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,380
It's practice because otherwise, the escape vessels, the purity of the pleasure could

552
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,500
be so overwhelming as to drive a, a person mad.

553
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,260
You know, there were sultans who were driven mad by pleasure.

554
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,740
And, uh, friends, it's a, you know, you wanna be able to appreciate the most intense pleasure

555
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,780
in the universe, so you have to kind of prepare your, toughen your mind up for it, you know

556
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,100
what I mean?

557
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,940
by pleasure right now here on Earth.

558
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,120
You know, what if an asteroid

559
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,820
crashed on your city tomorrow?

560
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,100
What if the world for you ended tomorrow?

561
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,340
Are you ready?

562
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,860
Think about that, friend.

563
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,340

Box number again.

the coming end times.

570
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,520
Survive?

571
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,000
Hell, how to?

572
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Eternal Salvation or triple your money back.

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,080
beautiful

587
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,420
beautiful

588

DJ Jones music for a while

589
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,320
as he takes us out to eat.

590
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,580
Mm-hmm.

612
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,480
I thought you were going to pack it with old lesbians.

613
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,100
That's another old idea from S.K.

614
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,460
With them rotating warp drives.

615
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,240
That's also another rotating idea that keeps on recurring.

616
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,680
That's an amazing ship you'd have there.

617
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,520
You'd be the envy.

618
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Every girl in the galaxy would want to fly in your ship.

619
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,680
That's for sure.

620
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,660
Well, wasn't that a sexual illusion back in the medieval times?

621
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,160
The little old man in the spaceship.

622
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,820
Yeah.

623
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,760
And if you can get a Farfisa console for it.

624
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,760
And if you can get close enough to that in the Middle Ages.

625
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,540
They're not that good, but they're nostalgic as hell.

626
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,520
So, you know.

627
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,960
So, what else?

628
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,800
The spaceships are everything else.

629
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,820
Especially what you just said.

630
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,180
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,400
I just glanced down there and lay one eye at the floor.

632
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,660
I'm sorry I didn't pick up the pen.

633
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,720
I'm going to go back and sit down with Donovan for a while.

634
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,280
We're about to start messing with your minds.

635
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,740
Pay us no attention.

636
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,520
We're about to start.

637
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,160
And just listen to what we're feeding into your hand.

638
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,420
Ah, that's so much better.

639
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,500
Hello, patients.

640
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,700
This is Dr. Ellis.

641
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,540
Occasionally, the body or brain or whichever will build an immunity to the pills that facilitate our lives.

642
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,800
I can only assume that this is...

643
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:55,060
This is exactly what has come to pass by the inordinate amount of whining and moaning that have been hampering experimentation lately.

644
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,620
I must emphasize the importance...

645
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:57,960
Blah, blah.

646
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,120
Cultural ebb and flow.

647
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,920
Yada, yada.

648
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,360
Okay, this is something legal put in.

649
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,260
All right.

650
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,780
Well, let me tell you something.

651
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,740
Kids, you know make worky.

652
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,180
You know get slacky.

653
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,620
Clear?

654
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,160
Six, eight, four, three.

655
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,700
Maybe if we stop tweaking those voices, they might persuade you to come back to the fold, huh?

656
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,020
Group two.

657
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,060
Group two.

658
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,240
We sent the insects away, and we can bring the insects back.

659
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,840
And they've been gone all this time.

660
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,260
They must be...

661
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,700
Ravenous.

662
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,080
How would any of you like it, huh?

663
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,240
I see you on the screens.

664
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,200
I see you all.

665
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,240
You saunter so smugly up to the dispensing station and pass your token to the chimp.

666
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:45,380
I see some of you giggling like little girls when your self-actualized cousin slides your daily dose back through.

667
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,500
Well, I'll cut you off.

668
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,840
All of you.

669
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,420
There'll be no sleeping.

670
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,000
There'll be no going to the bathroom.

671
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,180
There'll be no laughing.

672
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,200
And there'll be no asking questions.

673
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,320
Don't make me scrap this operation.

674
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,240
I don't want to, but I'll turn this program around right now.

675
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,140
Some fricasseed hobos in the ashes of a condemned warehouse.

676
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,260
Sound familiar?

677
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:16,120
A few zombies wander onto a few Greyhound buses and die in the night between Tyler and Killeen.

678
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,880
Are you getting the idea?

679
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,040
I'm not.

680
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,820
I mean, uh...

681
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,440
Well, anyway...

682
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,740
I guess I can tide you over, okay?

683
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,740
All right, let's see here.

684
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
Five-Forty-Eight wants to know...

685
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,560
Why do the Thing always bad?

686
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,480
And then it meanders off on some daisy talk.

687
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,340
All right, Five-Forty-Eight.

688
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,420
I'm a doctor, so I think I can make some sense out of your gibberish.

689
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,820
Uh, counterbalancing the luck plane.

690
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,700
That's what you want to know.

691
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,500
All right.

692
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:42,960
All right.

693
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,780
The fabric sags, and you're knee deep in your own soil.

694
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,620
Well...

695
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,240
Well, the first thing you need to do is locate the fulcrum of the immediate luck plane.

696
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,660
Simple machines, we've been over this.

697
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,940
Alright, examples. Okay, okay.

698
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,420
I know you guys don't get out much, but, well, frankly, I can't relate to you showdins.

699
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,140
Okay, example.

700
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,560
I'm in the car, late for something, and catching every red light.

701
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,000
Alright, we need counterbalance.

702
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,780
What I'll do is I'll throw my miniature nicotine delivery systems into the back seat.

703
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,840
Okay, now I can't reach them unless I hit a red light.

704
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,300
Well, that doesn't do it. I'm still hitting red lights.

705
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,240
Okay, pitch the tape you're listening to.

706
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,840
Chuck your portafropper back there.

707
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,120
Sunglasses, your works.

708
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,040
Keep in mind that the stuff in the back seat is not the fulcrum.

709
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,380
It is the counterbalance.

710
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,360
The fulcrum is your desire for the stuff in the back seat.

711
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,700
The lever, of course, is always present.

712
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,540
Eventually, depending on the inclination of your tilt,

713
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,240
all the crap you need in the back seat will tilt the plane

714
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,720
and ensure that you do not hit any red lights

715
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,820
to give you an opportunity to grab your stuff.

716
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,760
I must stress that you must leave the counterbalance in place.

717
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,340
In other words, don't grab the stuff back if you do happen to hit a red light.

718
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,680
Unless, of course, you now need the stuff in the back seat

719
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,280
more than you need to get where you're going.

720
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,380
In which case, well, you're out of luck.

721
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,380
Alright, now that better hold you.

722
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,280
We'll work on switching out the pills, but until then, shut up!

723
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,740
We'd like to welcome our listening audience tonight.

724
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,460
Listen to Bob Sighton Funhouse,

725
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,060
the local Atlanta subgenius radio ministry hour.

726
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,660
Welcome our cohorts tonight.

727
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,360
Reverend Dr. P. Ellis, Reverend Dr. Bugletter,

728
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,320
and the other people we have.

729
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,320
Please introduce yourself.

730
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,280
Tell us who we have tonight.

731
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,540
Hi, I'm the doctor's patient, Ted Mann,

732
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,280
and I'm still incapacitated and all.

733
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,080
Why do you have rotator room by the remote?

734
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,440
Nobody finds this anywhere.

735
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,020
Hey, what can you say, you know?

736
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,680
You're cool like that.

737
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,500
And we have Dr. Frank Quintley in the house.

738
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,480
I think I see him over there.

739
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,560
Hello, Frank, would you like to say something?

740
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,040
No, that's okay.

741
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,400
Thank you very much.

742
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:51,920
Thank you very much.

743
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,800
Doing research in the corner.

744
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,080
Agents active.

745
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,660
All recall civilization death.

746
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,240
From you, partner.

747
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,800
It's the River of Unfinished Time.

748
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,240
Please, shut up.

749
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,040
My son's family and I went to Disney World in Orlando two years ago.

750
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,520
Yeah.

751
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,740
And we didn't realize it, but the day that we went down there,

752
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,280
I found out later.

753
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,740
They call it gay day.

754
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,300
Oh, no.

755
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,860
Oh, no.

756
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,320
Oh, no.

757
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,640
Encourage the homosexuals.

758
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,600
You were there, Melba?

759
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,920
I was there on that day, and it was the worst experience of my life.

760
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,120
Can you tell me what you saw?

761
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,500
I mean, some of this you probably can't describe on a family show.

762
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
Well, that's true.

763
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,000
We saw several things that just were shocking.

764
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:41,780
But the worst part of it was, besides just, you know,

765
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:47,400
it was like these people would kiss openly, you know, and embrace.

766
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,540
But if we gave them a funny look, they would say rude things to us.

767
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,240
So when they were kissing, they're the ones doing the weird things.

768
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:57,700
Right.

769
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,660
But if you look at them funny, then they get mad at you.

770
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,620
Oh, yes.

771
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,060
They were very hateful.

772
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,020
And the worst part of it was, I have a nephew who is a teenager.

773
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,020
He went off and rode the rides and things.

774
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,520
He rode the rides and things by himself all day long.

775
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:13,820
Yeah.

776
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,140
When we met him back there at the pavilion and we all got back together,

777
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,180
he had a little friend with him, a boy a year or two older.

778
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,160
And this young boy, he said, I met a new friend here.

779
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,720
And this boy was very, you know, effeminate.

780
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,260
And he had like a pastel-colored triangle button on his...

781
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, that's the story.

782
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,100
That's the gay rights symbol.

783
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,920
Well...

784
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,780
Melba, how old was this child?

785
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,660
18.

786
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,160
So this other boy was gay.

787
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,120
At 18, he was already homosexual and proud of it.

788
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
We found that out later, Bob, see.

789
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,880
And the horrible thing was that we...

790
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,820
Apparently, his daddy works for the Disney company.

791
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,080
Oh, my goodness.

792
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:10,180
We felt like Disney people were sending their kids to try to recruit.

793
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,500
Right.

794
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:10,980
Right.

795
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


796
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


797
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


798
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


799
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


800
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


801
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


802
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


803
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


804
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


805
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


806
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


807
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


808
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


809
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


810
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:10,980


811
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,600
And the boy was gay.

812
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,360
And it was a little...

813
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:13,860
I don't know.

814
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,200
I don't know.

815
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


816
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


817
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


818
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


819
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


820
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


821
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,200


822
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,000
Because they were on...

823
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,600
They kept riding the same ride over and over.

824
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,600
Uh-oh.

825
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,360
It's a small world ride.

826
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

827
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,940
So that kid was after your son.

828
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,460
I mean, that gay boy was after your son.

829
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,620
I think so.

830
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,000
And ever since...

831
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,500
Now, Stefan doesn't see him.

832
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,720
But I understand that they ride back and forth.

833
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:34,940
Uh-oh.

834
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,840
Because this boy lives in California.

835
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:38,580
And...

836
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,100
Melba, you got to put a stop to that somehow.

837
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,720
Oh, Stefan.

838
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,020
He often uses, and I won't say anything nasty, you know,

839
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:51,200
but he keeps referring to weird expressions like bonus eggs and felching and things,

840
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,380
and we don't know what he means.

841
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,860
Well, you don't want to know, and I don't want to tell you.

842
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:02,320
And that boy that he was with, I'm telling you, his voice was higher than yours is, Bob.

843
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,980
He was such a sissy.

844
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,340
Oh, it was horrible.

845
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,680
Yeah, and he had the little pink triangle on.

846
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:08,960
Yeah.

847
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,840
Okay, I'll tell you what, Melba, I want to do right now.

848
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,700
All right.

849
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:21,400
Your child has come under the influence of the evil spirits of seducing homosexuality

850
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,180
that were surrounding this other young lad.

851
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:24,740
Yes.

852
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,380
And I want to pray with you right now.

853
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,860
Oh, please do, Bob.

854
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,720
In the name of Jesus to break that hold.

855
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,580
Okay, Melba?

856
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,140
In the name of Jesus.

857
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,020
All right, now, Melba.

858
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,680
I believe it.

859
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,320
I want you to say, I'm Melba.

860
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,940
I'm Melba.

861
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,840
I, Melba.

862
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,860
As the mother.

863
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,340
As the mother.

864
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,320
Of my child.

865
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,320
Of my child.

866
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,380
Have the authority.

867
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,220
Have the authority.

868
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,160
According to the word of God.

869
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,480
According to the word of God.

870
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,440
Over my child.

871
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,040
Over my child.

872
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,340
God gives me authority.

873
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,340
God gives me authority.

874
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,700
Over my child.

875
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,100
Over my child.

876
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,220
And I also.

877
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,860
And I also.

878
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:06,740
Have authority.

879
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,100
Have authority.

880
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:08,880
Have authority.

881
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,080
any demon in hell.

882
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,300
Over any demon in hell.

883
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,720
That tries to steal my child.

884
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,620
That tries to steal my

885
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,140
child. Lord Jesus.

886
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,760
Lord Jesus. I raised my son right.

887
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,580
I raised my son right.

888
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,720
I raised him to be a man. I raised

889
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,560
him to be a man. Not a homosexual.

890
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,780
Not a homosexual. And I'm

891
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,760
not going to allow. I'm

892
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,640
not going to allow. The devil.

893
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,820
The devil. To steal my son.

894
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,460
To steal my son.

895
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,600
In the name of Jesus. And the

896
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,880
the name of Jesus. Spirits of perversion. Spirits of perversion. Take your hands. Take your hands.

897
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:54,720
Off my son. Off my son. Now. Go. Go. You go. Go. You go. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus.

898
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:02,400
Set my son free. Set him free. In Jesus' name. Oh, thank you, Jesus. In Jesus' name.

899
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:16,300
Oh, you're getting a little blessed and happy there, Melba. Okay, now. Melba? Melba?

900
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:25,420
Give me the four bar religion. Add it to the other three.

901
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,460
Give me the four bar religion.

902
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,380
Give me the four bar religion.

903
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,860
Give me the four bar religion.

904
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,320
Give me the four bar religion.

905
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,560
Add it to the other three.

906
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:45,400
Well, it's good to learn some reading and arithmetic and writing, but you gotta have

907
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,360
our religion. Add it to the other three.

908
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,020
You know what? I've just, I've prayed long and hard about this, and I've come to the

909
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:02,180
point where I don't want to go to public schools. I really do think that God's judgment,

910
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,560
you know, is on our nation, and those public schools being run, you know, by the government,

911
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,500
more or less, God's judgment is on those schools.

912
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:16,540
When the teachers can't teach, and the kids get profanity and drugs and no God and paganism

913
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:23,240
and the teachers living in sin and the profanity and all of this, you know, what's wrong with

914
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:29,000
this picture, you know? Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 2 tells, God says, learn not the

915
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,880
way of the heathen. Learn not the way of the heathen.

916
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,260
Is that what we're not doing when we send them to the schools? And I think right now,

917
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:42,640
and I appreciate your empathy and your reasoning here, Robert, we ought to pray for Yvonne

918
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,720
Gonzalez. We ought to pray for that schoolboy. We ought to pray for the NAACP. We ought to

919
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,840
pray for Dallas and say, hey, God, please lend a hand to this because we are lost in

920
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,020
a fog on this thing, man.

921
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,240
Absolutely. And, you know, you were talking about the issue of trying to witness. I believe

922
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,680
someone called earlier, talked about trying to...

923
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,220
Yeah.

924
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,540
...share a pro-life message with some of these young people.

925
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah. Yeah.

926
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,880
Now, things have just...just in the last 10 years, things have just changed. Even up to

927
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,340
the mid-'80s, you know, I was able to go to the public schools and share with some of

928
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,780
the young people at high school, junior high.

929
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,300
Uh-huh.

930
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:24,220
And, you know, I try to do it now. They're trying to say that, you know, trying to drum

931
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,520
up a bunch of business that...saying I'm just talking to the teenage girls for some kind

932
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,720
of ulterior motive and things like that. But just...

933
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:31,980
Yeah.

934
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,560
...it's just utterly ridiculous, you know. But you're out there trying to share the message

935
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,440
with all the young people. And they just, you know, just because of one or two things

936
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,100
that might have happened or, you know, relationships that might develop, you know, out of that,

937
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,100
they want to make that into a big thing, you know. But, you know, most of the women in

938
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:57,560
the Bible, my goodness, were 12, 13, 14 years old when they married. I say if there's grass

939
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,200
on the field, go ahead and play ball.

940
00:49:59,420 --> 00:49:59,640
Yeah.

941
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,840
And, you know, that's always been what I say.

942
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:06,340
Robert, I'll tell you something. Let me tell you what my take is here. If in 20 to

943
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:12,320
30 years, we're going to look back at today in America and say we have lost our mind.

944
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,640
We've gone to madness, to the killing of infants, the genocide, the infanticide.

945
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,140
I read about, I read about a fallen pilot swearing death.

946
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,180
And no one's there.

947
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,100
And no one's there, nobody there.

948
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,080
They stole their tail, their friends and friends.

949
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,620
But since they've been down there, God was on their side.

950
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


951
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


952
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


953
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


954
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


955
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:29,620


956
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,420
We can see the way they're looking.

957
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,280
Hello.

958
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,180
How long have you been waiting?

959
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,700
My son.

960
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,320
You're late.

961
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,340


962
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,340


963
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,340


964
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,420
How long have you been waiting, my son?

965
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,720
It is his.

966
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:44,280


967
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:44,380


968
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:44,760
His.

969
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,480
His later.

970
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,380
Later.

971
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,440
That.

972
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:48,100
That.

973
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:48,640
That.

974
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,020
That.

975
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:49,700
You.

976
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,260
You.

977
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,100
Y.

978
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:51,120
You.

979
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:51,940
Think.

980
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,780
It's all yours, Lee.

981
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,480
It's all yours, Chuckie.

982
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,380
Chuckie, what he bought.

983
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,980
It's all yours, Lee.

984
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,640
It's all ours.

985
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,080
From the moment we laid our fish, John, at the first day we came across here to this big, small tiny place we're standing on,

986
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,620
to the day that we clenched down into the ground and lifted the dirt up to our eyes and said,

987
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,980
look at this stuff we've got.

988
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,800
It's dirt, and it's hard dirt.

989
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,680
And this land, which is our land, which we are on right now,

990
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,640
since the days when we first came here, we've been all out of caves.

991
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,820
In what we call the wellspring in the first cave,

992
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,580
which is actually not a real place, but a psycho-spiritual area.

993
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,600
We jumped out with hardly a stitch of clothes on and did the chicken dance all night long.

994
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:08,260
Till two in the morning we plucked and strutted and we fried ourselves in lard and sang the blues

995
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:17,000
and drank a pig, a knucklehead of pork wine and a beer, a whole bottle of wine.

996
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,400
Wow.

997
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,200
But now we're here, we're back to let you know

998
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,620
that jazz life is a little bit different.

999
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:24,620


1000
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:24,620


1001
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:24,620


1002
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,000
Lucky, if you want to dance this dance,

1003
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,460
you've got to do this dance with me.

1004
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,280
Or if you don't do this dance,

1005
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,820
then we don't dance.

1006
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,460
Then you're not going to dance with...

1007
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,820
You know what he means.

1008
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,760
The pantheon.

1009
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,600
Yes, we are the gods.

1010
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,640
We're here to mess with your hands.

1011
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,900
Can you dance with the gods?

1012
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:53,880
And we're talking about Nick.

1013
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,480
They dance quick.

1014
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,080
Elvis.

1015
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,400
Perturbo.

1016
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,200
Areva.

1017
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:58,900
Perduabo.

1018
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,800
James.

1019
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:00,300
Jimmy.

1020
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,240
St. Dimfnath.

1021
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:01,960
The Innocent Deadly.

1022
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,260
Jim.

1023
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,740
All the people of the Bizarre Shack.

1024
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,380
Living and Dead.

1025
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,760
Yeah.

1026
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,760
Sunhouse.

1027
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,380
Little Sun.

1028
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,160
Yeah.

1029
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:09,960
Big Sun.

1030
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,300
Big Bill.

1031
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,220
Big Bill Brunzi.

1032
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:12,900
Muddy.

1033
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,940
Little Bill Brunzi.

1034
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,380
Muddy.

1035
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,500
Muddy.

1036
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,080
Muddy.

1037
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,000
Dirtbag.

1038
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,740
Mike Luther King.

1039
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:19,760
JFK.

1040
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,100
Hans Fielder.

1041
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,180
Lex Luther.

1042
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:22,500


1043
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,340
Popeye the Rat.

1044
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,500
He was actually a sailor man, but he was confused.

1045
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,160
Yeah.

1046
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,140
Jimmy Hoffa.

1047
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,160
The Green Hornet.

1048
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,060
Huck Sampson and Delilah.

1049
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,840
They owned a barbecue shop down from my house where they both burned up that one night.

1050
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,720
And Kato.

1051
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,500
And Anne Rice.

1052
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,560
She doesn't know it yet.

1053
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,200
She's a vampire.

1054
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,420
Zombies.

1055
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,660
He's Booker, man.

1056
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,980
We gotta be Booker in two.

1057
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,260
There's only a scant 12 minutes until we have to be careless.

1058
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,520
But we're gonna be bumping and grinding.

1059
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,420
We're gonna get to a different tune.

1060
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,960
We're gonna go weightless in 12 minutes.

1061
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,220
Yeah.

1062
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,200
We're zapping off, man.

1063
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,060
You see these like normal, earthly coil type feet we got on here?

1064
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,140
We're gonna shuffle off them and we're gonna zap out into the fourth dimension where we

1065
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,300
can not only see the past and future, but the human kindness is a bowl of franken-beans

1066
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,560
for your own list and then a blazer and your listless barbecue.

1067
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,700
And a Rice Krispie treat that's been sitting on the mantle for four months.

1068
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,760
That's what we've all been waiting for.

1069
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,380
Mom's a Rice Krispie treat.

1070
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,020
Yeah.

1071
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,140
Yeah.

1072
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:27,580
Yeah.

1073
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,380
Yeah.

1074
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:28,380


1075
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,100
Sometimes she would melt down her fingernails and put them in them with the marshmallows.

1076
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,220
Other times she would smell her own clothing and yell at me for no reason in a different language.

1077
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,500
We didn't know what it was.

1078
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,600
It was the softener.

1079
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
He wouldn't have put the softener in the treats.

1080
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,880
I don't think the cats would have liked them.

1081
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,860
The dogs wouldn't like them.

1082
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,240
They were all particular.

1083
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,780
They were all protected by the soft machine, sir.

1084
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,940
The dinosaurs certainly wouldn't like them.

1085
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,980
And speaking of the dinosaurs, 150 million years is no guarantee of survival.

1086
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,640
But they were all protected by the soft machine, too, sir.

1087
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,320
How can you complain?

1088
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,120
Did you say soft machine?

1089
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,660
Yeah, Lord, Lordy.

1090
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,580
Oh.

1091
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:25,580


1092
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,120
Woo.

1093
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,300
Wow.

1094
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,720
What's good.

1095
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:35,660
Well, duddy?

1096
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,100
Want me to dry, you sure?

1097
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,740
No problem.

1098
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:46,440
Would you like to give George some coffee to Tharion Barrow?

1099
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,220
What?

1100
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,300
Yes, yes, please, please.

1101
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
No, thanks.

1102
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,880
Down both allowances.

1103
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,360
Yeah.

1104
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,360


1105
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,480
Can't you see the two neurons just ain't right

1106
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,580
They'll have to worry

1107
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,300
As long as we ain't turning

1108
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,880
The key to the lock on the door of illusion

1109
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,820
Yeah, yeah

1110
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,300
Well, submission

1111
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,600
Won't help the world's conditioning

1112
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,040
Nothing done too long

1113
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,800
I'm saying I'm trying, I'm dying

1114
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,520
The way it starts to line

1115
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,080
How long we got it on

1116
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,580
I heard that men were created for love

1117
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,460
But it seems there's some more than most

1118
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,700
As long as fear remains undemouched

1119
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,600
They'll have to worry

1120
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,400
Cause the one we turn

1121
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,140
The key to the lock on the door of illusion

1122
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1123
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,000
All right

1124
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,500
All right

1125
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:52,500


1126
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,380
Yeah

1127
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:54,900
One

1128
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:56,540
Yeah

1129
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,460
We'll let it go

1130
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:12,980
Even if we don't break

1131
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,360
It's this one

1132
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,780
Yeah

1133
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:14,780


1134
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:14,900
It's nothing like

1135
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,500
What we thought

1136
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,220
Yeah

1137
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,640
But tread with me

1138
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:21,640


1139
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:21,640


1140
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:21,640


1141
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,500
Broke

1142
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:22,500


1143
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,420
guitar solo

1144
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,300
guitar solo

1145
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,500
guitar solo

1146
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,500
guitar solo

1147
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,380
guitar solo

1148
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,880
guitar solo

1149
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:23,560
guitar solo

1150
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,880
guitar solo

1151
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,260
guitar solo

1152
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,600
And that's Frank Marino

1153
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,140
and Mahogany Rush, friends, from

1154
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,460
an old album.

1155
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:36,980
Praise God.
