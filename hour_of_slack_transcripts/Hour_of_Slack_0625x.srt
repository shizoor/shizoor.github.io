1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,440
It is a hard way, the way of being a man.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,980
Sooner or later, we all want a thing that is bad.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,580
To walk on all fours.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,280
To suck up drink from a stream.

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,560
To jabber, saying the words.

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,180
To go snuffling at the earth and floor the bark of trees.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,360
To eat flesh for fish.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,260
To make love to more than one every which way.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,100
These are all bad things.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,400
These are not the things that man do.

11
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,500
We are men.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,800
Are we not?

13
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,460
We are men.

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,380
Because the Father has made us men.

15
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,220
Praise Bob.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,820
Oh, Bob.

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,600
Turn on.

18
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,280
Tune in.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,220
Why do you want to be normal?

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,660
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,820
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,860
Next day's are coming.

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
And the pigs are bumming.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,900
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,400
you are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:20,240
we don't want to hurt you no we just want to tickle you and make you laugh

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:29,300
we just want to show you a good time we would never dream of brainwashing you

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:39,800
making you kill yourself no why on earth would we do such a silly thing like that

29
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:48,220
you can't kill yourself to the next day then you may shed your meat vessels

30
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,280
and

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,360
and

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,820
and

33
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,220
and

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


36
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


37
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


43
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


44
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


50
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


55
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,220


57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,900
and

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:50,900


59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,440
and

60
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,860
and

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,600
but remember

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,100
do not

63
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,340
shed your vessels

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,300
until next day

65
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,940
for all that will await you

66
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,880
is eternal

67
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,040
damnation

68
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
in a fiery

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,400
hell on earth

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,280
under ordinary

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,180
circumstances I would never

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,960
deny Jesus but under

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
physical torture

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,220
I would never deny Jesus

75
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,220


76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,220


77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,220


78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,220


79
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,280
afraid i would break down strapped to a table with someone sticking needles in my eyes now wait a

80
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,500
minute wait whoa hold the phone what kind of a false christ is supposed to be coming that loves

81
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,260
and saves souls now what what how many people would he to see if he took you doug and said

82
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,920
let's trap old doug down and poke his eyes out and save his soul my brethren

83
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,860
our task is nearly complete he was the last of those who brought the punishment to us

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,280
we have cleansed and purged his world now we must build built coffins that's all you'll need

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,780
and the peaks are coming

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:23,240
sure when the rupture hits we'll all be in our first class window seats on the pleasure saucers

87
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,180
watching the little pink boys fry

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,640
own alien allies bob's alien allies the exes are likened to gods their spaceships do not crash

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,240
for they do not need spaceships anymore than they are now they are the only ones that can

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,240


91
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:49,460
do anything and bob needs brains in his head soon we will be on the escape vessels yeah

92
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,440
each of us with our own fleet of battle planets if that's what we want they could just be shopping

93
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,860
malls or villages if that's what we want anything what's that need say smart witty

94
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,700
did he mention sacrilegious the church is not famous for its sense of humor or sense of its

95
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,460
uh of itself when being discussed by others uh i can understand this and it's

96
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,520
The issue was this new TV show called Nothing Sacred and how people were viewing that.

97
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,400
And in the context of that, we've gone off and talked about the church in general.

98
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,220
And now we have a call from Bethlehem.

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,300
Edward, I hope you are calling from Lehigh Valley and not from the Holy Land.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
No, it's quite correct.

101
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,300
It is the Lehigh Valley.

102
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,320
How are you doing tonight, Clark?

103
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:35,880
Very good, Ed.

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,160
A real pleasure to talk to you.

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,540
Thank you.

106
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,940
My girlfriend's a big fan of yours.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've been reading your columns and types.

108
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,740
Tell her I love her.

109
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,080
Well, you know, I've got to give it to you.

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,720
I drove an hour and a half from Reading listening to this show.

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,160
And it's probably the funniest hour and a half of radio I've heard in a long, long time.

112
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,860
I think so.

113
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,340
It's amazing when you talk about religion, the nuts that will come out of the woodwork.

114
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,780
Now, mind you, they're very righteous and lovable nuts, but nuts nonetheless.

115
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,020
I've spent a great deal of my life researching religion.

116
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,140
I'm myself a minister in a local church.

117
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,660
And it never ceases to amaze me that a church that has held so much power,

118
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,420
and is, what, 2,000 years old now, is afraid of a little rib, you know, a little jolt in the ribs.

119
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,140
And it'll poke a little fun at them, and they get all riled up.

120
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:20,660
Right.

121
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,560
When you get right down to it, you're talking about beliefs.

122
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
People are quoting this book and that book.

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,180
What you're really talking about is an invisible monster and who believes in which invisible monster.

124
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,280
Mm-hmm.

125
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,920
Now, you probably remember.

126
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,720
Well, you're not talking about the existence of God, right?

127
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,460
You're talking about...

128
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,640
Well, I'm talking about the existence of God on a person.

129
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,000
On a personal level, what you think God is.

130
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,120
Take, for example, the cult that...

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,740
What was it?

132
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,380
The Heaven's Gate.

133
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,820
Right.

134
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,200
Okay.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,160
Can't be proved the existence of whatever they believe in.

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,320
Right.

137
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
Well, they followed this religion, and they killed themselves.

138
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,180
Right.

139
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,600
And all you heard about for months and months and months were people tripping over themselves on your station and every other station,

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,340
talking about, well, how weird they were, and how wrong they were, and how we're so glad that we're so absolutely normal,

141
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,180
because we believe in a good invisible monster that didn't make us kill ourselves.

142
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,660
Right.

143
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,040
And, well, you know, each has their own invisible monster.

144
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:27,740
If you take the idea of many of the principles and the cornerstone of the Christian belief, Catholic belief,

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,700
certainly there's a cannibalistic right there, isn't there?

146
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,420
That we're eating the body, literally, and blood, literally.

147
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,120
Quite literally.

148
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,720
Right.

149
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,540
As a matter of fact, very interesting you should mention that,

150
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,960
that...

151
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
Right.

152
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


154
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


159
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


162
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


163
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,720


164
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,880
With the recent development in cloning technology,

165
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,440
there have been factions that have actually been trying to take transformed wafers and holy wine

166
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,660
to actually try and clone Jesus once again.

167
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,080
Oh, dear.

168
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:53,560
Yes.

169
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,480
You know, hey, each has their own, whatever you want to do.

170
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,560
If that's your religion...

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,260
Hey, if your religion revolves around creating an army of Jesuses to rule the world,

172
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,140
hey, so be it.

173
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,560
Don't expect not to be made fun of, and that's the point.

174
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:05,860
Right.

175
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,580
You're going to believe in an invisible monster that's going to send you into a fiery pit,

176
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,660
into a fiery pit,

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,420
for not doing exactly what he told someone else to tell you to tell you to do.

178
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,580
Well, here's...

179
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,920
You're going to be made fun of.

180
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,840
But, yeah, and if we, coming through that experience,

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,020
we were willing to martyr, be martyrs,

182
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,120
can't we take a little ribbon?

183
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
You know what I mean?

184
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,240
Ah!

185
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,900
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

186
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,640
And of course I want more slack.

187
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,360
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.

188
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,840
But what I really want...

189
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,920
Oh yeah, that's it.

190
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,840
Those lovely alien-nympho mutants.

191
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,580
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

192
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,940
Oh, I love to be naked.

194
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,220
More, more.

195
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,360
Oh, Bob.

196
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:10,940
Ah!

197
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Oh...

198
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,520
Ah!

199
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,840
We will be able to have sex and sails and mutual education with

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,980
many different species from many worlds and times

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,720
subgenius and even humans will be so few and far between amongst all these races

202
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,680
that when you see a person, you won't care whether they're

203
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,060
white or black or male or female or human or subgenius.

204
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,680
You'll be glad if they just have one head.

205
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,240
You'll say, wow, an earthling wow-ow, man.

206
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,640
Ah, hey, I'm from North America,

207
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,940
Wow, do you know Fred Schwartz?

208
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Next day's a-comin'.

209
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,740
And the peaks are bumpin'.

210
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,420
She bumped!

211
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,640
She got spiked! Stop!

212
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,400
Ring him.

213
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,020
If the students know that taking LSD might bring permanent brain damage, why do they take it?

214
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,060
The reply the teacher gave was,

215
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,760
well, if a student knows that tomorrow he may lose his head in Vietnam or buy an atomic bomb,

216
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,300
he's not too concerned about the possibility of damaging a few brain cells with a trip on LSD.

217
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,100
You know how some users may have lofty ambitions and hopes

218
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,200
that the drug or LSD will bring them some miraculous transformation,

219
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,460
make them poets and artists or supermen,

220
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
and many others looking strictly for escape.

221
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,780
Escape from life that has become too painful for them to bear.

222
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,420
What are we going to answer these young people today?

223
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,640
The young people that are crying out, live fast, look beautiful, die young.

224
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,040
The bomb may drop tomorrow.

225
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,100
Friend, you and I must find an answer.

226
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,420
I don't know. Gotta nuke something.

227
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,360
Touche.

228
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,860
First we got the bomb and that was good

229
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,440
Cause we love peace and motherhood

230
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,840
Then Russia got the bomb but that's okay

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
Cause the balance of power's maintained that way

232
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,060
Who's next?

233
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,620
France got the bomb and that was good

234
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
We got the bomb but don't you grieve

235
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,940
Cause they're on our side, I believe

236
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,600
China got the bomb but have no fears

237
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,280
They can't wipe us out for at least five years

238
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,760
Who's next?

239
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,940
Josh, the only difference between peace and war

240
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,600
is where we place our bombs.

241
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,200
We know that the vehicles for this kind of human destruction

242
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,140
are possible because there are things known as space buses

243
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,320
that can carry within them literally hundreds of pods,

244
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,540
each pod filled with a bomb of many megatons.

245
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,520
By radio waves, those bombs can be released wherever they want.

246
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,940
So they can just simply orbit this earth and touch the button

247
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,460
and city after city and country after country is blasted off the face of the earth.

248
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,800
Sarge, I think we're picking up something on the bomb detector.

249
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,080
And then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise

250
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,480
and the heavenly bodies will disappear in fire

251
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,960
and the earth and everything on it will be burned up.

252
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,220
I said X days are coming

253
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,620
And them little pigs are bummer

254
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,320
Those conspiracy Duke Pinkboy normals are gonna fry

255
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,240
They won't even know what hit them

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,060
That old Stark fist is gonna come down hard

257
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,940
But nothing's guaranteed dear friends

258
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm a card-carrying member of the church of the subgenius

259
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm the almighty king of slap

260
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,320
But when X day comes around

261
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,620
The only thing I have

262
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,460
is my

263
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,720
unshakable faith

264
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,080
in Bob!

265
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,040
Turn on

266
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,780
my tune-in

267
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,100
and turn off the lights!

268
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,660
That's really rude.

269
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,160
Really, really rude.

270
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,480
Now, bro, how can you get a master's degree if you keep swearing like that?

271
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,420
Well, you can.

272
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,620
I mean, Jesus had a master's degree, but he was denied ten years of worship.

273
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,720
For praying or cussing, which was it?

274
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,680
Uh, yes.

275
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes.

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,440
Yes.

277
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,460
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

278
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,300
Yes, friends!

279
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,280
Man, once again, I've got, just like last week, I've got so much great stuff here to play

280
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,360
that I don't...

281
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,720
There's no way I'm gonna get to all of it.

282
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,980
It's just too much too good to be true.

283
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,180
And, uh, uh, yes, what we've been listening to is what we will be listening to.

284
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,460
The great Bill T. Miller, king of slack, has come out with a new CD called,

285
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:41,120
Orgy of Slack, and I could easily just make this show nothing but that CD.

286
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
It is so good.

287
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
It is such a classic, pure subgenius CD.

288
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,800
I've also got this amazing audio collage, or media barrage as we call them in our religion,

289
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,180
done by the putacious sister, Susie the Floozy of Atlanta.

290
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,460
Congratulations to the Atlantaids.

291
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:11,120
They're a rockin' hand, and Jane and Papa Joe Mama, also, for the big Atlanta devivals

292
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,060
that they just had.

293
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:21,740
And, uh, friends, I've got an Einstein secret radio show that could easily carry the entire show.

294
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,040
And I've got the recordings from the amazing devivals in Portland and Seattle,

295
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,600
and I should just shut up and play that stuff, but I'm so excited.

296
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,620
I've got to tell you about the upcoming...

297
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,040
What?

298
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,700
What?

299
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,180
What?

300
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,380
What?

301
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:37,540
What?

302
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:37,900
What?

303
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,840
Oh, they're after me, friends.

304
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,260
I've got to hurry.

305
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,960
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, first off, in Cleveland, April 16th, Thursday, at the Euclid Tavern,

306
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,140
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank, will be preaching and, uh, and, and, whatever, with

307
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,460
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz and Michelle, and Princess Rhiar

308
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,500
Doe, and who knows what else.

309
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,600
That's, uh, April 16th at the Euclid Tavern, friends.

310
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,300
On Euclid Avenue in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

311
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,600
And then, uh, a week later, April 23rd in Boston, at the Middle East, the irreverent

312
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,000
Friday Jones brings you the final devival of all time that we know of, short of X-Day,

313
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,100
which will star...

314
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,020
Dr. Legume!

315
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,600
Bill T. Miller himself, the King of Slack, plus Pope David N. Meyer, Pope Sternodocs

316
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,260
Keycaver, possibly, and Brother Cleve Duncan and D.K. Jones.

317
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,220
Now, can you imagine a greater, uh, bunch of Slack bangers?

318
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,040
And, in fact, D.K. Jones, Brother Cleve, and, uh, Bill T. Miller, uh, together and, uh,

319
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,820
have become a band called the Slack Bangers.

320
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,280
We'll be hearing that off of Bill's amazing CD shortly.

321
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,180
Let me give you an address, a couple of addresses for Bill T. Miller, because when you hear

322
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,240

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,200

324
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,780

And here it is.

326
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:18,340

327
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:28,700
That's Box 230-221, Boston, Massachusetts, 02123.

328
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,840
Cool bunch of numbers there, friends.

Or you can email Bill T. Miller at KingofSlack, one word, at subgenius.com.

333
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
I don't know if Bill even knows that he has that address.

334
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
But, uh, uh, he, he, he does.

And, uh, friends, oh, so I'm gonna, I'm just gonna, we're, we're gonna just dive right

Uh, uh, oh, oh.

338
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,760
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,380
Praise the .

340
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,280
Why?

341
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,740
Uh.

342
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,280
Oh.

343
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:23,540
Oh!

344
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:24,780
Oh.

345
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh.

346
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Oh!

347
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,240


348
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,380
Oh.

349
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,180
Oh!

350
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,340


351
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,340


352
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,340


353
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,460
Oh.

354
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,460


355
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,920
The mind is the most powerful sex organ.

356
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,540
You're gonna like it when you get less frightened of it, you sleazy weasel.

357
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,320
Listen to me, mister, it's salvation I'm talking about!

358
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,360
The blues isn't about feeling better, it's about making other people feel worse.

359
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,620
I will tell you about the fiction and the fallacy.

360
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,080
It's brought to you by the salesman of salvation.

361
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,120
That's marvelous, that is marvelous!

362
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
I'm gonna have to fire.

363
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,720
Oh, no, no, no, no.

364
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,380
Easy there, bitches.

365
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, no.

366
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,880
I'm a slug baby, baby.

367
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,980
You know what I like.

368
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,360
A slug baby, baby.

369
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,500
You know what I need.

370
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,020
A slug baby, baby.

371
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,400
You know what I want.

372
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
Oh, yeah.

373
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,220
A slug baby, baby.

374
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,820
Now that's what I want, that's right.

375
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,480
A slug baby, baby.

376
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,860
Oh, ugh.

377
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,700
You know what I like.

378
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,540
A slug band, baby.

379
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,680
Ugh.

380
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,500
You know what I need.

381
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,760
A slug baby, baby.

382
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,660
You know what I want.

383
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,020
Ugh!

384
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:52,800
Oh, yeah.

385
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,960
A slug banging feels so good, yeah.

386
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,360
Ugh.

387
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,800
Slack banging with the slack bangers.

388
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,980
Now that's what I want. That's right.

389
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,700
You can always get more.

390
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,920
Slack bang the baby.

391
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Oh, my God.

392
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh.

393
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,320
Oh.

394
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,100


395
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Oh.

396
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:56,460


397
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:56,580


398
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,220
Slack banging with the slack bangers.

399
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Oh.

400
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,620
With the slack bangers.

401
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,020
Slack banging with the slack bangers.

402
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,020


403
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,020


404
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh.

405
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,440
Oh, yeah.

406
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,620
Now that's what I want. That's right.

407
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,380
You want to hear some great music?

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,620
I just wanted to make money and have fun.

409
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,760
Hello, doctor.

410
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
How are you?

411
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,780
The doctor is on.

412
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,060
You could have a rewarding career as a subgenius doctor.

413
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,820
That's right. Surgeons for Connie.

414
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,820
Perform healing orgy-deviable surgery.

415
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,340
Sicken the masses.

416
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,380
Bombard the patient with subgenius anti-fusing noise.

417
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,160
I'm gonna die.

418
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,460
Surgeons for Connie. Standing by.

419
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Well, I...

420
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,000
I...

421
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm ready to operate.

422
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,440
Scammer.

423
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,940
Golf club.

424
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,300
Pipe.

425
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,780
Light the pipe full of froth and insert the golf club into the third nostril of the patient.

426
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
And the depro gaming will begin.

427
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,820
Stop it! Stop it!

428
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,940
Please, I beg you!

429
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,400
You will no longer believe in Connie's little puppet, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

430
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,800
You will now realize the truth.

431
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:56,980
You will now realize the truth.

432
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980


433
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980


434
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980


435
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980


436
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,980


437
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,300
That Connie is the one true slack master.

438
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,700
Praise Connie! Praise Connie! Praise Connie! Praise Connie!

439
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,760
Don't worry.

440
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,460
The spurting, bleeding head side effects are part of the treatment.

441
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,060
Now, whenever you hear the name Bob,

442
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,240
you will automatically substitute the name Connie.

443
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,040
Connie.

444
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,580
Praise Connie.

445
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,180
Hail Connie.

446
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,740
Love Connie.

447
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,220
Hate Connie.

448
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,140
Connie.

449
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,820
You are out of control.

450
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,680
They set me on a cold metal table.

451
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,620
And prodded me with humiliating probes.

452
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,160
Now, don't you feel better?

453
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,700
Warning. Danger.

454
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,580
This is not Bob, young. It's God.

455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,480
Friends, you can actually call this unusual band,

456
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,400
which has an answer machine,

457
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,020
that they urge you to leave strange messages on.

458
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,400
The new number is...

459
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,640
617 Lick OBE.

460
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,720
Please make a note of it.

461
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,460
Disregard all rumors, no matter how entertaining.

462
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,720
Frankly, Mr. Miller, I don't understand this album.

463
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,860
The OBE album.

464
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,640
Could you explain it to us a little bit?

465
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,200
Well, it's an insane journey.

466
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,180
Sort of a dream flashback.

467
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,100
An all night TV dream flashback.

468
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,420
And you're looking through the mind of this insane genius.

469
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,080
After he's been up all night watching TV,

470
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,720
and he just was abducted by alien sex nymphs,

471
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,400
and he's on his quest for enlightenment.

472
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,680
Uh-huh.

473
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,060
And since it's a dream, it's a flashback,

474
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,580
it really doesn't really make sense.

475
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,340
And this insane genius has all these obsessions,

476
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,400
like he loves to eat, he watches too much TV,

477
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,240
he's on the phone,

478
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,020
he's into sex and magic and UFOs,

479
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,760
and he just, he tries to overindulge in all his obsessions

480
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,960
until his mind just blows.

481
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,320
This is called Out of Band Experience.

482
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,640
And make your dream come true.

483
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,540
Very sexually explicit.

484
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,140
Your discretion is advised.

485
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,100
Wait until I get my devices.

486
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,760
The next performer on our stage

487
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,400
is indeed considered to be one of the three greatest guys in the universe.

488
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,180
He was born of a virgin.

489
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,400
He was anointed and baptized by John the Baptist himself in the wilderness.

490
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,640
He suffered and was crucified under Pontius Pilate,

491
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,480
that hairy bureaucrat,

492
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,760
the procurator of Judea, a terrible child.

493
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,240
And he died for the sins of mankind,

494
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,080
and then after three days he rose from the dead,

495
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,300
and he ascended unto heaven

496
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,960
where he sat by the right hand of the Father.

497
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,360
Jehovah One,

498
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,320
senile and malignant space god.

499
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,420
Ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
the church of the subgenius of Zion,

501
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,140
Jesus of Nazareth!

502
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,860
Thank you, thank you.

503
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,180
I am the Lord Jesus Christ,

504
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,020
business manager of the subgenius.

505
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,960
Enough about me.

506
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,940
I've got a lot of people to talk to,

507
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
and I want to thank for putting this revival together.

508
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,620
I usually don't do this,

509
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,580
but I have a small parable,

510
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,720
a very serious parable for you.

511
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,800
Praise Jesus!

512
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Thank you, thank you.

513
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,360
They ask me why I came back

514
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,920
and became the business manager of the church of the subgenius.

515
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,920
And it's because I like being around a bunch of non-believers,

516
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,320
because maybe you guys won't kill me this time.

517
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,880
But just in case,

518
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,160
I have my ticket,

519
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,620
and I will be on the space vessels of the sex goddesses

520
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,680
on July 5th, 7 a.m.

521
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,660
And since I'm only 28,

522
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,320
I don't get crucified until I'm 33.

523
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,800
Hell, that's plenty of time.

524
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,320
So here's your parable for the evening.

525
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,280
Every morning,

526
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,620
in the plains of Africa,

527
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,200
the gazelle gets up,

528
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,640
and it realizes

529
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,640
that if it doesn't outrun the lion,

530
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,620
it will be killed.

531
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,860
And every morning,

532
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,600
the lion wakes up,

533
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,260
and it realizes

534
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,080
if it doesn't run faster than the gazelle,

535
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,180
it will starve to death.

536
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,480
Friends, it doesn't matter,

537
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,900
it does not matter

538
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,720
whether you're a lion or a gazelle.

539
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,780
When the sun comes up,

540
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,340
you better be running.

541
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,680
And if you don't have your subgenius membership

542
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,660
on July 4th,

543
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,880
you better be running your ass off.

544
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,420
Thirty dollars is cheap now,

545
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,560
but the price is going up.

546
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,960
And now, let me plug some products.

547
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,440
The full-color poster here by, uh...

548
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:56,740
Well,

549
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,520
has it ever occurred to you

550
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,640
you might have totally lost your mind?

551
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,500
I mean, this is just satanic.

552
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,520
Judge not, Mr. Douglas,

553
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,440
that ye be not judged,

554
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,040
for by these judgments

555
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,620
shall ye also be judged.

556
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,880
And let he who hath not sinned

557
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,960
cast the first stone.

558
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,160
There is no peace,

559
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,200
saith the Lord,

560
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,520
unto the wicked.

561
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,880
Uh, can't we take a little ribbon?

562
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,200
You know what I mean?

563
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
Well, it comes down to,

564
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,780
what's the point of a religion

565
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,900
if you can't use it to say that you're right

566
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,380
and someone else is wrong?

567
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Yeah, if it comes...

568
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,560
Yeah, exactly.

569
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,880
But when you get right down to it,

570
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:33,900
you know,

571
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:33,900


572
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,440
but a lot of people,

573
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,460
not all, mind you,

574
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,580
I mean, I don't want to condemn everyone,

575
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,600
but a lot of people,

576
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,080
they're not in it for the idea of love

577
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
and going to heaven.

578
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,320
No.

579
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,180
They like the idea of you and me

580
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,280
not going to heaven.

581
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:44,640
They like...

582
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,320
It's the inclusion.

583
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,460
They want to be part of that, you know...

584
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,600
It's a social club.

585
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,540
Well, yeah.

586
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,480
And it's also,

587
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,560
it gives them comfort.

588
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,480
Comfort to know.

589
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:52,660
You know, they get together

590
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,020
every Sunday morning and, you know,

591
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,300
play bridge with Jesus.

592
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Hey, and that's fine.

593
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,440
I play bridge with Jesus.

594
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,560
I usually let him win

595
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,900
and there's nothing wrong with that.

596
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,160
But don't expect not to be made fun of

597
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,680
because you are funny.

598
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,860
You're funnier than George Burns.

599
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,300
You're funnier than Red Skelton.

600
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,940
You're funnier than all of them.

601
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,020
And what's so funny is

602
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,180
you don't even realize

603
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,420
that you're being so funny.

604
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,480
So...

605
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,840
And you know what?

606
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,340
You speak much truth.

607
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,200
I wish it wasn't quite so serious.

608
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,980
Well...

609
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,600
You know what I mean?

610
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
No, no, you're right.

611
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,160
And thanks for the call, Ed.

612
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,160
I got to make a run.

613
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,420
If they can't take a joke, you know?

614
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,740
Yeah, I hear you.

615
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:26,940
Thanks.

616
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,880
Ed Strangman.

617
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,640
The Strange, dear friends.

618
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,700
The amazing circus oddity,

619
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,100
Edward...

620
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,640
Reverend Edward Strange.

621
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,740
Bravo.

622
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,460
Bravo.

623
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,120
Oh.

624
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,180
Somewhere in sands of the desert,

625
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,900
the shape of a lion body

626
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,060
and the head of a man

627
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,240
is moving its slow thighs.

628
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,840
The darkness drops again.

629
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,800
But now I know

630
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,280
that 20 centuries of stony sleep

631
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,800
were vexed to a nightmare

632
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,820
by a rocking cradle.

633
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,980
And what rough beast,

634
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,240
its hour come round at last,

635
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,140
slouches towards Bethlehem

636
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,620
to be born.

637
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,340
Oh.

638
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,740
Well, England,

639
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,480
that book was just beautiful.

640
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,600
Thank you so much.

641
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,620
Very, very much.

642
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,100
I mean, I mean,

643
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,860
Jesus had a master's degree,

644
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,580
but he was denied tenure

645
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,940
and they crucified him.

646
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,060
You know, publish and perish.

647
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,380
It's industry that made this country great.

648
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,620
Tell it like it is, Pastor Craig.

649
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,860
Why, why, thank you, Princess Wee.

650
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,580
I mean, I've worked hard for a living.

651
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,460
I've worked so hard,

652
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,440
it's just, it's just embarrassing.

653
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,500
And then I get e-mail like I got yesterday

654
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,840
from some person who was criticizing me

655
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,820
for something I put on All.Slack

656
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,780
over a year ago.

657
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,040
And I'm like,

658
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,040


659
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,160
well, I'm going to go to jail.

660
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,220
Mm-mm-mm, how funny.

661
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,340
Well, what's more than that,

662
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,140
it's like he was thinking

663
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,880
he was ragging on his band or something.

664
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
Good thoughts, now I'm hanging up on you.

665
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,260
It was like he was thinking

666
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,620
I was ragging on his band or something.

667
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,380
He's saying,

668
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,400
just because we got on stage

669
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,140
doesn't give you the right to compliment

670
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,680
and critique on your parents or something.

671
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm thinking, well, gee.

672
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,780
Looking in your bathroom window

673
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,980
and you don't know what to do.

674
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,960
Oh, yeah.

675
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,000
Surveillance cameras everywhere.

676
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,020
It's more than your dream, Pastor Craig.

677
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,740
They're not coming to you through the internet.

678
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,000
They're coming to you through your brain.

679
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,780
They got your brain in a jar.

680
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,420
Somewhere in Langley there's a clone.

681
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,180
Somewhere off in the D.I.A.

682
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,480
there's somebody who knows your real home.

683
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:47,960
Ha-ha.

684
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,660
Yeah, him and everybody else on the internet, but...

685
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,860
Oh.

686
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,820
But do go on. Do go on.

687
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,320
It's a sad song.

688
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,360


689
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,720
I like hearing my name said on the air like that.

690
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
It gives me a feeling of importance.

691
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,400
But it's like, it's like, geez, like...

692
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,080
It's like, it's like these people just keep picking on me or something.

693
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,840
It's like they think they're gonna...

694
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,320
Pastor Craig.

695
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,080
Yes, it is.

696
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
Really, Pastor Craig?

697
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,120
Yes.

698
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,560
Oh, Pastor Craig.

699
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,900
Pastor Craig.

700
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,060
Pastor Craig.

701
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:37,080
Oh, Pastor Craig.

702
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,520


703
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:37,520


704
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,000
Pastor Craig.

705
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


706
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


707
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


708
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


709
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


710
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


711
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000


712
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Would you please recap the song?

713
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,060
Open your eyes to the Lord and share the words that won a man to go send.

714
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,320
We remarkably think of God as Father, but he will come to the Lord before we depart.

715
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,900
We respectfully think of God as the King of our eyes.

716
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,220
It's not easy, man, no matter who you are.

717
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,340
But we have received moreury all the way up until today.

718
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,340


719
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,340


720
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,340


721
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,340


722
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,340


723
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:53,560
What's wilder, man?

724
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:53,560


725
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,900
What do you got to say to Pastor Craig?

726
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,800
How many people do you know are looking forward to X Day

727
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,960
just because it will get them out of debt?

728
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,820
Pastor Craig

729
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,120
I suppose they all owe you

730
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,080
Pastor Craig

731
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,560
There's nothing else you can do, man.

732
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,720
You got to stop fussing, bro.

733
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,380
You got too many problems.

734
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,680
Craig

735
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,400
Dust stick

736
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Oh, wow.

737
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,460
Oh, wow.

738
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,000
Stop that obscene dance.

739
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:46,560
Hey.

740
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,900
Can't. But I can't.

741
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,240
Wait just a second here.

742
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,080
Dancing is a part of life.

743
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,000
All civilizations have had dance.

744
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,600
Part of life is a dance.

745
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,960
Is it not, Pastor Craig?

746
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,520
Pastor Craig

747
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,360
Pastor Craig

748
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,960
Pastor Craig

749
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:18,940
Pastor Craig

750
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,400
Pastor Craig

751
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,400


752
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,400


753
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,400


754
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,400


755
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,080
That's so pretty.

756
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,280
I once had a band.

757
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,160
I once had a band, but know what happened?

758
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,560
It's another sad story, isn't it, Pastor Craig?

759
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,440
Well, it's the sort of story that people think you're making it up when you tell it.

760
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,760
Our keyboard player ran off to Arizona.

761
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,140
Pastor Craig

762
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,220
Pastor Craig

763
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,220


764
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,400
And you might think I'm making this up just because you guys have a song called Arizona,

765
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,500
but this person really did run away to Arizona.

766
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,140
And he ran away to Arizona because, well, his parents found him doing something that he shouldn't have been doing

767
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,100
and taking things that he shouldn't have been taking.

768
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,320
And he thought that he'd be closer to God if he gave away all his possessions.

769
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
And he was in my band.

770
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,340
I know.

771
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:40,000
And he was the only person in our band who actually believed he was going to be able to get with members of the opposite sex

772
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,240
just by being in the band.

773
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,980
All the other members of the band either could get it or had no illusions thereof.

774
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,100
Pastor Craig.

775
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,400
Pastor Craig.

776
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,780
Yeah, some people talk about mean old Mr. Tooth Decay.

777
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,580
You talk about mean old Mr. Tooth Decay.

778
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,420
Yeah, for ten years the dentist was sitting on your lap.

779
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,440
Didn't let you go, he wouldn't let you leave.

780
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,160
No, he had to get closer.

781
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,780
He had to drill down deeper.

782
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,600
Had to find out what was inside.

783
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Had to fill you up.

784
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,340
Had to look in your brain.

785
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,580
And he saw love.

786
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:19,860
And he saw love.

787
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,000
You know, some people think I'm Bill Cosby, but in reality I'm Mr. Tooth Decay.

788
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,140
Pastor Craig.

789
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,340
Pastor Craig.

790
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,560
In reality, Pastor Craig.

791
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,020
Yes?

792
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,600
Yes?

793
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,940
Could you repeat the original question, please?

794
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,380
The original question.

795
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,140
Is this a...

796
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,980
Mr.

797
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,900
The original bleepo.

798
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,400
The original bleepo.

799
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,560
We have the original bleepo on the phone.

800
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,060
And the original...

801
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,660
Pastor Craig.

802
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,540
The original bleepo.

803
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,120
The original bleepo.

804
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,180
Pastor Craig's on the phone.

805
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,000
Here comes another one.

806
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,820
Hello?

807
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,360
Hello?

808
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,900
Hey, what...

809
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,020
Oh, my God.

810
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,680
Here they are.

811
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,260
Who?

812
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,740
This is the original question.

813
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,980
We have Pastor Craig on the phone.

814
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,280
We have the Reverend Ivan Stang.

815
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,480
We have Reverend bleepo Abernathy.

816
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,180
We've got...

817
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,940
The princess we have now in the studio.

818
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,220
And we've got...

819
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,040
What the hell?

820
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,160
83-year-old squid falling from the sky.

821
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,000
83-year-old squid, man.

822
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,940
They make me so high.

823
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,220
Ooh.

824
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,100
Yeah.

825
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:30,980
He knows.

826
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,780
Well, I'm so glad to see Pastor Craig, the king of ugly.

827
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,180
And, oh, and lovely Reverend bleepo.

828
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,860
And we're going to do some healings.

829
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,180
The church in sub-genius, we do healings.

830
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,600
And sickening.

831
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,180
So if you have nothing wrong with you tonight,

832
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,440
feel free to come up and get something wrong with you.

833
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:58,120
Now, I know many of you have problems such as a job.

834
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
We can heal you of that job tonight.

835
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,560
I'm going to need the help of my assistant here,

836
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,140
someone who will be a catcher for me.

837
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,860
So come right up.

838
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,600
If you have any problems with the conspiracy,

839
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,880
anything you want to say, now's your chance.

840
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,080
Somebody out there needs to be healed.

841
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,460
Somebody, come up, brother.

842
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,360
Come up, brother.

843
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,180
Tell me your problem.

844
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,320
Tell me what's wrong.

845
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,300
How's the problem?

846
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,360
The conspiracy is holding me back.

847
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,960
It's holding me back because I've been working at a restaurant for four months,

848
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,200
and I'm still the fucking busboy.

849
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,680
He's still the fucking busboy.

850
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,060
Do you believe in water, J.R.R. Bob?

851
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,060
I believe.

852
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,200
Will you fight the conspiracy?

853
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,220
Shoot them.

854
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,780
I'm going to need your help, brother.

855
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,080
It can get dangerous.

856
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,080
It can get dangerous.

857
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
He's a busboy.

858
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,160
Do you believe in Bob?

859
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,320
I believe in Bob.

860
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,980
Do you believe in slack?

861
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,620
I believe in slack.

862
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,420
Let me heal.

863
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,880
What else can we have tonight?

864
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,520
It's a mad too.

865
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,480
Come on, sit down.

866
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,420
We've got to do something wrong.

867
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,680
It's got to get something wrong with this guy.

868
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,580
Come on up.

869
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,120
Come on up, brother.

870
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,680
I am selling futons and futon furniture.

871
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,480
Futons and futon furniture.

872
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,160
Be healed.

873
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,600
Our newest brethren, just ordained tonight.

874
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,320
What's wrong, brother?

875
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,900
Got some pain in my back.

876
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,320
Pain in your back?

877
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,260
And I can feel you have a pain in your shoulder.

878
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:13,740
Is that true?

879
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,420
Yeah.

880
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,600
And you have one leg.

881
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,200

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,120


903
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,120


904
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,120


905
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,500
Oh.

906
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:49,500

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:49,500


909
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:49,500

Okay.

Oh.

916
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,720
This is not a game for little boys and girls.

917
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,320
This is your life!

918
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,520
Happy Meadow!

919
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,180
Listen to your music, man!

920
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,480
Words in reverse!

921
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,340
This is just another stupid happy meadow band!

922
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,040
The motherfuckers gonna eat my meadow!

923
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,960
You thought you were gonna get pulled in here!

924
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,160
You're ready for me!

925
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,360
I used to be a nice guy just like you!

926
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,360
Then I found the ticket of a soul is the truth I want!

927
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,760
I will eat you alive and chew you up and spit in your face!

928
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,080
You're ready for me!

929
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,080


930
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,560
You better be ready to face the consequences little boys and girls!

931
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,000
One last chance! That's all you have!

932
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,240
You're ready for me!

933
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,280
There's no escaping the eyes!

934
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,840
You will see them in every dream!

935
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,140
You're right!

936
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,940
You will never escape the eyes of jobs!

937
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,940
You're ready for me!

938
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,640
The eyes of jobs will follow you wherever you go!

939
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,040
You're ready for me!

940
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,380
I will wash my soul's eyes again!

941
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,680
You're ready for me!

942
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,400
You'll be right for me!

943
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,920
You pulled me from beyond the grave!

944
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,660
You better be ready to face the truth my friend!

945
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,240
We're here for your soul!

946
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,720
You will love your love!

947
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,620
You're ready for me!

948
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:13,620


949
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:24,100
You will eat me alive and chew you up and spit in your face!

950
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,580
You are my life!

951
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,880
Hardcore girl, you don't have to cry!

952
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,100
Your eyes will always be a legend!

953
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,140
Peopleỗi

954
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,120
Your eyes won'tüler

955
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,180
Nine!

956
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,440
Nine!

957
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,220
You can!

958
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:39,220


959
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,920
You haven't attended to the break of a Saturday morning conspiracy!

960
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:55,940
Praise the eyes of Bob that look into yours as you look into them.

961
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,700
They are looking back and you are looking into them.

962
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:03,060
You are falling into the eyes of Bob and you will never hit the bottom.

963
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,000
On and on and on.

964
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,060
Oh, please tell me, is the devil still pursuing you?

965
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,080
Well, perhaps you could explain to me what you mean by the devil.

966
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,400
You seem to be on terms with him.

967
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:29,100
Well, permit me, Mr. Douglas, to tell you something of the devil that I've come to know him.

968
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:36,660
The devil is that element in human nature that impels us to destroy and debase.

969
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,140
And what are you about upon this island but destruction?

970
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,940
Oh, well, I can tell you very plainly.

971
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,400
No, please don't do that.

972
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:55,060
For seventeen years I have been striving to create some measure of refinement in the human species.

973
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,880
And it is here on this very island that I, sir, have found the very essence of the devil.

974
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,780
What do you mean?

975
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,200
I have seen the devil in my eyes.

976
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,620
I have seen him in my microscope.

977
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,540
And I have changed him.

978
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:19,040
And I suppose you could say in a sense, metaphorically speaking, I've cut him to pieces.

979
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:30,460
The devil, Mr. Douglas, I have found is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes.

980
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:39,120
And it is with great assurance that I can tell you that Lucifer, son of Morn,

981
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,240
is no more.

982
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,280
Well, I don't see how any of this specious nonsense justifies these monstrous disfigurements.

983
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,880
I have a problem with everything in my entire life.

984
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,200
Yes! Everything in his entire life!

985
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,640
It's not your world!

986
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,880
Do you promise to reject the conspiracy in all its evil ways?

987
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:08,620
Yes.

988
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,660
Be healed!

989
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,620
Secondary life!

990
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,140
Tell me, brother.

991
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:18,740
Oh.

992
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,480
He's evil. Everything in my life.

993
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,780
What's wrong with you, brother?

994
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,280
I work in a mortuary and I like it.

995
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:33,940
Well, I don't think you need me here. I think that's fine.

996
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,620
He needs a sickening. He needs a sickening.

997
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,080
Yes!

998
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,740
I'm sick of you.

999
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,700
Be sick of him!

1000
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,640
Be sick of him!

1001
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,800
Don't you wish we all had that job?

1002
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,040
Yes, friends. The beast flesh does keep creeping back.

1003
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,720
And we keep casting it back out and then having to clean it up.

1004
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:05,180
And I must say thanks to Negative Land for providing the amazing sound effects in the background on that.

1005
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,460
It's Portland Devival.

1006
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,240
Recording.

1007
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,260
And thanks to Jeremy Olson for recording the thing.

1008
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,560
Andi.

1009
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:14,880
Andi!

1010
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,560
Andi!

1011
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:27,880
As all of these things culminate in these end times here, we have only 111 or 110 days, I think, left.

1012
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,980
110.

1013
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,560
And imagine some of the people who just cannot, who will not be accepted into this mass fold.

1014
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,360
This big fatty thing that's going to be whipped asunder.

1015
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,540
And then sent magnetically and magically into the sky to have every, uh, anything it wants, perhaps.

1016
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:45,740
I guess it is, isn't it?

1017
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,440
Sure. Anything.

1018
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,560
And listeners, listeners, if you...

1019
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,360
Listeners, radio listeners out there...

1020
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,880
...will be crammed down its hideous fat craw.

1021
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:59,860
If you don't believe us right now, listeners, go to your televisions right now and tune in NBC or ABC or CBS, any of the major networks.

1022
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,580
You'll see it's the same thing that was on yesterday.

1023
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,560
Yeah.

1024
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,800
It is, every day.

1025
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,120
It's the same.

1026
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:11,380
And if the virtual world isn't enough for you, get in your car and drive north.

1027
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,520
You'll see a Burger King.

1028
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,240
Then you'll see a multiplex movie theater.

1029
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,540
Then you will see a McDonald's.

1030
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,100
And the underlying zeitgeist of the...

1031
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,360
Right.

1032
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:29,720
I can predict exactly what you will see as you drive away from downtown, no matter where you are.

1033
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,280
That's right.

1034
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,680
And turn on your radio.

1035
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,800
Anybody can predict it because, uh...

1036
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,620
You know what you're here.

1037
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,600
It's the same from one town to another.

1038
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:46,140
And basically what's going to start happening, the whole Clinton scandal is going to be hundreds and then two thousands of women are going to start recalling having been groped by Bill Clinton.

1039
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,420
Hey, I'll tell you what, Bill is not a bad lover.

1040
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,540
He's...

1041
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:57,900
You know, I'm glad that he doesn't have a mustache because that's kind of scratchy, but I loved Bill in my own...

1042
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:58,060
Uh-huh.

1043
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,660
You know, in his...

1044
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,260
Oh, is that when you were visiting James?

1045
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,780
I know that I was just one of his little toys that he just...

1046
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:03,780


1047
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,820
Used during a lunch hour and threw aside, but...

1048
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,860
That was at that lunch that Jayner took you to.

1049
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:09,520
Right.

1050
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,340
Yeah.

1051
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,720
Sure.

1052
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,340
Well, it's when he was governor.

1053
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,920
Right.

1054
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,080
Long before he was president.

1055
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,500
This thing...

1056
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:14,560
Yeah.

1057
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,620
This marking on my genitalia...

1058
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,280
I don't know if the listeners know about this thing.

1059
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:17,820
What?

1060
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,200
The marking on my genitalia?

1061
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,440
I have no, uh...

1062
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,600
It's not a 666.

1063
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,680
I have no qualms about admitting, uh...

1064
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:22,800
It's not a bad sign.

1065
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,260
It's not a sign from Satan.

1066
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,220
It has nothing to do with the Antichrist.

1067
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,680
This mark on my penis is a sign that I've been in close spiritual contact with aliens.

1068
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,340
I have, uh...

1069
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,940
Come down numerous times and visited me in the Oval Office.

1070
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,560
And it isn't Monica Lewinsky or...

1071
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,280
And I resent the charges...

1072
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,760
Take your hands off me!

1073
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,300
In fact, it was...

1074
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,640
Take your hands off me right now!

1075
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,420
You know what I think it's all about?

1076
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:45,700
Wow.

1077
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:51,260
I think what it's all about is the Republicans resent the fact that the Democrats get it

1078
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:51,740
for free.

1079
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,520
The Republicans are used to paying for it, getting professional treatment.

1080
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,260
Yeah.

1081
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:57,820
Nobody talks.

1082
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,940
Nobody says anything afterwards.

1083
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,520
Yeah.

1084
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,200
But, uh...

1085
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,320
You know, the Democrats are used to paying for it.

1086
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1087
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1088
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1089
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1090
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1091
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1092
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:02,320


1093
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,180
And the Democrats vote with their peckers once again, as always.

1094
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,740
It's the perennial...

1095
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,720
It's the big problem.

1096
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,280
You know, it's the bonobos versus the...

1097
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,400
Well...

1098
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,060
Bono's.

1099
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,600
Nutless...

1100
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,340
Nope.

1101
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,220
Noblos versus bozos?

1102
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
Yeah, I don't want to...

1103
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:18,560
Yeah.

1104
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,920
Bonobos versus the bozos.

1105
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,060
The noblos...

1106
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,360
Nope.

1107
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,440
Nope.

1108
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:22,940
Noblos...

1109
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:23,140
Yeah.

1110
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:23,680
That's it.

1111
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,440
The noblos...

1112
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,300
Versus the no-dos.

1113
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,520
And versus the...

1114
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,820
Triceball.

1115
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,460
Triceball.

1116
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:31,460


1117
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,180
Triceball.

1118
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:32,300
Triceball.

1119
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:32,320
Triceball.

1120
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,320


1121
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,200
And I just...

1122
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,280
monitors.

1123
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,200
Sounds like action.

1124
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,480
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1125
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:54,380
Please.

1126
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,500
Now the subtle messages are getting in there.

1127
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,800
I had some guy...

1128
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,740
I read a review of some genius material the other day

1129
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,240
in some magazine called Paranoia, in fact.

1130
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,660
Ah!

1131
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,640
That said that it implied that we used subliminals

1132
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,640
in our radio and video material.

1133
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,080
P.O. Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1134
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,300
It implied that we lied about having subliminals in them.

1135
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,740
There are no subliminal messages.

1136
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,500
These are not subliminal messages.

1137
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,440
You know, if I seem to recall correctly,

1138
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:44,880
all certain various products begin with a 15-minute disclaimer

1139
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,820
about how you can't sue a...

1140
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,120
Bob.

1141
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,080
Bob.

1142
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,320
Bob.

1143
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,680
Bob is whispering in your ear.

1144
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,060
Bob is whispering in your ear.

1145
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:58,960
40306.

1146
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,440
Bob is whispering in your ear.

1147
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,060
Bob is whispering in your ear.

1148
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,160
Send money to the radio station.

1149
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,680
Support public radio.

1150
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,380
And zip codes.

1151
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,640
Support public radio now.

1152
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,100
I'm going to go over you.

1153
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,660
Bob Tilton himself.

1154
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,100
Jack Van Imp.

1155
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,600
Pat Robertson.

1156
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,900
Jimmy Swagger.

1157
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,260
And Roxanne's a babe.

1158
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,180
Huh?

1159
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,300
Roxanne Van Imp?

1160
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,620
You know, actually, Pastor Craig,

1161
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,520
I'd have to agree with you,

1162
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,380
at least, you know, for one of those pompadude,

1163
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:49,900
completely artificial, made-up, robot, bimbo-looking...

1164
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,160
You know, for a preacher wife, you're right.

1165
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,300
She is hot.

1166
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,300
She's squid.

1167
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,280
Squid.

1168
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,180
Squid.

1169
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,420
Squid.

1170
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,360
She's...

1171
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,840
I wouldn't mind D. Beacon and Mrs. Jack Van Imp.

1172
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,340
No.

1173
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:02,700
Squid.

1174
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,440
Squid.

1175
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,980
In fact, I've been...

1176
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,020
Actually, I imagine there's probably some people telling stories at parties in L.A.

1177
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,440
about just such a thing.

1178
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,280
That's all stories.

1179
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,080
That is squid.

1180
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,560
What?

1181
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,560
Parties in L.A.?

1182
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,180
They have squid parties in L.A.?

1183
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,320
Well, with Mrs. Jack Van Imp.

1184
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,320
Oh, wow.

1185
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,340
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Holm.

1186
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,920
I love it when she jacks my imp.

1187
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,540
Well, the whole family comes out.

1188
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,560
And James Swagger.

1189
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:27,800
James Swagger.

1190
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,840
And sometimes the hill comes down and scrapes the squid.

1191
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,420
And the beauty of the squid.

1192
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,100
Come on, baby Jack Van Imp.

1193
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,360
And I can't really remember the...

1194
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,360
Fallen from the sky.

1195
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,820
And the beauty of the squid.

1196
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,880
Gosh, Uncle Bob.

1197
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,720
Come on, then, new people.

1198
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,500
Get that thing going.

1199
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,980
Hey, Uncle Bob, you know, the creator really, really took his time when he made me, you know.

1200
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,080
Yeah, me too.

1201
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,480
Come on, Uncle Bob.

1202
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,880
Come on, Uncle Bob.

1203
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,300
Let me show you something.

1204
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,860
Sit on my lap, child.

1205
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,580
Sit on my lap, child.

1206
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,740
Come back here, child.

1207
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,820
Yes, lady.

1208
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,160
Sit down.

1209
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,740
Sit down.

1210
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,380
All right.

1211
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:11,440
Here, let me preach to you the Catholic word of the catechism of the special giant rod and staff of...

1212
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,160
Here, if you would just step aside and let me spread my Catholics here.

1213
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,160
Ah, Father Peter Raskin.

1214
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,160
Here into this confessional.

1215
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,740
Father Leo Buse.

1216
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,120
Let me take you, my little...

1217
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,440
Leap in there, Father.

1218
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,560
Father Leo Buse.

1219
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,300
Let them down easy, Father.

1220
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,180
Father Leo Buse.

1221
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,640
As Father Leo Buse sings homespun toilets from the toilet.

1222
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,560
It's...

1223
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:33,820
I'm sorry.

1224
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,520
No, it was the...

1225
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,500
Amen's Room.

1226
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,080
That's right.

1227
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,780
The delightful tales of Amen's Room.

1228
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,440
Delightful tales sung from the...

1229
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,740
Cathedral rectum...

1230
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,420
No, never mind.

1231
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,860
Well, my son, I understand that you don't have a mother at home.

1232
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,960
Let me tell you about the mother of God.

1233
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:54,000
And here's a special statue that I've just unraveled here for my Catholics.

1234
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,380
Now, just bend your head down.

1235
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:57,860
Okay, Father.

1236
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,260
Let me...

1237
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,220
Yes, it's my...

1238
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:00,800
Yes?

1239
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,400
I've bent my head down now, Father.

1240
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,820
Now what?

1241
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,280
Now just pray.

1242
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,520
And you'd better pray, good boy.

1243
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:17,140
This is an old story, isn't it, Father?

1244
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,320
Well, it's as old as the grass dance, the ancient snake dance,

1245
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,760
which is heard in the background as the Lakota...

1246
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,400
Holy men and shaman back at...

1247
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,600
Cart the great buffalo skull around in a great circle around the giant campfire of...

1248
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,820
You broke, Frank.

1249
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,560
Yes, we...

1250
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,400
It was good fire.

1251
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,660
Hey, man, that's probably pretty offensive to our Native American listeners, frankly.

1252
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,960
If you guys can't do a proper grass dance, don't try.

1253
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,420
It's not the real grass dance.

1254
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,940
The real grass dance involves the grabbing of the clumps of grass...

1255
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,000
to remind us that our feet are made of clay,

1256
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,500
and our chickens are twice as golden and rich as all the other competitors.

1257
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,180
Twice as golden and rich as both the competitors.

1258
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,920
It reminds us that we can win if we put our spirits to it and our buttocks down to the wheel.

1259
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:19,180
Put your buttocks down to the wheel and wear Bob's new special deluxe ghost shirt.

1260
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,000
Stop that silly...

1261
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,680
Yes, for only $12.95, you can own a special ghost shirt,

1262
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,500
which will make you impervious to cavalry bullets.

1263
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,360
Or the white man's laws and taxes.

1264
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,760
Yes, the special new subgenius brand ghost shirt.

1265
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:41,100
And now do your 24-hour-a-day special subgenius brand ghost dance,

1266
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:46,900
which will repel all dragons, dinosaurs, and cops.

1267
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,940
Here's the trail of Keeler's golf course.

1268
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,200
Uh, yes. Yes.

1269
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,320
It still makes me cry.

1270
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,920
I could never break it.

1271
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,300
Even their damn mouths was getting in the way.

1272
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,700
One day, I was out late.

1273
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,840
It was near dusk, and I thought I heard a soft footfall.

1274
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,220
It looked like an Indian feller walking by.

1275
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,880
It was the little whiskey fairies.

1276
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,180
No, it wasn't a whiskey fairy.

1277
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,840
It was an Indian.

1278
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,620
It was. It was us, the little whiskey fairies.

1279
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,280
Damn it, it was.

1280
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,300
We were tricking you.

1281
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,300
It is the whiskey fairies.

1282
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,560
We've been around for a long time.

1283
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,180
Very, very long time.

1284
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:26,900
We've been tricking you.

1285
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,320
You and all the other people.

1286
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,100
Geez, I thought you was a big medicine man coming to me in my dreams.

1287
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:33,900
Yeah, me too.

1288
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,000
I was the one who told you to beat your wife.

1289
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,740
It wasn't the medicine man at all.

1290
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,640
I thought I was doing Bob's will.

1291
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,440
Man, this is a nightmare.

1292
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,120
This is a nightmare.

1293
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:45,920
Nope.

1294
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,600
What a nightmare.

1295
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,700
It was us, the whiskey fairies, all along.

1296
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,820
Little whiskey fairies.

1297
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,900
You can smell us in the morning.

1298
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,520
I can smell the honey on your pillow.

1299
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,400
You are my parents.

1300
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,760
You can drink here all night.

1301
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,860
You're so cute.

1302
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,760
We're the ones who invented the DTs.

1303
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,240
I love you.

1304
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,720
Geez, you've got such soft, filmy, gossamer wings.

1305
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:14,240
You ever thought there were little insects and snakes crawling all over your body?

1306
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,600
Yeah, there was, wasn't there?

1307
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,880
It was us, the whiskey fairies.

1308
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,920
It wasn't so bad after all.

1309
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,600
I guess I kind of enjoyed that soft correction.

1310
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,740
In Mexico, they call us tequila fairies.

1311
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,360
Tequila fairies.

1312
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,480
I remember there was a book I never read.

1313
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,720
Tequila Mockingbird by Herman Wook.

1314
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,680
No, that was...

1315
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,080
Now, wait.

1316
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,340
Hey, who are you again?

1317
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,440
Hey, let me have a drink of that.

1318
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:38,200
Give me...

1319
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,760
Just let me have a little drink of that.

1320
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,780
And just like that, we'll disappear and we won't answer any more of your questions.

1321
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,340
No, wait a minute.

1322
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,780
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1323
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,180
Come back.

1324
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:46,900
Come back.

1325
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,960
No, no, no, no, no.

1326
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,600
We're gone.

1327
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,380
What's happened to Dave's mind?

1328
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:56,880
I don't know.

1329
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1330
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1331
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1332
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1333
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1334
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1335
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:56,880


1336
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,920
All these little voices...
