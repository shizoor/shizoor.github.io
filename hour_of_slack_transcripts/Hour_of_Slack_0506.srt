41
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,920
But it's been a real blessing to me because I'm learning how to deal with people, you know,

42
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,560
and telling some of these.

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,080
There's a lot of guys that they were Christians at one time, you know.

44
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,260
Backslidden.

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah, and they slid into this thing of feeling sorry for themselves.

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,140
Hey, you know, listen, you know, Brother Steve.

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
On the road again.

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,420
Cross.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Right.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Hallelujah.

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,020
And it's, you know, it's what they need to hear a lot of times.

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,740
Thank you, Jesus.

53
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,200
You know, and because these guys, you wouldn't believe it.

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,480
These are guys that don't make a great deal of money.

55
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,240
They make okay money.

56
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,240
But all these guys buy more cocaine in a week than Robert Chilton Ministries.

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,580
I mean.

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know about that.

59
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,760
I've never heard about that.

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,220
It's okay.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,880
Well, you know, it's incredible what these guys do.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,500
We don't, when we talk to them, we've learned a lot from listening to Praise in the Nights.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,320
You know.

64
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,940
We don't let them tell these stories, you know, these hard luck stories.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,860
It's like, get to the point.

66
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,420
Tell them what your problem is.

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,080
Shit, let's talk about salvation, you know.

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Right.

69
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,480
And quit moping and meandering around the cross.

70
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,360
Sorry ass, you know, feeling sorry for yourself.

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,280
You need to watch your language.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,380
What did you just say?

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,060
What?

74
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,900
What did you say?

75
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,300
Sorry what?

76
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,940
Oh, I said taking the sorry path of feeling.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,640
Oh, sorry path.

78
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,720
Yeah.

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,220
Oh, good.

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,440
Okay.

81
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,500
Because, you know, they're moping and meandering around the cross.

82
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:47,820
Right.

83
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,300
And, you know, feeling sorry for themselves.

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,160
I say, you know, wake up, Christians.

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,400
The time is short.

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:55,700
Amen.

87
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,360
Treat you.

88
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,100
Get your thumbs out of your ass.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,340
Get, get.

90
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,760
Is that what he said?

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,400
Get that guy off.

92
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,960
There he was.

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,500
Man, I'll tell you.

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,200
Hey, it's radio.

95
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
You know, good spirit, huh?

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,560
Yeah.

97
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:17,940
What's it tonight?

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Is it a full moon or something?

99
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,360
Come on, man.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,080
If you're going to be on radio, use your head.

101
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,360
You can't be full of the Holy Ghost and talk like that on radio or off radio.

102
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,220
Give me a break.

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,160
Use some common sense.

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,640
That's right, friends.

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,960
You got some sense.

106
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,440
Oh, well, I'm sorry about those awkward cuts there.

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:47,140
But, you know, that guy let a bunch of real bad language slip by and didn't didn't even notice until the guy got to the stuff that everybody else doesn't worry about playing anymore.

108
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,600
So, we're going to go ahead and get right to the point.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,620
Oh, my God.

110
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,080
What a world.

111
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,420
Well, that tape was given to us from Brother Russell Ministries.

112
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,140
And, you know, to tell the truth, I probably shouldn't give their address.

113
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,440
He told me to feel free to write for more info or goodies.

114
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,800
It's in that tape trading world.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,600
It's a limbo nightmare world, friends, where a lot of this stuff comes from.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,680
It's the traders of, shall we say, tape.

117
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


120
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


123
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


124
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


126
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


127
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


128
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


129
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,720


130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:28,900
Recordings of sociological experiments, often using the telephone as a medium of experimentation upon the minds of those who listen.

131
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,840
Well, those who out there would be preaching and they preaching good enough.

132
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
Friends, you're going to hear some good preaching tonight.

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,120
I don't know which, but there's always some kind of good preaching on this thing.

134
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,420
In the meantime, let's follow what that fellow suggested.

135
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,540
And, you know, if you're going to be on the radio.

136
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,380
Make some sense, okay?

137
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:09,300
Susie, Susie, Susie, I want you to croak a last few words to the listeners who generally are used to hearing your sparkling laughter and clear, clear, soothing voice.

138
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,660
And instead they get this.

139
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,100
Ah, beauty is only skin deep, but slack goes all the way to the bone.

140
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Ah.

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,120
You...

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,260
I second that.

143
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,760
Please, Bob.

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,960
My comic books, my comic books will testify to that fact.

145
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,060
And now, back to the Betty Boop scandals.

146
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh, no.

147
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,060
Oh, no.

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,720
Oh.

149
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,220
Professor Knutsenbolz is one of the foremost scientists in this country, you screwball.

150
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,480
Oh, what you hit me for, Mo?

151
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,700
Just trying to knock some sense into your head.

152
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


153
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


154
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


155
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


156
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


157
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


159
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


160
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


161
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


162
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


163
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


164
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


165
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700


166
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,700

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
well actually but that does kind of hurt

184
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,320
enclosed you will find a copy of my stupid tape Fruit and Feener I have

185
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,200
sent it to you in the hopes that you will find it entertaining and or useful

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,840
please feel free to give copies of this tape to anyone you think would enjoy it

187
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,620
although I prefer you sent email at abruptly taunting it down

188
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,420
or on the non Cinematography website

189
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,000
an BuyBuyakan

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,420
that's

191
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,220
713-493-3203, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

192
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,720
Well, see?

193
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,960
Now, friends, if you were on the Internet,

194
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,540
you'd already have memorized those ridiculous numbers.

195
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,240
And, well, friends, let's get religious now.

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,200
Let's go to a live subgenius devival,

197
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,880
as it happens, months ago in Cleveland,

198
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
with live on stage in the tent,

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,160
the big tent show that Brother Steve Bevilacqua produced,

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,420
the most recent one.

201
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,220
Oh, this is really distracting sound effect music in the background.

202
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,540
This particular sermon was broadcast about four shows ago,

203
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
but this is different.

204
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,020
This is the live version.

205
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,220
We broadcast a studio version, I believe, back about show 502.

206
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,580
This one here is 505.

207
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,680
I mistakenly called 502 503.

208
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,480
See, now you just got to remember to do HTTP.

209
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,320
It's got the western salami in it.

210
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,480
Yes, it's got your own rich, moist Texas salami in it.

211
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,440
Friends, I have a confession to make.

212
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,240
I, I, well, there aren't many sins in the church of the subgenius,

213
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,760
but I committed one, the stupidest sin of all.

214
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,680
A couple of months ago, I worked too hard on Slack.

215
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Oh, I thought Bob was going to be so proud of me.

216
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,140
Let me tell you what happened.

217
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,940
It was in 1875.

218
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,040
I'd been preaching in a saloon in Kansas City.

219
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,080
Kansas City wasn't a very big town then.

220
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,780
I was crawled out of the saloon, crawled underneath the saloon.

221
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,960
I'd been preaching in the saloon, and I had a bit too much to drink.

222
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,740
I was crawling through the,

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,780
muddy streets of Kansas City.

224
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,500
There was a thunderstorm going on.

225
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,160
The, there were literally rivers of washing through the streets.

226
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,280
They weren't paved back then.

227
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,080
I, I crawled out of that saloon, and who should I see riding by on a great big white horse

228
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:39,640
but J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, wearing a great big old cowboy hat and thick cowboy boots.

229
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm a subgenius preacher.

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,860
I saw my personal story.

231
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,960
I saw my personal savior ride by.

232
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,820
So of course, I had to lick his boots.

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,380
Yes, I saw Bob and I had to lick his boots.

234
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm a preacher.

235
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,900
In fact, I had to kiss his boots.

236
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,880
He, he just, I just ran alongside the horse, licking away on Bob's boots.

237
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,480
I didn't care if he'd been walking through the, through the prairie stepping on buffalo

238
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,740
chips and pasture pastries and meadow muffins.

239
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,840
I didn't care if he'd been walking through the horse awful filled streets.

240
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,600
I didn't care what was on Bob's boot.

241
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,520
But I licked it.

242
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,080
Oh, I worked hard licking Bob's boots.

243
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,100
I licked and kissed and licked and kissed.

244
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
It was disgusting.

245
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,760
Didn't taste real good.

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,260
But you know, when you see Bob's boot cheeks, you gotta kiss them.

247
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,720
And I was thinking, oh, won't Bob be proud of me?

248
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:41,720


249
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,900
Oh, Bob's gonna be so damn proud because I worked so hard for slack.

250
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,400
And friends, my lips got chapped from licking Bob's boots.

251
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,980
They got more chapped than my chaps.

252
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
They were like creaking leather beaks.

253
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,680
I couldn't preach.

254
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,380
I couldn't even smile.

255
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,160
I could, to eat a hamburger, I had to flatten it down and feed it in through the slit.

256
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,220
Oh, Bob.

257
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,800
I had to take saddle soap and rub it all over my mouth in order to loosen up those leathery,

258
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,840
saddle-like lips from kissing Bob's damn boots for too long.

259
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,600
My lips were cracking and bleeding.

260
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,860
And getting that lemon oil and saddle soap out.

261
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,540
I was sick, friends.

262
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,500
I made myself sick working too hard for Bob.

263
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,460
And you know what Bob did?

264
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
He said, thanks for cleaning my boots.

265
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,680
I said, thanks for cleaning my boots, dumbass.

266
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,140
And he left me with the virus and the yeast.

267
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:53,000
But friends, I then learned my lesson.

268
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,140
I knew what to do.

269
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,900
I knew it was time, finally, to truly slack off.

270
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,340
I pulled out my six-gun and I shot Bob Dobbs in the back.

271
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,860
Must have been the right Bob because, you know, he just kept riding on.

272
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,640
But I slacked off.

273
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
And that crust on my lips, that's what I called it.

274
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


275
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


277
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


278
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


279
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


281
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


282
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


283
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


284
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,680


285
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,640
And I slacked off.

286
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,900
And that's why I'm here to preach to you tonight.

287
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,940
And this is where I started talking about the bats and it got a little bit too, well,

288
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,340
just a bit too raunchy.

289
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,380
I had truly learned my lesson.

290
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,780
No more would I work too hard for slack.

291
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,200
In fact, I'm tired of doing this right now.

292
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,920
Maybe I ought to just quit.

293
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,360
I think I'm done.

294
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm done.

295
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm done.

296
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
I'm done.

297
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm done.

298
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:40,560


299
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:40,860


300
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:40,860


301
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,300


302
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm done.

303
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,640


304
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,640


305
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,640


306
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:41,640


307
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,740
Let's enjoy the night together.

308
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,220
In the thicketened darkness I'll sit in a tower of red

309
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,360
I next time I'm gonna bring a Saint personal avatar

310
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,060
In line with an all white bunny

311
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,440
Pop out of Las Vegas, all will bleed on the ground

312
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:08,940
for no one who's home bought my ticket.

313
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,620
let's go out to Hollywood with Bob do what I tell you d'ya colorful thing.

314
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,560
Dumb cowboy, and I know what done wrong.

315
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,640
That song always makes me cry.

316
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Of course, Eddie Arnold did it better, but it still makes me cry.

317
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,880
It's so sad.

318
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,060
I'll go outside every while.

319
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,600
We've only got half an hour left.

320
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,820
We've got to have Circus Apocalypse.

321
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,300
We've got to have the head launch.

322
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,880
The head launch.

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,840
The head launch.

324
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,980
And we've got to have...

325
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,260
I've got to get this news around my neck.

326
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,760
And the testimonials.

327
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,000
And since Melody's talking.

328
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,980
String him up!

329
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,940
String him up!

330
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,680
God damn it, idiot.

331
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,800
Can't even tie a hangman's knot.

332
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,600
Take that.

333
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,320
Take another pill.

334
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,700
I can't even.

335
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,880
Take another pill.

336
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,660
Well, they're going to do this song about pills.

337
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,680
This has got to be the most pill-soaked revival ever.

338
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,220
People are going to leave this revival going,

339
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,040
well, I thought they were going to be preaching about how evil the conspiracy is,

340
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,260
but all they did was talk about pills.

341
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,540
Take another pill.

342
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,660
Take another pill.

343
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
How many words can you think of that rhyme with pill?

344
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,920
Take another pill.

345
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,940
It'll cure every ill.

346
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,880
Take another pill.

347
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,560
Your brain will become nil.

348
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,240
Take another pill.

349
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,400
It will make you want to kill.

350
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,500
Take another pill.

351
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,800
Leave it on the windowsill.

352
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,820
Take another pill.

353
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,160
Put your mind through rototill.

354
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,220
Take another pill.

355
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
Just throw it on the grill.

356
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,400
Take another pill.

357
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,740
Fall down like Jack and Jill.

358
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,600
Take another pill.

359
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,640
Take another pill.

360
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,960
The vomit will start to spill.

361
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,980
Take another pill.

362
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,700
Hey, bungalow bill.

363
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,120
Just take another pill.

364
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,880
Brew it up in your still.

365
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,460
Take another pill.

366
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,480
This is not a drill.

367
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,700
Take another pill.

368
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,700
It will make you feel evil.

369
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,980
Take another pill.

370
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,340
You won't be happy until.

371
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,300
Take another pill.

372
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,380
And come back for a refill.

373
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,600
Take another pill.

374
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,280
To do otherwise is unacceptable.

375
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,820
Take another pill.

376
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,660
To do otherwise would be impossible.

377
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,200
Take another pill.

378
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
Pickled like a dill.

379
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,380
Take another pill.

380
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,520
You'll feel like roadkill.

381
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,720
Take another pill.

382
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,680
Yo, yo, chill.

383
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,940
Take another pill.

384
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,220
Walk through the daffodils.

385
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,300
Take another pill.

386
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,360
You'll be sprouting kills.

387
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,620
Take another pill.

388
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,500
It's such a thrill.

389
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,760
Take another pill.

390
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,300
If you've been through the mill.

391
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,060
Take another pill.

392
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,880
You'll end up on boot hill.

393
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,360
Take another pill.

394
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Whales take them with their krill.

395
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,160
Take another pill.

396
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,920
And I can't think of any more.

397
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,860
Take another pill.

398
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,180
That's the end of it.

399
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,120
I'm on leave.

400
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,020
Take another pill.

401
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,700
I took some.

402
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
I took so many pills.

403
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,340
I...

404
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,060
This nun suit is...

405
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,700
It's tight.

406
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,780
It's gripping my...

407
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,380
All these panties don't fit.

408
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,640
I...

409
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,300
Wait a minute.

410
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,840
I shouldn't even wear it.

411
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,640
Take another pill.

412
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,640
Slack can only be sold.

413
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,620
Take another pill.

414
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,700
It cannot be bought.

415
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,160
Take another pill.

416
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,160
Take another pill.

417
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,340
Take another pill.

418
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,280
Hey, can you guys do golfing music?

419
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,900
Yes.

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,500
Take another pill.

421
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,980
Because we got us a head to launch.

422
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,580
Yeah!

423
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,740
Take another pill.

424
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,340
Are you ready?

425
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,600
There's many golfer heads out there.

426
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,580
There's people that like to launch the lips of Lee Trevino.

427
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,260
Oh, yeah.

428
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,620
There's those out there who would put a rocket up

429
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,540
and launch into outer space the feet of Sam Snead.

430
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,360
Oh, yeah.

431
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,560
Jack Nicklaus tongues have been launched in our public school.

432
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,560


433
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,780
School system, damn it.

434
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,280
Thanks to the Trevinas.

435
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:55,380
But when was the last time you gazed bare eyeballed upon the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

436
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,280
Ah!

437
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,880
The head!

438
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,160
The head!

439
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,100
Why?

440
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,560
Why?

441
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,940
Why?

442
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,840
The head asked why.

443
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,060
Notice.

444
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,200
Notice this neck stump.

445
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,580
Notice this wound on the forehead.

446
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,240
They didn't just cut his head off, man.

447
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,860
I don't know what they did to him.

448
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,520
They didn't just cut his head off.

449
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,400
Where's the sacred tea?

450
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,640
Where's the holy nine iron?

451
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,860
There is no sacred tea.

452
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,900
There is no holy nine iron.

453
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,040
God damn it.

454
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,280
We're just going to have to launch it without.

455
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,540
We're going to have to boot the damn head.

456
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Yep, we're going to have to launch the head by foot.

457
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,760
All right.

458
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,560
It's a beautiful ceremony, friends.

459
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,300
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

460
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,620
In the name of Arnold Palmer himself.

461
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,200
The true bleeding head.

462
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,640
In the name of Flo Tan.

463
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,160
In the name of Brandon Stimpy.

464
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,680
In the name of Jimi Hendrix.

465
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,840
I can't do it.

466
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,300
I can't.

467
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Oh.

468
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,340
Watch that head, friends.

469
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,980
Okay, launch it back this way.

470
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,180
Launch that head back this way, friends.

471
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,760
That's a $500 head.

472
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,420
Oh.

473
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
It bounced.

474
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,820
And his eyes are still intact.

475
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,860
Oh.

476
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,760
Oh.

477
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,220
Oh.

478
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,720
Oh.

479
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:00,920
Oh.

480
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,320
Excuse me.

481
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


482
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


483
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


484
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


485
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


486
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


487
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


488
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


489
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


490
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


491
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


492
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,320


493
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,640
Excuse me, friends.

494
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,540
I've seen so many head launchings.

495
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,820
That was a nice head launching.

496
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:13,840
And we did get the, you know, of course, when you hear me doing a head launching, friends,

497
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,220
we're probably using the replica head.

498
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,820
It's pretty realistic.

499
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,760
And a lot of people probably don't know the difference.

500
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,560
And, you know, it's like faith healing.

501
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,400
It still works.

502
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,280
Now, on the other hand, when you see Pope Sternodoc's keycaver,

503
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,700
or St. Jane or hyperclites launching that head,

504
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:40,100
you better not let any of that blood drip on you, my man, my sir ma'am, my woman.

505
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,520
The universe would have ended instantly.

506
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,560
Because it's just not, the time is not yet nigh for their arisal.

507
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,600
But I'm going to preach.

508
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,740
What we're really doing here, friends, is fighting a war.

509
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,500
This is a war.

510
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,540
Believe it or not, not very good soldiers,

511
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,260
but, you know,

512
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:06,000
the conspiracy has something like 50,000 nuclear weapons.

513
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,480
The Church of the Subgenius only has three.

514
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,200
And yet we dare to fight them anyway.

515
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,080
Because it's always been, it's always been the crazy people,

516
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
the maniacs, who are the only ones dumb enough to fight City Hall.

517
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
And one of these days we're going to win.

518
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,640
But it is a war, friends.

519
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,260
It's a war of the mind.

520
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,560
It's a war of the humans versus the subgeniuses.

521
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,440
It's us versus them.

522
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,480
Don't you just hate them?

523
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,840
And the great thing about this church is,

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,040
them is anybody you don't like.

525
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,960
Praise Bob.

526
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,080
The subgeniuses versus the humans.

527
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,520
And you know the ironic thing is,

528
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,420
we're the ones who designed the humans 80,000 years ago in Mutantis.

529
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,040
Our worst mistake, dear friends, a dreadful mistake.

530
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,100
Because you gaze out, go outside, go to your job,

531
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,300
go look around this room, you'll see the humans,

532
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
the normals, the mediocritons, the pink boys,

533
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,160
the Barbies and Kens, the cage dwellers.

534
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,820
We've got more nasty words for them than they even have for us.

535
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,400
Because we're the humans.

536
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,680
Because the problem is pinkness equals boredom.

537
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,200
The pink is afraid of that which is different.

538
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,460
They are what you might call xenophobes.

539
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,120
The subgenius is what you would call a xenophile.

540
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,040
We get off on things that are different.

541
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,020
We don't necessarily like them,

542
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,340
but when we first see them, we go,

543
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,040
Shit, that's weird as hell. That's disgusting.

544
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,680
Tell me more.

545
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,420
The pink will say, string them up.

546
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,060
We wait and then say, string them up.

547
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,360
But friends, it is a religion.

548
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,300
Among other things, sure, it's a big stupid art project,

549
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,480
an excuse for disgusting no good, good for nothings,

550
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,660
like these guys to get up and jam.

551
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,100
But it is a religion, friends.

552
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,120
It's a living, bleeding religion for today.

553
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,340
It's not one of these old-fashioned religions

554
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,380
for some guy who's been dead for a long time.

555
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
He's been dead for ten years.

556
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,840
He hasn't answered his message machine in 2,000 years.

557
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,080
And when we talk about the conspiracy,

558
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,820
oh yeah, that's a big joke, they're thinking,

559
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,100
yeah, they're making fun of those conspiracy kooks.

560
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,340
We're talking about the conspiracy that is so f***ing dumb

561
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,860
that it doesn't even know that it is a conspiracy.

562
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,660
They do not even know how bad they def***** over themselves,

563
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,640
and much worse, us.

564
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,240
Pinks, friends.

565
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,740
The conspiracy is a lot bigger than Republicans versus Democrats,

566
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,240
or Communists versus Capitalists.

567
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,540
The conspiracy is nothing but an attitude of distrust.

568
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,980
They distrust anything they don't understand,

569
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,800
and they don't understand much at all.

570
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,140
Yeah, the conspiracy, it's a real big joke.

571
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,380
About as funny as the headlines in today's press conference.

572
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,380


573
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,440
It's paper, don't you think?

574
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,960
Yep, it's not a clever conspiracy.

575
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,420
It doesn't even know it's a damn conspiracy.

576
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,120
It's a confederacy of dunces.

577
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,180
The pinks are literally stereotypes of themselves.

578
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,540
Mindless bovine stereotypes, like a herd of cows,

579
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,120
and yet, they could destroy the world.

580
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,060
In fact, they may already have.

581
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,840
We're gonna destroy the world too,

582
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,720
but we want to make sure the end of the world happens properly.

583
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,480
False prophets, dear friends.

584
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,700
False prophets surround us.

585
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,580
And the worst thing about them is,

586
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,840
they call us wolves in sheep's clothing.

587
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,900
I'd sure rather be a wolf in sheep's clothing

588
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,380
than sheep in wolves' clothing.

589
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,500
Which is what we're dealing with.

590
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,740
Now you may notice that things seem to be getting a little worse these days.

591
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,700
Everybody's got cancer.

592
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,040
You get a new disease every time you screw somebody.

593
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,220
There's poisons in the air.

594
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,780
The weather's kind of funny lately.

595
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,840
And the world is horribly overpopulated,

596
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,920
and so forth and so on.

597
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,800
You think about how bad it is now.

598
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,740
Think about what they're not telling you about.

599
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,920
Well, they've got all kinds of tricks up their sleeves.

600
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,960
And they call the Church of the Subgenius some kind of a cult.

601
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,660
Oh yeah, a cult.

602
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:04,060
I don't know, it seems like if the United States can get millions of people

603
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,800
to bury toxic waste in their own backyards,

604
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,640
how is that any different from Jim Jones getting 900 people to commit suicide?

605
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,080
America is a cult these days.

606
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,880
Praise Rush Limbaugh.

607
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,500
The ATF is a cult, for that matter.

608
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,200
The ax khaki, nothing but axes against the clock.

609
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,140
хрю xemерBC

610
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,140


611
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,240
What has you done?

612
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,520
I think there's some bad coisaе So why would you leave the living person

613
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,140
hanging?

614
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,520
Because they buried it.

615
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:45,520


616
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:45,520


617
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,120
They don't have a life here today.

618
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,120


619
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,780
Sometimes an actor upon a forever lie

620
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:53,100
can enter a tent Boules Malaysian

621
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,520
and they can transformer it.

622
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,560
to an empty house.

623
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,340
Bob never said, Bob's no communist.

624
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,920
He doesn't want everybody equally poor.

625
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,840
Bob Dobbs wants everybody equally rich,

626
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,140
but without working.

627
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,460
Without working, dear friend.

628
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
Oh, but you say, oh, I don't work,

629
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,260
but that's all, I don't work for the conspiracy.

630
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,160
I'm a freelancer, I sell art, I'm in a band.

631
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,240
The conspiracy can't get me.

632
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,400
Oh, no, I don't work for the conspiracy.

633
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,200
You are, everybody works for the conspiracy.

634
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,380
They've got you by the balls or the ovaries.

635
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,000
All the time, and all the, right now,

636
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,580
they're probably just kind of tickling.

637
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,600
They've got you on a leash,

638
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,060
and they'll let you run pretty far on that leash.

639
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,740
But when they decide you've run far enough,

640
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,620
when you've got a real good head of steam up,

641
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,840
you're trotting along going,

642
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
man, I guess I'm free of the conspiracy.

643
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,840
Wow!

644
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,060
They yank that leash back,

645
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,220
and you never get back.

646
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,540
Never forget.

647
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,480
Never forget again, friends.

648
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,360
You may forget the conspiracy for a minute,

649
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,340
but they'll never forget you.

650
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,000
They hate you worse than you hate them,

651
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,180
and they don't even know you.

652
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,840
As Bob Dobbs said,

653
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,160
act like a dumb shit.

654
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,660
Act like a dumb shit,

655
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,840
and they will treat you as an equal.

656
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,560
Truer and sadder words were never spoken, dear friend.

657
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Wow.

658
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Man, what a devival.

659
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,240
Well, that left me feeling pretty devived,

660
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,140
I'll tell you, friends.

661
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,340
But actually, it is such a joy to work with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

662
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,320
I don't know what it is.

663
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,660
I just love doing stuff with those guys.

664
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,500
They're in Cleveland,

665
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,120
and they're on WCSB there in Cleveland every Thursday,

666
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,220
what is it, Thursday nights at 10?

667
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,440
10 o'clock or 11?

668
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,360
I never can remember.

669
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,460
I know we go from about 11.30 to 1,

670
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,800
and it always supplies me with an hour of slack material.

671
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,300
It's just such a joy to not have to do it by myself sometimes, you know?

672
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,180
And now, as we come down near the end of side one

673
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,220
of this hideous radio show,

674
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,460
we wonder what will be next.

675
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,460
Well, I'm wondering what's going to be next.

676
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,880
But as I've said before, by the time,

677
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,060
well, actually, by the time you hear this,

678
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
I may be back from the GWAR tour.

679
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Let's flip this show over and see what I'm going to have to listen to

680
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,280
nine nights in a row,

681
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,060
starting next week for me.

682
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,780
Who dies?

683
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,180
What a chance!

684
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
Who stands?

685
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:52,960


686
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,360
Ha ha ha ha!

687
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,400
That's the rub!

688
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,440
For in that sleep of sin,

689
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,260
what kingdom may come?

690
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,520
What of the limitless sex and violence

691
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,980
in the wake of Ragnarok?

692
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,220
Welcome to the slaughter!

693
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,580
What are you going to do?

694
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,280
What will be your epitaph?

695
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,520
When we get done with you,

696
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
are you going to cry for your mama?

697
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Or are you going to have a good time?

698
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,280
Are you going to be a boheme?

699
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,460
When did you return to die?

700
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,040
Don't get crazy, crazy!

701
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Let them all around!

702
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,060
Parakeet!

703
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,640
They are through the streets!

704
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,820
It's a Ragnarok project!

705
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,360
What is wrong?

706
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,840
You're painting, you're turning, you're burning,

707
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,460
you're sanitizing, you're white-eyed.

708
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,480
The final hour's here, no rap, you're from a villa,

709
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,500
you're out in game for one damn night.

710
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,460
The woman gets a job, but you're gonna have some fun.

711
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
Nothing else to do, you're praying for another day.

712
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,580
The only dirty twin is that mind,

713
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,600
you're all sitting, sitting feels so fine.

714
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,300
You're running for no time!

715
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,420
Action to action!

716
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,120
Yeah!

717
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,520
It's always one hell of a party

718
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,920
When Ragnarok throws a crowd

719
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!

720
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,100
It's time to trash the party

721
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,340
Ragnarok and man, no crowd

722
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,980
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!

723
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,120
Welcome to Valhalla!

724
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,340
Do not be afraid!

725
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,120
Now you are a zombie!

726
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,520
Have all your friends been dead!

727
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,000
It all gets rarer than hockey!

728
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,180
When you get backstage,

729
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,300
everybody gets a grounder!

730
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,340
I hope you're underrated!

731
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,920
When the trouble of me offends me

732
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,300
Body out the edge of war, but I won't come down!

733
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,140
Looking for a lover, no need to worry

734
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,660
I'll have a Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!

735
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,340
Come on, find somebody and get to the very bloody!

736
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,940
Never falling, feeding, never joking

737
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,360
Choking, never joking, laughing, never loaded

738
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
You know there's a lot of fun!

739
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,560
Ragnar, you're running out of time!

740
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,880
Dust to dust!

741
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,200
Stare, but there's no way out!

742
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,840
Oh-oh-oh!

743
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,580
Oh-oh-oh!

744
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,280
Ain't going one hell of a party

745
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,680
When Ragnarok rolls around

746
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,420
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!

747
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,360
It's time to smash the planet here

748
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
Ragnarok and man, no crowd

749
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,820
Ragnarok-a-ro, Ragnarok-a-ro!

750
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,040
That's the plan, yeah!

751
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,920
It's always one hell of a party when Ragnarok rolls around.

752
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,340
Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls.

753
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,020
Go out and chat your city, it's Ragnarok battleground.

754
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,160
Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls, Ragnarok rolls.

755
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,240
Ragnarok rolls.

756
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,580
And she's buying the stairway to heaven.

757
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:03,520
Oh man, I'm going to be spending nine or ten, no, something like eleven days in a bus with those guys.

758
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,980
And do you know what those guys look like? Do you know what that group GWAR looks like?

759
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,220
The lead singer, Odorus Urungus, looks like he's got...

760
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,780
maggots crawling out of his face, which isn't even much of a face at all.

761
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:32,180
It's like a destroyed skull, maggot, demon, bottle of rum, CD, real dead, purple skull cow.

762
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,540
Oh man.

763
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,040
Yeah, I've been hanging around with doctors for Bob for all these years now.

764
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,180
It's the GWAR universe.

765
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,680
We will destroy you humans.

766
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,280
You all humans must crawl beneath the grate.

767
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,160
The might of GWAR and Bob as he comes to rip your face off.

768
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:02,060
Actually, I think this show may feature such scenes as Slydenstra Hymen gets impregnated by some...

769
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,460
Well, these aliens, these aliens abduct Odorus, I think, and...

770
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,220
They extract some sperm from...

771
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:18,700
Odorus Urungus and it accidentally gets Slydenstra Hymen pregnant.

772
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,500
They crucify her and give her an abortion while she's being...

773
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,020
crucified.

774
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,320
But the baby escapes and falls in with the aliens and then God arrives.

775
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,840
But it turns out God's nothing but a big robot.

776
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh, I don't want to give away the whole plot.

777
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,860
Anyway, the way they put it to me over the phone, they go,

778
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,720
What our show's work is every three songs...

779
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,940
No, he said every two songs we kill or rape somebody.

780
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,320
Yeah, man, those guys, they have their own special version of slack.

781
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,120
But you know their message is the same.

782
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,480
It's a message of hate.

783
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,120
It's just like the message of this church.

784
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,780
A message of hate and agony for our enemies.

785
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,760
And pure degeneracy.

786
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,220
And...

787
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,640
Wallowing in slack for ourselves.

788
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
Praise Bob.

789
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,680
And I was going to shut up and make this be a music show because you all have already heard me ranting enough.

790
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,640
And what do we have coming up next here?

791
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,360
It's music by your fellow subgeniuses.

792
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,880
Let's pull this little wellman head through here.

793
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,240
This is Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.

794
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,860
And here we go.

795
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,540
This ought to be pertinent.

796
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,460
This ought to be pertinent.

797
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,380
This ought to be pertinent.

798
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:28,060
This ought to pertinent.

799
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,520
Let's get this 승å Gulfwизern.

800
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


801
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


802
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


803
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


804
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


805
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


806
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:33,560


807
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:40,320
No really.

808
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,200


809
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,600
music will set me free.

810
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,980
I'm gonna have a big house

811
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,080
and two cars. I'll have more

812
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,580
money than I can spend.

813
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,940
Because I'm gonna be rich

814
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,320
and famous, yes sir.

815
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,080
And then I can buy some friends. And then I can

816
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
buy some friends. And then I can buy some

817
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,440
friends.

818
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,080
Being famous really knocks me

819
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,980
out. It's not so fun

820
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,500
you know.

821
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,980
And my fame will make it to the

822
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,740
top if we ever do the

823
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,560
lock and load.

824
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,880
Yeah baby,

825
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,540
that's the way.

826
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,520
You got the room,

827
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,120
you got the room.

828
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,580
That's right.

829
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,560
We're so cool.

830
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,340
I think I'm gonna choke on the old

831
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,820
vomit.

832
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,600
I'll be so famous.

833
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,100
I'll have some cash.

834
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,760
Famous.

835
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,080
I can buy me some cash.

836
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,180
Famous.

837
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,700
Famous.

838
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,280
I can buy me a car.

839
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,380
So famous.

840
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,100
It'll be so bizarre.

841
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,740
Now people don't even know me

842
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,260
because I'm nobody now you see.

843
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,780
But one day people are gonna

844
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,180
know me because my music

845
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,360
will set me free.

846
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm gonna have a big house

847
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,820
and two cars. I'll have more

848
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,340
money than I can spend.

849
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,640
Because I'm gonna be rich

850
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
and famous.

851
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,180
And then I can buy me a car.

852
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,200
And then I can buy some friends.

853
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,700
And then I can buy some friends.

854
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,260
And then I can buy some friends.

855
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,900
And then I can buy some friends.

856
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,020
Oh Lord, thank you for your baptism of fire.

857
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,940
I'll tell you what, the fire of the Holy Ghost falls on you.

858
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,460
Something's gonna happen.

859
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,580
Some will cry out.

860
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,700
Some will laugh.

861
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,920
Some will just weep.

862
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,280
Some will swoon.

863
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
Peter said these aren't drunk as you suppose.

864
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,760
Why would Peter say these aren't drunk as you suppose?

865
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,920
Do they look like they were drunk maybe?

866
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:37,880
Possibly.

867
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:38,860
Possibly?

868
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,160
I'd say more than that.

869
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,640
More than possible.

870
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,800
They accuse him of being drunk.

871
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,680
These are drunk.

872
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,580
He said no, no, no, no, no.

873
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,300
Not the way you think.

874
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,200
This is something entirely different.

875
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,480
Just say Jesus.

876
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,740
Just say Jesus.

877
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:52,740


878
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,680
I want it all.

879
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,440
I want it all.

880
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,320
Lord, fill her right now.

881
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:55,720
Fill.

882
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,600
Just fill her Lord.

883
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,880
Say Jesus, I lift my cup.

884
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,260
Say Jesus, I lift my cup.

885
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,740
Fill it up.

886
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,500
Fill it up.

887
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:02,900
Fill it up.

888
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,080
Uh huh.

889
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,760
Uh huh.

890
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,400
No hope.

891
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,000
No hope.

892
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,780
Hee hee.

893
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,200
Hee hee.

894
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,260
No hope.

895
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,220
No hope.

896
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,680
No hope.

897
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:11,680


898
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,160
Thank you, Jesus.

899
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,580
Uh huh.

900
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,800
Uh huh.

901
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:13,980
Uh huh.

902
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,300
No hope.

903
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,900
No hope.

904
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,020
No hope.

905
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:15,240
Hee hee.

906
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:15,460
More.

907
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,080
Hee hee.

908
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,560
More.

909
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,080
More.

910
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:17,640
More.

911
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,120
More.

912
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,160
More.

913
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,400
More.

914
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:18,420
More.

915
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,240
I guess we're in the wrong religion, friends.

916
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,520
These guys are having so much more fun, I can't believe it.

917
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,240
Have another drink, look.

918
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,160
Thank you.

919
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,400
Thank me, thank him.

920
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,540
Thank you, Jesus.

921
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,800
Jesus said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.

922
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,960
That was awesome.

923
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:32,520
Fill.

924
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,400
Something's happening up there.

925
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,920
Something's happening over there.

926
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,660
I believe the Lord's just going to pour out just abundance of joy tonight.

927
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,580
Be back in a few moments.

928
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,300
Don't go away.

929
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,700
That's no way to talk.

930
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
Don't ask me to speak a word.

931
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,320
I'm fed up with all your bullshit.

932
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,260
Soon I'll go away.

933
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,080
But you'll find another victim.

934
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,900
You'll find another victim.

935
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
You say that I'm paranoid.

936
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,080
It makes sense.

937
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,260
You think you're blameless.

938
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,120
You just write me off.

939
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:36,880
Jack.

940
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,680
And go on with your business.

941
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,520
And go on with your business.

942
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,540
Don't act like you're on my side.

943
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:51,460
When you like me for one reason.

944
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,260
You don't have a clue to what in the hell I'm after.

945
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,060
What in the hell I'm after.

946
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,700
What the f*** are you looking at?

947
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,480
You're not.

948
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,660
One day I'm gonna pick up my guitar.

949
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,180
And play it for myself.

950
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,160
And no one else.

951
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,860
No more freebies.

952
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,380
And if I can't pay my bills.

953
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,060
I'll never whiz the will of the people.

954
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,660
It's not that I haven't tried.

955
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,420
But there's a limit to my patience.

956
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,300
Bet your ass.

957
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,220
You can't win.

958
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,980
You can't stand your money on bullshit.

959
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,100
Reward the mean if you please.

960
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,920
Who are just in it for the bucks.

961
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,060
A pack of opportunists.

962
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,620
Who get stronger as they make you.

963
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,940
They lie to you when you believe them.

964
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,200
Just like they got you a new tip.

965
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,040
Their music is all the same.

966
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,900
They can barely write their own name.

967
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,120
By supporting him.

968
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,220
What does that make you?

969
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,860
By giving money to a stranger.

970
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,760
While neglecting the needs of your own.

971
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,300
Harvest what you can and what remains.

972
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,080
Because tomorrow you'll be empty and alone.

973
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,740
I feel like I'm doing this for nothing.

974
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,440
Don't have a house.

975
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,560
Can't pay the rent.

976
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,140
While you go to shows by those who didn't give a shit.

977
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,540
The whole affair's an embarrassment.

978
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,200
I'm not a fool.

979
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


980
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


981
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


982
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


983
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


984
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


985
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


986
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


987
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


988
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


989
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


990
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


991
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


992
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,200


993
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,400
Bet your ass.

994
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:35,960
You can't win.

995
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,300
You can't stand your money on bullshit.

996
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,740
What goes around comes around.

997
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,660
And sucks it up.

998
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,940
The thing is when to vote probably remains planned.

999
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,120
Essa Andrea perdido tu� esta que es.

1000
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,580
The family spray with their face for Captain America.

1001
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,520
Is that where all of that else parties from highways go?

1002
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:51,520


1003
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:51,520


1004
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,140
� equiv составidade.

1005
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,900
Cada qu om whether good or bad.

1006
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,800
Or whether I'm a troublemaker.

1007
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,720
guitar solo

1008
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,780
guitar solo

1009
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,780
guitar solo

1010
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,760
guitar solo

1011
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,260
guitar solo

1012
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,660
guitar solo

1013
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,980
guitar solo

1014
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
guitar solo

1015
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,180
guitar solo

1016
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,820
guitar solo

1017
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,040
guitar solo

1018
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,420
guitar solo

1019
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,020
guitar solo

1020
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,720
guitar solo

1021
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
guitar solo

1022
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,440
guitar solo

1023
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,640
guitar solo

1024
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1025
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,760
Thank you, Lord, for your touch.

1026
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,720
Until the day I have declined.

1027
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:45,900
David.

1028
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,120
We've got these little machines that tell us phone numbers when people call in now.

1029
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,300
You've got the caller ID stuff.

1030
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,180
So we can find out what phone number you call from.

1031
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,400
And if you're going to act in such a way.

1032
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,020
I mean, just not right.

1033
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,540
Well, matter of fact, even worse than that.

1034
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,400
Jesus says this.

1035
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,900
I say unto you, Matthew 12, 36, that every idle word that men shall speak,

1036
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,740
they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment.

1037
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,920
For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.

1038
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,360
So if you say, oh, my back's all messed up now,

1039
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,760
don't be surprised if that thing or something similar or worse really comes upon you.

1040
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,360
So don't play around with the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

1041
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,420
Don't think you're going to get by with anything.

1042
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,640
You get nothing better to do than sit around.

1043
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,100
And play on the telephone.

1044
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,240
You see, you'll have to answer to God for that.

1045
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,360
It's a serious thing to be involved in.

1046
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,200
This is not a game.

1047
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,620
It's not a show.

1048
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,420
This is kingdom of God business.

1049
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,620
This is kingdom of God business.

1050
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,460
Well, I used to be a sinner.

1051
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:07,660
Because I truly did believe that the Virgin Mary, Jesus, and me were thick-ass thieves.

1052
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,800
And I used to give my dough to tell evangelistic snobs.

1053
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,460
Then the light had shone upon me, and I found J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1054
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,340
Now my wallet belongs to Bob.

1055
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,300
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

1056
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,800
Well, my heart is for my honey.

1057
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,400
My brain is for my job.

1058
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,660
But my wallet belongs to Bob.

1059
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,160
Well, Bobby goes a-fropping every chance that he can get.

1060
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,980
He can outperform the biggest without even breaking sweat.

1061
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,520
So I gave him all my money.

1062
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,920
Reverend Stang said it was right.

1063
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,340
And for only...

1064
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,240
Twenty dollars.

1065
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,680
He did save my soul tonight.

1066
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,640
And so my wallet belongs to Bob.

1067
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,620
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

1068
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:18,520
No more can the conspiracy my lowly wages rob.

1069
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,120
Because my wallet belongs to Bob.

1070
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,680
Well, Bobby's got his sweetie and Connie is her name.

1071
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,560
And her ways could put the sacred whore of Babylon to shame.

1072
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,340
She reaches in Bob's pocket, feels around for something hard.

1073
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,080
And pulls her hand out holding on to his mighty credit card.

1074
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,020
So my wallet belongs to Bob.

1075
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,940
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

1076
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,440
Yes, my wallet belongs to Bob.

1077
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,300
And I never have to fear.

1078
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,860
Because I know Connie's on the job.

1079
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,200
Because my wallet belongs to Bob.

1080
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,720
Well, you may have your lady and your horny green man too.

1081
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,520
Their existential energy may be what's right for you.

1082
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,420
But someday you'll grow weary of those pagan egos.

1083
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:30,420


1084
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:30,420


1085
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:30,420


1086
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,400
And you'll be a mystic cult.

1087
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,020
And give away your money to the one that gets results.

1088
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,000
And then your wallet will be for Bob.

1089
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,180
Yes, your wallet will be for Bob.

1090
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:51,220
And you will be subgenius, not another stupid slob.

1091
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,220
Because your wallet will be for Bob.

1092
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,920
Well, I believe I am much calmer.

1093
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,380
Got the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1094
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,460
Sitting on the dashboard of my car.

1095
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,540
Praise Bob.

1096
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,880
Praise Bob.

1097
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,800
Praise Bob.

1098
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:29,820


1099
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,400
Praise Bob.

1100
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,920
Praise Bob.

1101
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,340
Praise Bob.

1102
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,340


1103
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,360
Praise Bob.

1104
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:34,980
Praise Bob.

1105
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:34,980


1106
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,360
Praise Bob.

1107
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:36,820
Praise Bob.

1108
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,780
Praise Bob.

1109
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:37,780


1110
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,040
Praise Bob.

1111
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,140
Praise Bob.

1112
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,140


1113
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,140


1114
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,140


1115
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,820
No, ladies.

1116
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,980
Sister Melodious Chops, dear friend.

1117
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:46,300
Available on the wonderful subgenius type, hairs in Bob's ears.

1118
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,640
Oh yes, dear friend.

1119
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:55,480
Sister Melodious Chops there with Princess Wee Ardo backing her up at the latest Cleveland

1120
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,440
D-Vival back in July, I guess it was.

1121
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,380
And old woman.

1122
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,160
It was a beautiful revival.

1123
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,340
One of Steve Bevilacqua's jobbies.

1124
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,360
I'm going to be at one in three days.

1125
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,380
No, two days.

1126
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,440
In two days, I'll be at another one.

1127
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,520
Only it's the wake of Dr. Legume.

1128
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,640
Friends, I've done four hours of slack in one day.

1129
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,960
You can probably hear it in my voice.

1130
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,840
That one's a song.

1131
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,440
A good Jimmy Ryan song.

1132
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,720
But there ain't time for that right now.

1133
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,780
Now, I know what there's time for.

1134
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:35,720
There's always, there's always time, dear friends,

1135
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,280
to give out the subgenius post office box number,

1136
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,840
which is, of course,

1137
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,500
a post office box.

1138
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,960
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1139
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,320
In lovely Dallas, Texas.

1140
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,100
That's right.

1141
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,340
Box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1142
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,320
Dallas, Texas.

1143
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,000
7-5-2-1-4.

1144
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,220
That's where you write to to get to Bob,

1145
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,060
get free information about the church and the subgenius.

1146
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,220
Uh, just, uh, just, uh, you do have to put a stamp on it,

1147
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,640
but it helps if you hold it against your lap and think Dallas.

1148
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,940
And just address that to Bob, P.O. Box, 1-4-0-3-0-6.

1149
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,000
Dallas, Texas.

1150
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,400
7-5-2-1-4.

1151
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,580
And Bob's your uncle, my friend.

1152
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,160
Yes, Bob is your big brother.

1153
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,260
Your big old brother.

1154
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,720
Our children, it's time for recess.

1155
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,940
Please roll up your sleeves.

1156
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,160
More toe-frop-houser there, friend.

1157
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,040
Whoa, it's still rolling.

1158
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:02,940
...

1159
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:02,940


1160
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,560
...

1161
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,560
...

1162
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,840
...

1163
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,760
...

1164
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:17,760


1165
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:17,760


1166
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:17,760


1167
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,380
Now, if it's just a show, just show business, that's one thing.

1168
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,720
But if it's a Holy Ghost, and you mess around with the Holy Ghost,

1169
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,240
and mess around with God and his people,

1170
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:13,100
I'll tell you what, you'll be, um, it's not a pleasant situation to be in.

1171
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,840
I pray maybe God would give you repentance

1172
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,140
unto the acknowledgement of the truth.

1173
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,620
Perhaps God would.

1174
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,200
Maybe he won't.

1175
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,440
It's up to God.

1176
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:26,540
Hallelujah.

1177
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,400
Hallelujah.

1178
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,100
I want a woman.

1179
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,140
I want a woman.

1180
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,860
I want a woman.

1181
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,160
I want a woman.

1182
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,800
I want a woman.

1183
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:14,240
.

1184
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:14,440
.

1185
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:16,500
.

1186
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:16,560
.

1187
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,620
.

1188
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,000
.

1189
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,000
