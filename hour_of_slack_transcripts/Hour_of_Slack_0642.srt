1
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,080
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,180
My name is Chaz,

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,900
and I'm broadcasting you tonight

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,420
from my little holding cell here,

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,740
all quarantined,

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,140
all strapped in my suit,

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,640
pressure suit's all pressured up.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,620
Yeah.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,720
It's here.

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,160
The ship is waiting, hissing away,

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
spewing out its little steam,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,580
waiting for the moment,

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
the final countdown.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,140
And that's where we're at,

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,980
just hours away from the final hour.

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,940
The final minute, the final second.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
X-Day.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,800
Thought it'd never get here.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,780
It's kind of late now.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
We're there.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,340
There's nothing else to do.

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,660
Just sit, look out the window,

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,040
and wait for the light.

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:37,780
And shaky gravity copy

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,200
You read it.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,200


27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,960
Is your pleasureship

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,620
hovering above,

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,520
waiting for the final hours to pass?

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,040
Who is it?

31
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,740
Is it your alien sex goddess

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,980
waiting for you?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,120
You're standing inunal,

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,580
somewhere

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,600
in Eurasia

36
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
blue.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,460
My name is

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,680
We'll see you.

39
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,260
Goodbye, Mom.

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,360
Goodbye, Dad.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,580
I gotta go into space.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,140
One, two.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,140
Hey, Bleepo.

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,460
Yeah.

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,980
Oh, God.

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,920
Down to a few hours now.

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Right.

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,780
Yeah.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,900
Well, I was...

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,260
No, no, no.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,160
No, no, no.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,260
No, no, no.

53
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,340
I was under some understanding that

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,800
they were gonna install some black, black box

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,300
in the studio here.

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,840
I don't know what the technology of this really is.

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,780
You know, like I say,

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,360
I don't understand how a lot of this is gonna,

59
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,800
you know, take place.

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

61
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,840
I just know that it won't fail because of me.

62
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,380
I'm gonna do six and a half million pounds.

63
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,120
We all are in this together as a team effort.

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,340
We're gonna make it work.

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,460
And I don't know how to make it work.

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,140
I don't know how to do most of this mission.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,520
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
And it won't fail because of me.

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,660
Hello, world.

70
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,540
Hello, world.

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,740
Chaz here.

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,440
ESO is here.

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:57,440


74
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,860
ESO Radio broadcasting live from the Pleasure Ships.

75
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,740
Oh, yeah.

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,140
Where you gonna go?

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,820
Where you gonna go?

78
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,500
When the sex goddesses come for you.

79
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,860
Going up to die.

80
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,520
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

81
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,700
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

82
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,500
It's where I'm gonna go when I die.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
When I die and the day not your best.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,440
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best.

85
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,620
And it's so beautiful from out here.

86
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,720
It's so pretty, the Earth.

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,880
It's just that little blue and white, little marble hanging there.

88
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,700
Gosh, that's where it all began.

89
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,160
We'll see ya.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,140
Goodbye.

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,840
Prepare yourself.

92
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,700
You know it's a must.

93
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,620
Gonna have a friend in Jesus.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,680
A friend in Bob.

95
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,720
So you know that when you die.

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,900
Bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky.

97
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,960
Swamp Radio.

98
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,860
Radio.

99
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,380
Radio.

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,060
It's so pretty.

101
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,600
Carry on in your 2009 Jesus.

102
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,300
Failure is not an option.

103
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,080
Happenings have been going further and further backwards in my career as I get better at what I do.

104
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,180
Well, at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio bleep-o.

105
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,480
There are those of us that...

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,400
I would say major disappointment might be the word used.

107
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,720
But he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair.

108
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,680
I mean, I don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation or...

109
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,980
There was major disappointment and there was General Electric.

110
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,960
Oh, there...

111
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,600
I thought you were gonna refer to the guy's erection again.

112
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,900
And then there was Admiral Bob.

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,460
Bob.

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,340
Just like a penguin in bondage, boing.

115
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,940
You know, on X-Day, Neegie will return to us all the greatest tapes that we ever recorded.

116
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,340
Praise the Neegie.

117
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,720
Which he has been keeping in.

118
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,060
Praise the Neegie.

119
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,320
Oh, God, that's so good.

120
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,660
Neegie has been keeping all of our lost recordings in a special vault.

121
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,840
You hear that, brother?

122
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,820
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,140
Oh, that's so glorious.

124
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,800
Jayner will get his 8mm films back.

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh, the stuff.

126
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,440
You know, your first show will come back.

127
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,960
I'll...

128
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,740
Actually, I never did lose anything.

129
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,740
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

130
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,700
As long as you saw them, Bill.

131
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,760
Things that...

132
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,120
I mean, um...

133
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
You mean everything I've ever seen?

134
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,800
You know, that you never got around to looking at?

135
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,360
Uh-huh.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second?

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,480
What about events that I've never taped that never were taped?

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,780
There's a thing called the new program.

139
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:06,940
The things that you thought...

140
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,180
What?

141
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,320
This is too damn confusing.

142
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
...that you imagined very vividly doing...

143
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm getting out of here.

144
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,860
...will then be done.

145
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,820
They will have been done.

146
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,940
When you want to do a wonderful new show, that show will materialize in your hand as

147
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,180
a tape.

148
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah, the new program.

149
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,760
We...

150
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,320
We...

151
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,880
We...

152
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,500
We...

153
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,080
We...

154
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,300
We...

155
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,540
We...

156
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,720
We...

157
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:22,720


158
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,140
We...

159
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,140


160
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,860
Yea.

161
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,980
Well, sheesh, that's, that's, that's...

162
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,180
...the Anunnaki is related to the Oshitashi, which you often get, you know, when served

163
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,840
with wasabi.

164
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,780
Yea.

165
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,100
And it's in conjunction with the uni and the unagi.

166
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,980
And the hiroshi.

167
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,340
And the inaka.

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,580
And the wasabi.

169
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,500
And the wasabi, yeah.

170
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,940
All of these things, you combine them.

171
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,900
These things become combined.

172
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,520
For the normals, they become combined in sort of a slurry shop.

173
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,800
We subgeniuses luckily will get the fresh human soul sushi, as it were.

174
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah, on demand.

175
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,400
On demand.

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,220
Sushi on demand 24 hours a day, even in Cleveland.

177
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:23,780
Yeah.

178
00:08:52,780 --> 00:09:03,020
Now I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.

179
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm living in Arizona.

180
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm living in Arizona.

181
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm living in Arizona.

182
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm living in Arizona.

183
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm living in Arizona.

184
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm living in Arizona.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,120
I work with my hands in a land born free

186
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,340
Live in a white house in Canyon du Chez

187
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,640
And what I take I give to live in me

188
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,920
For when this is a universe

189
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,020
Through your eyes it sees and knows

190
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,320
That certain beauties are a state of mind

191
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,800
Or so it's thought they just walk the clock into the light

192
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,260
I work with my hands

193
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,040
I work with my hands

194
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,040
Living castles made out of sand

195
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm riding alone out on my own

196
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,660
In a land of sand

197
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,660


198
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,000
And I'm riding alone out on my own In a land of sand

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
And I'm riding alone out on my own In a land of sand

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,540
I'm living in Arizona

201
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,000

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,300

Goodbye mom

222
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm never coming home

223
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,220
We're gonna give you one more little song

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,500
You know you should go

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,880

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,500
From midnight to three in the morning tonight

00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,900
Friday night

232
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,800
We'll be puffing it all night in the Domo

233
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,120
Beam in

234
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,300
Beam in

235
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,540
From the pleasure ships

236
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,160
Holographic images only

237
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,020
Please

238
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,160
A lyric little song

239
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,820
Perhaps maybe a child's nursery rhyme

240
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,040
Perhaps a little didgeridoo song

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
From an aboriginal

242
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,940
A little song that a child would sing

243
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,480
Wouldn't swing his eucalyptus leaves on his head

244
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,320
And make a crown of thorns for himself

245
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
To become the aboriginal messiah

246
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,020
And save the red rocks from these

247
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,080
And that

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,980
And this

249
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,040
And those cars going by

250
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
That time of year

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,320
And that toxic polluted swamp over there

252
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,180
And those red glowing rocks over there

253
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,120
And that meteor falling through the earth

254
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,240
We can't even comprehend what we might have been

255
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,320
We can't even think about where we might have gone

256
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,560
It all takes too long

257
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,980
Just keep your eye on the red rocks

258
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,460
Just keep walking by the river

259
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,740
Oh that's so pretty

260
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,520
It made everyone weep in the moon

261
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,560
Oh that's so pretty

262
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:15,560


263
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:15,560


264
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:15,560


265
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,980
We'll meet them soon, the inside

266
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,980
I'm touched

267
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,520
You've been touched so many times

268
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,380
You're as soiled as a bad pair of underwear at the bus station

269
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,100
Please don't touch me again

270
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,320
I'll try not to

271
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,620
They make me say things

272
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,460
They make me do things

273
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,220
Hit me

274
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,600
They make me wear the moon pants

275
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,880
They didn't make you do any of that, man

276
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,800
Ah but the moon billies wear the shaggiest moon pants you've ever seen man

277
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,200
And they're packed with all kinds of strange ideas

278
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm afraid those shaggy pants are the ones that I can't take care of

279
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,540


280
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,540

There was the pop record.

Picture yourself

328
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,980
afloat in the cosmos

329
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,580
in a pleasure ship vessel

330
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,120
of your own design.

331
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,660
Somebody calls you

332
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,820
you answer quite slowly

333
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,860
cause you're so incredibly high.

334
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,620
And then your saucers

335
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
appear on the shore

336
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,660
waiting to take us

337
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,720
the next day.

338
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,040
Climb on the deck

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,460
with our heads in the clouds

340
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,760
and we're gone.

341
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,520
Loomies will not die

342
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,200
with Simon.

343
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,400
Loomies will not die

344
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,140
with Simon.

345
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,300
Loomies will not die

346
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,020
with Simon.

347
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:43,860
Ah!

348
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,540
Picture yourself

349
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,320
in your own private garden

350
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,100
with lobsters,

351
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,600
trees,

352
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,360
and fresh figgy pies.

353
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
I didn't like the figgy.

354
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,800
It's my product.

355
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,560
Somebody calls you

356
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,960
you answer but dronely.

357
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,540
The girl with calliope signs.

358
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,180
More pleasure saucers

359
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,020
appear on the shore

360
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,860
waiting to take us

361
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,920
the next day.

362
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,160
Climb on the deck

363
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,700
with our heads in the clouds

364
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,800
and we're gone.

365
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,440
Loomies will not die

366
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,540
with Simon.

367
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,160
Loomies will not die

368
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,800
with Simon.

369
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,120
Loomies will not die

370
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,480
with Simon.

371
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,480


372
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,700
with Simon.

373
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,260
Loomies will not die

374
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,260


375
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,260


376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,940
I...

377
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,860
Picture yourself

378
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,760
all asleep

379
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,160
in a fountain

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,560
where charcoal tyrannosaurus

381
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,920
leave kisses behind.

382
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,100
Suddenly someone comes by

383
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,540
and awaits you

384
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,540


385
00:19:59,540 --> 00:19:59,540


386
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:29,480
You cannot keep either face inattenance.

387
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,520


388
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,520


389
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,060
The stars will be dark, the sky will be dark.

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,600
I won't see them, but I'll see them.

391
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,280
Strange, but I'll come in.

392
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,100
I won't see them, but I'll come in.

393
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,240
I won't see them, but I'll come in.

394
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,460
I won't see them, but I'll come in.

395
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,200
Now, I know you'd really like to know just who Simon is, but I'm sorry.

396
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,540
Sorry? That's one of the wee mysteries you'll just have to figure out for yourself.

397
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,760
Everyone gets the Simon they deserve.

398
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,380
And everyone gets that destiny they choose.

399
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,600
I know you ordained that genius, but you know exactly what that means.

400
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,040
I know exactly what that means.

401
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,180
But for the...

402
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,360
For those of you who are somehow yet unsaved,

403
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,520
there are nine more holy and complete days where the post office will be open.

404
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,180
And if you don't know what to do, call one...

405
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,840
Nine.

406
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,580
Six.

407
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,120
Nine.

408
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,700
Six.

409
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,440
Nine.

410
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,040
Six.

411
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,620
Nine.

412
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,580
And ask.

413
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,100
Operators are standing by.

414
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,060
But we...

415
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,220
We...

416
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,540
That's me.

417
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,460
Are not standing by.

418
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,780
By those...

419
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,600
We...

420
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,380
We're ready.

421
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,820
And we will greet you as you board the pleasure ship.

422
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,320
Just a little.

423
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,700
With both horn lights flashing brightly, we will...

424
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:12,480
We even will place the lei around your neck, kiss you on the cheek, and send you on your merry way.

425
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,740
Into the escape vessel.

426
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,600
But for now...

427
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,880
We out.

428
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,240
We out.

429
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,880
E-S-O.

430
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,040
We out.

431
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
Gotta go.

432
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,520
We out.

433
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:24,760
We out.

434
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,660
For now.

435
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,440
And you get your own free wee bell.

436
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,540
We out.

437
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh, wow.

438
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,260
I don't know.

439
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,300
That's not the wee bell.

440
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,440
The wee bell is...

441
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
No, the wee bell is a wee bell.

442
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,780
And it's a wee bell because...

443
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,040
Not because she is wee like in this cottage or I always wear it because she says wee.

444
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,120
Oh, no.

445
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,700
I bet, I bet.

446
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Oh, man.

447
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,720
She always says wee.

448
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,040
Ah, yes.

449
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
Oh, wee.

450
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,480
Simple.

451
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,060
Simple.

452
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,100
El dido.

453
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,940
El dido.

454
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,420
El dido.

455
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,360
Oui, oui, oui.

456
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,580
There are hands sticking out of the walls.

457
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,440
Yeah.

458
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,560
And when the Bosch came, we had to hide and think about when Bob would come and liberate

459
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,520
us and put us in little tiny pleasure ships about the size of this pack of girl right here.

460
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,980
Oh, yes.

461
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,920
You see, we had to shrink because our heads were so big from staying in the basement.

462
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,680
But you can't surprise us.

463
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,840
Yes.

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,740
Because...

465
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,420
Well, I can't wait till the subgenius exhibit opens in the new Disney world.

466
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,120
Ah, what...

467
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,000
You know, now, don't start counting your chickens before the hatch, Bleepo.

468
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,780
Well...

469
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,820
And don't talk about...

470
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,360
You promised me a job 50 years ago before I was born.

471
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,720
Uh...

472
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,760
Well, me too.

473
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,300
Me too.

474
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,600
They...

475
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,260
Most of us.

476
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,600
But...

477
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,640
Um...

478
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,820
St. Palmer Vreedies, uh...

479
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,420
Speculated that...

480
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,580
You know, what if, on X-Day, the exes, the, you know, sex goddesses from outer...

481
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,200
From Planet X arrive...

482
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,900
Mm-hmm.

483
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,580
In saucers.

484
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,060
Saucers.

485
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,180
The size of little tiny shirt butts.

486
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,640
And they fly around hovering like gnats in front of our faces going,

487
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,600
Well, get on board.

488
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,680
Get on board.

489
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,240
And then what we do...

490
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,780
And then they, you know, get tired of waiting and they fly away and fly away and fly away and...

491
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,320
Do not abandon your post.

492
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,160
There is no danger of radiation leakage.

493
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,320
5,000, 6,200, what is everything all right down there?

494
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,220
Are you willing to follow us?

495
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,900
That accident over in Red Sector L destroyed another 63 personnel,

496
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
giving them a total of 242.

497
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,400
Two lost to our 195.

498
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,040
Keep up the good work and prevent accidents.

499
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:37,100
John and Yoko, Kimmy, Leary, Rosemary, Tommy Smothers, Bobby, Dylan, Tommy, Cooper, Derek, Taylor, Norman, Mailer, Allen, Ginsburg,

500
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,180
Hare Krishna, Hare, Hare, Hare Krishna.

501
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:49,200
All we are saying is give peace a chance.

502
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Now, sing it for the Senate.

503
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,460
Oh, God.

504
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,800
All we are saying...

505
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,420
All we are saying...

506
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,240
Is give peace a chance.

507
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Personally, I like to think of myself as the most sweetness and light New Age, love-oriented subgenius.

508
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:19,000
And I know that the 33,000 saucers of Planet X will line up from North Pole to South Pole across this globe.

509
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
Let the world turn under it.

510
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,440
And loonies will not die.

511
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,440
That's right.

512
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,340
For Simon, with Simon.

513
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,320
They will have nothing to do with Simon.

514
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:37,980
Loonies will fly, arise, up, up, up, above the atmosphere.

515
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,980
Far, far, as they depressurize, their heads will swell.

516
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,940
Even the poor, innocent loonies who don't know of Bob.

517
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:54,160
Like balloons, they will swell as they depressurize, floating ever higher up, out into the stratosphere.

518
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,420
Out into the stratosphere.

519
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
The O-O-Sphere.

520
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,380
The DNA-O-Sphere.

521
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,940
The fly-way above the countryside.

522
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,420
The Dave-O-Sphere.

523
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:10,360
And finally, the most furthest out from the solar system, surrounding like a great bubble the solar system, the We-O-Sphere.

524
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,860
And it's really weird out there.

525
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,200
But there can be other creatures in this alien environment.

526
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,400
Hunters.

527
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,180
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

528
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,440
They eat the floaters.

529
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,300
Both for their organic molecules.

530
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,320
And for their store of pure hydrogen.

531
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,540
But there can't be many hunters.

532
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,840
Because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves will perish.

533
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,200
Give birth to the little onion-headed boys.

534
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,920
The little onion-headed boys and girls.

535
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,000
With such pale skin.

536
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,980
Made for exterior voyages of sheer glandular pleasure.

537
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,740
Pleasure.

538
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,620
And we may talk about pleasure ships.

539
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,560
You don't know, like I don't.

540
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,080
My glands just...

541
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,080
Exploded with delight as we passed...

542
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Well, it wasn't a galaxy.

543
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,540
I guess it was just a thought.

544
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,420
A creation of my own fancy.

545
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,820
And the next thing I knew, I...

546
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,660
Well, I excreted some sort of grey, malodorous substance all over my pants.

547
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,840
You're out of the woods.

548
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,880
You're out of the dark.

549
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,060
You're out of the night.

550
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,920
Step into the sun.

551
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,120
Step into the light.

552
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,080
Ooh.

553
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,620
Keep straight ahead.

554
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,080
More than this glorious place on the face of the earth.

555
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,880
Or the sky.

556
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,260
Ooh.

557
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,900
Hold onto your breath.

558
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,940
Hold onto your heart.

559
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,060
Hold onto your home.

560
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,120
March up to that gate and fill it open.

561
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,420
Open.

562
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,340
Open.

563
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,840
Speaking of swinging like a corpse of stink, did you get the email and hear about the dreams of, like, Toto with the space helmet?

564
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,740
And you haven't heard of a lick of a dream like that?

565
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,140
No.

566
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,560
Of dog sex with...

567
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,780
Judy Garland in the space... nothing like that.

568
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,240
The helmet and everything?

569
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,840
I had that.

570
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,880
I had... I didn't actually have the dream.

571
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,860
I had the actual sex.

572
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
The dog sex with Judy Garland.

573
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,300
So you were Toto in the space helmet.

574
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,960
Well, you knew your...

575
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,040
Well, actually, I was...

576
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,200
Can I say doing?

577
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,860
I was doing Toto and then Toto was doing Judy.

578
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,120
She was...

579
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,600
It was a little three-way thing.

580
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,160
It was fun.

581
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,060
Little is right.

582
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:16,800
Well, yeah.

583
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,480
I mean, it was...

584
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,560
I'm surprised to hear that about you, Bleepo.

585
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,360
Well, let me tell you, I mean, the dog was never the same after that.

586
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,460
Let's just say he had to wear a special little bag after that.

587
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,840
But I don't...

588
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm not proud of that.

589
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,060
I use my dog as a special little bag.

590
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm not proud of that, you know, because I'm not into animal abuse.

591
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,500
I like that one better.

592
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,080
I use the little dog as a special bag on the big dog.

593
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,320
Right.

594
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,720
I saw that.

595
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,320
I saw those dogs.

596
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,060
Those dogs are the funniest lawn ornaments I've ever seen.

597
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
I got to say that.

598
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,340
Well, especially when I turn the blood spray on.

599
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,340
Yeah, coming out of the derby hat.

600
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,340


601
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,080
I love that.

602
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,980
The first time I saw it, I thought it was like a Laurel and Hardy thing.

603
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,380
And then I...

604
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,960
I didn't do it.

605
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,840
Instead of chocolate, I thought it was like chocolate, but it was real blood.

606
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,420
I thought...

607
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,740
That was wacky.

608
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,320
You know, with the old film holograms with the dog thing with the nose and the chocolate.

609
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,040
It was just too...

610
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm sorry.

611
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm sorry.

612
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,380
I'm sorry.

613
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm sorry.

614
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm sorry.

615
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:10,920


617
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm sorry.

618
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,380
I'm sorry.

619
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,440


620
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,440


621
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,440


622
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,440


623
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,540
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,180
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,780
I'm sorry.

628
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm sorry.

629
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

630
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,560
No, that's alright.

631
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,560


632
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:32,560


633
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,680
Get used to it.

634
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:33,680


635
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,100
That's okay.

636
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,320


637
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,420
Don't get emotional, Jimmy.

638
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,840
Jon Charlie!

639
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,080
I didn't do anything but notice there was somewhere for the chocolate top.

640
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,980
I was telling Tom Lewis it was really .

641
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:39,980


642
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,600
I actually feel an awesome personality when I'm not pizza-いました.

643
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,500
Yeah, completely.

644
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:42,500


645
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,340
The redesigned emotion is plates.

646
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,340


647
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,780
Oh, are you alive, darling?

648
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,060
Hey.

664
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,040
They are complete.

665
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,620
There's no clothes on the pleasure ships, is there?

666
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,300
If they want them, they grow them.

667
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,120
I guess it's with some of them newer models and stuff.

668
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:27,260
All you have to do is think of like maybe a nice pair of checkerboard pants with bell bottoms.

669
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,260
You could want them to not grow them and it would disappear.

670
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:38,480
It would be this endless cycle of them growing clothes and themselves willing the clothes and you willing not clothes.

671
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,220
I guess staying really did kind of help bring about a very awful world for all of us.

672
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,980
It's just this constant fluctuation.

673
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,800
Yeah, between a bunch of different minds wanting their different ego ideas of what they want, you know?

674
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,500
I am here to protect you.

675
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,240
You have nowhere to go.

676
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,100
You have nowhere to go.

677
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,140
You are a full believer.

678
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,640
Blessings of the state.

679
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,920
Blessings of the masses.

680
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,360
It could be hell.

681
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,380
Subgenius hell.

682
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,920
Subgenius hell.

683
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,620
There is no hell.

684
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,000
There's just endless, endless lines of more or less pleasure and a lot more pain all the time.

685
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,240
There is no heaven.

686
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,480
Really.

687
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,040
There is no hell.

688
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,160
There is no Bob.

689
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,020
Well, I happen to know there is a Bob because he's standing right over there.

690
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,620
He's sitting there smiling.

691
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,700
It's just like the smile on the dog's face.

692
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,680
What's the instinct to a dog?

693
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,300
To hunt.

694
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,400
To kill.

695
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:39,820
Master.

696
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,620
Hunt.

697
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,000
Hunt.

698
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,480
Hunt.

699
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:42,600


700
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:42,600


701
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,140
To hunt for the pack.

702
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,320
From all the tales of the West, we'll number best Corporal Rusty and Private Renton Timm.

703
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,800
Nobody has done this for them or to them.

704
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,320
They have done it to themselves.

705
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,680
They are a slave.

706
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,420
You know what it is?

707
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,300
In short, they are a slave.

708
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,320
They're a slavery.

709
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,280
They need to be free.

710
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,460
They need to be liberated.

711
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,120
They need to be liberated.

712
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,120


713
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,340
They need to be liberated.

714
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,180
You know.

715
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,300
You know.

716
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,600
Bob doesn't care.

717
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:12,600


718
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,520
He doesn't care whether you brush your teeth or whether you shave your legs or whether you...

719
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,740
Or whether your dad's the heat.

720
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,240
Yeah.

721
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,380
He doesn't care.

722
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,880
Bob doesn't care.

723
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,620
He doesn't care if you're packing a big old colostomy bag from a surprise you had somewhere in a hillbilly bar.

724
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,540
He doesn't care.

725
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,600
Or a .44 Magnum loaded with big hollow point bullets ready to...

726
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,820
No, sir.

727
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
As long as you got...

728
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:39,100
Take out Africa with one shot from this pleasure ship which can magnify the bullets to the size of the state of Oregon.

729
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,600
But since we're all into drumming, we wouldn't want to take out Africa with one shot.

730
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,160
We'd probably aim for Antarctica.

731
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
But I like penguins.

732
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,460
Ye who read are still among the living.

733
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,160
But I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows.

734
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,280
For indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known.

735
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,020
And many centuries shall pass away ere these memorials be seen of men.

736
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,300
At the end of a rainbow

737
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,460
You'll find a pot of gold

738
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,940
At the end of a story

739
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,260
You'll find it's all been told

740
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:27,740
But our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend

741
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,600
And it has a story

742
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,380
Without any end

743
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,380
Unless we're so stupid as to destroy ourselves, there are going to be people exploring those worlds.

744
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,340
There are going to be human habitations on those worlds.

745
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,080
We're going to be moving out into space in the next century.

746
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,840
We're on a little time delay here.

747
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:57,940
We're broadcasting live from Brushwood and then it's airing just a few minutes later via the internet at WCSB in Cleveland.

748
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,320
And that's what's happening tonight.

749
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,860
Yep. And we're watching all kinds of people from many, many walks of life, every different type of...

750
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,260
They've kind of set up a little booth here for us, a little window booth like they do at the...

751
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,720
Big TV station.

752
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,640
Some people are going to hang around the Universal Date Line or the Invisible Date...

753
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,220
Yeah, which is actually going to be hovering right over the jam site for Saturday in the afternoon.

754
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,500
To allow the jammers and the other unfortunate ones...

755
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,960
Which consists of Einstein, Secret Orchestra, again, and whatever drummers show up.

756
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,500
We're going to be drumming for the Earth.

757
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,420
Saturday is going to be the last drumming to the Earth, the last...

758
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,580
We're going to bid farewell to the Earth Saturday afternoon.

759
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,880
At the...

760
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,700
With a happy, clappy, pounding sound.

761
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,440
The Greek Amphitheater in Brushwood.

762
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,380
We'll be singing the Strophe and the Anistrophe and we'll be performing Antigone in the afternoon.

763
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,960
But I don't think any of the players from the Iambic Chorus will be there.

764
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,980
Not the Baraka?

765
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,760
No.

766
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,340
Or the Coya Nascotzi?

767
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,300
No, those people will all be taken into Native American subterranean worlds to have their manicures and toes nails.

768
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,200
The life out of balance is about to be balanced.

769
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:09,980
Yep.

770
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,200
It had to happen someday.

771
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,280
And better that it happened someday than some other day.

772
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,040
Some day.

773
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,360
Some other day.

774
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,540
X day.

775
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,260
I still get gripped with...

776
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,760
Great five.

777
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,840
...plasms or spasms of fear.

778
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:22,980
And...

779
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,260
Thinking that...

780
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:24,840
Convulsions.

781
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,760
Well, I don't know if them ships is really going to be able to pull us up.

782
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,020
What if Stan gives us the Kool-Aid and...

783
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,240
Well, he pointed that out.

784
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,180
Yeah, he pointed it out.

785
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:39,020
You know, Stan could be a black-off guy trying to get a bunch of us, the subgeniuses, so that the, you know, the other bad guys...

786
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
Yeah, delivering us.

787
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,840
Right, to them.

788
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,880
Saying, here's the choice ones, chomp, chomp.

789
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,240
Or the pleasure ships might come down and they're the size of a mosquito.

790
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,960
Yeah.

791
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,260
And there they are hovering right in front of your face going, come on, get on, get on board.

792
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,960
Yeah, I...

793
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,880
And there we are, all paid up, dues paying members, and there's a little mosquito spaceship going, come on, let's go.

794
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,680
Well, that thought might have been precluded by the infinite worlds theory, wherein some...

795
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,160
There's a galaxy, supposedly.

796
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,900
A completely self-contained galaxy the size of a grain of sand.

797
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,580
And since this is possible, it is probably happening.

798
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,340
So therefore, there could be many, many, like Stan predicted also that...

799
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,960
I can't deal with the possible, it must be happening.

800
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
The possibilities?

801
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,660
Yeah, just so many of them.

802
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,000
I mean, who knows who's gonna show up the next day?

803
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,200
And they all happen.

804
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,660
Not just the little teeny bug craft.

805
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,640
Every thought that people have...

806
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,740
What if the big guys show up first and don't even see the planet?

807
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,140
You know what I mean?

808
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,140


809
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,460
You know what I'm saying?

810
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,780
Yeah, right, they're so big.

811
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,600
It's like they look at, where's the planet?

812
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,360
Yeah, where's Earth?

813
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,260
We're down here, man!

814
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,700
It's supposed to be here somewhere.

815
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,540
The charts say Earth's right here, and we'll be this tiny dust speck.

816
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,180
They won't even...

817
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,700
Yeah, and they...

818
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,280
Smaller than a mote of dust.

819
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,120
And they mistake it for like, you know, just a mote of dust.

820
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah.

821
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,260
They don't even see it.

822
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,500
They were expecting some big guys like them, you know.

823
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,020
Right, they don't even comprehend it.

824
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,120
Yeah, you're right, there we are down there, hey, we're down here!

825
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,000
And then right in the middle, you got the black-off guys trying to figure out who's gonna...

826
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,260
They want to get on there, see?

827
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,660
They want to make their own deal.

828
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,540
They want to get off on time and stuff.

829
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:18,280
You think a bunch of goons and spies who know this is gonna go on is gonna let it go on,

830
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,440
and they're not gonna get on there?

831
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
No, no, man.

832
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,680
Oh, the spooks are definitely here tonight.

833
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,820
Yeah, the spooks want to get all their people on there.

834
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,060
Oh, yeah.

835
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,040
Sure.

836
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,700
A pure white race, probably, who knows?

837
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,420
And they think, yeah, they have to do all this other stuff, but all they have to do is become dues-paying members.

838
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,480
And that's it.

839
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,060
That's it.

840
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,300
They don't have to go around...

841
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,680
They don't have to get the jersey out of it.

842
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,300
Right, yeah.

843
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,320
They're spending...

844
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,500
Look at how much money they're spending in surveillance.

845
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,140
How many gray cars did you see on the edge of the campground this morning when all they had to do was just walk up to 30 bucks?

846
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,380
Blow three bucks.

847
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Yeah, blow three bucks.

848
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,580
Have fun, meet a girl, smoke some frappie.

849
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

850
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,580
That's all it takes.

851
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,200
There's not much to it.

852
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,480
We're not, you know, talking rocket science here.

853
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,660
Well, we are, but not in any form that you would understand, so...

854
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Don't worry about it.

855
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,620
Or even us, you know.

856
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,060
Really.

857
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,560
We don't know how this whole thing works.

858
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:07,960
Yeah.

859
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,660
You know, like I said before, I don't know how a great amount of this whole endeavor

860
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,540
is gonna happen, but I know my little part of it.

861
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:22,020
I know how to make my little part of this whole thing work, the whole rupture and all

862
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,380
that, and I guarantee you...

863
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,620
You won't fail because of me.

864
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,720
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

865
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,680
Nothing like this has ever been exploded before, and we're gonna be pretty darn close.

866
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,460
I know you're leaving, babe, goodbye

867
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:44,420
So long I hope someday somebody listens to your song

868
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,060
Those bright lights never ever spelled your name

869
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:56,580
It's true Maybe a change of scene would be the best

870
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,320
for you

871
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
So long, babe

872
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,820
So long, babe

873
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,440
So long, zo之後

874
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,020
So long, babe.

875
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,500
So long, babe.

876
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,760
When in doubt, eat pussy.

877
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:59,340
So long, babe.

878
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,080
So long, babe.

879
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,780
So long, babe.

880
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,580
So long, babe.

881
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,920
So long, babe.

882
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,260
Well, I had no intention of sex.

883
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,560
Not with nobody, girl.

884
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,260
So long, babe.

885
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
I tried and I tried.

886
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,660
I will, I tried.

887
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:52,900
I was not the crazy man.

888
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,980
guitar solo

889
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,680
Well, I have no retention

890
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,160
I'm in another dimension

891
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,460
So

892
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,920
I do

893
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,760
Bye-bye

894
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,960
Bye-bye

895
00:47:32,980 --> 00:48:02,900
Bye-bye

896
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:31,000
Bye-bye

897
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,720
at with what it's worth is with what it's worth.

898
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,000
Lob is not the end.

899
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,640
And meat is anything else.

900
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,620
Was it bad for you too?

901
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,920
There, it's a beginning.

902
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,000
The beginning was the end.

903
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,760
Talk about lobster meat for years.

904
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,960
Of everything, my friend.

905
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,920
That was a premature ejaculation, though.

906
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,320
I'll say.

907
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,240
It was before and after.

908
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,960
The ape regards his tail.

909
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,060
He's stuck on it.

910
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,900
Have I ever had multiple orgasms?

911
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,520
No, not in my recollection.

912
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,300
You will soon, my friend.

913
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,000
Very soon.

914
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,340
I want candy, lobster, I can roll.

915
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,740
I'm going to make sure there's control.

916
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,440
I'm going to make sure there's control.

917
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,060
I'm going to make sure there's control.

918
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,640
I'm going to make sure there's control.

919
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,260
All that stuff.

920
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,540
The real X-Day.

921
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Behind the X-Day.

922
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,000
The sword of destiny.

923
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,320
It's kind of like the real Mardi Gras behind Mardi Gras.

924
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:31,580
Yeah.

925
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,200
Like who?

926
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,440
Who's the real Rex?

927
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,320
Where's the real magic happening?

928
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,240
Yeah.

929
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,340
It's not happening in a boneyard somewhere down on...

930
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,960
It's not happening in outer space.

931
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,800
On Rue d'Abelard.

932
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:51,340
The real magic doesn't happen in outer space, kids.

933
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,780
It happens in a little microcosmic world.

934
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,260
Inner space.

935
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,180
Magic.

936
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,700
Are you...

937
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,980
Let's speak to the Brushwood fans here.

938
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,840
Just randomly...

939
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,800
We're out there practicing their magic right now.

940
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,240
Let's just take...

941
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,760
Forget about the people in Cleveland.

942
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,020
Forget about the people in other parts of the world.

943
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,380
You want to pick us up here as we just roll along?

944
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,260
We'll just walk out there?

945
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,760
Yeah, all right.

946
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,420
Here, let's go.

947
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,860
Let's take the microphones.

948
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,580
What should we hit first?

949
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,060
You want to go where they're selling all the frock?

950
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,220
Or you want to go where they're selling...

951
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,520
The magic drums?

952
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,820
No, I want to go watch the magic.

953
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,180
Oh, there's people, I guess, off over by those blue tents.

954
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,640
Hey, have you seen Ivan Stang?

955
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,200
Hey.

956
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,380
Hey, you dressed in that white...

957
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,960
Gosh, look at that outfit.

958
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,380
It's like white polka dot.

959
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,080
The arms are 40 feet long.

960
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,180
That person's arms are 40 feet long.

961
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,280
Wow.

962
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,320
Look at that.

963
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,160
That's pretty cool.

964
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,040
Look at that chick over there.

965
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,480
The day glow paint all over her body.

966
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,220
Look at that, dude.

967
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,560
Nice little purple little things.

968
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,000
Look at that.

969
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,620
Over that way, there's this weird glow coming from just over the hill.

970
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,580
Let's follow the glow, man.

971
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,220
That's always, you know...

972
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,220
Let's put these mics down and not worry about this radio showing.

973
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,400
Look, it's getting bigger.

974
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,300
There she is, man.

975
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,620
The chick I was telling you about.

976
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,240
Oh, wow.

977
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,880
The one they were interrogating.

978
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,280
Wow, she's...

979
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,980
Wow, she's looking...

980
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,720
Look at how tall she is now, though.

981
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,040
Man, she's looking...

982
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,280
A 30-foot woman.

983
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,880
Man, one pill makes you smaller.

984
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,180
One pill makes you tall.

985
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,300
She took the tall pill.

986
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,040
I don't want to take no more of these pills.

987
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,440
We all took the small pills.

988
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,340
I took the...

989
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,460
I took all the pills.

990
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,300
Oh, man, what's going to happen to me?

991
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,200
You didn't eat the mushroom, too, did you?

992
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,920
Yeah, I took...

993
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,460
Name it, what'd they give me?

994
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,120
I took it all.

995
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,040
The hamburger, the mushrooms on the hamburger.

996
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,500
You just remember what the doormouse said.

997
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,240
You just remember what the doormouse said.

998
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,240


999
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,440


1000
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,440


1001
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,300
You just remember what the doormouse said.

1002
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,300


1003
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,540
What if the rockets don't come?

1004
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,140
Don't worry, they're coming, all right.

1005
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,020
Nothing's going to happen to spoil my plans, baby.

1006
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,100
I figured it all out.

1007
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,620
It's time we told you, son.

1008
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,420
We're not going home.

1009
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,880
This is where we'll live from now on.

1010
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,000
But what about the rocket?

1011
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,400
What about Ohio?

1012
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,180
More of what they want will be wherever we are

1013
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,100
because we'll want the same thing, too.

1014
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,220
Welcome, Israel.

1015
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,700
Welcome, Israel.

1016
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,840
We have bliss this time instead of misery.

1017
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,500
Exactly, my friend.

1018
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,520
Dave has spoken.

1019
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,580
The Jews have spoken.

1020
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,700
Filippo has spoken.

1021
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,960
Chaz has spoken.

1022
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,060
Stang has spoken.

1023
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,580
And we have spoken.

1024
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,000
We have spoken.

1025
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,200
This is the end.

1026
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,880
And yet, perhaps the end is really a new beginning.

1027
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,320
A new beginning for all of us.

1028
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,860
Because at the end of the rainbow,

1029
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,920
if we do it the same way we began,

1030
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,380
then it'll all be simple.

1031
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,160
Here we are at the end of the rainbow.

1032
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,460
We'll have a chance to redo all of those things

1033
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,920
that we weren't able to do before.

1034
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,380
Each and every one of us.

1035
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,120
We can get it right this time.

1036
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:12,920
That's right.

1037
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,040
You imagine what it's like to go back,

1038
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,580
to make it all right again.

1039
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,480
It'll be like doing third grade all over again,

1040
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,860
only knowing everything that you know now.

1041
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,640
No more knocks on the head.

1042
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,620
No more kids picking on you.

1043
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,620
Driving you down and making fun of you.

1044
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,920
You will be as unto a god.

1045
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,940
At the end of a river,

1046
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,920
you'll have everything you want.

1047
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,200
The water stops its flow.

1048
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,760
At the end of a high sea,

1049
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,620
there's no place you can go.

1050
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,940
You're as close to a god as you will ever be.

1051
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,540
Take me, love me,

1052
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,140
be your own.

1053
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,780
Be there then.

1054
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:00,980
Be there now.

1055
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,300
I want to thank everyone who led up to this.

1056
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,980
Where's my mom?

1057
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,640
I want to thank Reverend Stagg,

1058
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,720
and Lee Poe Chow,

1059
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,380
and Lee,

1060
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,440
and everybody that...

1061
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,340
We'll see y'all at the end of the river.

1062
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,300
I'll see you on the flip-flop, man.

1063
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,420
Goodbye, Dad.

1064
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,200
Catch you on the saucer.

1065
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,260
Open up, my friend.

1066
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,700
I've been going that night.

1067
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,800
You gotta think about it.

1068
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,700
You were at the top of the fence.

1069
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,760
You think you can lock me up?

1070
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,860
I'm in doubt.

1071
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,160
I'm not going to tell you anything.

1072
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,140
I'm all yours now.

1073
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,160
I know.

1074
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,720
When I'm trying to find out,

1075
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,460
it's because my Lord is using me.

1076
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,480
It's a kind of trade-off for what I do.

1077
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,480
Put it to my face.

1078
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,020
You're a drunk, failed writer,

1079
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,420
failed school teacher,

1080
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,160
failed husband.

1081
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,440
You cry in the dark.

1082
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,880
You're sad and cry yourself in the dark.

1083
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,660
I don't know what to say.

1084
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,500
Just shut up, all right?

1085
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,620
Just shut up.

1086
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Why not add bad father to the list

1087
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,460
just by giving you permission for the trial?

1088
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,600
And in return,

1089
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,860
get a job.

1090
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:57,980
No.

1091
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,480
We're going to do something about it.

1092
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,660
The Earth is finished.

1093
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,940
We're going to blow up our rocket

1094
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,980
and start all over.

1095
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,500
See if we can't build a better world up here.

1096
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,120
And then he lifted his eyes to the deep ocean sky

1097
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,380
trying once more to see Earth

1098
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,660
and the house he had always called home.

1099
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,600
But Earth was too far away

1100
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,800
and the house was now only a heap

1101
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,620
of radioactive rubble.

1102
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,120
Only one wall remained standing.

1103
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,300
and within the wall a voice spoke again and again and again.

1104
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:39,020
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, if mankind perished utterly

1105
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:45,920
and spring herself when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone,

1106
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,820
that we were gone, that we were gone.

1107
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:55,200
The whole world is waiting, for this will decide the fate of civilization, all humanity.

1108
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,560
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.

1109
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,000
Attention please, four minutes to bomb time.

1110
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:12,660
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times and think to yourself,

1111
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:22,700
there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home,

1112
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,120
there's no place like home.

1113
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,120
Stars are my home, stars are my home, stars are my home.

1114
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,180
The world of Dimension X.

1115
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:43,700
A googolplex is just as far away from infinity as is one.

1116
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,220
Well infinity, you don't want to argue with infinity.

1117
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,020
One.

1118
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,720
It's not a number, it's a state of consciousness.

1119
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,120
Isn't it?

1120
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:53,280
One.

1121
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,180
Come on now, let's not try to think like three people.

1122
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:55,880
Three dimensional beings.

1123
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:56,320
What?

1124
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,860
Let's try to think like two dimensional beings.

1125
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,040
In a binary world.

1126
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:01,560
Yes.

1127
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:02,800
Let's just...

1128
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,200
Ah, that's what it's called.

1129
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,080
Getting stoned on sunshine, sunshine.

1130
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,540
Yeah, but it's in.

1131
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,240
Stacking it for us.

1132
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,280
Getting to it naturally.

1133
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,160
Now we can do the ring with your shiny voice.

1134
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,180
We're going to a place you'll never remember.

1135
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,100
We've seen a big fan of a poor man like me.

1136
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,400
A good son gone on a great length skirt.

1137
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,920
Life is such a trippy thing.

1138
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,520
And I hope that this summer's good.

1139
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,760
Each day on earth is a day that's worth remembering.

1140
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,200
Remembering.

1141
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,800
Remember me, that's what I sing.

1142
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,380
And life is such a trippy thing.

1143
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,740
Remember me, that's what I sing.

1144
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,600
I don't think your baby's your baby.

1145
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:56,740
I don't think your baby's your baby.

1146
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:57,420
I'm not a baby.

1147
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,000
You're a baby.

1148
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,000


1149
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,820
It's another day.

1150
00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,740
It's another day.

1151
00:57:59,740 --> 00:57:59,740


1152
00:57:59,740 --> 00:57:59,740


1153
00:57:59,740 --> 00:57:59,840
To grow.

1154
00:57:59,840 --> 00:57:59,840


1155
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,380
To look for it.

1156
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,080
Look for it.

1157
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,160
Watch the sky.

1158
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,280
And in the waves of gel.

1159
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,040
The waves of hot gel.

1160
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,860
The waves of the molecules.

1161
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,360
The wave of the molecules.

1162
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,600
Atomic crushing gel.

1163
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,420
Came down.

1164
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,720
Out of our speech.

1165
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,860
That's what we're doing.

1166
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:23,260
One, one, one more, one more, one more, until it's tired, the entire planet is gone.

1167
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,080
I had to change me.

1168
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,680
I love the world I found.

1169
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,500
I've got to fly my own sweet way.

1170
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,060
I've got to fly my own sweet way.

1171
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,320
Life is such a trippy thing.

1172
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,300
Hello, hello.

1173
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,740
Talking about it.

1174
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:47,320
On Earth is a day that's worth remembering.

1175
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:51,220
Each day on Earth is a day that's worth remembering.

1176
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:56,080
Life is such a grueling thing.

1177
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,520
Don't pity me.

1178
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:03,420
I'm glad to be a ding-a-ling, a ding-a-ling, a ding-a-ling.

1179
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,620
Life is such a trippy thing.

1180
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,800
You're silly.

1181
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,200
I didn't know you shaved down there.

1182
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1183
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,140
It's so fuzzy.

1184
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,240
Well, kids.

1185
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,120
Yeah?

1186
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,740
I'm so glad we're so squeaky again.

1187
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,380
Keep your head on top.

1188
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,800
Bob didn't tell us it would end so squeaky.

1189
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,400
You're back to the wind.

1190
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,100
All right.

1191
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,720
And you're back in the saddle.

1192
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:33,860
The saddle.

1193
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,900
The saddle.

1194
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,820
You as close to a god as you'll ever be.

1195
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,640
You're so close.

1196
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,720
She brings to me.

1197
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,460
Oh, it's so sweet.

1198
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,380
The time I remember.

1199
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,180
Thank you.

1200
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,500
My ancestors.

1201
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,340
I won't say.

1202
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,940
You are close to the beginning.

1203
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:53,900
Goodbye.

1204
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:54,780
See you again.

1205
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,900
Out here.

1206
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,800
Out here.

1207
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,660
I, Bob, and Tim.

1208
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,700
It's so cold.

1209
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,500
It's so cold.

1210
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,440
I have to be in my fusion.

1211
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,020
Out here.

1212
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:13,820
Let me see.

1213
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,200
Myisu.

1214
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,780
Let me see.

1215
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,140
Be quiet, constitution of the dead.

1216
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,040
Be quiet when the war begins.

1217
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,560
inhibited.

1218
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,380
And always go back to the start.

1219
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,460
You have to always hold me in your book.

1220
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,100
My nightcare.

1221
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,460
Wall is so long.

1222
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,460


1223
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,460


1224
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,120
Need to have a shadow.

1225
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,940
Ow!

1226
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:37,980
Ow!

1227
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,020


1228
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:43,720
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . any time history.

1229
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,560
We're the champs.

1230
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,220
We're the champs.

1231
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,040
We're the champs.

1232
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,020
And we're the champs.
