1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,560
You're recording me, aren't you?

3
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,820
I'm telling you not to call me again.

4
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,340
I'm the evolving drinking theme crush now.

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,720
Yes, apparently.

6
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,600
What are the effects of the theme crush drink itself?

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,700
Uh, it makes you, uh, it makes you breakdream.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,260
Ah, the break...

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,020
Oh, much like the breakwind of the...

10
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,460
Yes, the breakwind of the breakdreamers often clogs these busy mall arcades,

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:28,780
causing merchants to get out on the sidewalk and fuss and fume at the blocked aisles and the lack of customers.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,320
And they often, what they do, they use what they call the dancing flame, and I think that's pretty...

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,400
Oh, I see. And then, just how do they carry the flame about the park?

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,220
Exactly. Exactly. That's the problem.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,840
It's a giant match.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,360
Scientists have been trying to decide this problem for years.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,180
Here they are now.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,880
This is Mission Control. Roger, you're one-three-zero-one-three.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,320
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,480
This sort of thing has cropped up before.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,760
It can only be solved...

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,160
...if it's only attributable to...

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,300
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,700
Roger, you're one-three-zero-one-three.

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,140
Well, first of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,180
Do you believe that Howell has genuine emotions?

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,580
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,880
But as to whether or not he has real feelings is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,260
Hmm...

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Hum...

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:31,940
Hum...

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
I do, I do.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,860
It's working now. I can't believe it. It's actually...

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,060
Huh?

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,060
It wouldn't start. It would discard.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,080
Unbelievable.

37
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,600
Why did you stop it? I mean, by changing it, I smashed it.

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,420
Which is good for the cassette's meaning to be whacked on the side.

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,640
Well, I tried this other cassette on it. Let's try it with this cassette. Another call. Okay?

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,800
Well it's working now.

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,200
Sometimes there is something that can be improved,.

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,220
Well, Bob Dobbs is a real nice guy.

43
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,020
...

44
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,760
About Tom Dobbs.

45
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,420
Send a dollar to the P.O. Box, he'll get you high.

46
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,380
Yeah, Bob Dobbs is a real nice guy.

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,460
Send a buck to the box and he'll get you high.

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,340
The box number is 140306.

49
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,300
140306.

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,420
Dallas, Texas.

51
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,100
306.

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,500
706.

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,780
1-4-0.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
3-0-6.

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,240
2-1-4.

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,300
1-4-0.

57
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,980
3-0-6.

58
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,020
Dallas, Texas.

59
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,040
7-5.

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,580
7-5.

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,500
7-5.

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,500
7-5.

63
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,360
7-5.

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,940
2-1-4.

65
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,800
2-1-4.

66
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,580
Hello, caller.

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,820
Something has happened in the motorcade.

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,260
Yes.

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,080
I believe I can see Arnold Palmer showing up.

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,820
You mean he's alive?

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
Something did happen.

72
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,540
No, he's not alive.

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,720
Temporarily alive.

74
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,960
Not for long.

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,380
Oh.

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
How do you communicate with him?

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,980
How do you communicate with him?

78
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,180
Communicates quietly.

79
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,000
Foot gland.

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,340
Have you been glandscaped?

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,100
Which I think he's practiced a great deal since he was born.

82
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,980
Have you been glandscaped?

83
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,700
Excuse me.

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,020
I see.

85
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's see if I can get it right.

86
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,360
Yes.

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,980
Teddy.

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,360
Bobby.

89
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,760
Johnny.

90
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,200
John.

91
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,920
They're all here.

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
This will be the Kennedy Hour.

93
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,880
We will be here with all the Kennedy family, dead and alive.

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,140
For later interviews, any of you with political orientation,

95
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,040
questions can call in here at the KPFA hotline.

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,800
Just phone 848-4425 and talk to a Kennedy.

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,140
That's right.

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,500
And ladies and gentlemen, I'm most honored at this point to say that we will be going to camera one on the floor live.

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,600
This is Reverend Stang down on the floor at the Divival.

100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,200
Stilex, I think, is about to play.

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,860
Here they are.

102
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,460
Stilex.

103
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,080
We'll be right back.

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,720
Time to forget yourself

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
Sudden panic attacks

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,280
Like the break of dawn

107
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,600
Slowly the empty rise

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,300
Remember who you are

109
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,860
But let it dry and fall

110
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,880
This time just yesterday

111
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,940
You were losing your mind

112
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,680
Now it's complete and all

113
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,520
Make sure you're forgetten

114
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
I have no right or stage

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,520
To make it back home

116
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,040
Wait up, wait up

117
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,920
While you work it

118
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,680
We've got way down

119
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,640
While you work it

120
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not the one in control

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,680
I am a machine

122
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
And I do as I flow

123
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,740
I'm not the one in control

124
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,460
I am a machine

125
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,360
And I do as I flow

126
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,420
I'm not the one in control

127
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,480
I am a machine

128
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,140
And I do as I flow

129
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,940
I don't want to go

130
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,240
Try again

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,320
I won't ever do it again

132
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,860
Why are you working

133
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,420
I'm not the one in control

134
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,100
I am a machine

135
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,320
And I do it on my own

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm not the one in control

137
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,820
I am a machine

138
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,300
And I do it on my own

139
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,840
I'm not the one in control

140
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,960
I am a machine

141
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,120
And I do it on my own

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,260
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

143
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

144
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

145
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

146
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

147
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

148
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm not the one in control, I am the power, and I do as I go.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,780
I'm not the one in control ...

150
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:08,780


151
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,120
Bidwell

152
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,760
approach to it and it's

153
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,700
extremely vague and

154
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,280
our religion is based

155
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,840
on hypocrisy folks

156
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,100
don't ever if you ever

157
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,460
catch us being consistent

158
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,680
oh I don't know what to tell you to do

159
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
kill me

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,040
the Buddha said if you meet the Buddha

161
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,100
on the highway then you should kill him

162
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,880
and Bob said something like that

163
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,200
and there are people who think

164
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
they're Bob running around there and you should

165
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,140
go ahead and kill them

166
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,280
if it's really Bob

167
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,000
he's like Daffy Duck

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
he'll come back with

169
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,820
band-aids on

170
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,020
but if it's a

171
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,680
false boss

172
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,820
slack is dollar bills

173
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,940
slack is drugs

174
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,280
slack is a warm home

175
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,020
slack is the car

176
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,960
you drive slack is the

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,180
job you do for money

178
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,640
slack is that which the conspiracy

179
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,180
system

180
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,020
stole from you

181
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,600
they don't love you Bob

182
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,400
they don't love you Bob

183
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,820
they don't love you like I do

184
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,200
slack

185
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,600

If you have the cash, you can have your slack.

238
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,520
Money is slack.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,420
Something for nothing.

240
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Slack is green.

241
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,340
Slack.

242
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,080
Slack is government control for your protection.

243
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,160
I want more slack.

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,340
Slack is not for everyone.

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,440
You cannot take my slack away.

246
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,900
Slack can be taken by prescription.

247
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,640
A used slack for sale by the great king of slack, Reverend Bill T. Miller.

Thank you.

252
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,100


253
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,100


254
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,100


255
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,100


256
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,040
And we're going to get some of the stuff that we want to do so badly.

257
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,980
And now with the injection of this age force that you have received through the regulation

258
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:03,200
of the cash flow and the invokin of the yakutismic forces, and the true aesthetic beauty life-death

259
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,300
force of the universe is coursing through your veins, we now look at our work and go

260
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:17,900
through it, plan every step of it, every, every facet of it until there it is.

261
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:17,980
And that's it.

262
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:17,980


263
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,220
crafted, polished, completely, perfectly assembled.

264
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,740
The great jewel, a great jewel of something,

265
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,580
of some great expression that we've wanted for so long.

266
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,340
And we focus it, we examine it, we look at it,

267
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,460
holding it there with the energy from it feeding back to us, from us,

268
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,680
as it is us and we are it.

269
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,160
And then we blow it all off.

270
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,760
That's right, friends.

271
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,060
At that moment, we just blow it all off.

272
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,920
We snuff it out.

273
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,480
We throw it away.

274
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,160
We say, yeah, well, that could be done.

275
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,860
Could be done.

276
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,500
Could be done exactly that way.

277
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,380
I know I can.

278
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
And so what?

279
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,500
Why should I?

280
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,560
And when you blow something like that off,

281
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,520
ah, the slack, it doesn't trickle in, friends.

282
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,920
It surges in.

283
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,840
It's a great injection of slack into your life.

284
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,180
Yes.

285
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,880
Do you like people?

286
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,620
No, I don't.

287
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,460
Do you like all kinds of people?

288
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,200
No, I don't.

289
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,200
That's wonderful.

290
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,860
Do you like adult films and other visual materials?

291
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm looking for a book on television.

292
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,340
Steadily expanding direction.

293
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,100
I think we can help you.

294
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,400
You do?

295
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,400
That's good.

296
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,240
There exists a number of positions.

297
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,140
You will find that there can be...

298
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,560
great variety and interest.

299
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,600
But you will be rewarded with real pleasure television.

300
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,640
People like you.

301
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,600
On wheels.

302
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,500
Did you get me that material on the sternocleidomastoid

303
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,140
and the zygomatic head of the quadratus levius priori?

304
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes, doctor.

305
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,440
Here it is.

306
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,560
Oh, thank you, nurse.

307
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,840
Pleasure work by Norell Preff there, friends.

308
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,140
And you can cop whole albums of Norell Preff

309
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,160
at heavyconfetti.com.

310
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


311
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


312
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


313
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


314
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


315
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


316
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


317
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


318
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


319
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


320
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


321
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


322
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


323
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


324
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


325
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,140


326
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,740
Yes, heavyconfetti.com, friends.

327
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,280
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it.

328
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,360
You can put it in your pipe.

329
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,480
Now, some people say,

330
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,100
oh, but Reverend Stang,

331
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,700
what about Bob's pipe?

332
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,260
What's he smoking in there, Reverend Stang?

333
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
That must be marijuana.

334
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,580
That's what Slack's really all about,

335
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,760
getting high and sitting around on your ass all day,

336
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
not having a job.

337
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,640
That's the pink boy dumbass version of Slack,

338
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
my friend.

339
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,360
That is the dumbass version of Slack.

340
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,460
The dumbass version of Slack is,

341
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm a slacker, dude.

342
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,180
I just sit, I donate, I work as bad

343
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,380
because, because, because, you know.

344
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,860
Friends, for some of us,

345
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,960
Slack is being as alert and aware

346
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,660
as you can possibly be

347
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,940
and keeping in that awareness.

348
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,960
The thought that you are indeed

349
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,960
smarter than those other dumbasses around you

350
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,380
who are trying to out-yell me.

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,100
You can't because you don't have an amplified microphone.

352
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,460
You can't, you can't be as dumb as Bob

353
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,180
because your face has not been mimeographed in Xerox

354
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,140
and put up in as many places as his hat.

355
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,200
Again, you may doubt,

356
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,140
to the polished ears of the modernist

357
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,180
or the liberal or the conservative,

358
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,540
you might say, well, that don't make no damn sense.

359
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,520
Pace fucking Bob!

360
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,740
And then you say, well, my friend,

361
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,000
what Reverend's saying, what about sex?

362
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,340
I've heard sex is Slack or Slack is sex

363
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,320
or something like that.

364
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,880
How often is sex really Slack for you, my friend?

365
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,900
How often do you achieve the ultimate ooze squirt

366
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,620
that will make you feel like you're a fucking dick?

367
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


368
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


369
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


370
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


371
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


372
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


373
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:14,620


374
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:25,460
What do you do, Felаете?

375
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:25,980
Why, I Kurt, what do you do, you furious

376
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,040
fucking sick asshole.

377
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,900
I mean sit.

378
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:36,480
Then I roll in the toilet.

379
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,160
Aye, aye.

380
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,200


381
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:54,180
So how do you know if you have the ooze squirt, the pure sex feeling that Bob and God and evolution put into your head?

382
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,320
How do you know?

383
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,920
You don't know, friends.

384
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,180
You don't know until you have emptied yourself of all that conspiracy programming.

385
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,440
And that doesn't mean studying the word of Bob, buying the videotapes, reading the books.

386
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,280
Of course you have to do all that.

387
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,600
But then you have to flush every bit of it out of your mind.

388
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,020
Because your mind is a toilet that the conspiracy has been shitting in.

389
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,460
Yes, the conspiracy has been shitting down your brain hole.

390
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,100
Mine too.

391
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm not saying I'm in any better shape than anybody else here.

392
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,120
As a matter of fact, I got a cold.

393
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,700
I'm hallucinating.

394
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,360
I'm half fucking crazy.

395
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,360
And that's when I'm healthy.

396
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,620
Pop that Bob on the brain, my friend.

397
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,440
That's right.

398
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,720
My shorter persevere.

399
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,980
My shorter persevere.

400
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,180
Bob does.

401
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,320
My shorter persevere.

402
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,740
Bob does.

403
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,720
My shorter persevere.

404
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,520
Bob does.

405
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,020
My shorter persevere.

406
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,920
Bob does.

407
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,180
Bob does.

408
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,800
My shorter persevere.

409
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,780
Bob does.

410
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,020
My shorter persevere.

411
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,380
Bob does.

412
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,260
Or I just don't believe him.

413
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,760
Or I just don't believe him.

414
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,960
Bob does.

415
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:35,960


416
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,720
Or I just don't believe him.

417
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,300
Bob does.

418
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,320
Bob does.

419
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


420
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


421
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,320


422
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,260
This is starring...

423
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,660
Al-Qaeda changes its tune.

424
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,360
We're by Ed Fred.

425
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,700
And now Dr. Onan Canobite on the road.

426
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,480
It doesn't matter if you're a vegetarian,

427
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,520
or if you eat hamburgers,

428
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,220
or if you're something else.

429
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,700
You know, a lot of subgeniuses have been on the Slatkins diet lately.

430
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,920
The only raw meat diet.

431
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,080
And it's true they've lost weight,

432
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,100
if that's what they wanted.

433
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,180
Others have gained weight, if that's what they wanted.

434
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,200
The Slatkins diet adjusts to your needs and your goals,

435
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,940
even before you knew you had them.

436
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,280
A lot of subgeniuses have been on the Slatkins diet,

437
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,020
Slatkins diet,

438
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,780
since before they were born.

439
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,880
How is that possible?

440
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,480
Send one dollar.

441
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,580
And you ain't heard the last, Ernest T. Banks.

442
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,420
Yes friends, we all make mistakes.

443
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,020
If we were like Bob,

444
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,240
we'd make a million dollars every time we made a mistake.

445
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,300
But if we were like Bob, we'd be as lucky as Bob.

446
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,940
And friends, I'm sorry, but

447
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,860
he's Bob and we're just friends.

448
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,760
That's why we worship him.

449
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,800
And isn't he a great person to worship?

450
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,460
Because it's not like he's going to show up

451
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,560
and make sure you're worshiping him right.

452
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,020
The great thing about Bob is,

453
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,120
you can be alone with Bob.

454
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,060
When you're with Jesus, you're not alone.

455
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,840
Jesus is still breathing down your neck.

456
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,860
He's still wondering whether you've been sinning or not.

457
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,600
When you're with Santa Claus, you're not alone.

458
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
He knows whether you've been bad or good.

459
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,140
Bob does not care whether you have been bad or good.

460
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,040
Bob does not care about your sins.

461
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,540
Bob came and comes again and again

462
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,860
to justify and excuse your sins.

463
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
Such as they are.

464
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,580
Most of your sins are...

465
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,720
You know, you feel so guilty about that bad thing you did.

466
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,380
Man, everybody in this room did that same bad thing.

467
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,860
Bob is not in the same room.

468
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:06,860


469
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,240
You're not impressed.

470
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,040
Unless you've come up with a new bad thing

471
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,500
that no one else has ever thought of before.

472
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,820
Then maybe that's what we call slack.

473
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,600
Among other things.

474
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,020
Oh.

475
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,620
Ha.

476
00:24:36,880 --> 00:25:06,880


477
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,520
Give me good Bob.

478
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,520
Give me slack Bob.

479
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,520
Give me brap Bob.

480
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
Give me brap, give me brap.

481
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,220
Give me brap, give me brap, give me brap.

482
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,980
Just kidding.

483
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,560
That's the way we like it here.

484
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,160
At beautiful WCSB.

485
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
At Cleveland State University.

486
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,600
Ah, yes.

487
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,020
The most noble college station in the world.

488
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,660
Except for the other college stations that carry this show.

489
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,140
Such as beautiful WREK.

490
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,240
In Atlanta.

491
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,920
The strongest.

492
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,620
Of oh, the southern.

493
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,520
potent power

494
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,600
college station. The rising

495
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,260
banner of the new south.

496
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,700
Not a flaccid whore of the old

497
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,060
confederacy, but a beautiful...

498
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,500
They do have a flaccid whore. Oh, well, of course.

499
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,740
But it is these

500
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,620
other stations that carry the

501
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,800
hour of slack. And friends,

502
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,540
we're coming up on hour of slack

503
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,560
number 1,000.

504
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,720
Yes, there have been almost... This is hour of

505
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,360
slack number 990.

506
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,620
One... Soon we will

507
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,740
come up to Bob's number 999

508
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,980
and then finally,

509
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
yes, the conspiracy

510
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,560
will fold in

511
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
half when we reach the magic

512
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,760
number of

513
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,540
1,000 hours

514
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,580
of

515
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,440
slack!

516
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,660
Hey.

517
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,140
Hey, Chico.

518
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,680
What you going to do with your slack?

519
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,800
I'm going to go after that blondie

520
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,080
guy. I'm going to cut him.

521
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm going to cut blondie. And then I'm

522
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
going to get him.

523
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm going to get him with my badge, man.

524
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,580
I think I'm going to go and buy some hot

525
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,640
chocolate. Hey, do you have any stinking badges?

526
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,060
I need a...

527
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,660
I can find you

528
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,580
the hot chocolate if you can find me some stinking

529
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,460
badges, man. I need some stinking badges.

530
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,080
Well, just take a look at these ones here.

531
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,700
See, these were recently removed from a

532
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,740
man's groin area.

533
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,900
Oh, an elderly man's groin area.

534
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
An elderly incontinency.

535
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,720
Yes, incontinency man's groin

536
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,620
area. And these came

537
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,280
from a small child's...

538
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,400
Well...

539
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Let's overlook this child. Let's move

540
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,060
on to the next child, please.

541
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,440
That child was not radio-friendly.

542
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,740
No, that was not a radio-friendly

543
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,920
child you were talking about.

544
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,400
Or any sort of mechanism

545
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,820
which flies through the air. You cannot hear her.

546
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,220
You cannot feel her. She's like...

547
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,660
I don't know, like an anti-radio wave.

548
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,260
Perhaps it is more like a...

549
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,660
No.

550
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,940
An TV. Anti-TV.

551
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Anti-radios.

552
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,580
The silent radio

553
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
signal, friends. Yes,

554
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,780
sandwiched between the layers that you can hear

555
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,600
and the carrier signal.

556
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,300
There is a third signal.

557
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,640
The DAWB signal that is

558
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,680
getting through to you and imparting to you

559
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,940
a sense of the slack you already

560
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,220
had, my friend.

561
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,680
You had that slack and you will

562
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,640
have more slack if you turn

563
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,560
up the radio. Let's

564
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:01,960
this...

565
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,340
...your third

566
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,020
nostril and let the

567
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,220
essence of the slack power well

568
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,240
up within you from within your well

569
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,900
swollen, good annual

570
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,360
areas. Millions of them smelling

571
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,280
the slack as they come over the

572
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,300
mountain were saved, Jeanette. You will be like

573
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,960
the badge of an elderly

574
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,420
groined man. Oh, Jeanette

575
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,220
was saved. The sub...

576
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,140
...genia here.

577
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,560
Uh-oh.

578
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,580
Epigenia? The dangerous?

579
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,000
Does his name appear in the book

580
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,960
of life, Lord?

581
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,780
Nay.

582
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,480
Cast in and into the lake of fire,

583
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,880
for the Lord is not slack concerning

584
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,900
slackness.

585
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,960
We've got, um, Williams, Terrence,

586
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,040
um, Clarence, Barron, Terrence,

587
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
uh, 2972.

588
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,200
Terrence Williams, 2972.

589
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,840
See, three thousand...

590
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,980
Oh, he was convicted

591
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,000
and found guiltless of

592
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,720
wearing a blank yellow

593
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,040
page. He said, uh, I'm writing

594
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,820
a book and you fill in the pages.

595
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,060
Here we are on page three.

596
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,680
Mr. Williams says in his own

597
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,740
eloquent way, he says,

598
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,820
Bob Dobbs has given me

599
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,640
more slackluster and flavor

600
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,880
than I've ever experienced in my entire

601
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,000
life. By the time I'm

602
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,720
ready to go, I've already gone

603
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,940
twice each day. And I don't have

604
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,980
to eat bran, it eats me.

605
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,040
Ah. Well, I don't

606
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,900
know for sins, but, uh, hey,

607
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,640
a good way to go. The prune.

608
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,740
Ah. The almighty

609
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,880
prune. Shoo ye not

610
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,700
the prune. And

611
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,680
and and and can't

612
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah, dried plums.

613
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,020
Yeah, right, whatever. And do not sniff

614
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,780
at the dried baboon. And don't

615
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,180
make sniffy faces. The dried baboon

616
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,940
is the key. Oh, now Bob's laying out a bunch of rules.

617
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,980
So now we can't sniff at baboons purple.

618
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,840
Those are not Bob's rules. Those are

619
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,880
my rules. Those are the rules of God.

620
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,720
As expressed in the mathematical

621
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
number of pi.

622
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,880
And here are some... The true name of God is

623
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
216 letters hidden

624
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,820
within pi. I read that in a book somewhere

625
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,020
or saw it in a movie or something.

626
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,700
And speaking of pi,

627
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,660
how late is that baker's pi

628
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,820
place open? I'm getting hungry. Oh, no, no,

629
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,740
no, no. No, no, no.

630
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,400
No pie, no baker pie.

631
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,020
We hate pie. Pie is baker bad pie.

632
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,800
Tonight is a pro people

633
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,460
anti-pie show.

634
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
We deal with deviated

635
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,320
septum, septum, septum,

636
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,440
septum. Yes, yes.

637
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,060
Unless they are septic,

638
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,860
they are septic.

639
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,900
Quadinal arches?

640
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,200
We like to climb them, alright?

641
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,040
Thank you.

642
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,640
Hello, this is a recording

643
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,180
that will not be repeated. Thank you.

644
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,740
Oh, thank you.

645
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,700
These

646
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,460
are the forces. This

647
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
is the power. And this is

648
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,440
65869.

649
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,980
Now what? What?

650
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,160
What is the most potent

651
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,360
invocation you can have against the

652
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,840
conspiracy?

653
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,680
Dot, dot, dot, or kill me.

654
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Say it. Kill me now.

655
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,080
And close your eyes and feel.

656
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,460
Go ahead, please.

657
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,220
You can't say on the radio.

658
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,920
On this call, we'd like you to use the T.O.P.

659
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay, I feel like 6586928.

660
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,300
Here I am having a feeling that I'm not supposed to have.

661
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,620
This is a good time to stop this tape.

662
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,020
Go ahead, please.

663
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,260
Oh.

664
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,700
Oh.

665
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,940
I'm gonna go down.

666
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,200
Where's my money?

667
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,720
Bye.

668
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,780
Man, I'd better do that.

669
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,260
I was struck naked right in the arm.

670
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,440
Paul here.

671
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,620
Oh, of course.

672
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,220
Hey, hey, puzzling?

673
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,340
It's puzzled.

674
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,800
Color Xerox place.

675
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,560
Nose around.

676
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,220
I'm gonna call Lies and see if he can tell me the truth about your location.

677
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,860
I'm calling you again about your fly.

678
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,560
I really need it as soon as possible, please.

679
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,580
Thank you. Bye.

680
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,860
Go underneath the atom ball, okay, Doug?

681
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,680
I'm gonna go down. I'm coming, Doug.

682
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,040
Okay.

683
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,880
Come, come, come, come, come.

684
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,300
Ah!

685
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,640
Ah!

686
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,540
I want $2,000 off Lyft or just kill me!

687
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,560
Yay!

688
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,180
You have reached Doug.

689
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,280
All our lines are busy.

690
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,940
As soon as one of our lines is free, you will be connected with today's curse.

691
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,940
Thank you for waiting.

692
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:40,140
He or she is a slimy-sided, frog-mouthed, silt-eating slug with the brains of a turtle.

693
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,120
Thank you for calling, you pathetic, cringing little milksop.

694
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,800
This is a recording.

695
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,800
In the name of Bob, I demand that you hang up on me right away.

696
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:59,240
Thanks to Dr. Phineas Narco for providing those cuts and clips that were by puzzling evidence.

697
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:05,740
And Dr. Howell and Bob Nelson and Gary Gabrogfran and all the rest of us old-timers.

698
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Uh, and now, Hellpulp Huey.

699
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,540
Actually, you're closer to the core of true slack than most.

700
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,360
By sitting and bitching about it and not chasing it, slack can come to you in its true form, unadulterated.

701
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:29,060
If you chase a cat bellowing, come here, you little bastardo, I wanna pet you, the only portion of cat you will experience is the egg it will lay on your pillow for your disruptive screeching.

702
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:39,560
However, if you dab a little tuna on your chin and lie there on the couch passively grumbling about your imagined laxin life, why sure as anything, that cat will come up and lick you right on the chin.

703
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,140
That tuna is your yeti hood. That cat is Bob and the effect of that licking is pure slack.

704
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:54,720
Going out among the pinks is a wretched thing on its own, but when used in its proper form as the psychic slide rule for divining the spaces between crap and shinola,

705
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,040
it can refine your sacred laziness and generate for you all the tuna you need.

706
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,040


707
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,620
Of course, if you just leave it in the can, screw you, I did my part.

708
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:15,660
After all, we have a fake president, faked enemies, fake patriotic gusto with balsa wood underpinnings, fake food, fake heroes, fake love, and fake Chinese dildos that fall apart after the fourth porking.

709
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,420
So I'll be really, really amused when one of those giant tripods steps on George and squishes him like in Bambi Meets Godzilla.

710
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,600
QEM do happy happy joy joy dance them very muchly, yes, min saheed, mmm.

711
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,060
isto habo Audrey

712
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,060


713
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,060


714
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,060


715
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,300
TKC

716
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,620
TKC

717
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,780
Thank you.

718
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,760
That ate my teeth

719
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,400
The coffee chair

720
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,380
It lost its shape

721
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,140
Destroyed

722
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,580
Destroyed

723
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,260
Destroy old things

724
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,240
And do it today

725
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,540
You broke a string

726
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,040
And you broke a string

727
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,380
Throw the guitar away

728
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,660
Find a new one

729
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,100
Now they're all so cheap

730
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,700
So what?

731
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,540
Who cares if it just lasts a week?

732
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,240
Destroyed

733
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,020
Out of date

734
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,640
Outmoded

735
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,900
Out of all of you

736
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:08,580
And out of all of you

737
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,540
Destroyed old things

738
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,860
And buy all new gear

739
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,560
And do it

740
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,040
Several times a year

741
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,620
Spend your time

742
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,780

Destroy it

747

Buy it cheap

748
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,320
Be smart

753
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,000
This brand new stuff

754
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,800
Your body's broken

755
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,200
Destroyed

756
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,460
AT a flash

757
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:27,460


758
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:27,460


759
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,060
But the budding public

760
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,640
Have already spoken

761
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,180
They purchase garbage

762
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,280
With a smile

763
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,920
With violent high

764
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,900
On top of stinking garbage pile

765
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Shock

766
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,140
Destroy it

767
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,800
You no longer care

768
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,700
Fix it all so it can't be repaired

769
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,180
Smash that trash, no hesitation

770
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,500
Destroy and vent out all your animal frustration

771
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,740
But what to do with all this waste

772
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,460
Fired into outer space

773
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,780
Would cost too much

774
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,020
Instead let's act fast

775
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,840
Destroy it with long-storming fire

776
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,480
Turn those heat-missing lights

777
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:58,040
Piles of trash into radioactive ash

778
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,500
Outsized

779
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,400
Outcast

780
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,940
Destroyed

781
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,500
Destroyed

782
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,500
Destroyed

783
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,040
Destroyed at last

784
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,280
All your new things

785
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
Destroyed

786
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,380
Will soon be broken

787
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,580
You'll buy them over again

788
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,600
Do you think I'm joking?

789
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,200
We can, we should

790
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,900
We can, we should

791
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,020
Blow it up real good

792
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,740
Blow it up real good

793
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,480
Destroyed

794
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,480


795
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,380
Destroyed

796
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,540
Destroyed

797
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,320
Destroyed

798
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,860
Destroyed

799
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,940
Destroyed

800
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,220
Destroyed

801
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,500
Destroyed

802
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,880
läh, leh, geh, eeh, go

803
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,160
Thevold

804
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,440
Thewatch

805
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,460
We're heavy!

806
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,020
We're heavy!

807
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,860
We're heavy!

808
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,360
We're heavy!

809
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,040
We're heavy!

810
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,680
We're heavy!

811
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,980
We're heavy!

812
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,000
We're heavy!

813
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,780
We're heavy!

814
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:16,500
We're heavy!

815
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,740
they might be buying at Woolworths in the next few days.

816
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,000
We don't know.

817
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,660
Only Bob knows that.

818
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,540
And the great thing about it is he doesn't care.

819
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,220
You are completely free of any guilt trips.

820
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,500
Bob just ain't judgmental.

821
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,180
You've noticed it's not called the Church of the Genius.

822
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,000
Have you noticed that?

823
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,320
It's called the Church of the Sub-Genius.

824
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,740
It's not that we're not proud.

825
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:57,620
It's that we believe that the conspiracy has misdefined intelligence for thousands of years.

826
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,180
So that now an intelligent person, that's your limp-dick-no-nuts college professor

827
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,680
that hasn't got his rocks off in 15 years.

828
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,820
But he made better grades than you, so therefore he's more intelligent.

829
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,540
Or Bill Gates, who made more money than anybody else.

830
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,200
Does that prove intelligence?

831
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,580
Of course not. You know that.

832
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,360
Then what we're talking about in the Church of the Sub-Genius

833
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,280
is not intelligence, but sense.

834
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,560
Common sense.

835
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,880
Sense of humor.

836
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,640
And dollars and cents.

837
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,400
Now, Reverend Carter LeBlanc was up here trying to get...

838
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,960
He was talking about the dollars and cents.

839
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,860
He wants you to go back to that table and get yourself ordained

840
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,300
so that you can do marriages.

841
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,840
Massaments, everyone, what are you looking at?

842
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:48,840


843
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:48,840


844
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:48,840


845
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,380
Subscribers the absorptions of all that shit.

846
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:49,800
Seriously, that stuff sucks.

847
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,580
It actually and a hurts the whitewashed dresses between cold and cold

848
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,400
and gunpla fires.

849
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,460
Disaster started to suppress your eyes in all kinds of my contains,

850
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,820
all this behind cose,

851
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,740
and of course you have a skin on your face,

852
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,240
and resources for a few 아이폰 Firmen are so bothering.

853
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,300
Would you like a few pieces of that stuff?

854
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:17,300


855
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:23,480
there to watch each dropping of each coprolite from each dinosaur sphincter. Bob saw. Bob sees

856
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,640
now. Bob always will see. And if it is not superfluous to add, the only faith that promises.

857
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,940
It may sound like we're endorsing the worst kind of conspiracy behavior. No, you only do these

858
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:42,680
terrible things to get what you need. Each caller hears a different thing. Well, it's my own idea.

859
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,160
Oh, now the caller's turned into a little dog playing the drums.

860
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,640
Sphincto's dead. Yes, it's Mimi Kemp's show now. That's right. We're trying to bring him back. We

861
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,600
just don't have enough juice. Sphincto is dead, but it's schmutz. I better send more money. Yes.

862
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,380
Dr. Howell, how do we get them on? They're back to Earth. Well, we have spilled a pure neutronium.

863
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,360
And now the neutronium is rolled down to the street level where the peasants will begin to

864
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,580
eat it and then kiss the queen, giving her the power of the neutronium. Yes, this neutronium,

865
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,440
the densest substance.

866
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,080
Known in the physical universe, it is going to be the basis of an entirely new review of the

867
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,760
tale which all of our foreign dignitaries, as well as the president and his charming wife,

868
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,680
will ascend in just 25 short minutes as the subgenius floats continue in this parade of

869
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:34,380
parades on the year of surprises. And here, moving at faster than sound, a giant transports

870
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:39,140
in a transportable... Leave them on. Dear God,

871
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,660
please don't let it...

872
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:49,240
...stray, rot, water chew off my genitals. And don't let my arms be pulled off by a threshing

873
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:56,200
machine. Don't let me crash on the freeway, mangling my legs and causing massive irreparable

874
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:02,620
brain damage, paralyzing me for life so I can't move, clean myself, or go to the bathroom normally.

875
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,460
Don't let me be stabbed in the head or be captured by a sadistic serial killer who tortures me in

876
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:11,020
his basement.

877
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:17,800
Don't let my building collapse in a horrific earthquake trapping me, all my bones broken

878
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,400
and split, smothered so that I can barely breathe, with my life slowly sleeping out

879
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,760
of me.

880
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,440
Please God, keep my skin from burning. Don't let me go blind. Don't let me be shot, slashed,

881
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:41,220
or bludgeoned to death. Don't let any of my organs fail on me. Don't let my bones snap for any reason.

882
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,820
Don't let my skull be fractured or my eyes get accidentally punctured. Don't let anyone

883
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:55,620
I love die or get sick. Don't let me become homeless. Don't let me lose all my possessions.

884
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:04,680
Don't let me be arrested or executed or tortured. Don't let me be raped or assaulted. Don't

885
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,200
let me be hit by a car. Don't let me get liver cancer. Don't let me get old and live in a

886
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,320
hospital. Don't let me be sick and helpless. And just don't let anything bad happen to me.

887
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,340
Please.

888
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:27,620
And in exchange for this, I will try to be a better person.

889
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,080
Please.

890
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,220
Please.

891
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,180


892
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,180


893
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,320
Please.

894
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,620
Please.

895
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:27,740
Please.

896
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,420
Please.

897
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,740
Please.

898
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,060
Please.

899
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,320
Please.

900
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,820
Please.

901
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,340
Please.

902
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,780
Please.

903
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,100
Please.

904
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Please.

905
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,940
Please.

906
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,960
Please.

907
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,660
Please.

908
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,180
News in Washington. From PR News in Washington, I'm trying to regain the momentum that brought

909
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,960
down PR News. The Walt Disney Company has announced that they brought Peter Pan to jail

910
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,960
in the Philippines. The legal team says he would be transferred elsewhere to be tortured.

911
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:27,020
And now an official reports from London. There's been military action against PR News,

912
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,200
symbolic status quo. Thousands of PR News in Washington. From PR News in Washington,

913
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,480
I'm sticking a gun in her side and tying her up to slowly lower PR News while at the same time

914
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:48,240
making room for more PR News. 61072244. Yes, you've entered the listener zone.

915
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,640
You're one of the listeners. Hello? Hello? Yes, hello, you're on the air. Oh, yes. Did you want

916
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,940
to hear Too Young to Date? I want to know everything I possibly can about Bob.

917
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,420
I must know more about this mysterious Bob.

918
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:19,800
This studio is slanting a bit. Oh, the gas. If you're in a canoe and you don't have that paddle

919
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:24,900
that you need, don't worry about it. Don't sweat it. There are lots of songs you can sing,

920
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,720
things like that. Things are nice, pretty, you know. Don't worry about it. Because I mean,

921
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,880
the problem is, you probably haven't thought.

922
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,980
The problems that you have at this time. Yes, and how much time do you have left?

923
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,180
I can't think anymore. It's 3.30 and you can't think anymore.

924
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,100
Why they didn't even announce they were going to test today.

925
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:52,460
No, Skull Farmers. They're testing the Skull Farmers again.

926
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,780
The rising sun will play thunder.

927
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,940
Being a driver in a panic, climbing the brakes on a positive note.

928
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:02,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

929
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,200
Yes, showing them how to breathe now.

930
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,320
What was that?

931
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:26,240
There they go. Teams of doctors off to the different heliopads to answer your needs at this hour in Berkeley.

932
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,660
And here on this program.

933
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,000
I glanced at Bob and then I saw a great whale of fright overcoming target situation.

934
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,060
Jacks are better to open.

935
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,380
This is Conrad Red alert.

936
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,520
This is not a test.

937
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,640
This is an alert.

938
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,480
Take cover immediately, everyone.

939
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,080
I repeat, this is not a test.

940
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,960
This is Conrad. Take cover immediately.

941
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,740
We are under attack.

942
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,060
How quiet it was under attack.

943
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,080
The competition finally found the following.

944
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,260
The first one.

945
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,460
The show.

946
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:07,720
Wait a minute.

947
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,620
I'm not asleep.

948
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm really on the show.

949
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,320
What's happening.

950
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,280
I wouldn't know.

951
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:13,760
Okay.

952
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:14,740
Listen.

953
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,060
Then we've got to find out what's happening.

954
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,280
Read the map or something.

955
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:17,540
Stop.

956
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,140
Stand up.

957
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,560
Put that cigarette out.

958
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,860
This is time to think.

959
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:21,620
Here.

960
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,160
Light up a cigarette.

961
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:22,820
Here.

962
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,100
Relax.

963
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,280
I don't know.

964
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,660
They said all of Berkeley was invited down here to start a show.

965
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,460
So we're all lined up outside the station here.

966
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:31,580
We each get two minutes on the show.

967
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:31,680
They're all lined up outside the station here and we're.

968
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,120
We each get two minutes on the show.

969
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,260
They'll get their two minutes too

970
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,200
Everybody gets time on the show

971
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,340
I understand

972
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,020
Well they're farther back in the line

973
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,080
Nothing to get excited about

974
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,900
It's just a show

975
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,100
Yeah I saw it too

976
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,260
At Dockstop

977
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,260
Trying to get away from the music

978
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,900
The music was so horrible

979
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,600
So bad

980
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,620
People running in all directions

981
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,940
Doing anything they could

982
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,340
To stop the music

983
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,000
Stop the music

984
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,200
And they watched for all those people

985
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,320
Who were buying lots of postage stamps

986
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,780
At once in suspicious amounts of course

987
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:18,560
And mailing lots of large boxes

988
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,380
That had radios in them

989
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,200
That couldn't focus on any one thing

990
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,660
Hello

991
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,940
I'm just trying to send this to Dallas

992
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,600
No it's not

993
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,900
The voice is not coming from inside the box

994
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,720
Let go of my box

995
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,840
Yeah right

996
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,760
Hello

997
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,900
I think I just wanted these tapes

998
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,180
You know

999
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,480
Yeah

1000
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:31,960
No no

1001
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,380
No you're one of the tapes we're playing

1002
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,140
We're really here

1003
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,400
Look buddy

1004
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,140
We can't be talking to you

1005
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,000
If you're going to be calling us up

1006
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,960
And ask us questions

1007
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,760
If you're not sure

1008
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,500
Then you have

1009
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,520
Not sure

1010
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,780
You're not sure you'd call us?

1011
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,240
Okay well then you have

1012
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,520
Some really old puzzling evidence

1013
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,840
From the 80s

1014
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,560
Thanks to Phineas Narco

1015
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,740
For preserving that

1016
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,860
Now next Dobbs is asked

1017
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,160
If he is a traitor

1018
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,460
Dobbs has embarked on an anti-traitor

1019
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,520
Trade tirade

1020
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,020
Too greedy

1021
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,880
Too vile

1022
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,200
Unnecessarily adversarial

1023
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,560
Now it's interesting listening to Dobbs

1024
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,320
He's a pro-capitalist component

1025
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,500
He's not really a capitalist

1026
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,360
Dobbs

1027
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,460
Dobbs

1028
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,860
In some ways

1029
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,120
He's so caught

1030
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,980
In this illusion of the ruling class

1031
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,940
Dobbs says

1032
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,520
When Dobbs is talking about

1033
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,280
Don't put the middle class competing

1034
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,500
With the third world

1035
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,540
Let's check out what Dobbs has to say

1036
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:29,940
Because

1037
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,440
Let's see

1038
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,060
Let's see how Dobbs responds

1039
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,280
To this whole process

1040
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:35,820
Dig this

1041
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,760
Dobbs is further advanced

1042
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,220
On this particular issue

1043
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:41,960
Than you are

1044
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,340
Now what's interesting

1045
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,480
In part about this

1046
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:45,820
Is that

1047
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,600
You know while Dobbs is right on

1048
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,820
You know some of these issues

1049
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,800
About as far as

1050
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,540
What is happening

1051
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,780
Let's check out what Dobbs has to say

1052
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,460
Dig this

1053
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,740
Mars needs women

1054
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,140
Mars needs women

1055
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,100
Mars needs women

1056
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,440
When Dobbs says

1057
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:01,640
When Dobbs speaks

1058
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,600
By Noro Pref

1059
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,440

Though friends

1063
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,120
The best place to go is

www.subgenius.com

1065
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,680
Ah yes yes yes

1066
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,680
That makes total sense

1067
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:44,500
Do you want to drive

1068
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:44,500


1069
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:44,500


1070
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:44,880
Sakuya

1071
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:44,880


1072
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:45,960
Press

1073
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,800
Bueno

1074
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:46,800


1075
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:46,900
See you

1076
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,240
Bye

1077
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:47,300
Ah

1078
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,200
MALE MODEL

1079
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,200


1080
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,200


1081
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,960
Come

1082
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:56,960


1083
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:56,960


1084
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,080
Come on

1085
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:57,360
We will

1086
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,040
But I'm driving

1087
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,240
No I can't

1088
00:58:59,240 --> 00:58:59,860
We'll drive you

1089
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,460
If you like

1090
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,440
No you sit in the middle

1091
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:01,440


1092
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,060
I'm sitting in the middle.

1093
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,040
Who says you were driving?

1094
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:03,960
I am driving.

1095
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,260
I'll get in the back then.

1096
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,380
I'll get in the back then.
