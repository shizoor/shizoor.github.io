This is Eric Johnson singing in ancient Cthulhuian language.
I'll try to translate.
Basically, he's saying, praise Bob and he through whom all slack floweth, or urinateth, actually is the correct translation there.
And it's a message about how much money you should send to a specific post office box.
In Iraq, for some reason, I don't understand.
This is really an ancient translation from stone tablets.
It's very atmospheric, though, wouldn't you agree?
And call, I think it also, he says, call in your pledges.
I don't know what that could possibly refer to.
Oh, no, it's the transition.
Today, today.
I must not fear, fear is the mind killer, fear is the little death which brings me.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
It's a Bob world after all.
It's a Bob world.
It's a Bob world after all.
It's a Bob world after all.
It's a Bob K-N-O-N.
I'm sorry, Tevis, it's not a Bob K-N-O-N anymore.

Yes, that's exactly right, friends, and we have a plot coming up here.
A plot.
A Connie-tite plot.
Or Connie, they, some of them say Connie-ite.
Bob says Connie-tite, that's what I say.
Mmm.
Uh, friends, yes, it's gonna be one of those Susie the Floozy shows.
Well, mixed up also with an Einstein Secret Orchestra and Reverend Stanky type of show.
And, uh, I had to do a rerun last week, and next week will be an all, uh, yes, so, Chaz show.
Because I've gotta go out of town and do a, by the time you hear this, it'll all be too late.
It's a winter star.
Uh, I...
Uh, the, the, the Pope Bob, uh, had to bow out, and that means I have to go do that, uh, show.
But, uh, but like I say, by the time you hear this, you won't be able to go, and you wouldn't be able to afford it anyway.
My dear, dear, dear friends.
Oh, you are such dear friends to me, personally, each and every one of you who, uh, spend.
Uh.
And we want to see you at X-Day.
Okay.
We want, we'd like to be lifted up with you.
That's how much we think of you.
We'd like to die with you, to die to this world, and to be reborn into Bob's...
The lust of the flesh?
Yeah.
Power.
Right on.
Control the world.
That's us.
Control the world.
Lust, flesh.
The pride of life?
Yes, baby.

I can do anything.
There's a freedom there.
I can do my own thing.
A release there.
I can get released.
That's just amazing.
I can just make a mess.
You know how it feels, don't you?
It feels good.
We all know how it feels.
Feels real good.
And sometimes we swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it...
Speak for yourself, buddy.
Swallow it, and swallow it...

Speak for yourself, dude.
Man.
It gets all the way down into our power.
Control the world.
Magic.
Yeah.
Applause.
There's something intoxicating about fame, about position.
And notice the little word here that says...
Reach around.
Bob will...
He'll pick your pocket, sure, but he'll give you a reach around while he's doing it.
And he'll take you into space, friends.
Bob, he'll take you and Susie the floozy into space.
Well, actually, just to be safe, friends...
Actually, just to be safe, friends...
You know, you don't have to worry about Y2K because you're going to be lifted off into outer space.
And you don't really have to build your own rocket ship.
Just in case.
You never know.
You never know about the...
Oh.
What good background...
Oh, here.
Friday sent the soundtrack from Day of the Dead.
That's always good.
And, uh...
Because I did...
Before we go back into the world of Einstein's Secret Radio, Volume 14, and the holiday shows,
and Susie's plot to be defeated by the Connieites or something.
I'm not sure where that's going.
I did want to share a couple...
Oh, X-Day!
Well, that's the main thing, friends.
Yes, X-Day.
And I think last time I was telling you...
July 5th, 1999.
The most psychedelic, amazing, camp-out, subgenius, outdoor, huge event activity.
The end of the world as we know...
Well, it's going to affect everybody everywhere.
But we subgeniuses would like to all go up at once if we can together.
And we have a hell of a party building up to it.
This particular X-Day, as always, the main event.
X-Day.
It is at Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York.
And you can get information about that from our website, subgenius.com.
Or you can call our toll-free information number.
Or you can send your self-addressed stamped envelope to the address that we'll give near the end of the broadcast, dear friends.
But when you...
Most of you already know about that stuff.
And as we've been saying, we're going to...
Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Orchestra is sponsoring a gigantic test launching
of home magic.
made rocket ships, flying saucers, space shuttles, and perpetual motion devices.
He has already gathered together 16 gigantic rockets and a Yakutisma skull that will all
be simultaneously launched, carrying with them into low Earth orbit a lawn chair holding
lonesome cowboy Dave, a six-pack, and a parachute.
Friends, you know, bring explosives, plywood, scrap metal, rockets, and build your own ship.
Have at it, man.
And even better, we're giving prizes for best theme campsite.
Even better on the way to Brushwood, stop at Hangar 18, Area 51, Studio 54, Cape Canaveral,
and steal your own ship.
Pack that frop up your exit wound and excrete your own fuel.
We must, my friends, we must learn how to escape.
Escape the gravity chains of Earth without being dependent on either the conspiracy or
other extraterrestrials.
And I'm going to go up to this nifty Eric Johnson music here in the background and tell
you that, friends, yes, there are some practical matters we have to think about.
It's true.
Believe it or not, we have noticed, like you may have by now, that July 5th this year happens
to fall on a Monday.
And maybe some of you guys are thinking, oh, well, I'll celebrate the coming cataclysmic
judgment with my fellow subgenie up until Sunday night.
But I'd better be back at home and, you know, ready to go back to work by Monday morning,
July 5th at 8 a.m., just in case the exes fail to arrive at 7 a.m. like last time.
Backslider!
Backslider!
Backslider, my friend.
And your faithlessness, you know, that's like sticking a knife in Bob's chest and just
twisting it, saying that, oh, just in case it didn't happen.
But, look, let's face it, man, whether you have a membership card on you or not, everybody
knows that a subgenius cannot be ruptured and taken up to the escape vessels of the
sex goddesses from Planet X while clocked in and working for the conspiracy.
It ain't going to happen.
So, you know, are you really going to let your stinking Earth job come before eternal,
salvation, my friend?
Are you really going to go?
Are you really, really going to do that?
You know, why should you?
Do you really think that there's going to be a job to go back to anyway?
Seriously?
Friends, you're a subgenius, friends, and therefore, July 5th is your main religious
holiday, and therefore, you should get off work paid.
And you should insist on this.
In fact, if you don't, you are pink.
And we, the truly saved, will gather at the exit of Brushwood, mocking you as you drive
away Sunday evening, July 4th, to scamper home to your pathetic little home jobs.
Puk-tui!
And you probably thought peer group pressure ended with high school.
Well, friends, if you have any lingering doubts about making this admittedly costly journey,
then, for the love of Bob, do yourself a favor and get yourself somehow get hold of our X-Day
19-day.

and stoned with ecstasy as if you had actually been there.
And if you ever wondered just how weird 400 of Bob Dobbs' most devoted followers might be,
then here you will find your vivid and unrelenting answer,
like a National Geographic documentary about hell.
The Woodstock of the subgeniuses, friends.
You can see it all.
If you're too chicken to get there yourself,
if you can't build your own ship,
you could at least put a cassette in your own video deck, I suppose.
Well, let's listen to this nice Eric Johnson music for a minute,
and then we'll go back into one of those other dimensions.

Yes, really.
Did you ever know that you're my hero, Dave?
Oh, I don't want to start singing that.
You're the pee beneath my feet.
It's all mushy.
Don't you know that?
Do you ever know that you're my hero?
Oh, man, I remember when I was Dana Carvey or Diana Webb.
Do you ever know that you're my pride?
Lady Rife, if you'd seen that before the rally,
you'd start to get everybody in the mood.
And they'd all start singing,
Did you ever know that you're...
Get kind of a cute little grin on his face.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah, no.
Since that conversation started losing steam,
now that's our cue to go back
into the world of Sister Susie the floozy's brain.
Actually, this is all happening as a little skit inside her brain
being conducted by other parts of her personality
just to make her paranoid.
We love to do that.
Do that to subgenius preachers, ma'am.
And I'm not...
What the hell is this?
I'm not exempt.
Specialized schizophreniatric psychopharmacosexual therapies
administered by...
Nurse Decadence?
Decadence.
Wait.
Wasn't she the one who displayed dangerous Connie-ite sympathies
at the X-Day gathering?
Hmm.
Man, I don't know about this, but hey, it's...
It's happening on Stang's turf.
He ought to know she's kosher.
I'm just glad the flus here is solid with Bob.
Those Connie-ite bitches are bad news.
What I can't figure out is how decadent
snagged security clearance.
I mean, operating here in the very bowels of the church's
top-secret subterranean labs deep beneath Parkland Hospital.
Who signed off on the original work order?
Hmm.
This looks in order.
It's Dr. Batarudin of the Lymphnode Institute.
Well, he ought to know his stuff,
but why he shipped her here is beyond me.
These idiots have their hands full with Oswald and Wendy O. Williams.
Plus, Kerry Thornley just arrived on ice.
Yeah, maybe Batarudin just doesn't want bimbo breath
here going tits up on his watch.
It'll look good in the yearly Institute report.
Oh, damn it, I gotta think positive.
Aunt Dobbs wouldn't just flip off his investment in her like this.
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's gonna be all right.
I mean, after all, this is a church of the subgeniuses
home turf we're talking about.
We're in Dallas, Texas.
What could possibly go wrong here?
Central, this is Ted.
It's time to hit that off switch and get ready for immersion.
Oh, it's lullaby time.
See you on the other side, Caesars.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, four, six, ten, two, seven, nine, nine.
verein we manage,
down for the kids.

Kind of a two piece piece.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.

I'm going under.
I know you've made your choice before.
Now you've got to eat some more.
I know a place where you can crush.
Old Jack Smith, you've got to crush.
This old dude's been a potential.
Put him up for potential.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.
I'm going under.
I don't know, whoever it is, it sure hurts to have him inside my head all the time like this.
Ah, yes.
There is...
The Dobbs County prisoners are lined up.
The people that still refuse to give up their old religions and join subgenius are hurried here into the pits.
There's slacks taken from them.
They're lined up.
See here, Bob addressing the troops.
No, this isn't a phony film, listeners.
And the people here that are picking us up on the subgenius cable channel.
If you look really closely on the left hand of the screen, the Lies Foundation has prepared...
a place for the prisoners to sleep before their...
before their...
Ah, well.
It just takes me over the emotion.
It's...
I can hardly speak here.
It's seeing this dramatic time here at Dobbs Town.
I don't think it's strange sometimes.
We wanted things to be pure.
Why did everything have to be all mixed up and convoluted?
Why couldn't it be pure?
One thing.
One thought.
One cell.
No dichotomy.
One Dave.
No argument.
Leave me out.
Hey, who's that new chick down there at the end of the bar?
Luciferina?
Luciferina!
Oh, so glad to meet you.
I'm so glad to meet you too.
Heard so much about you.
Connie's mentioned you several times.
She has too, hasn't she?
That's...
Isn't that one of the apocalyptic secret things about me?
Luciferina is a babe, man.
She's bright red.
I mean, that's the way her skin is.
And she's of the red devil race.
Ow.
The underground people.
When she has horns, classics, and...

Classic devil horns.
And a tail, man.
A tail with a little...
Kind of a pointy lily pad shaped thing on it.
And she is built like the whore of Babylon, dude.
I ain't kidding.
She is a scarlet woman.
Uh-huh.
Luciferina.
They get like real big and real small depending on your own personality?
She plays the sister drum.
Princess, we used to play pool with her, didn't you?
Right.
Back during the...
Uh, the days when UFOs and demon... demon-led armies were sort of in cahoots.
Right.
There was, uh, demon-led armies around here for what?
Those were the Dave's.
Those were the Dave's.
You mean there was actually...
Those were the Dave's, my friend.
Dave's, my friend.
He thought his round of...
What...
What...
There was actually demon armies?
Who lock up the...
Oh, did she go away?
The girl at the end of the bar, yeah.
That was Beepo.
Beepo.
What about those days?
That was Beepo?
Beepo called in.
Beepo?
He went, beep, beep, beep, beep.
That's a joke.
That's a funny pun.
And left a little spattering of spine gravy on the telephone receiver.
Now, uh, analysis of the spine gravy shows that this... it was ejected by the, uh, the
excited radio, uh, personality, Lonson Cowboy Dave, on the, uh, the aid.
I don't know.












We don't know the exact number but it's, uh, this dish appears to be, uh, contaminated.
Contaminated with aids, a number of presidential aids...
We don't know where the infusion came in.
Uh, it could have been with the sample.
It got into the blood of the...
...present.
Stained dress.
This is the, uh, the dress, of course, is...
How many times I've tried it on in my own secret mirror of my mind's eye and wished
I was Pani Aker.
Just, you know, any girl that was kinda important.
Yvonne.
That's what I always wanted to...
When I was a kid, I just wanted to have that, uh, this thing.



Whenever I wore that dress, that crusted...
And boy, there's a lot.
Isn't there a lot?
That was just one time.
He was packing a mean load.
Anyway, when I've ever tried that dress on,
man, I would call myself Yvonne.
Really?
Yvonne Stong.
Yvonne Stong.
And I'd flounce and prounce around.
Little babalina.
What was that word, Princess Wee?
All flippy and jippy.
Flippy and jippy?
Say.
All flippy and jippy.
Yes, all flouncing around.
And I'd feel real sexy.
Seeing I feel pretty, like, what's her name in West Side Story?
And I'd start running my hands up and down the dress,
but then that would, like, totally spoil the effect
because, you know, instead of a soft, feminine body,
here is this hard, muscular, tall, you know,
built Schwarzenegger-like body that I have, unfortunately.
I...
You know, I've always wanted to look more like Mae West.
That's all right, Stan.
We can't all be built like that.
I know.
I mean, we, you know...
Mae West.
Mae West.
Mae West.
Oh.
Sorry.
Hey, I want to thank Jimmy Image for sending me down a whole lot of tapes.
I'll get to some of this stuff in future weeks, but...
Jimmy is imaginary.
We'll have to weave that into the mix.
Do people send you tapes?
Yeah, occasionally.
Jimmy sends...
He listens to the show, what do you call it, religiously, in your church,
and then he makes up cut-ups from the show,
plus his other errant-eyed lifestyle.
He lives kind of like a bizarre religious fanatic
somewhere near the fringes of society.
Oh, gosh.
You know, I try to avoid people like that.
What's up?

Bring me the head of Suzy the Floozy.
Come on.

Prepare a giant torpedo for Connie.
It's the only one I have left.
After, after...
After...



It's a funny, evil plan.
She's back again.
Bigger, more beautiful, and bolder than ever.

Bees are the words that she said
Well, your love has ceased to be
Well, you're the place for me

And the system works.

heterosexual wife, and then loses all interest in sex after menopause. But this is a myth.
Very few women actually fit this profile. The truth is, each woman's sex life follows its own
unique path of likes and dislikes, with ups and downs, and often through many phases.
One sex path is no better or worse than another, we are just different.
Furthermore, most women have various sensual and sexual personas within themselves.
We have been taught to judge them as either good or bad,
to allow some of them and others to fear and repress.
But according to our research, embracing and exploring
all individuals Россисьная inspirational 의지на



of our sexual personas is not only fun and pleasurable, it is empowering, liberating,
and healthy. In this video workshop, we will focus on two specific sexual personas, the
slut and the goddess. Oh, that's Annie Sprinkle. That's what that is. Oh, God, that's the mustard.
The pain is of no return, and you've breached it. Never mind. You'll love it. What was that?
Nothing to worry about. The pain is of no return, and you've breached it. No, now I get it. You'll
love it. Oh, yes. Hello, welcome to the wonderful world of sluts and goddesses. I say do that again.
And I'm going to be guiding you through a very exciting and stimulating adventure,
especially designed to bring you a lot of pleasure. Oh, man, this is the most retarded
videotype.
Folks, I've got a copy of this video. I have to, I hate to, I have to stop here and say that
this videotape that I've seen called Sluts and Goddesses by Annie Sprinkle, the wonderful Annie
Sprinkle, man, if there was any, if there was ever any doubt at all in your brain about whether
drugs cause serious brain damage, just watch this tape.
You will feel happier and healthier. You'll grow as a person. Expand your mind.
And you know, if it's not drugs, that it's only, that it's religion, man, what does that tell you, man?
Oh.
All of your senses and enhance your sex life. So you may even create some miracles and attain
enlightenment.
Oh, bummer.
See lots of violent adult action.
There we go.
Young, beautiful, curvaceous cuties.
Now you're talking.
And enjoy a secret visit to sex club life.
Praise Bob, he will come.
Join the Sex Club International and share in their lustful games.

The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video ring.
The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye.
Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain.
Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen is part of the brain.
The HTTP screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it.

Robin Hood.
Birds of the moon.
Still before.
The sun.
The sun.
The sun.

Oh, Hari, I've missed you.
Don't you forget that you're going for to the moon...
But I will surely return to you...
I beg you...
To respect me...

again
they are
to
stand
again
bummer
bummer dude
whoa
I think that was
something called theater of tragedy
Sterno sent me
a whole mess of
Scandinavian death metal
acid killer
burn down the church's rock
which
great stuff
it's kind of strangely labeled
we of course have also been listening to
Einstein's Secret Orchestra
on the
particularly the show of
December the 17th
1998 just before Christmas
and Susie
the floozies Bob
slack time funhouse
episode number
256
man
she's real proud of that
this is hour of slack number
672
now you're ready to
apply some makeup
if you can't remember which formula you need
just refer to your beauty profile
you'll want to take this list home with you
and keep it for future reference
we're full of eyelashes for that extra hint of glamour
and your fabulous
lining the lips will give you the collagen enhanced look
lipstick is extremely important and the final touch
remember when it comes to makeup too much is never enough
what what
what a thrill to have a massage
with vibrating steel needles
if you don't have time to apply your makeup
simply wear a mask and you'll be a woman of mystery
yes yes yes
you demon of darkness trick
it's funny to make you wonder
when you see how girls do that feel
forget it
apply red plastic nails for your slut persona
and long golden nails for your goddess
follow the grass girls
you haven't really lived fully until you've had your body painted
you can use grease paint glitter paint or use your own menstrual blood
this is a motion picture that depicts the secret cult of the devil

devil worshippers as never before shown
the hidden initiation chambers for the very special ones
the sacrifice of the snow maiden upon the altar of darkness
princess we must be sacrificed by susie
and weird
and pruning them
for special functions in the dance hall
yes
oh
hey susie
your seams are crooked
awaken your inner slut by slipping into some high high heels
a fitting pedestal for a sex goddess
or strut your stuff in biker boots
music
backing up your boat
rescue car
grief
what is the�
no
what is the
surface
how is this
blue
so
what is this
being
seen
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
Chaz and Princess Wee tried to sing, too.
It was just a sorry, sorry, sorry idea.
It's Christmas, man.
You're supposed to, when Christmas comes around,
you're supposed to think about the sweet little baby.
Hey, Zeus!
And you're supposed to think of him lying there all emangé
with an apple in his mouth looking like an N star
and the angels over his head
and think of, I don't know, good thoughts.
Check us all with Boston Charlie.
And Caliburn.
Jingle bells, Santa smells, Easter's on its way.
The first Noel, a cuddle on a lake.
Oh, no, Silent Night. Let's sing Silent Night.
I remember Danny, remember the second pathfinder,
you sing Silent Night, Stalker, Silent Night.
A little sniper, power up a pum-pum.
A little sniper boy.
Do you smell my sharp shoes?
Smell it.
Do you smell my sharp shoes?
I have an Uzi 2.
I have an Uzi 2.
Power up a pum-pum.
Yes, that was from the boys on the West Coast.
Lawrence, you're up there.
They don't care to a new negative.
A Christmas classic here on ESO Radio.
Did you play it?
Yeah, I played it earlier and I'm playing it right now.
Oh, they're so delightful.
They're just so delightful.
They're well produced and they actually sound like a chorus
on the Merv Griffin show or Andy Williams.
Oh, they wouldn't want to talk to us then.
No, they're all...
They're all as big a weirdo beatniks as we are.
Oh, no.
If they...
No, no, no.
No, they would just tell them guys together
and they'd do it, unlike us.
They'd just go there.
No, if it sounds good, I...
I'm a...
I don't think they'd...
If it sounds...
No, if they know what they're...
If they're nice and...
If they're oxygen breathers,
I don't know if they're going to want to deal
with the likes of us.
Well, you've kind of been making up
with the reptile side of life, though.
I mean...
Actually, I...
I gave up on the oxygen breathers entirely.
I'm working on the hydrogen people now.
They're not even people.
They're just blobs of gas, practically.
But, you know...
They internally synthesize the other gases
and keep on going, or what do they do?
Well, they live in an environment
that's totally antithetical to oxy life.
But, if that's all you can get, man...
You know, it's kind of like
mailing off for a Polynesian wife.
You can't find anybody
you can knock around in America,
so you mail her to her.

You can't find anybody
you can order from some country
where it's legal.
And bring them in.
That's why I finally had to get
a hydrogen breather.
Keep her in a tank.
Yeah, I was trying to get
one of them mail-order brides.
Somebody sent me one of them
executed, mutated monkey hands.
She likes it when I slap her around.
She just jiggles like a big water balloon.
Oh, wow.
She has no face, no eyes,
no features, no hole or anything.
You just punch in, sort of.
Hurts.
But, like I say, the main thing is
she lets me and oxygen breathers
breathe her.
Just slap her around.
She makes this noise.
It goes...
Well, buddy, she's letting you
slap her around.
You notice not only she's got
some pull-bucker blood in you,
but also that you are on the top
or on the ladder,
and she knows that she's an
unfearing hydrogen-breathing creature
when she's around you.
She depends on you, buddy.
Well, see, the thing is,
she kind of digs that.
Oh, so you're saying she's like
one of them New York bitch kind of
hydrogen...
She's one of those freaks, man.
She's a freak.
That's what he says.
I don't know, man.
That's dear clear of them.
They got all kinds of strange habits.
You know, some of them,
they're many, many, many more
millions of light-years older
than you think.
Hey, man, some of us are into hydros.
I'm a hydro guy, man.
I'm into it.
Don't put me down.
You know, I'm out.
I'm not going to hide in the closet.
Whatever happens between you
and that hydrogen...
I'm a hydrogen breather-osexual.
It's...
I'm so...
Oh, my God.
It's hard to score, dude,
in this sector of the galaxy.
I'm really waiting for X-Day.
So, sex goddesses...
We never said exactly
what phylum they were.
No, you didn't.
You never elaborated on this.
Bob didn't go into any
super extreme detail
out of which kingdom they might be.
Oh, he didn't is why you don't know.
You don't know either?
Boy, I don't care.
You don't care.
Hey, they're sex goddesses.
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.
That's it.
You already speculated
on what would happen
if they would, like, kill you,
kind of like a spider
can kill its own lover and stuff, right?
You talked on about that for a while.
We can't really trust these beings
which we're putting our trust in to.
Well, look,
you spent your 30 bucks
buying your membership
in Church of the Subgenius.
That's what you're paying for
is to pay the hydrogen-breathing
sex goddess monsters
not to bite your head off
after you have sex with them.
Well, if I go down
to X-Rated Place here
and I pay my...
As far as for massage,
I surely don't want somebody
to come out and hit me on the head
with a bowling pin afterward.
Well, that's probably
not going to happen
in this sector of the galaxy
with being paranoid
about a day.
Are you nuts?
Well, they had a big speed net
going on over there
on the east side of town.
They did?
Yeah.
In Cleveland?
That far north?
They had a big speed net
out on by the Kuiper Belt
last week.
Sheets going on everywhere.
Well, I guess
I've got to give you
Yankees more credit.
They wouldn't let you go
more than 10%
the speed of light.
Bastards.
Well, yeah, back then.
Well, that's why
the vice squad
just cracked it down.
We've got to cut out of here.
You've got Einstein's
secret fuzz buster ready, Chaz.
That's right.
We've got to cut out of here
as much as I...
Well, you know,
just Merry Christmas, folks.
We'll be here next week,
Christmas Eve.
So if you folks
want to call in on Christmas
with the real Christmas wish,
you can feel free to do that
because I'm going to be here
whether I like it or not.
It was a great wish.
That was a great...
I remember
that on...
Was it a song?
Beware Satan's clog
that was done by
a nude on the moon.
Till next week.
Keep your back untied.
Your hat in the saddle.
Your butt in the...
In your saddle.
Sleep under your hat.
It's a killer.
It's a killer.
It's a killer.

Lamb and rice flavor.
For older dogs.
Good night, kids.
Good night, Paul.
Good night, Paul.
Where's Chad?

Paul, when are you gonna come back to us?
He's in the car.
Paul, when are you gonna move back in with Ma and me?
You gonna be doing the squirrel supper, Paul?
Paul, where'd you go?
Conversation can serve no purpose anymore.
Goodbye.
