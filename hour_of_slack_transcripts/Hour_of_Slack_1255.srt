1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,920
Daddy!

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,760
Okay, don't forget to wipe, flush and wash your hands!

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,100
Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge!

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,220
At your home or in your car, this is where you really are!

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,300
We're very curious about that.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,140
His brethren would have understood.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,880
So if you missed our ad...

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,740
Go to the mountain and regurgitate, regurgitate.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,600
A little bit of spiritual pablum to you.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,060
And get a touch of God!

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,140
And a touch of the glory yourself!

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,520
You better stop thinking!

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,400
You better stop thinking!

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,960
You better stop thinking!

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,900
You're listening to the mighty...

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,060
Subgenius!

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,400
Our old switch!

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
Welcome potential initiates,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,480
and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,700
Starring Peter Cushing as the Doctor.

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,360
Confronted by a conspiracy of silence that paralyzed a village with terror.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,880
Johnny...

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,020
Seriously, before I say goodnight...

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,600
I like your cousin Monica, but isn't she a bit kooky?

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,840
At first, after my brother left, I went shopping two, three times a month.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,600
As I gained insight into this closed society, I went shopping more often.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,520
Week after week, hundreds of village and town of Hempstead employees, not only cops, but even commissioners, clerks, parks, and even sanitation employees,

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,820
many of whom I recognized in all sorts of vehicles,

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,940
they circled the streets of this gigantic ghost town around me.

30
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,940
These hangman-rope, sneak-deadly gangsters called the government.

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,740
They dropped their fake, far-staged con artist ploy of shuffling of papers when in the public eye, when in reality,

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,780
everything in government, taxes, bills, forms, letters, all court records, etc.,

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,580
are typed and printed by secret 2,000-word-a-minute computer brain machines.

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,560
There is no one decent and honest in any government.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,500
Every government employee is a loitering, lurking, believe-nothing, gangster, parroting puppet of the computer government.

36
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,420
They not only tried to crush me between their vehicles repeatedly,

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,360
but also repeatedly tried to run me down through red-light intersections.

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,380
All traffic lights in this country are controlled by the computer god.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,280
As I walk back and forth aimlessly to the supermarkets at the busiest times of days,

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,880
I so also reduce the prearranged stripping of supermarket shelves of the food I usually buy

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,940
by not going to the same supermarket, and reduce the occasions the supermarkets completely set up with government assassins.

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,420
You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:37,820
Maybe...

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,720
Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering,

45
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
a lot of history, but that's all over.

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,420
We'll be on guard now. We'll be ready for you.

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,120
So ship out! Come on, haul it! They're out already!

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,540
Wipe, wipe, wipe yourself, always front to back.

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,980
Carefully, carefully, now you have the knack.

50
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,420
Now we have to flush and wash our hands, then we'll be all ready for Bobby's birthday party.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Yay, Lizzy!

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,720
She is a super-duper pooper.

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,400
She can party with the best.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,420
No more.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,500
No more.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,880
No more diapers to get in her way.

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,940
We are very impressed.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,640
They've got men locked up for less than what you've done.

59
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,580
No! No! No! No! No!

60
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,620
Hey, God! Hey, God! Hey, God!

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,740
I gotta know how to go.

62
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,700
She knows when she has to go.

63
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,180
Have a lunch with a white woman.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
She's a Caucasian.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,420
She's a Caucasian.

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm a Caucasian.

67
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,740
Bob?

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:35,680
Always I wore a topcoat, not only to protect against deadly assaults, especially the tape and needle, but also I would put much of the food I purchased under my undershirt, like I did apples and pears as a boy.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:35,680


70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:35,680


71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,260
boy from the shopping cart in the back of the supermarket. Available only at your KPFA store.

72
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,920
Yes, you're asked for the Puzzling Evidence show catalog. Yeah, they kicked out the tied

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,620
restaurant and opened up the store next door. Okay, now we're walking through the aisles.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,260
Here are the little hourly figures. Oh, hey, look at this. You get taped to KPFA.

75
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,200
No, that's the Puzzling Evidence dance girls on cassette. Look at all those beautiful legs.

76
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,620
You can't say girls in the new age. No, no, girls, no. Babes. That's right, and if you

77
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,640
act now, we'll give you the map to Chorus Girl Beach. That's right, where all the chorus

78
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,740
girls go to get their suntans. That's right, the girls from Vegas, the girls from Reno

79
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,820
have to go somewhere to get those nice, even tans. And where do they go? They go to Chorus

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,080
Girl Beach. That's right, and if you act now, call and make a way for 445, you'll win the

81
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
map to Chorus Girl Beach. That's right. Find out where the chorus girls get their suntans.

82
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,740
Come on down now and call.

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,960
I don't know, you think I should order that thing? I think once you send away your check

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,260
to this TV place, I don't think they give you that stuff back. Well, trust me, man, I'm

85
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,920
a man of the clock. Feel this. Wow, that hurts. I gotta go out and get some of that mountain

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,060
spring water to fill up the bidet. I'll be right back. Oh, that's where you get your

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,520
drinking water from. You'd get it without the chunks, would you? Ah, sure is nice up

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,900
here in the future. Actually, let's open up the future door. Yeah. Hey, hey.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,180
It's a warning sign. Something's wrong in here. It needs fixed. Fix it quick, because

90
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,040
if you don't fix it, that thing will infect all the way back into your jaw, run up into

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,480
your brain. My wife had one running all the way back up and was touching into her brain

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,900
with infection. And if we hadn't found out what the cause was and grab that thing and

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,140
yank it out of there and grab that thing and yank it out of there and cleanse that place

94
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,980
out where it was, get out of there and grab that thing, get out of there.

95
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:48,260
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power. Thank you. Oh, I'm enjoying

96
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,580
this. Since we got all the hot, hot, hot mixing equipment, we've been having a lot of fun.

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Here's something my wife could use in the house. An iterocitor incorporating an electron

98
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,080
sorter.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh, she probably did.

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,080
Yeah, I need one.

101
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,300
I like to think of the top of the pyramid as when the Big Bang occurred, then slightly

102
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,300
lower down as when the X particles were formed, and then the quarks were formed, the nucleons,

103
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,220
the neutrinos, and the electrons. And by that time, one second had passed in the beginning

104
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,960
of the universe.

105
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,840
Right on.

106
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,040
But then came the nuclei.

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,500
Showtime is different, right? Radio moments are not quite linear time the way we think

108
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,520
of time in the Western society.

109
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,180
It took about one million years for these atoms to form, and boy, did I get bored. Then, I

110
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,600
think you've got a bill of goods, too. Look at the size of these atoms.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,040
I think you've got a bill of goods, too. Look at the size of these atoms.

112
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,320
Where do you guys get your information from? I'm just curious.

113
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,260
Oh, we have a pipeline.

114
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,000
In a sense, we are information.

115
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,080
So is me.

116
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,440
We are information as we travel through the air.

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,780
Okay, go ahead and tell them one of the biggest secrets in the universe. We are information.

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,440
No, I mean, we, I don't know about anybody else, we on this show are radio waves. We

119
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,420
are traveling around through the ionosphere, or some of it bounces back towards the AOD.

120
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,340
That's what you get.

121
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,060
And will you look at that?

122
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm going to look at that.

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,160


124
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,160


125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,160


126
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,740
All right, go ahead and look at that.

127
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,360
I have to tell you something.

128
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,420
Okay.

129
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,700
Well, I don't know if we answered your question correctly.

130
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,600
It was never...

131
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,200
She's still with us. We can, oh, now we've switched brains.

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,360
Yeah, we switched brains.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,620
Hello.

134
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:13,760
You're up?

135
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:13,980
Yeah.

136
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,380
Just take a switch to that brain. Take that brain out behind the woodshed.

137
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh, my gosh.

138
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,080
And show it who's what.

139
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,780
It's just a pile of toothpaste-like substance. Yeah, we can still hear you and you can still

140
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,040
hear us.

141
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,740
But if you start doing that, we'll just get all over the bucket here.

142
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,380
What time of year did the program start?

143
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,200
4.30 in the morning.

144
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,260
It started millions of years ago.

145
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,780
4.30 in the morning?

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,820
Is this every morning?

147
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,160
Right.

148
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,360
4.30 on Saturday morning.

149
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,620
4.30, I walk in here, I put on a tape, and I go home until I come back.

150
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
I come back at 6, I take the tape off, and that's it.

151
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,340
I get up, I turn on the radio.

152
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,680
And now they're dead!

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
My God, that's worth the price of admission!

154
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,720
My God, that's worth the price of admission!

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,780
It's a virtual bloodbath.

156
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,760
Literally.

157
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,780
It's horrible.

158
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,100
Oh, bite me, it's fun!

159
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,180
I've been around a long time, Mr. Keene.

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,420
I lived through the days of redemption.

161
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,080
They say we're redeemed now.

162
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,380
Well, things could be worse.

163
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,660
Mr. Keene, when Unicom decided to ban the use of computers by civilians,

164
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,040
because, as they say, we screwed up the money markets,

165
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,100
we triggered the econocollapse,

166
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,220
we bought that.

167
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,360
We didn't like it, but we bought it.

168
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,060
Because that was the easiest thing to do.

169
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,740
And when they outlawed robots,

170
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,000
because of some demented vision about the Book of Revelations,

171
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,940
we thanked them for guiding us out of the darkness.

172
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Nathan.

173
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
But nothing much has changed, Mr. Keene.

174
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,580
Except you and I have lost a couple of our civil rights.

175
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,840
We're still as uneducated as ever, and self-absorbed,

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,080
and we're still in the middle of a war.

177
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,080


178
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,820
We're still watching the same crap on television we did 40 years ago.

179
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
Please love me. I just got a process.

180
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,160
Please love me. I just fixed my face.

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm wearing new cologne or new perfume.

182
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,120
Do you like these jeans? Do you like my car?

183
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,700
Do you know what I do for a living?

184
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,960
Do you know where I live?

185
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,680
Do you know what I want to do?

186
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,640
I ain't nothing else, but I'm going to be something.

187
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,100
You want to know what I'm going to be?

188
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,120
Please love me.

189
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,640
That's the whole human race.

190
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,360
Please love me.

191
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
So we try to find a way to live.

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,860
We try to find it in our wives.

193
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,140
We try to find it in our husbands.

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,600
We try to find it in our children.

195
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,800
We try to find it in religion.

196
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,120
As I came up in the church, first of all, in my home.

197
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,100
I wanted to please my dad.

198
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,060
I want to please my mom want to please my parents.

199
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,240
I want to please my grandparents.

200
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
I'm both sides.

201
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,760
And I wanted to please my older sister and I desperately wanted to please my older brother.

202
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,280
And I wanted to please my family and be accepted by them.

203
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,200
By the pastor and the bishop and the superintendent and district missioner.

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,300
And the churchmother and the head of the elders and the Sunday school teacher.

205
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,060
And my school teacher.

206
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,280
teacher and my coach and my principal and all the students who were going to vote for me i want

00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:31,720

210
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:46,200

211
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,940
maggots it's true but i always deny them

212
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:02,320
my essence they can't touch that they can't even know of it duh look at the planes the birds the

213
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:12,460
other creatures of nature they're nothing compared to the maggots i've seen the maggots i've smelled

214
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:21,480
the maggots palmer that i've tasted tasted yes maggots of pure

215
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,300

maggots of silver of plutonium it will all be ours someday palmer they're all piglets they're all

217
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:49,180
swine on this planet but they are in unity indeed but a unity of sin oh but then we're all maggots

218
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,460
in bob's eyes

219
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:06,620
what are we to him the driving about in our petty ways what are we to bob and his friends if friends

220
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:15,260
they be if anything like friendship can exist on that level

221
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,440
we're all maggots in this world we're all maggots in this world we're all maggots in this world

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,940
you didn't understand me the world did not understand me they weren't ready for what

223
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:38,580
i had to offer but it shall be different for those who follow me for i've laid the groundwork i've

224
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:48,360
shown the way from our ruined cities and buildings hatred will always spring anew for those who are

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,340
ultimately responsible for this disaster and the people who are responsible for this disaster

226
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,780
the conspiracy and its helpers the normals but the struggle of our people has been so great

227
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:11,840
i can't believe it has all been in vain perhaps in another thousand years a man with a genius

228
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:21,640
similar to mine shall arise he shall pick up the pieces of my ideas and lead a glorious

229
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,720
rebirth of the subgenius church

230
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,740
well friends

231
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,460
those were the words of janer hypercleets who died as he lived

232
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:51,060
a raving psychotic threatening the art world with destruction his epitaph a seemingly endless list of

233
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:58,280
of grisly crimes against humanity written in the blood-stained pages of our history.

234
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:07,700
They form an everlasting indictment against the most inhuman barbarian the art world has

235
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
ever seen.

236
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,340
Next, of course, to J.R. Bob Dobbs, our prophet and guru, living slack master.

237
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

238
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,800
Well, here we are, back again.

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:28,220
And it is the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack, yes?

240
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,260
Something mysterious for those who've never tuned into this station or certainly this show before.

241
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:46,160
I should mention that Bob Dobbs actually hasn't done any of the materials and pieces of tape you've been hearing.

242
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,600
. . .

243
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,920
So far.

244
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
. . .

245
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,360
But, in fact, actually, let's see.

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,180
Let's see, what have we been listening to?

247
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,840
Now, friends, there's some lovely media barrages there by Joe Riley.

248
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:07,740
And also, the Reverend Ott pieces and some other submitted by Reverend Uncle Jimmy.

249
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,540
Our dear friend, Reverend Uncle Jimmy, oh, thank you so much.

250
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,880
And, of course, some KPFA.

251
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,600
Dr. Howell.

252
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,460
Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence talking about the beginning of the universe and the subgenius store.

253
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
You see.

254
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,780
But are we there?

255
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,620
Are we there?

256
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,500
I don't know.

257
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,540
I think we need to build up some more spirit.

258
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:38,100
And I think we can do that thanks to Reverend John Bartels of New York who has sent us yet another tape.

259
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,400
. . .

260
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,140
Another evil tape.

261
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
This album called Born to Lick Salt.

262
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:53,520
And I think that you'll really enjoy the sweetness and light embodied in this song from Joe Bartels.

263
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,600
Dear friends.

264
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,800
. . .

265
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,540
. . .

266
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
. . . .

267
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:18,180
. . .

268
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,180


269
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,180


270
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,560
. . .

271
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:30,520
Someone blew up the savings and loaned while the ABS can. . .

272
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,520


273
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,520


274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:30,520


275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:38,600
trial dragged on and on they gave a couple rich guys a couple thousand years while the working

276
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,740
stiffs sit around in bars drinking draft beers

277
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:55,340
ronnie and dick jerry and george all skip town at the end of their tours now it don't take a

278
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,040
professional squabby to figure out this game of financial hide this umami

279
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,140
the congress was all crooked run by democrats who pointed fingers at the republicans who said

280
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:25,200
i smell iran while the big money lobbyists lined all the politicians pockets and all the junk

281
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,320
people and the rich guys and the rich guys and the rich guys and the rich guys and the rich guys

282
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,400
collapsed while the deficits got rocketed

283
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,300
they tried to stimulate the economy by starting a war

284
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:43,800
that didn't work they started two more they hired the israelis to do what was illegal

285
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,480
so they took away our guns and they had to protect us

286
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:12,720
and when they told us that the recession was the fitment of our imagination we declared another war

287
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,780
all the enemies of foreign conquest went for nothing

288
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,780


289
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,780


290
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,780


291
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,780


292
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:13,780


293
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,180
inflation

294
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,720
So they finally figured out

295
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,920
there was no one else to rob

296
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,740
They raised taxes on

297
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,660
the few guys left who still had jobs

298
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,940
Now the skeleton

299
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,760
sex closet are beginning

300
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
to smell funny

301
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,380
And they run around looking for the hill

302
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,540
where they hide all the money

303
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:12,760
Oh yes, uh, John Bartels, dear friends, and I probably should, uh,

304
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,760
uh,

305
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,400
tell you where you can write

306
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,960
for information on the albums of, uh,

307
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,160
Bartels

308
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,420
Got that pencil ready?

309
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,780
This is just Bartels' address, okay?

310
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,820
Not the Church of the Subgenius

311
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,640
But it's post office box

312
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
two s-

313
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,480
Uh oh

314
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,320
Yeah, it's post office box 288

315
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,160
Springwater, New York

316
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,740
14560

317
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,940
Well, and tonight is, uh, rather a random show

318
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,480
Yes, we've been, uh, slow to, uh

319
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,180
Uh, well actually we've been working so darn hard on this new, uh, uh, Bible

320
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,500
The new Subgenius Holy Book

321
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,460
That, uh, I just didn't have time to edit together all that much tape

322
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,820
Which means...

323
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,840
I'm gonna have to deliver a sermon

324
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Yes, it's true

325
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm sorry

326
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,220
But, uh, uh, but at least I don't know which one it's gonna be

327
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm just gonna, I've got 500 pages of book here

328
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,720
I'm just gonna open it up to, uh, any old page

329
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,720
And we'll just, uh, okay

330
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,060
Okay, fine, I'll do this one

331
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,300
Okay, fine

332
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,120
Well...

333
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,640
I'm not gonna do it off of that tape deck

334
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
I cannot believe it

335
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,720
Friends, you heard that little hideous whistle

336
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,460
I turned off, I gotta learn, I must learn

337
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,500
Don't trust, don't trust anybody's equipment

338
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,400
If there's been a pink anywhere nearby

339
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,520
If there's been a human being anywhere nearby, dear friend

340
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,400
Then you might as well just, uh, double check everything

341
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,800
That's, uh, and of course I don't know, I didn't know there were any, any humans that worked for KNFB

342
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,020
I went

343
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,080
But what the hell, friends, because the gods must be impotent

344
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,940
But you, you can't let these spooks, uh, spook you

345
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,000
I mean, face it, you've got one thing they haven't got

346
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,580
A body

347
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,700
I mean, what the hell is a discarnate entity gonna do to you?

348
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,640
A particularly violent poltergeist might throw plates around the room

349
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,740
Or some UFO-nauts might stick a probe up your keister

350
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:39,800
Or some UFO-nauts might stick a probe up your keister

351
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,320
Or a Bigfoot might let the air out of your camper tires and leave a stink

352
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,780
But there's no recorded instances of any of these critters actually killing anybody

353
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,900
Well, not many, anyway

354
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:59,560
But lots of people have been killed by those who believe what the voices in their heads told they

355
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,280
So we, the subgeniuses, need to fear these apparitions

356
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,740
Uh, energy demons and disembodied whisperers

357
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,300
But we certainly don't need the distraction from the blurry black light of B-B-BOB!

358
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:22,420
Many subgeniuses deliberately build up a kind of psychic static in their brains

359
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,880
To jam their signals and drown out the voices

360
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:37,420
Whereas some of you may be actively seeking to open up your mind to signals from, quote, higher thought forms, unquote

361
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:47,360
Talk to God, practicing divination, trying to heighten your ESP and invoking spirits and casting spells and so forth

362
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,700
Well, some of us have already been doing those things involuntarily

363
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,320
So long that it's just about driven us nuts

364
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,340
And now we go out of our ways to close ourselves off from all this input

365
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,400
Which at times can make you feel like your brain is a car radio on sound

366
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:17,160
And, uh, we may be a little bit more of a

367
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,420
But we seem to be in great demand throughout the etheric airwave

368
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,580
But the wise subgenius channels nobody but itself

369
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,300
And unlike the other creatures, posers, and art geeks

370
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,020
We don't use our spouting to fool anybody

371
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,280
Unless we intend to, that is

372
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,460
But with a birthright of one, uh, citizen per minute

373
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,660
Any clever enough preacher, politician, or salesman with a good frant riff

374
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,720
Can raise not only whole armies

375
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,400
But armies of conflicting denominations

376
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,740
Willing to fight to the death over what that leader really meant

377
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,400
When he was doling out instructions from God or the president or whatever

378
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,380
And once people get it into their heads that they're God-like,

379
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,560
And the gods and heroes want them to do something, there's no stopping them

380
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,920
The perfect microcosm of belief gone hog wild

381
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,700
Is the prehistory of Easter Island

382
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,480
Now until recently, those big carved heads on Easter Island were a complete mystery

383
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,920
Since the current natives had no idea why or by whom they were built

384
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,320
Archaeologists have since pieced together that hundreds of years ago

385
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,860
Two fairly advanced but competing cult tribes shared the idyllic island

386
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,200
Their preachers had instructed them to outdo each other in piousness

387
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,000
By building big idols, big stupid heads that looked sort of like Bob

388
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,580
In their eagerness to prove themselves the better head-erectors

389
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,440
And therefore closer to God

390
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,520
The two tribes managed to achieve severe overpopulation

391
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,060
Unending combat

392
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,800
And most importantly, to chop down all the trees on the island

393
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,760
In order to transport and engineer the cut stones

394
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,200
This totally wrecked the ecosystem of course

395
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,620
So the people were starving

396
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,820
A sign! A sign that the gods were displeased at them for letting the other tribes live

397
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,620
To this in turn drove the constant fighting in a vicious circle

398
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,900
Until it escalated to cannibalism

399
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,400
And both tribes were decimated

400
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,720
But boy were their gods impressed!

401
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,820
The survivors reverted to the stone age

402
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,840
Living nocturnally in caves

403
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,080
Afraid to emerge in the daytime for fear the bloodthirsty religious nuts might still be out there

404
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,500
Long after the fanatics had killed each other off

405
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,540
Their pathetic, wimp, bystander victims had forgotten their whole history

406
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,800
Their religion

407
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
The names of the gods

408
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,880
And even why the day was so long

409
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,420
The damn heads had been built in the first place

410
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,060
Uh...

411
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,180
Altogether, Easter Island represents the worst thing that can happen to a civilization

412
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,300
Self-inflicted loss of culture, history, gene pool, ecology, everything

413
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,100
It was like the perfect religious war computer simulation

414
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:29,480
An ant farm into which world history cycles could be compressed and observed

415
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,980
The exus, or somebody

416
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,360
Puts one tiny little ant Jesus down in there

417
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,480
And five years later the ant farm box is full of hundreds of teeny little ant Jesus statues

418
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,060
And thousands of dead ants

419
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:51,820
And maybe a few degenerate retarded ants who don't even know they're ants anymore

420
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,700
And without exus intervention

421
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,840
And who knows, maybe with it

422
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,160
The Easter Island Syndrome will take place

423
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,120
On a worldwide scale

424
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,280
As our planet gets more crowded and confused

425
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,920
Drug wars

426
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,340
Product wars

427
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,520
Civil wars

428
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,460
Race wars

429
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,620
Ethnic wars

430
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,520
Religious wars

431
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,160
Ultimately, it will become a perpetual battle between two types of fundamentalists

432
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,640
Each wanting so badly for their form to be the only one that both are destroyed

433
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,780
War is heck, dear friends

434
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,620
But we say, put a wall around all of them

435
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,040
And let them shoot it out amongst themselves for our entertainment

436
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,620
If they want to fight each other

437
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:49,700
Let them do it until they've totally looted, burned, smashed, and exhausted their cultures

438
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:55,620
If the ammo ran out, they'd still end up beating each other to death with pie pans and boards

439
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,260
Let them compete to see who can get the most people killed for their god

440
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,780
And meanwhile, both gods are ensconced up there in Asgard or wherever

441
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,240
Inhaling great lungfuls of human anguish

442
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,840
Wafting up from the physical world

443
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,660
Ah, smell that terror, say those gods

444
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,200
Smell those gourdons and gourdons of terror

445
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,140
Hey, don't hog all the garmonbozia, man

446
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,800
Give me a hit

447
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,420
Well, that's what wars are all for, after all

448
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,760
The gods are all for war, after all

449
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,600
And demons, who really are out there, even if the preachers are wrong about them

450
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,220
Get high on our tormented, squirming souls

451
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:45,660
As they're untimely cast adrift from our bodies by violent suicide or engineered diseases

452
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,620
Our death terror is what gives some of these gods

453
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,120
And several species of advanced space aliens

454
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,560
Just the boost they need in the morning, so to speak

455
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,900
It gets them going

456
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,560
Rings their bells!

457
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:10,580
And in turn, they keep religions and political movements driving the great machinery of human history forward

458
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,740
The sense of righteousness adds to the flavor of the endless battles

459
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,860
It gives them style

460
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,560
Otherwise, war would provide only the joy of killing

461
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,100
Without that special pride in doing good

462
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,520
Oh, and there's some doctors for Bob in the background

463
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,900
Actually, I think it's only one doctor for Bob

464
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,680
I think it's James Splice and his machines

465
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,340
Whoa!

466
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,480
But, you know, friends, there's no end to the hate

467
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,380
And the slobbering, killing

468
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,680
Oh, yes, the hate

469
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,720
The beautiful, the lovely hate

470
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,280
Come on, let's go!

471
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,660
Hold on now, let's get a perspective here

472
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,240
I am the Reverend Stang of 2010

473
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,660
And this is Hour of Slack number 1024

474
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,360
And I'm the Reverend Stang of the year 1255

475
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,620
But it is a re-run of Hour of Slack number 394

476
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,380
From the year of 1993, or thereabouts

477
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,560
The shows of those days were mastered on cassette tape

478
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,980
And I've labeled the cassettes by number

479
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,580
But almost never with the exact date

480
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,940
Go figure

481
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,100
I guess I didn't expect to do a thousand more weekly shows

482
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,240
Jesus

483
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,660
Anyway, this old ad is a little bit of a joke, but it's not a joke at all

484
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,120
This episode dates from when we were working on our book called Revelation X

485
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,100
And it features, among other things, readings of material for that book

486
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,800
Before the material was shortened and edited and censored

487
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,560
1993, good lord, my kids were in junior high

488
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,520
Crime and age

489
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,040
Just a second here, I gotta do something

490
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,140
You know, it was kind of funny what you were saying

491
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,340
Being a believer, you know, I'm like

492
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,860
I really had a heart and soul, body rock conviction

493
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,420
Been an atheist

494
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,520
Since I was about 12, I think, really

495
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,600
12 or 13

496
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,080
12 or 13

497
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,540
That's when my grandfather died, you know, I sort of...

498
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,660
There's something about the injustice of that

499
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,660
Especially since I had done a lot of real fervent praying

500
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,040
One of the few things I ever prayed for to God, you know

501
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,660
And, you know, I got my new guy

502
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,620
It's just really not...

503
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,500
You don't have to take it easy

504
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,800
And if you really exist, you know

505
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,920
I'm hearing it

506
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,180
If my soul is that important that you would want it

507
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,760
That I'm supposed to do all this stuff

508
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,740
Then you can at least

509
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,940
Just prove to me, man

510
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,900
I mean, it's faith and bull

511
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,500
Prove it

512
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,680
Show me you're as tough as you say you are

513
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,740
And of course, he didn't rise to the challenge

514
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,800
And, uh...

515
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,460
It's like...

516
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,580
It's a sad thing that we are born

517
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,180
To know at a certain age

518
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,940
Become aware of our own

519
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,100
Confined

520
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,940
Period of existence

521
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,380
Our own short life span

522
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,580
And yet

523
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,060
It's such a fine thing

524
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,960
That the same...

525
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,540
The same organ of cognitive awareness

526
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,800
That gave us this ability to...

527
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,440
To look into the future

528
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,840
And make comparisons

529
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,680
And realize with this thudding inevitability

530
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,120
At one time or another

531
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,300
That we are going to die

532
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,940
Can also produce these most miraculous delusions

533
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,920
And fairy stories

534
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,300
And myths

535
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:28,940
And concepts

536
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:29,940
And...

537
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,360
And...

538
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,220
And higher rationale structures

539
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,500
That support

540
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,100
Or would tend to support

541
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,940
Uh...

542
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
An afterlife

543
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,580
Or another level of existence

544
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,220
Right?

545
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,580
Is what we're talking about

546
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,760
That we would posit towards...

547
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,880
Towards an existence of the less material

548
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,440
Less physical of us

549
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,920
Greater than the material

550
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,220
Less gross

551
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,980
As if a recognition of our bodies

552
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,440
Are...

553
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,360
Are...

554
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,420
Are...

555
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,160
You know like the brain's recognition of itself

556
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,820
Has put the I

557
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,520
The me

558
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,160
The unconscious entity

559
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,540
That sits behind your eyes

560
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,580
And watches you watch yourself

561
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,300
That part of you

562
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,240
Cannot believe

563
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,600
That when this big old hulking chunk of meat

564
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,820
Full of squishing bags

565
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,080
And squirting organs

566
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,820
And thumping ribbons of flesh

567
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,620
And bone

568
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,520
And bellows of soft horrible porous

569
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,600
Gross looking materials

570
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,380
All jammed into a small compact carcass

571
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,820
When that finishes

572
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,620
This wonderful self

573
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,420
This me

574
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,800
This transcendental thing that saws

575
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,020
This is gonna go to...

576
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,840
No man

577
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,620
It's gonna be...

578
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,880
No look it's like...

579
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,540
There's a guy up there saying like

580
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,180
If you're really good or...

581
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,760
Or then it goes to uh...

582
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,080
But we see if we can...

583
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,060
If we can purge ourselves of the emotional

584
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,340
Uh...

585
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,640
Bond that we have with our body

586
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,140
If we can deny the zero by embracing

587
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,000
You know like that's the oriental concept

588
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,980
We can...

589
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,760
We can call it the great illusion

590
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,320
But it is the great illusion of the self because

591
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,900
There is only one self and that's me

592
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,020
I mean it's uh...

593
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,760
You can see why they haven't done much developing

594
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,420
In quite a few years there

595
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,740
That concept of...

596
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,760
The concept of uh...

597
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,700
Maya

598
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,300
But you know that Maya is a reality

599
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,320
It's just not the cosmic reality

600
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,100
You know

601
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,840
And patriarchal...

602
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,060
Patriarchalism

603
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,660
Whatever you call it

604
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,540
That's a reality too you know

605
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,260
But it's not the whole reality

606
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,940
And uh...

607
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,900
Bob is reality but not the whole of reality

608
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:53,740


609
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,440
Here's what you gotta guess

610
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,040
The allegorical, what

611
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,040


612
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,780
Up this time

613
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,160
I got another idea

614
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,920
But you can yank that down

615
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,500
Don't say stupid things

616
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,580
And say you've got this

617
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,580


618
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,580


619
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:20,640
Why do you keep had to Bohm

620
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Earlier

621
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,140
Oh

622
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,720
I

623
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,040
And calling it by any name is like being struck by lightning in midair.

624
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,440
Let us bow our heads.

625
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,460
I was struck by lightning in midair.

626
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,260
While negotiating the subtleties of a tornado at an altitude of 200 feet, brothers,

627
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,860
I fell to the ground and landed safely in a peat bog.

628
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,280
Later, I told my friends over a beer.

629
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,020
Boy, that was a close one.

630
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,180
I was struck by lightning walking down the street.

631
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,580
I was hit by something that's lying in my seat.

632
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:53,600
I was struck by lightning walking down the street.

633
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,720
She got up. She's healed tonight by the power of God.

634
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,280
What's happening to you now, lady?

635
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,080
I'm healed. I'm healed with all hope.

636
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,800
I know, Mito.

637
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,660
If you don't have any religion or if you do have a religion, it really doesn't matter.

638
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,160
If we're looking to Allah in Washington, no wonder we're in trouble.

644
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:38,660


645
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:38,760
Bye.

646
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,620
Bye.

647
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,060
Bye.

648
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,740
Bye.

649
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,040
Bye.

650
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,100
She was healed by the power of God by watching the Daily Broadcast.

651
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,920
Not anymore.

652
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,040
If you don't have any religion or if you do have a religion, it really doesn't matter.

653
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,540
If we're looking to Allah and watching a new Wonder Woman film.

654
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,960
Yes.

655
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,720
Dear Lord, dear Lord, what I see.

656
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,240
There's a mist going up that area right there.

657
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,240
I'm seeing it right now.

658
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,620
It's going up.

659
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,920
The power of God came on her when you spoke the word.

660
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,200
She was slain in the spirit.

661
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,960
She got up.

662
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,100
She's healed tonight by the power of God.

663
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,940
What's happening to you now, lady?

664
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,400
I feel like I changed my life.

665
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,460
I know, me too.

666
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,420
If you don't have any religion or if you do have a religion, it really doesn't matter.

667
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,880
If we're looking to Allah and watching a new Wonder Woman film.

668
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:22,960
What's happening to you now, lady?

669
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,640
What's happening to you now, lady?

670
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,400
Yes.

671
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,940
I just began to see it go right up like this.

672
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,060
It's showing it in its quick.

673
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,540
Oh, yes, dear friends.

674
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,940
A little bit of Ray Samortano there.

675
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,460
Oh, there.

676
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,720
Will, have that duck get it.

677
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:04,300
in here. That music there was by Ray Samartano from his Peeling the Big Blue Banana tape.

678
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:13,820
You can write for information on that particular album. The song, by the way, is called Slain

679
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:27,360
in the Spirit from Ray Samartano, 317 East Homestead Street, Medina, Ohio, 44256. For

680
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,620
those of you with your tape decks running, which I believe is illegal now, kids, isn't

681
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:43,800
it? But before that, G. Gordon Gordon lecturing off the cuff, probably, on Slain in the Spirit.

682
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:52,480
A little atheism and death, and a little music clip from Mondo Logic in Georgia. The piece,

683
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:59,800
I believe, is called Crap, because, you know, religion is a mental illness on an international

684
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:10,620
scale, although it's a particularly sissified form of insanity, if you ask Bob. You know,

685
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,260
you're a regular neighborhood schizophrenic.

686
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,800
You're a regular neighborhood schizophrenic.

687
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:13,800


688
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,560
If someone gets locked up, thinks he's going to take over the world. Now, that at least

689
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:25,440
shows some gumption. But religious schizophrenic, like your average Mr. and Mrs. Church-going

690
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:34,600
America, think that the world has already been taken over by someone else. The one who

691
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:43,600
might, however, withhold punishment if they kiss its butt, or his butt, slavishly enough

692
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:53,520
is God. And oh, they eat it up, dear friends. They love groveling and begging and confessing,

693
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:05,440
because for them, bliss is blindly following someone else's idea of God for eternity. And

694
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,780
they're burdened with no responsibilities, no tough decisions to make on their own, just

695
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:22,040
like babies off of the hook. And if they screw up, all's forgiven. Plus, they live

696
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:29,340
forever. The perfect deal. And actually, you know, friends, it's not that they love

697
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:41,580
God all that much. It's that they love the idea of the rest of us burning in hell. And

698
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:47,260
that's what's wrong with America. I mean, don't these humans realize that that anthropomorphic

699
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:56,280
deity they're emptying themselves into is actually Jehovah One? An ancient, ravenous,

700
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:04,900
alien space creature, writhing in a pit of chaotic subatomic mega-tachyonic time variations,

701
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:11,560
pretending to be God? No, he cavorts with pain.

702
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:17,900
It's the plasma angels from the Z-dimension. He's no benevolent father there for you to

703
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:28,200
count on. You're nothing but one of his crops. He's planning to sell you. Oh, he listens

704
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:36,620
to your prayers, all right. That's how he knows what scares you. All of this, all of

705
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:41,140
this was spelled out in plain English ten years ago.

706
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:49,600
The first book of the subgenius. But why, why do they continue to cling to their barbaric

707
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:55,840
superstitions when the word of Bob has been flailing right around, right, right there

708
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:04,060
in front of them all this time? They just want the world to make sense. Everybody does.

709
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,620
But we seem to be the only ones who don't expect it to.

710
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,940
To the pink.

711
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,340
The human, the mediocrity, and anything that makes the world make more sense must therefore

712
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:23,660
be truth. Whereas we're just the opposite. Anything that makes the world appear to make

713
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:32,660
sense is a lie. It's so simple in actuality, isn't it?

714
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,240
We return.

715
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:41,540
We return.

716
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,540


717
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:41,720
We return.

718
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,040
With the wackos from Waco, a segment of our subliminal punishment. It seems our crew on

719
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,040
the ground has unearthed this tidbitty of self-proclined messiah in the fortress is

720
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,420
actually an evil neck sucker. Just a rumor, no real confirmation on this, and this just

721
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:06,480
in. More folks with ozone-related skin tumors prefer creamy stumps, the hide-a-blotch oinkment

722
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,540
that lets you live, love, move with the mutants. Wherever you go.

723
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:11,540


724
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:18,260
We'll be back with the hostage crisis in Waco, Waco, after a cutaway to another hostage

725
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,120
crisis in Ohio.

726
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:38,520
We're here beside their humble RV parked in this humble toxic swamp in humble Cleveland,

727
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:38,900
Ohio.

728
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,700
To talk with the humiliating Mr. Lonesome Cowboy Dave, the self-proclam-baked messiah

729
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,720
of Cleveland and Lake Irridiculous. Known to some as the world's worst country singer,

730
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,660
and to others as the world's worst erotic self-amusive self-disabuser. But tonight, he

731
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:05,580
has taken two hostages. One, a Mr. Simon Nipplesworth, yet the hay pathfinder. His Native American

732
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,160
medicine man and psychiatrist.

733
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,220
Waco.

734
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:16,320
The other is a Easter scabby daze, a child genius retardo man of avant garbage music.

735
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,380
The eventually retarded garbage man is dangerously accident prone, even in a standing position.

736
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:29,260
Now, let's forget about the missing vertebrae for a minute. Mr. Lonesome Rectangular Cowpie,

737
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,280
our listeners want to know why.

738
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,200
Why, indeed. I'm the Lord. Any porky scam deemed fit should be removed.

739
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,320
I shall be called creation. Anything which comes into my mind and out of my mouth shall

740
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,520
be called REVELATION. I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of the communist golf

741
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,200
balls lodged in my brain. And being a deuce-playing left winger, I'm also God's slough paw. Amen.

742
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,120
Don't case.

743
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,500
Slough paw, eh? I used to play bald for the Middle City Hawkers. Used to catch, swallowed

744
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,560
more spitballs than Thomas Alma Edison. He was three tons bigger than you, though. A

745
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,180
great creator, but not as great as Mr. Lonesome.

746
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,180


747
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,180


748
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,920
as great a third baseman as Nikolai Telsla.

749
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,740
Now, where'd the name Lonesome Cow Pie Dwayne come from,

750
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,680
and what makes you think you're in the big cheese in the sky?

751
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,880
The name is not necessarily from pure boo-boo.

752
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,060
That vehicle was a three-ton Mack truck raincoat.

753
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,920
And I am the messy messiah, not the big cheese himself,

754
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,120
which those of us enlightened to secret scripture know as the Gouda Buddha.

755
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,900
Now, look, cow poop, if you're God, why take hostages?

756
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,940
Why not just will whenever you want into non-existence?

757
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,720
Hey, Dave, can we come out now?

758
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,340
My gonad's erectile area is sweating profusely.

759
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,940
It's hot in here, and I can't find Chekobat Finder.

760
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,940
What? You can't find Chekobat Finder?

761
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,640
How could you not find him?

762
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,700
I locked it both in the same closet as part of the hostage stick.

763
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,620
Scabby, if you're pulling my leotards, damn it!

764
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,760
I swear, he started chanting, and poof, he disappeared in the skim milk.

765
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,900
Then I got a real bad headache.

766
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,300
Then I walked in the room, and a puppy was on me into the duck tails.

767
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,980
Then I tried to peg legs, called him a goose, a goose in the wind.

768
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,220
Did I remember the flatulence?

769
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,440
Get back in there! I'm still alarmed. I'm still alarmed. I'm still alarmed.

770
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:32,880
Why?

771
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,260
Why?

772
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,700
Why?

773
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:34,060


774
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,100


775
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,100


776
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,520
Are you an idiot?

777
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,080
You're an idiot, Big Bacon. You're an idiot.

778
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:40,700
This isn't a real hostage situation at all, and no one will ever meet your demands,

779
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,760
even if you had any in the first place.

780
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,860
Well, that's all from Ohio.

781
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,180
Let's cut back to the armored meat cleaver telechopter in Army Dildo's, Texas,

782
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,580
or, I mean, Waco, or, I mean, Waco-uppo.

783
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,760
Woo! Woo! Woo!

784
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,840
Woo! Woo! Woo!

785
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,820
Woo! Woo! Woo!

786
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,160
Well, we're not at a hostage situation now.

787
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,460
We're at a dairy farm for this special mini-special on global warming.

788
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,960
Yes, global warming.

789
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,100
Is it because of the millions of tons of particulate matter and fluorocarbons and toxic gunk we dump into the atmosphere daily?

790
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:25,720
Or is it because dairy farmers insist upon feeding their cows gassy foods which produce flatulence?

791
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,060
Foods like soybeans, beans, think of it, just think of it, beans, thousands of cats, thousands of cows all erupting at once

792
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,400
like some enormous bovine, some enormous bovine volcano, that's it.

793
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,120
Hey you, in front of the cows, get out of here.

794
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,500
We're shooting a cheese commercial.

795
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,640
Who, me? Who are you talking to?

796
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,560
Hey, what's going on?

797
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:00,660
Hey, it's me. You're in the way of our cheese from Wisconsin commercial. Please move.

798
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,200
What if I move my hand away from my lap?

799
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,040
What if I open my journalist trench coat and expose my throbbing gristle like this?

800
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,240
Hey!

801
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,480
Oh my God, boss, it's disgusting. I've never seen such a disease unit in all my career.

802
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,620
You and the cheese shot by. Put it away, put it away.

803
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,660
Why is all the messentropes get the good lines and the microbes get the close-ups?

804
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,280
Why, look at this reptilian body.

805
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,040
Why do the messentropes get the good lines?

806
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,040


807
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,580
We shot at them like the close-ups. Why do the microbes...

808
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,240
No more cheese! No more cheese! No more cheese!

809
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,240
Butter cause, hardly any arteries. Butter cause, hardly any arteries.

810
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:51,880
No more cheese. No more cheese. No more cheese. No more cheese!

811
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,860
No more cheese. No more cheese. No more cheese. No more cheese.

812
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,020
I don't know Sarge. Maybe we shouldn't be here. All kinds go back home and say, it's wrong.

813
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,660
No more cheese.

814
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:04,740
Hey.

815
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,440
Hey, what happened to me?

816
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,560
Oh, no more cheese, dear friends.

817
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,580
That was my problem the whole time.

818
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,120
And it's also the problem of Brain Rot Radio Theater,

819
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,040
who is just on there with their Video Bleak show.

820
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,220
Number 120.

821
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,020
Yes, Brain Rot Theater in Cleveland.

822
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:36,500
And, you know, on this show, the Hour of Slack show,

823
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,840
we use bits and pieces of many, many other shows.

824
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,300
And you can get information about how we do that

825
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,900
and just what we do with all the rest of what we can't play on the air

826
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,060
and what we do with all those words

827
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,360
and where those books that we read from come from.

828
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,640
Because I'm going to give you an address

829
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,580
to write to for further information from the mighty church of the subgenius.

830
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,440
And I want you to get that pencil ready.

831
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:16,000
But first, I want you to listen to something that J.R. Bob Dobbs said in 1956

832
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,280
while trying to comfort an orphan at the first home for slackless children in Wichita, Kansas.

833
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,060
Bob said,

834
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,720
Son, there is no God.

835
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,340
But if you're any kind of real American,

836
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,540
you'll demand that he treat you as an equal.

837
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,920
You are an enslaved God, friends.

838
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,980
But you can hardly blame the poor mere humes.

839
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:50,360
After all, they've been dumbed down by TV and radio for three or four generations now.

840
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,680
The only way Americans can address questions of philosophy anymore

841
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,100
is through beer ad slogans.

842
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,620
The A.C.E.

843
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,720
The Apex of American Metaphysical Thought is represented by

844
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,940
Why Ask Why

845
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,760
and Grab for the Gusto.

846
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,280
They insist on a God they can comprehend.

847
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,200
Now surprisingly, God is measurable, but only in ineffabilities.

848
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,060
So the joke's still on them.

849
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,300
A God they can comprehend.

850
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,940
That's a lot to ask, especially for any God capable of creating even one universe.

851
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,700
Let alone the 36 known universes.

852
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,740
But that's not a lot to ask of the Church of the Subgenius at

853
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:50,660
P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

854
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,620
and also see subgenius.com

855
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,980
That's right, just drop us a line and ask for free information.

856
00:55:59,020 --> 00:55:59,920
It's free.

857
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,180
Free!

858
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,720
