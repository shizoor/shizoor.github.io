1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm supposed to start in late August or early September.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,580
This triggers a period.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,280
The Saudi Foreign Ministry says it will keep flying even if the mechanics walk off to the White House.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
The Democratic senator has died.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,900
According to his agent, Democratic senator died this morning of L's disease.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,600
He was five years old.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,260
PR's bad.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,840
PR's bad.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,780
On Wall Street, 10-6-4-6-5-5-1, NASA may test reports.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,560
NASA could pump in a super cold blast off, cut off, blast off.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,620
Engineers have been struggling to find the source of PR news in Washington.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,300
I was smart.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,040
I covered all the angles.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,420
I have an airtight alibi.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,780
Dicks, if you had anything to do with it, I want to know.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,320
Tell me.

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,940
Why do you want me to confess?

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,020
Because I'll have to get you a lawyer or maybe get you across the border into

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,860
The Self-Genius Power of Swatching.

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,680
Well, what do you think?

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm glad you're not a genius.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,780
Or a sick man.

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,540
The Aetherian overlords of the...

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,940
The UFO have thinking minds, feelings, and emotions like we do.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,380
Head.

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Another head.

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,480
You need a man.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,060
Bob.

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,920
Bob.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,640
TTTTTTTT government harassed.

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,160
And this has been coming to a head.

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,980
Coming to a head.

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,340
Coming.

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:24,700
Coming.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,080
Coming.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,340
Coming.

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,660
Head.

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,060
Head.

39
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,380
Head.

40
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,620
Head.

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,740
It's a small world.

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,120
Sex.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,240
Sex.

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,660
Sex.

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,100
Sex.

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Bob, I'm not going to ask you what you think of this.

47
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,820
The breakdown.

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,680
Breakdown.

49
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,100
Break.

50
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,300
Break.

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,540
Break.

52
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:34,760
Break.

53
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:34,900
Break.

54
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,020
Break.

55
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,080
Break.

56
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,140
Break.

57
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,160
Break.

58
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,260
Break.

59
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,260


60
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,420
Break.

61
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:35,440
Break.

62
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,420
Well, let me just kind of paint a little picture here.

63
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,320
Sexual freedom.

64
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,140
Putting condoms on plastic penises at the age of eight and nine.

65
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,500
So what's happening here?

66
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,140
Schools are teaching our children free sex.

67
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,660
Shove.

68
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,900
Things will get better.

69
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
We were very much involved.

70
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,600
So let me just paint you a little picture on a daily basis.

71
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,160
They really don't have any clue.

72
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Very nasty girls.

73
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,320
Wow.

74
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,720
Oh.

75
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,500
Oh, you're kidding me.

76
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,180
Feels good.

77
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,300
Watching videotaped sex.

78
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,340
Watching videotaped sex.

79
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,340
That's correct.

80
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,260
And in fact, the children now are even coming sexually aroused.

81
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,060
And homosexuality now.

82
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,980
I think I might be a lesbian now.

83
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,920
What do I do?

84
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,880
Details.

85
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,340
How to use their fingers.

86
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,460
How to use their mouth.

87
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,820
How to use their tongues.

88
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,380
Hey, I've been with a girl.

89
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Strippers.

90
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,180
Prostitutes.

91
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,000
Pornography.

92
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Phone sex.

93
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,080
Prostitution is an acceptable and moral vocation.

94
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,920
Stay up.

95
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,700
Very small staff.

96
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,640
I feel somewhat.

97
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,700
I feel somewhat impotent.

98
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,240
In the loop.

99
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,720
In the loop.

100
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,180
In the loop.

101
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,280
C-H-S-U-Z-H dot D-E com.

102
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,620
So many neat ways online to find out about.

103
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,660
Very nasty girls.

104
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Wow.

105
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,060
That was interesting.

106
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Wonderful.

107
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,860
We'll be back to make it.

108
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,660
Unmistakable evidence has established the fact.

109
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,340
Every three years, an ancient ritual takes place here.

110
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,580
Japan will probably get quite wet on both Monday and Tuesday.

111
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,220
What is your name?

112
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,920
So let it be done.

113
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,220
Not a bad cat.

114
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,360
Who is this fair young god coming to the house of people?

115
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,060
That was Lamprey Systems.

116
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,020
More of that from LampreySystems.com.

117
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,580
We've also been hearing and will continue to hear lots of collages by Reverend Norrell Preff

118
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,700
at NorrellPreff.com.

119
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,460
And Mr.

120
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Fernand and Andy Lemur, who does the titles and so many other things, such as this title

121
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,220
of this show, Hour of Slack number 1006.

122
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:47,100
And let's go straight back to the live stage radio from 8X Day Drill at Brushwood, New

123
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,620
York, which will be mixed with some canned live radio from KPFA, Puzzling Evidence, Dr.

124
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,240
Howell and Philo Show.

125
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,080
Any questions?

126
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,880
We'll be right back.

127
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,780
Where's the whelmanization that's supposed to be in this mix?

128
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,020
Well, the whelmanization creeps in, part of the entropic constant of the universe.

129
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,060
But instead of concentrating on the negatives, I think we should all extend a glistening

130
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,780
subgenius welcome to all who have come out to participate in this raucous, rambunctious

131
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,700
rolling festival.

132
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,240
How would that be done?

133
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,640
Would that be like strumming the larynx?

134
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,400
We would say...

135
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,620
In a u-u-lating fashion?

136
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
We would say praise those...

137
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Praise those who came from near, praise those who came from far.

138
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,640
Praise those who were born on Earth and those who were born on Mars.

139
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,300
From all the corners.

140
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,440
Praise Bob, praise Connie, and praise all the robots who help us here.

141
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,860
And the, uh...

142
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,500
And for us all, let us say...

143
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,780
Somebody said that that noise upsets the goose, the geese.

144
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,780
There are geese who live around here.

145
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:55,960
They're gone.

146
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
No, they didn't upset them.

147
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,700
They're gone.

148
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:57,700


149
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:57,700


150
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,420
They're out of range.

151
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,380
Sexually excites the geese.

152
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:00,920
They got excited.

153
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,760
If you will make the sacred salute noise like this.

154
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,000
In fact, if you can talk about voice to them while making the noise.

155
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,620
Then they'll...

156
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,940
You can get a goose egg and eat it for breakfast.

157
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,200
Shut up, pink boy.

158
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,980
Remember that?

159
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,140
That great old...

160
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,420
Shut up, pink boy.

161
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,220
Those great old days when the exes first spoke to us.

162
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,740
The Chinese is the most advanced of all human species.

163
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
A voice out of the whirlwind.

164
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah, when we first heard those transmissions, they...

165
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,200
We thought they were real.

166
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,580
Yeah.

167
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,640
Well, we thought they were just people.

168
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,880
Static blasts coming out of the radio chatter.

169
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,760
Earth must cease all atomic testing.

170
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
Shut up, pink boy.

171
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah, I remember.

172
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,220
It sounded a lot like that.

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,900
Some of it was thought to be even emanating from the sun itself.

174
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Part of the cosmic background chatter.

175
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,360
They later found it was coming from a star on the opposite side of the sun.

176
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,840
And that gave the illusion that it was just coming right through the sun.

177
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
A very powerful one.

178
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,960
It was just coming right through the sun.

179
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,180
Yeah.

180
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,180


181
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,700
Extremely powerful transmissions.

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,440
37.

183
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,620
My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks.

184
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,260
In a row.

185
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,540
And...

186
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,080
Action.

187
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,260
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

188
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,420
Praise the Lord.

189
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,900
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

190
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Why are we all forced to go to work at the same time?

191
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,660
Who arbitrarily decided that 8 a.m. was a good time for everyone to go to work?

192
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,720
What seems to be the trouble, soldier?

193
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,380
You look a little bit worried.

194
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,160
Well, I am.

195
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


196
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


197
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


198
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


199
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


200
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


201
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


202
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


203
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,160


204
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,740
I am, Chaplain.

205
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,260
And for the peace of my United States is under nuclear attack.

206
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,820
And take cover immediately.

207
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,260
What do I gotta do to get the throwbacks of the subgenius groupies?

208
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,760
And how do I go about this?

209
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,180
Well, you have to be at...

210
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,800
Are you talking about from X Day?

211
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
Well, yeah.

212
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,880
I don't mind sloppy seconds.

213
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah, well, I didn't either.

214
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,900
So...

215
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,960
That was the, you know...

216
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,680
Would they count it?

217
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,060
That groupie gets around a little bit.

218
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,480
Are you talking about Shayla?

219
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,800
Oh, you're talking about one particular person?

220
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,780
Is this one of the Love Corpses groupies?

221
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,260
Shayla?

222
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,600
One groupie, yeah.

223
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,460
I thought you were talking about hundreds of them lining up, like...

224
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
No, that's an X Day, yeah.

225
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,340
Well, the same one hundreds of times.

226
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,260
Anybody else need to be healed of their guilt demons?

227
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,500
All right, come up here.

228
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay, what have you done tonight, River Chrisley, that you feel that conspiracy guilt demons inhabit your ass?

229
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,560
I've really had a good day today.

230
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,660
Well, I'm sorry.

231
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,180
That does it for you?

232
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,620
I watched the news recently.

233
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Oh, there you go.

234
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,700
Put your hands upon the table.

235
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,220
Are you ready to be healed of the conspiracy guilt demon?

236
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,920
I think so.

237
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,180
All right, here we go.

238
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,240
Oh, yeah, those conspiracy guilt demons are coming straight out of his ass.

239
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,780
Oh, yeah, River Chrisley.

240
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,720
All right, you've been healed.

241
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,580
My friends, that was Reverend...

242
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,000
...Nicky Deathchick.

243
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Ah, yes, add to the most recent Cleveland subgenius devival.

244
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,960
Don't call me babe.

245
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,120
Another public service announcement from Braille Cream.

246
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,480
What?

247
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,120
Bugger me with a fish fork.

248
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,580
What are you looking at, buttonhead?

249
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,520
But this whole place sucks.

250
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,460
That's right, it sucks.

251
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,640
Hey, that new church air is just great.

252
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,960
Alert today, alive tomorrow.

253
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,200
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well.

254
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,540
Conspiracy!

255
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
I told you I...

256
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,780
Did I not?

257
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,840
Uh, no time for the old in-out, love.

258
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,540
I've just come to read the meter.

259
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,460
Well, Herr Doctor, I have an idea.

260
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,720
Take off your pants.

261
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,320
Me?

262
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,740
Take off your trousers!

263
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,380
Yes, yes, very good indeed.

264
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,420
It is very good, don't you think?

265
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,160
Excellent.

266
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
I can hardly be the gay companion you wish me to be.

267
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:54,120
Every so often I get a strong sex urge, and the only way I can take care of it is to masturbate.

268
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,000
Masturbate.

269
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,040
Masturbate.

270
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,440
Masturbate.

271
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,540
O...

272
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:18,200
I tell you, I'm closed in on your his-his, or the things being done, the事!

273
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,200


274
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,200


275
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,200


276
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,360
Welcome to the sec-

277
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,720
Wag Song of Sloppy

278
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,720


279
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,120
recognition tickling

280
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:20,680


281
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,120
by 2019

282
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,760
by Japan

283
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,100
by 2019

284
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:30,420
masturbate just like I'm committed a crime or something. It worries me. I say well, I won't do it anymore

285
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,740
And I come back and do it again

286
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,420
And when I do control myself for a while, I end up with a wet dream

287
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,180
Hanging from the ceiling wearing women's underwear get that out of here and

288
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,520
Naturally the loved ones tend to cover this up

289
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,260
But it goes even farther because in certain Midwestern states there have been

290
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,340
lonely farmers who have

291
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,780
Conceived a passion for say their their tractor

292
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,700
in a certain case we know of this

293
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,220
Farmer carried a picture of his tractor around in his wallet and he used to arrange things in the barn

294
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,040
So that he could pleasure himself with this powerful piece of farm machinery. Well

295
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,000
Things went wrong as they sometimes do and this unfortunate man's body was discovered with the tractor

296
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,820
still rumbling and

297
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,040
thrumming by his horrified

298
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,660
survivors who found him wearing a garter belt hose and crushed and

299
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,940
asphyxiated by his

300
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,780
reliable cherry red John Deere a tractor

301
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,460
He perished how do you explain that to June he perished as a martyr for love

302
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:51,780
Junior only your dad had he didn't die in a foreign land killing someone for hate or greed or for the

303
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:57,800
false specter of glory he died for love for an ideal of love and

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,140
Love with a tractor

305
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,560
Among the stars

306
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,820
Well, it was a tractor

307
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,760
It was a tractor. The problem was it was not the right love object. I know that's what I think

308
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,260
He did not stifle himself

309
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,260
I wish she was a tractor. I

310
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,060
Think you missed the point. Dr. Drummond. The idea is that

311
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,760
better to have loved and if I had a

312
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,740
Nickel for every point I missed I'd be a millionaire now

313
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,060
That is how Bob became a millionaire

314
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,820
He's got a nickel for every point he missed and for every opportunity that he lost praise Bob

315
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,560
but yes, the thing is just because Bob can make physical love to a tractor and come away unscarred and

316
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,460
In fact the tractor made to run better

317
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,040
and

318
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,280
he says you're not Bob

319
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,520
You can't you can't hump your tailpipe and expect?

320
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,860
anything but burns and especially when it's red hot after bumping over the

321
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,720
Wretched roads of rural Arkansas all day. You're not Bob. You can't you're not

322
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,120
No, but you have a Bob given Dobbs Ian nature. There is a you better tell some of these people

323
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,180
Bring out

324
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,020
But don't bring it out downtown Sherman. Yeah, in fact, don't even bring it out past that sign up there

325
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,400
But you can bring it maybe that you should bring it out

326
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,840
That guy right right come any closer than that than Reverend Chris Lee there if you're gonna bring out your abnormality

327
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,700
Particularly has like gunpowder or anything. Yes, if it's gasoline burnt from

328
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,240
Abusing machines if your name is Al or something, but you know sooner or later those robots are gonna get good-looking enough

329
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:47,940
They talked about the horror of Babylon, but they didn't say anything about how attractive she was her good-looking

330
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,660
Naturally, she's attractive. They make her look unattractive

331
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,200
She's a whore. She has to be fairly attractive just for a reason

332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,380
They don't want you to be you know spellbound by the idea

333
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,000
I mean a whore who only gets like one date in her whole career. She's not gonna be known very far and wide, you know

334
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,440
Not in the normal not like the whore of course a lot. Ah, she was so popular

335
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,260
back in her day

336
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,220
Of course, we're not speaking of the mother of she could carry on a

337
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,420
station a

338
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
semi Ramos

339
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,980
Nimrod the architect of the great tower of Babel

340
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,820
Before his time all humans spoke the same language the old solar tongue, but afterwards it was

341
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,900
transmogrified into the many

342
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:46,820
varieties of a jibber-jabber which now buzz around the earth and destroyed Nimrod's great project but

343
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,740
in-between

344
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,320
brokering the construction of the Tower of Babel

345
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,680
Some of which still stands in Iraq. He was also topping his own mother

346
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:03,860
Semiramis now would that be between the jibber or the jabber it would be between both jabbers and

347
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:11,100
Topping the stopping that was when worse the route from stop well, you know, we're talking to a bunch of adults here

348
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,600
I don't think we need to draw them a picture. It's important to draw the

349
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,640
diagrams and chart the exact philology that we need to understand where these words come according to

350
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,620
the Bible

351
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:21,620


352
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:21,620


353
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:21,620


354
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:21,840
The first part of the story is the story of Isaac's Christians

355
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,880
He committed an unnatural act and was forever cursed by the ire of Jehovah one

356
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
You know the story

357
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,380
So, you know the rest of the story just remember it for now

358
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,080
The shadow of the Tower of Babel was six miles long

359
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
That it's a full height which was

360
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,780
Was that at noon?

361
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,660
Not where it was located no

362
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,640
The arch of sita fun is nearby can still be seen although they'll probably blast it down one of these days

363
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:12,060
If you stretch my rubber till it's thin enough to tear I just

364
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,980
stretch my barb

365
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,720
like

366
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,480
You could just take your finger and only it's just your finger end times

367
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,900
angst the mark of the beast its technology that'd be great

368
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,960
I would do it big business. They want to keep everybody poor a Bob

369
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,600
Hey Bob, but I find myself praying for a lawyer

370
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,320
Well, Bob, you know, it's very reminiscent of homosexual rights.

371
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,220
Homosexuals deserve equal rights.

372
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,580
Yeah, and Bob, if you look at where we are now,

373
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,960
if you look at where we've come and go on and go on,

374
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,460
please, somebody help me find a lawyer if I need some help.

375
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,060
In the neighborhood, you'll absolutely love it.

376
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,440
Bob, my friend, God bless you.

377
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,960
Thank you.

378
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,320
Bob, my friend, God bless you.

379
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,840
Thank you.

380
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,440
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

381
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,860
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, use cash.

382
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,600
You could.

383
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,100
Use cash.

384
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,780
You could.

385
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,220
Do you believe the beast is coming?

386
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,860
Well, wait, wait, wait, we'll get there.

387
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,420
But we're talking about running your finger.

388
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,820
Okay.

389
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,380
You said you would have no problem doing that.

390
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

391
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,760
Well, that's another topic.

392
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,760
Let's stay on the mark of the beast.

393
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,260
Okay, well, I'm saying that's the mark of the beast.

394
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,120
Well, that's another topic.

395
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Let's stay on the mark of the beast.

396
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,600
Okay, well, I'm saying that's the mark of the beast.

397
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,960
Bob, use your common sense, Bob.

398
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,320
Bob, use your common sense, Bob.

399
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:27,580
No.

400
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,320
A bag of Fritos at 7-Eleven?

401
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
But they ought to know better.

402
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,220
They ought to know better.

403
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,820
What, Bob?

404
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,440
What, Bob?

405
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,260
Your finger running across.

406
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,920
Your finger running across.

407
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
Bob, it's a pleasure to speak with you.

408
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,140
Paranoid.

409
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,060
Paranoid.

410
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,900
Paranoid.

411
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,660
Paranoid.

412
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,420
Paranoid.

413
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,020
Paranoid.

414
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,800
You bring up what you ate last night.

415
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,680
The words in my mouth.

416
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,000
Do you.

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,800
The words in my mouth.

418
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,140
Do you.

419
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,380
I want to tell you about the mark of the beast.

420
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,260
Yes, ma'am.

421
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,300
At 666.

422
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
At 666.

423
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,020
666.

424
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,420
That serpent on the stick.

425
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,780
Bob's heart can be hard at times.

426
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,960
It is necessary.

427
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,420
Bob can have a tough love.

428
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,560
Most of the time,

429
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,420
his love is in a traditional sense.

430
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,700
You feel this glowing warmth from him as you pay him.

431
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,420
And then a departing sensation of dampness.

432
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
But there are times, you know, when you just...

433
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,280
Squishy pads.

434
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,260
When you end up after it's all over,

435
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,780
you have to go,

436
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,340
Thanks, Bob.

437
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I needed that lesson.

438
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,480
Bob, you sure hit the spot that time.

439
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,380
I didn't really need those brain sips, Bob.

440
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,880
Thank you, sir.

441
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
May I have another?

442
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,300
You were right.

443
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,760
I didn't need the use of my legs, Bob.

444
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,080
You were right about that.

445
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,160
Bob, I don't know.

446
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
I don't know what you did, but you just keep on doing whatever it is that you do.

447
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,900
All that blood was wasted being circulated through those appendages.

448
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,720
You'll know it when you feel it.

449
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,920
Do you guys, like, practice talking at the same time?

450
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,480
That's something I'm sure that all of the show listeners would love to know.

451
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,540
It just seems that whenever some of us talk, somebody else always talks.

452
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,440
But it seems that way to each person.

453
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,720
That's our style, man.

454
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,840
Don't you get it?

455
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
Yeah, in stereo.

456
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,140
In stereo.

457
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,880
In stereo, sure.

458
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,400
It's a Bay Area thing.

459
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,620
Well, in a better world than this, it would work out better.

460
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,700
It's all the perfect mixes on the Akashic Records.

461
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,140
And we'll get them all played back in just a few hours.

462
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,940
On the imperfection.

463
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,020
In just a few more days.

464
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,680
We must concentrate on our small fields of success, such as they are.

465
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,640
You lock into a groove and you just, you know, follow it.

466
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,940
Yeah, you get in the zone.

467
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,160
You get in the zone.

468
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,700
You hang in there.

469
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,080
Try not to act like you're born in a barnyard.

470
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,000
Try not to show it.

471
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,200
Try to act like everything's normal.

472
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,720
Yeah.

473
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,260
And everything is normal.

474
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,960
Whoa, where'd that come from?

475
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,280
Welcome, Mr. Happy.

476
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,300
Yes.

477
00:18:53,540 --> 00:19:00,440
So we want to welcome everyone with hope of encouraging and inculcating happiness.

478
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,340
Let's make Mr. Happy feel at home.

479
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,740
You've only got a few more days to feel happy, friends, before the X's come.

480
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,120
And you feel so much.

481
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,640
You feel so much total ecstasy that you've almost wanted to stop because you just can't bear it anymore.

482
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,660
It's not good.

483
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,480
Any minute now.

484
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm sure this will be it.

485
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,320
Yes, but you're back and you're still trying.

486
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,560
You're still fighting the good fight.

487
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,040
That's the important thing.

488
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,380
That was good.

489
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,980
That's probably the closest you will get, too.

490
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,380
The fib.

491
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,720
So enjoy it, my friend.

492
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,600
The faith in Bob.

493
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,920
The demented laugh.

494
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,620
In the dark.

495
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,940
Some people don't have enough.

496
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
The long step off a tall pier.

497
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,800
If you can't follow Bob blindfolded off that cliff, then what are you even doing here?

498
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,600
If you aren't ready to just take the pill, whatever it is, when Bob says to do it, then this could be a dangerous place for you.

499
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,200
What if you take the pill if I say to do it?

500
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,000
And if you have faith, those pills won't be larger than your head.

501
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,680
That's right.

502
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,660
Look at those pills.

503
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,640
I have trouble swallowing large pills.

504
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,400
So I can't join you in taking the pills at 7 a.m.

505
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,280
These are on the large side.

506
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,360
That's okay.

507
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,160
We have a specially compounded mini pill for you.

508
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,660
They're somewhat big.

509
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,840
No, it's the...

510
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,280
They must be absorbed into the body.

511
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,240
It is the will of Landon.

512
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,100
Old enema.

513
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,760
But X-Day isn't just pills, prairie squid, and face-fucking bats.

514
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,620
Certainly not.

515
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,620
No, it's a time of reflection upon, you know, on the good things and the bad things.

516
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,960
Of our lives.

517
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,160
Unless you've gotten so far that you don't have one anymore.

518
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,320
A reflection, I mean.

519
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:42,800
Right.

520
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,060
Well, we can only...

521
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,240
When we get on the escape vessels, we can become the living dead if we want to.

522
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,900
That is so.

523
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,100
We can become vampires.

524
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,640
Well, I think we'll enter into a new life.

525
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
Then we won't have to pay taxes.

526
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,380
The future...

527
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm banking on that.

528
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,660
The happy hunting ground.

529
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,080
You're banking on not paying taxes?

530
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,240
Yeah, I'm banking on the fact that X-Day will arrive, because if it doesn't, I'm going to jail.

531
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,320
After X-Day, they'll pay you taxes, Pastor Stank.

532
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,780
That's right.

533
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,540
Tax-ation will flow the other way.

534
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm going to go back to Texas and tax him to death.

535
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,140
Rivers will run backwards.

536
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,500
Ron Barr can tax Bill Ivan.

537
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,260
And trees will shrink to tiny seeds.

538
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,200
I would like to get you the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes.

539
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,260
I want to look at perversion, sexual perversion, incest, homosexuality.

540
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,140
Get down on your knees.

541
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,000
Are you being obedient today?

542
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
Spitting, snorting, biting, you know, and that other thing.

543
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,320
Right here, please.

544
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:38,980
A little bit harder.

545
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,980
Oh, thanks.

546
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
You better get down.

547
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,440
And have my face and somebody else's fat.

548
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,880
But destroy everyone.

549
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,660
Die on drugs.

550
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
We've kicked God out of our country.

551
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,800
Sodom and Gomorrah.

552
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,800
Big deal.

553
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,540
Wretched and naked.

554
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,280
But we're fat.

555
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,260
Are you involved?

556
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,260
Are you in?

557
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Number two.

558
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,080
What about you?

559
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,920
Why don't you do it?

560
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,500
What about you?

561
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,240
What about you?

562
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,300
Satan cleaned up and...

563
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,880
I like a pat on the back, too.

564
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,180
Sodom, you know...

565
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,400
They were hot.

566
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,880
Oh, I don't want any more.

567
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,160
No, I don't want any more.

568
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Look at me.

569
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,120
Wow.

570
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,080
Wow.

571
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,840
Wow.

572
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,580
All over the place.

573
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,020
Get back in line.

574
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm here, mother.

575
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,060
You're not going to hurt me.

576
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm number one.

577
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Gotta go.

578
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,280
You're not hung.

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,640
You're an animal.

580
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,280
You're an animal.

581
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,460
You're an animal.

582
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,060
You're an animal.

583
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,340
Give.

584
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,420
You think he hammered that one home?

585
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,300
Change my heart.

586
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,660
Satan.

587
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,880
Changed my heart of Satan.

588
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,240
An abundance of idleness.

589
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,580
From PR news in Washington, I'm caused by a grounding problem.

590
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,440
President Bush sent portographic emails.

591
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,720
Sexually explicit.

592
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,480
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld says,

593
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,760
That was mindless.

594
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,100
Rumsfeld was briefing reporters at PR news.

595
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,040
Recapping our top story, police have responded to portographic senators today

596
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,920
to try to prevent opponents from carrying out threats to disrupt PR news.

597
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,880
Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

598
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,140
Before that, some babaganda from Noropref.com.

599
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,540
But now, back to July 1st, 2005, as we await July 5th, 1998.

600
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,420
You know, have you all figured out what you're gonna grab on X-Day?

601
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,680
Are you gonna...

602
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,700
I know what I'd like to grab on X-Day.

603
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,980
I, for instance, have dibs already on the entire contents of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

604
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,340
I've got the Grand Canyon, okay?

605
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,460
Monument Valley, okay?

606
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,420
Just keep your hands off the plastic dinosaur warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada.

607
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,420
You can... now, alright. The towel's got dibs on the plastic dinosaur museum in Las Vegas.

608
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,700
I thought this has all been settled. We've got the map drawn.

609
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:52,840
It's actually just outside.

610
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't know what this is all just...

611
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,880
We're simply pointing out that there's a world available for the plucking.

612
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,040
For those who were here...

613
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,700
It's already been divided up, so don't think there's a lot of leftover space.

614
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,020
First...

615
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,280
Subgeniuses, uh, prototypical members of the new...

616
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,360
It's mostly been divided.

617
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,780
...the new race which shall populate the new eon.

618
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,720
That's friends, but there's gonna be a lot of competition with your fellow superior mutants.

619
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,800
When you get that spaceship, say, I'm gonna run over...

620
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:27,940
I'm gonna go to the Grand Canyon fast before one of my fellow subgeniuses fills it in with human skulls!

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,880
Because I may not be as vengeful as some of them.

622
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,000
I only have a few dozen people that I'm gonna put into eternal torment.

623
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,580
For inconveniences they caused me in the past. No more than that.

624
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,320
And I know some subgeniuses are going, I'm gonna kill everybody in Dallas.

625
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,420
I'm gonna... I'm gonna spray all over the world and just kill everybody.

626
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't care. I'm full of hate.

627
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,380
Reverend Stang, I have a question.

628
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,640
Well, that's fine. Go ahead and indulge your hate.

629
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,660
But give me a few minutes to... to rupture up a few of the collector's items that I wanted to keep.

630
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
And some of those include pinks.

631
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,740
Now, how would you deliver this paint?

632
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,160
I have quite a few living pinks that I want to have as pets.

633
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,460
And I'll trade with you later.

634
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,600
Would you deliver...

635
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,100
Do you see yourself delivering this paint in like... in the form... having to use a tool to do it?

636
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,060
Or would it just be like...

637
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,200
No, it'll just be in like a dream that Mrs. Darden...

638
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,060
There it is! There it is! There's the map! See, it's already divided up!

639
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,640
Oh, you missed it. Sorry.

640
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Yeah, we did... we did divide...

641
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,180
Dr. Drummond and I divided up the United States.

642
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,440
And so-so daughter drew it up as a nice looking map.

643
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,380
And you can purchase that map for only $40.

644
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,160
You can giant...

645
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,340
You can purchase one of the lands if you want.

646
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,120
You can purchase one of the states of the Union.

647
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
They're not completely sold.

648
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,440
It is on page 126 of Revelation X.

649
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
The concentration camp of normal land is still available.

650
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,740
Yeah, we've got... we need that.

651
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,300
That's most of Oklahoma. What's now Oklahoma.

652
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,140
The normal land concentration camp.

653
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,640
That's where we keep the normals that weren't wiped out.

654
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,320
But, do you know the Exists, when they gather up samples from the Earth,

655
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,140
will actually take some normals in their gathering camps?

656
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,140


657
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:04,140


658
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,220
Yeah, they will.

659
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,120
And so it actually won't be just the subgeniuses.

660
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,080
They will probably take, you know, for collection purposes,

661
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,180
one Republican, one vegetarian, and so forth.

662
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,840
Well, I was gonna do that myself!

663
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,160
They need something to grease the machinery with.

664
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,460
But they'll take all the subgeniuses because they are not alike.

665
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,180
They use the vegetarians to grease the machinery.

666
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,680
Each one represents a holotype specimen.

667
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,980
Each one is potential of speciation,

668
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,140
and diversity, and multiety in unity.

669
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,620
Praise Bob.

670
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,740
And that's why the general ruck of normals and Nelkis and so on

671
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,260
will be represented only by a skeleton crew of specimens.

672
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,220
Yes, Nelkis, that's what our German friends call pinks.

673
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:50,440
Really?

674
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,880
Nelki, yes. Nelki.

675
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,820
Is that German for pink? The color pink?

676
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,280
The German word for rose pink. Nelki, yes.

677
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,300
Nelki.

678
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,140
Nelkis und normalen.

679
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,960
Nelki.

680
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,440
As they say.

681
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
That's what the Nelkis!

682
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,960
What the hell, that sounds familiar somehow.

683
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah. There's a footnote in Revelation X,

684
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,900
but naturally you can't keep all this in mind with the many items on your docket.

685
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,900
You mean I should know that because it's in Revelation X?

686
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,440
It's a minor footnote in Revelation X, yes.

687
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:18,820
That's right.

688
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,140
Damn.

689
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,780
It's down there. It's not a header, it's a footer.

690
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,320
In the search for the method of communication with alien intelligences of space,

691
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,460
such as the overlords of the UFO,

692
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,600
rock and roll means sex.

693
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,920
Mind you have been abducted by aliens.

694
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,380
This sex craze.

695
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,360
Nymphomaniac.

696
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, I love to be naked.

697
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,120
You really are dangerously cute, baby. I gotta admit it.

698
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,540
Sugar.

699
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,620
I love it.

700
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,460
Be careful.

701
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,720
Look out for that UFO.

702
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,380
Mama.

703
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,780
Sugar.

704
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,300
Mama.

705
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,380
That.

706
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,240
That.

707
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,840
Is my UFO.

708
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,760
The full, locked in rock space

709
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,640
Video images and X-rated, ghost sex

710
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,420
Overload your memories

711
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,960
As I devour your gross clusters

712
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,980
And lick your beaks

713
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,240
Alien, android, succubus

714
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,180
Alien, android, succubus

715
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,800
It's more of a satisfaction of hunger than desire

716
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,420
More, more sugar

717
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,880
She's not a robot! She's a woman!

718
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,940
More sugar

719
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,500
She's a penis

720
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,420
Yeah

721
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:26,720
Yeah

722
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,900
She's a vagina

723
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,460
She's a vagina

724
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,280
She's a vagina

725
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,280


726
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah

727
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,480
Yeah

728
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:34,280
Yeah

729
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,700
Yeah

730
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,500
Yeah

731
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,660
Yeah

732
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,760
Yeah

733
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,560
Yeah

734
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:39,840
Yeah

735
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,100
Yeah

736
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,300
Yeah

737
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,920
More, more

738
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,780
Alien, android, succubus

739
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,240
Alien, android, succubus

740
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,440
cœur

741
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,260
Ah

742
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,320
Ah

743
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,640
It's an organic sludge that keeps coming.

744
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,660
Machines keep humming.

745
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,500
As the time walks and dances into a dreamland of dreams.

746
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,060
I love to be naked.

747
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,700
The microtech drops the entire soundscape for eternity.

748
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,960
Alien, android, succubus.

749
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,180
Alien, android, succubus.

750
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,180
I'm coming.

751
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,060
Thank you, Time Master.

752
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,640
Alien, android, succubus.

753
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,720
Can I have it?

754
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:10,380
Alien, android, succubus.

755
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,100
Alien, android, succubus.

756
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,680
This is from OBE, Out of Band Experience.

757
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,600
And friends, that's from BillTMiller.com.

758
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,300
You can go to BillTMiller.com.

759
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:23,940
That has all the information you need.

760
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,240
The album is almost out of print, but you can download the whole thing

761
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,340
and like ten other excellent rock collage type albums.

762
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,320
That's BillTMiller.com.

763
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,520
Now, back to 8X Day Drill, Stage Life Radio.

764
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,000
So, ladies and gentlemen, we're here, perhaps sacrificing some of our slack,

765
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,700
in the greater effort to bring slack to all.

766
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,540
And we must assemble at the...

767
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,280
precious moment when the great saucer will hover over us all

768
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,300
and begin to glean and collect us, the lucky ones,

769
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:10,800
for our act of faith and for our hewing to the subgenius doctrine and party line,

770
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:17,060
the only remaining definition of virtue in this imperfect world.

771
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,880
Well, that was beautiful, Hal.

772
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,380
Well, uh...

773
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,240
He just...

774
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

775
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,100
He just...

776
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,340
He feels...

777
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,820
You know, Hal has such strong feelings that he can just talk that way.

778
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,220
He doesn't have to write these things down and memorize them

779
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,160
like I do everything I'm saying right now.

780
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,460
Hey, you missed...

781
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,560
You didn't say that last statement right either.

782
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,420
I was just reading that.

783
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,020
You missed it.

784
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,460
Well, I try to fake it.

785
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,620
But there...

786
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,140
Mr. Q.

787
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,200
It's not often that you have Reverend Ivan Stang or Dr. Philo Drummond

788
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,840
or myself, Dr. Howland Owl, right before you.

789
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,660
And that's...

790
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:53,740
In the flesh.

791
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,580
That guy right there at the same time standing in that spot.

792
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,960
So you could ask us things and we could tell you

793
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,660
since we're all set up to do something...

794
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,260
That guy over there, too.

795
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,700
...in the nature of a service.

796
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,540
He's standing right in that one spot nobody stood in...

797
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,220
And it might...

798
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,100
...for at least 20 minutes.

799
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,600
...help us all on our journey away from slacklessness

800
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,500
toward that bright, remote point of light.

801
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,000
There's some rules.

802
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,260
There's some rules behind that.

803
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,900
Do you have your questions on pieces of paper?

804
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:20,580
No.

805
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,660
If you're going to speak, Mr. Thompson,

806
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,640
you're going to have to share it with all of us.

807
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,160
You have rules.

808
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,780
There's rules here.

809
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,460
You can't just do this Ask Dr. How thing without following the rules.

810
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,280
That's right.

811
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,720
I think it should be asked to all of us.

812
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,360
This great gentleman seated before you all,

813
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,300
the venerable Dr. Hal Robbins,

814
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:53,020
he is a fellow who I first met at the first IndyVival I attended,

815
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,640
a rather illustrative...

816
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,640
...loved gentleman I found then.

817
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,780
But he is possessing of a very unique talent.

818
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,160
And that talent is the knowledge,

819
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,440
the full comprehension of, you know,

820
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,740
of eldritch facts that have been assembled

821
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,660
in the great cultural history of this thing

822
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,900
called the Church of the Subgenius.

823
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,220
And you may ask him any question you like,

824
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,120
provided you write it on a slip of paper,

825
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,620
preferably include a $1 or more tip,

826
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,640
and he...

827
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,540
He will answer all.

828
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,620
He knows all, sees all, nothing but the truth.

829
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,880
Ladies and gentlemen,

830
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,700
Dr. Hal Robbins is at your disposal this evening.

831
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,540
Well, thank you very much, Reverend Alex.

832
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,000
But I think it's a bit much to ask people

833
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,980
who have already shelled out money to get here

834
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,180
to put money in envelopes, which we do not have,

835
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,180
and write questions on slips, which are not present.

836
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,220
But if they were present,

837
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:53,220
I would certainly read the questions and give answers.

838
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,860
Of course, the presence of questions

839
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,920
argues the existence of answers.

840
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,120
Neither have any actual palpable guarantee of existing.

841
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,640
But, boy, there's a great display of art there.

842
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,420
You can't even keep your mind on what you're doing, can you,

843
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,580
because you're looking at that art and you're losing track.

844
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,400
Well, it shows what...

845
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,620
It has the distractibility factor.

846
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,120
It's mostly your art, that's why.

847
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,480
Maybe you've all thought,

848
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,160
what are you going to do when you get on that great,

849
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,720
resonating, vibrating space vessel?

850
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,100
How are you going to find your stateroom,

851
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,580
your own personal area?

852
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,400
All these things will be taken care of for you,

853
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,600
as long as your name is on the manifest,

854
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,580
the passenger list.

855
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,680
You have to see the warrant officer,

856
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,880
also called the bursar,

857
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,760
to see if you're in order, if you're paid up.

858
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,580
It's important.

859
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,240
It may seem a trivial matter.

860
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,280
But, of course, everyone here has, if not paid in the lucre,

861
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
the long green,

862
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,560
made some distinct personal sacrifice to be here.

863
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,280
And we honor that.

864
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,160
Is that lucre like filthy lucre?

865
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,340
Well, filthy only in the sense that money is considered an imperfect value.

866
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,560
But it's the only value that is really constant.

867
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,640
I found that the one thing about money...

868
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,940
that it never lies.

869
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,740
The one thing about money is that no one...

870
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,620
It never...

871
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,580
will acknowledge even for a moment

872
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,060
that it might not have the value that's printed on it.

873
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,800
It never lies.

874
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,220
It never lies.

875
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,220


876
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,060
This exercise can be done sitting down.

877
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,860
If you choose to lie down on the floor,

878
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,180
do so in an uncomfortable position.

879
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,660
Straighten your legs, keeping them at your side,

880
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,640
and your eyes uncrossed.

881
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,860
Make sure that your spine is not touching your body.

882
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Let's begin.

883
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,380
Scan your body for feet and toes.

884
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,400
Now, pay attention to your buttocks and release the air.

885
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,440
Feel the warm air.

886
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,700
Focus on the sound and feeling of your...

887
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,880
What was that?

888
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,580
An internal explosion. A bad one.

889
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,580
Gas exploding in pockets.

890
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,540
No matter. Let them laugh.

891
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,620
And with each passing year, it became...

892
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,340
more and more evident that he was endowed with...

893
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,860
strange powers and abilities.

894
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,820
Far beyond those of ordinary human beings.

895
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,000
Jack off all trades.

896
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,160
Master baiter of none.

897
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,680
Okay, well, we're just winging it now.

898
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,580
We've run out of material.

899
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,720
We used up... That was our script.

900
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,400
We're gonna start ad-libbing for a while now.

901
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,360
Tell us a story about Bob.

902
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,380
Yeah, Dr. Drummond, you knew Bob in college.

903
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,660
I knew Bob when he was just a little boy.

904
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,100
And he lived in Fort Worth, and he lived down at the bottom of a...

905
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,800
No, he lived at the top of a big hill.

906
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,380
How about later when he was a...

907
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,480
And his daddy brought home a bicycle one day.

908
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,520
But it didn't have any brakes on it.

909
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,160
And little Bobby got on the bike and...

910
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,820
headed downhill.

911
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,020
Well, you know the story after that.

912
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,820
But what about when he was a teenager and a red-faced drunk?

913
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,580
What about then?

914
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,920
Sure, they said he was a drunk, but maybe his face was just red from embarrassment.

915
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,560
It was red from being a hearty enjoyer of life.

916
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,680
Oh, I... See, I do have a question.

917
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,040
It was ruddy. He had those kind of ruddy cheeks.

918
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,600
Dr. Drummond, I have been given a question here,

919
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,820
so maybe I'd better answer it. And it says...

920
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,200
Okay, I'll shut up.

921
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,940
My 18-year-old son won't come to X-Day

922
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,120
because he's afraid of the weirdos.

923
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,540
How do I convince him in the future to come?

924
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,940
Well, you know, the best way to influence the rising generation

925
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,280
is to be a good example of ourselves.

926
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,240
And it wouldn't hurt to raise your youngster with adherence to the weirdos' creed.

927
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,080
I, insert subgenius name here,

928
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,240
do solemnly swear to be under my own genius

929
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,180
and not that of the conspiracy.

930
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,440
My own particular spirit or genius shall be my guide.

931
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,260
Even if it tells me to swing out on that fraying rope swing

932
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,140
over the pit full of broken glass centipedes and rusty nails,

933
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,520
I will do it and take that leap into the unknown.

934
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,400
Because Bob is with me.

935
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,920
His pipe smoke enshrines and surrounds me.

936
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,420
And I shall have slack in the house of Bob forever.

937
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,760
Dr. Hal Robbins, thank you.

938
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,860
If that traffic light looks red to you and Bob says it's green,

939
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,260
what are you gonna do?

940
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,460
Who are you gonna believe?

941
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,860
You're gonna floor it, baby!

942
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,360
You're gonna push Bob out there ahead of you.

943
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,740
Prove it, Bob!

944
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,280
That happens.

945
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,220
That's how it works.

946
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:19,780
You, uh...

947
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,860
Because that's faith in Bob.

948
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
You know he can do it.

949
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,740
He's gonna go out there and prove it to you.

950
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,260
When faced with any difficulty of any kind,

951
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,740
bring out your subgenius faith,

952
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,320
your strong weapon,

953
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,440
your sword, your buckler, and your shield.

954
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,280
Yes, this is your secret method of triumphing in adversity.

955
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,100
And look, when everybody's panicking,

956
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,560
it's not really called shoving.

957
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,980
Yes, of course, people are laughing at him.

958
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,900
Toиеe who...

959
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,280
Male Voice Long after that,

960
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,160
a car they were then in rural Walton County west of Athens. However, local authorities hope $25,000

961
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,180
will spur more support for lynching suspects alive. Efforts to seek lynchings have been stepped up

962
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:24,880
since the recent PR news in Athens, Georgia. Stock prices $4.4, $10.13, $5.12, $29. The Dow $6.66.

963
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,140
A coalition of civil rights groups have set up clear plastic food containers to hold

964
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:36,880
suspects. Tribal elders exploded in the nearby hotel. Today, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld

965
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,340
predicted today that the groups working on PR news will be assassinated on schedule by August 15th.

966
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,480
Police in London say they've identified two of the four suspects in last week's PR News Washington.

967
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,280
If you want to know more, go to www.webcast.com.

968
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:19,140
I'm a friend of the Reverend Ivan Stang, and I was a normal.

969
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,880
Well, no, actually, I never was a normal, but I tried to be a normal.

970
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,960
Man, Bob shows up in the strangest places. All I can say is I'm glad I got over it.

971
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:30,860
It works for a while.

972
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,120
It's just a phase.

973
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,900
Oh, you can fool others for a while.

974
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,100
You can even fool yourself for a while.

975
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,160
I know that comes with who you convince you know you're talking about.

976
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,560
It's like that guitar player said.

977
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,660
If you can convince yourself that you know who you are.

978
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,620
Anybody can sound, any guitar player can sound like Jimi Hendrix for a little while.

979
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,220
For one note, yeah.

980
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,540
But you have to leave this wah-wah pedal behind you.

981
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,900
I can play like Jimi for one note if I have the right kind of equipment.

982
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,300
You have to indulge in some study of technique.

983
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,580
These are somewhat disquieting photos here, Reverend Stein.

984
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,240
Yeah, the subgenius art mine is not for the faint of heart.

985
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
No, they're for heart ignition.

986
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,500
The fired up of heart.

987
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,900
Heart ignition is the person who drew the ones that we're seeing.

988
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,600
And they're actually drawn, although they're drawn on a computer.

989
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,960
They're hand-drawn with a...

990
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,240
A hand somewhere along the line had something to do with their...

991
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,500
He goes by the name Heart Ignition.

992
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,400
And is that in the subgenius art mine?

993
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,220
Yes, that is also in the art mines.

994
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,560
I didn't print all of them, but we did publish some.

995
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,660
So keep watching, folks.

996
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,380
That's pretty sweet.

997
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,560
The important part, Hal.

998
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,360
Surrounding said blood-besmeared member is a cut-out paper Dobbs head.

999
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,960
I saw that. It was in this.

1000
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,360
That's why I said this was a rather disquieting photo montage.

1001
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,740
Was that the one that got your attention?

1002
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,620
That's the one that got my attention, actually.

1003
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,500
He put a Dobbs head on her with a big hole in it.

1004
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,780
I said, oh my lord.

1005
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,640
He had Dobbs and her at the same time.

1006
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,800
They saw it. You don't need to repeat it.

1007
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,400
During the sacred time of the month,

1008
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,660
when you can only get a girl pregnant

1009
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,840
if there's a Dobbs head wrapped around your pecker.

1010
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,520
Of course, some people say that you put a Dobbs head on anything

1011
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,700
and that makes it art.

1012
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,460
And here is the question.

1013
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,160
The Weekly World News said,

1014
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,740
dinosaur pee made the oceans.

1015
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,300
Is this true?

1016
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,400
As a subgenius, I am qualified to tell you

1017
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,540
that you can set your mind at rest.

1018
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,480
This is a fabrication.

1019
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,560
If the oceans were comprised of the urine

1020
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,140
from giant saurians of years past,

1021
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,160
they would have had to consume a similar amount of liquid.

1022
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,860
Where did that come from?

1023
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,720
The urination of invertebrates from Earth's carboniferous age?

1024
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,240
And even that doesn't let us off the hook.

1025
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:06,280
Giant oranges.

1026
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,540
There were the eukaryotes and their frantic attempts

1027
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,880
to clear their proto-blastards.

1028
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,200
Giant watermelons.

1029
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,000
Which created the water spouts of primitive and earlier oceans.

1030
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,080
And some say that in the latter days of the Earth,

1031
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,520
the shrunken oceans, the last remnants of the former great seas of our planet,

1032
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,940
which will fitfully...

1033
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,180
Graves.

1034
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:35,480
... subside under the bloated view of a huge, unsightly red sun.

1035
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:41,900
These, too, will be thought by some primitive, superstitious sorts

1036
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:49,720
to be the leavings of an enormous, perhaps semi-divine bladder.

1037
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,140
But it will be as untrue then as it is now.

1038
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,720
We tend to think of results rather than process.

1039
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,780
And it's more important to consider filling the bladder than emptying it.

1040
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,980
Because it's always important to get more.

1041
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,700
So, no.

1042
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,940
I've got a question.

1043
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:14,900
Not...

1044
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,980
So, therefore, your answer...

1045
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,280
Furthermore, dinosaur bodies don't produce gasoline either.

1046
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:26,720
Now, yes, dinosaur pee and dinosaur bodies themselves ultimately did...

1047
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,520
Produce those...

1048
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,400
Fossil fuels?

1049
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,180
No, they didn't.

1050
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,160
Petroleum layers?

1051
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,520
Not true.

1052
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,320
No.

1053
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,460
A gas company put those ads on TV.

1054
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,600
Now everyone believes it.

1055
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,720
Totally untrue.

1056
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,300
Well, a gas company actually put the fossil fuel in the ground.

1057
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,760
Everybody knows that.

1058
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,340
Well, it's certainly the sludgy former biomass...

1059
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,040
Fossil fuel comes from the moon.

1060
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,460
... of previous lustrums...

1061
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,480
It pipes from the moon.

1062
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,820
... of cosmic time.

1063
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,920
But not the...

1064
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,420
Hidden behind clouds.

1065
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,240
Individual saurian behemoths of a primordial long-gone time.

1066
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,600
But what about that cloud-moon theory?

1067
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,320
As picturesque as this image may be.

1068
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,280
You know...

1069
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,440
What about that cloud-moon petroleum theory with a big pipeline?

1070
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,500
You mean the one that Native Americans have?

1071
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,480
Right, right.

1072
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,460
You know, that the petroleum actually comes from the moon through a giant pipeline.

1073
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,680
A snake, actually.

1074
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,220
It's a snake.

1075
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,320
Well, a mythopoetic story.

1076
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:37,940
The structure of human thought is flexible and plastic enough to expand, to contain that and many other charming beliefs.

1077
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,920
It doesn't mean that we have to follow them.

1078
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,360
That's a brilliant idea.

1079
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,080
Thank you, Dr. Allen.

1080
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,820
I must congratulate you on such a...

1081
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,580
Well, am I...

1082
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,160
You're saying, well, some people sure are crazy.

1083
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,360
Yes, they are.

1084
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,720
But we're not going to lampoon them for that, but rather applaud them...

1085
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,220
That's right.

1086
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,940
... for their degree in...

1087
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:57,940


1088
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:57,940


1089
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:57,940


1090
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:57,940


1091
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:57,940


1092
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,720
of going off the rails,

1093
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,380
which is to be commended

1094
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,660
insofar as they have done it,

1095
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,880
however far they have gone.

1096
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,580
They deserve encouragement.

1097
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,060
Our job is not to cut down

1098
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,840
jungles of misapprehension.

1099
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,000
Our job is to irrigate deserts

1100
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,780
where nothing grows

1101
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,080
and to create new growth,

1102
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,560
new life for Bob.

1103
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,500
Bob.

1104
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,480
From PR News in Washington,

1105
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,900
I'm suffering from pneumonia

1106
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,480
and a debilitating PR News.

1107
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,620
Saudi Arabia's king is being succeeded

1108
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,560
by his hapdula.

1109
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,820
Sudan's vice president died.

1110
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,700
Garang crashed.

1111
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,400
Monsoon rains have shut down fetuses.

1112
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,560
The announcement came on state-run PR News

1113
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,720
by the information minister.

1114
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,780
British police say they arrested

1115
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,800
the failed PR News in Washington.

1116
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,900
So what do you do on the show?

1117
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,320
Dr. Hal.

1118
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,880
Now what show would that be?

1119
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,240
A regular show.

1120
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,960
Our radio show where you also are present.

1121
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,220
That's the one.

1122
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,940
Yeah, well what we do is

1123
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,400
we do about two hours,

1124
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,940
although the first half hour

1125
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,040
is usually filled with

1126
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,480
Wellman's incomprehensible tapes.

1127
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,100
No, they're not incomprehensible

1128
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,400
if you've seen the movies

1129
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,420
that he extracts them from.

1130
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,100
Or if you've listened to earlier shows

1131
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,940
that he...

1132
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,560
splices them from.

1133
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,820
All old, all dared before.

1134
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,900
Everything that you've already heard

1135
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,140
you shall hear again.

1136
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,480
It's what we call

1137
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,020
eternal reoccurrence.

1138
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,680
Reconfirmation.

1139
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,380
And eventually you hear little bits of it

1140
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,040
bubble up on the hour of slack

1141
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,180
over and over again.

1142
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:43,720
That's right.

1143
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,420
Nothing is lost.

1144
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,560
No tidbit that falls

1145
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,620
from between the red lips

1146
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,040
of father time

1147
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,980
is...

1148
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,140
is...

1149
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,920
is...

1150
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1151
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1152
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1153
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1154
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1155
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1156
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:53,920


1157
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,100
ultimately jettisoned

1158
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,600
into the universe.

1159
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,920
It lands in his beard

1160
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,300
from which precincts

1161
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,360
we retrieve it.

1162
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,360
It's never lost.

1163
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,100
You'd say though

1164
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,580
that the show is...

1165
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,060
You could say that a lot of it is wasted.

1166
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,700
It's highly ritualized.

1167
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
It's formalized.

1168
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,480
It's been going on

1169
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,520
for more than 20 years.

1170
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,800
There's a certain protocol

1171
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,540
of why and wherefore.

1172
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,300
That's right.

1173
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,840
We just did

1174
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,860
Hour of Slack number 1,000

1175
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,320
but the show has...

1176
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,340
has started

1177
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,100
a couple of years

1178
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,540
before the Hour of Slack.

1179
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,980
Our first episode

1180
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,800
was October.

1181
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,960
October 85.

1182
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,060
And the show,

1183
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,600
I think...

1184
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,520
I was on the first

1185
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,760
two show shows

1186
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,080
with Bob Nelson.

1187
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:32,640
I think that was in 1982.

1188
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,600
That's pretty good.

1189
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,060
Well, you see,

1190
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,460
it's gone out into the ether

1191
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,440
many times.

1192
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,300
Ahem.

1193
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:39,940
Ahem.

1194
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,160
Ahem.

1195
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:41,740
Ahem.

1196
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,000
Ahem.

1197
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,580
Ahem.

1198
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,200
Ahem.

1199
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:44,680
Ahem.

1200
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:44,900
Ahem.

1201
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,000
Ahem.

1202
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:45,380
Does it hurt?

1203
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:45,860
Ahem.

1204
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,240
Does it hurt?

1205
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,000
Ahem.

1206
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,380
I...

1207
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:48,580
I...

1208
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:48,780
I...

1209
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,080
9-11 didn't happen.

1210
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,580
Stop.

1211
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,240
Does it hurt?

1212
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,880
Ahem.

1213
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,320
Ahem.

1214
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,760
Ahem.

1215
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,040
Ahem.

1216
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,400
Ahem.

1217
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:53,940
Ahem.

1218
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,140
And a...

1219
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,160
some sort of silly little

1220
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,020
personal vendetta

1221
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,540
that Bush had.

1222
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:57,780
Whatever.

1223
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,900
Uh,

1224
00:51:59,100 --> 00:51:59,760
grab mo.

1225
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,160
Dick.

1226
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,560
Wailing and moaning.

1227
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,140
Wailing.

1228
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,180
Wailing and moaning.

1229
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:03,760
Get dick.

1230
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,520
Grab dick.

1231
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:04,940
Dick.

1232
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,160
Dick.

1233
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:05,480
Uh,

1234
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,160
uh,

1235
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:06,960
uh,

1236
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,640
and,

1237
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,200
and,

1238
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,560
oh,

1239
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:08,960
oh,

1240
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,220
oh,

1241
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:09,380
oh,

1242
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,680
oh,

1243
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,400
woe is us.

1244
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:10,940
It all,

1245
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,720
it all,

1246
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,200
it all,

1247
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:12,680
it all,

1248
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:12,840
it all,

1249
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:12,980
it all,

1250
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,640
it all,

1251
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:13,780
it all,

1252
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,120
it all,

1253
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,160


1254
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,280


1255
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,360
it all,

1256
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:14,700
it all,

1257
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:14,700


1258
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,040
it all,

1259
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,100
it all,

1260
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,880
it all,

1261
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,180
We're in theط14th century,

1262
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:20,780
it all,

1263
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,060
it all,

1264
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:21,600
it all,

1265
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:21,660


1266
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,220
Noral prefi collage there,

1267
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:34,380
and before that somе doctor Howlin Fyllo y some Dr. Hallen Filo at eight x day drill But now a contribution from Fernande Nandeli Mer.

1268
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,500
I'm like a robber baby,

1269
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,740
I am frownsy.

1270
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,900
Just a,

1271
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,900
just a robber baby.

1272
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,460
frownsy.

1273
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,420
If you stretch my

1274
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,940
Robert tell it

1275
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:47,860
mantely,

1276
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:47,860


1277
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:56,700
enough to tear. I just stretch my rubber like a rubber boot. Bouncy, bouncy.

1278
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,700
Do aliens have the SETI program? Oh, they don't call it that.

1279
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,160
So what do you know about the SETI program? Can you tell us just a general

1280
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,220
kind of synopsis of where it is today? Well, it's not an unofficially sponsored

1281
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:22,220
program from our government, but there are many people who are involved and you can donate

1282
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:33,580
your computer to the hashing over of the data that are received from the void. And you can

1283
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:40,700
participate in the SETI or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence program. That's why they, the

1284
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:45,200
aliens, don't have it because they are not searching for aliens.

1285
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,260
They are looking for anything from beyond the earth themselves. They do have one, but it's not extraterrestrial.

1286
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,980
No, it's called the SHIT, the Search for Human Intelligence.

1287
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,540
You're supposed to pass these to me and then I give them to him.

1288
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,100
Very well. That's what my showbiz partner...

1289
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,960
Don't I actually ask the question?

1290
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,700
You may. So go ahead.

1291
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,900
You pass them to me and then I ask them.

1292
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,340
As you wish.

1293
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,720
Okay, here is one that is the perpetually asked question from those that have little understanding of the rules.

1294
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:31,080
Here it is. It says, what should I ask you? Now that's sort of an open-ended question. We like one that's a little bit more specific.

1295
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:42,780
We're going to take this question. This question is asked a lot of times. It's seen by some to be one that has an element of humor attached.

1296
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,320
Okay.

1297
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,660
Well, that's a flat-out lie.

1298
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:54,220
Well, that's what we do here in the so-called post-modern age. We ask self-referential questions.

1299
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,960
Inward spiraling loops which echo only against their own sides.

1300
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:10,260
But this question does betray an actual desire to go further with this question and answer business.

1301
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,320
And I should say you should ask about anything that is related to the world.

1302
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:20,000
So, I'm going to ask you about something which seems as if, though unknown, it might be bodied forth somehow.

1303
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:26,720
This is an unusual situation. We are an unusual group of people gathered at an unusual event.

1304
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:39,620
And it is quite possible that something will occur to you under these circumstances which might not normally percolate up as you navigate the reefs and shoals of your daily life.

1305
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:48,640
So, you might indeed ask and put me to the task what the name was that Achilles used when he hid among women.

1306
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,900
Or what song the sirens sang when Ulysses was lashed to the mast.

1307
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,580
Or what they call this thing between your lips.

1308
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,660
Toads in the rice that killed the poppy, cockalorum, and the cockahoopatrice.

1309
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,060
That thing is called the philtrum.

1310
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,920
See, I told you.

1311
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,140
Well, you have another question there. So, what is it?

1312
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,520
Okay. Now, I'm trying to...

1313
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,440
I also have a little bit of editorial license in some of these questions if I see fit.

1314
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,720
What will the common...

1315
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,000
Now, is this trade language?

1316
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,300
Somebody said trade or is it tirade language?

1317
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:23,940
It's trade.

1318
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,560
It could be trade.

1319
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,520
If it had an I in there, it could be tirade language.

1320
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,440
The T seems a long ways away from the R.

1321
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,240
Okay. I'm sorry. I won't be...

1322
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:39,100
I won't criticize the actual script here.

1323
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,940
What will be the common trade language on Earth in so... in 50 years?

1324
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,220
Looked like so.

1325
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:46,940
50 years.

1326
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,380
It's like so years, kind of.

1327
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,800
Half a century.

1328
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,100
Psychotic anarcho-materialist.

1329
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,060
That's a language, you say?

1330
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,120
It will be by then.

1331
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,580
Anarcho-materialist is a language?

1332
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,120
In 50 years, it will be a language instead of a political system.

1333
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,700
Because it will be so completely ingrained.

1334
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,280
Since language is common.

1335
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,300
It will be a language of thought, a thought language.

1336
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,980
Yes. If it's common, it will be thought.

1337
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,540
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump in and answer your...

1338
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,200
This is the Ask Dr. Howell show, Reverend Stang?

1339
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,160
No, I've... I've...

1340
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,560
I don't remember.

1341
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,940
I've welcome any assistance with these answers.

1342
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,420
I've studied the prescriptions.

1343
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,560
This is the... Okay, we're going to change...

1344
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,680
I'm going to change the show.

1345
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,540
It's the Ask Dr. Howell and Reverend Stang show.

1346
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,120
And Dr. Drummond. Don't expect to get out of it since...

1347
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,840
I'll just editorialize the questions.

1348
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,480
You can for a while.

1349
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,220
Okay, now...

1350
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,540
Please, your responsibilities will catch up.

1351
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,020
It's a very, very subtle question, please.

1352
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,460
Anyway, the common trade language on earth, as it is common,

1353
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,580
will be one in which thought is possible.

1354
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,700
And if it is a trade language, then the materialism part makes sense too,

1355
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,120
since one must trade in material objects and goods.

1356
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:01,480
The idea that ideas themselves are saleable is a transient phantom

1357
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:06,700
of a sort of masturbatory release of willful thinking,

1358
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:12,640
in the first cries of the newborn digital age.

1359
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,860
So one must expect the language to be truncated,

1360
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,560
full of abbreviations, numbers, ever fluctuating colloquialisms,

1361
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:29,800
and in jokes of a winking, sniggering nature.

1362
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:35,160
The purpose will be not just to be inclusive, but exclusive.

1363
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:42,820
For mark well my words, the common traders of fifty years hence

1364
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,520
will be the movers and shakers, such as they are.

1365
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,680
Of course, they may be nursing their seeping radioactive wounds in caves

1366
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:55,760
and bartering with sticks, bugs, and logs.

1367
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,040
But...

1368
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,120
How much are they worth?

1369
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,380
Nevertheless, power is what it is.

1370
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,120
If bugs be the token of exchange...

1371
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,140
If bugs, sticks, and acorns are...

1372
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,320
If they are the medium of exchange,

1373
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,700
one will murder for them as well as they do for gold,

1374
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,040
that glitters and shines.

1375
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,180
And if subgenius pamphlets are the medium of exchange,

1376
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:25,480
then you can find a preview at www.subgenius.com

1377
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,660
or by mail from, got that pencil ready, Subgenius Foundation,

1378
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,140
P.O. Box 181417,

1379
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,880
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1380
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,740
And I've run out of questions.

1381
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,060
Okay, now we're at a dearth of questions.

1382
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:49,120
In fact, we have only one question with one word in it,

1383
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,800
and I don't really believe it qualifies as a question.

1384
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,560
It's too grossly open-ended.

1385
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,060
Just has a three-letter word.

1386
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,500
Just give it to me.

1387
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,320
It says, why?

1388
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,720
Is that it?

1389
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,240
Why?

1390
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,020
Why is not, that's not an appropriate question.

1391
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:08,020
The question is why, and it's followed by a question mark, right?

1392
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,580
Right, it's followed by a question mark.

1393
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,580
That makes it interrogative.

1394
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,180
Therefore, it is a legitimate question.

1395
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:12,960
The question is why.

1396
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,060
The answer, of course, I'm sure you all know before I even say it, is...

1397
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:17,100
I know.

1398
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:17,700
Because.

1399
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,800
Yes, because.

1400
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,700
There's only one answer to why.

1401
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,560
The presence of a question,

1402
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,880
the presence of an interrogative mood implies an answer.

1403
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,320
But both are artifacts of intellection.

1404
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,660
Both simply have to do...

1405
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,560
In a relativistic universe like ours,

1406
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,640
where you stand, and perhaps how fast you're going,

1407
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,280
whether you be standing or sitting.

1408
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:44,840
You're still in some sense at motion,

1409
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,400
not at rest.

1410
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,520
And as long as you are moving,

1411
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,540
you require an answer,

1412
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,500
because you'll be in a position to ask a question.

1413
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,940
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

1414
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm taking steroids.

1415
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,620
The China Kongon Corporation Critics Capital Chinese clears the face of El Segundo.

1416
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,120
President Bush has formed in the Atlantic,

1417
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,100
currently about 800 miles east of the central north.

1418
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,120
President Bush is washing Peter's,

1419
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,560
bypassing the Senate,

1420
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,160
and, uh, sickens you up.

1421
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,740
The president tested positive for PR News in Washington.

1422
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,140
Protected every day of his life,

1423
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,340
— he sneaked into crypto- targeting the internet

1424
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:57,200
— ever since the king gambed money for a goldfish.

1425
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,200


1426
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,200


1427
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,200


1428
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,200


1429
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,200


1430
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Lenovo is the new impressions of Chinasea by the end of 2019,

1431
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:58,900
so every day you'd like to become known.

1432
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
Today, all netizens around the world

1433
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,800
are watching Chinabase TV,

1434
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,580
This week's bonus filth cuts.

1435
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, I should mention this background music here is by Print Rogers.

1436
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:14,360
Strange music found on the internet by Baldin Praner.

1437
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,540
Print Rodgers.

1438
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,880
Anyway, friends, this week's bonus filth cuts.

1439
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,120
First, from Reverend Nora Preff.

1440
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,280
Talk about sex.

1441
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,300
Talking about sex.

1442
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,180
I suspect my husband does, too.

1443
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,300
Talk about sex.

1444
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,320
Talking about sex.

1445
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,160
I suspect my husband does, too.

1446
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,340
I know he does.

1447
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,980
Talk freely about sex.

1448
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,420
It's a bugaboo.

1449
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,920
We want to share our excitement and experience with our children.

1450
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,440
How about his head?

1451
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,360
As it grew bigger, Shelly could feel it.

1452
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,160
Mommy, mommy, mommy, I want to ask you something.

1453
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,080
But he seems so big.

1454
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,280
There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM.

1455
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,260
The special opening that little girls have.

1456
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:03,200
The one I told you about has a name, the vagina.

1457
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,720
Now, you know that little boys like our Johnny have a penis.

1458
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,380
You see his penis.

1459
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,000
He is able to put his penis into the vagina.

1460
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,100
That special opening that mothers have.

1461
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,980
Sex gear, sex gear culture.

1462
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,500
Do we have a great creative artist here examining body parts, including his genital sex?

1463
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,660
Who hasn't?

1464
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,160
Jimmy.

1465
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,900
What's this?

1466
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,500
And what's this?

1467
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,660
I'm referring, of course, to masturbation.

1468
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,420
Masturbation is not harmful.

1469
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,240
The young child often plays with his genitals.

1470
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,240


1471
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,120
Growing boys will either masturbate to get rid of this energy or have a nocturnal omission.

1472
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,140
Parents are very wrong.

1473
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,520
Genital organs are formed.

1474
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,220
Tammy, don't do that.

1475
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,180
Honey, that's nasty.

1476
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,320
Honey, you know better than that.

1477
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,200
Shame, that's nasty.

1478
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:46,820
You know better than that.

1479
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,680
Without even thinking.

1480
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,580
Every so often I get a strong sex urge.

1481
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,400
And the only way I can take care of it is to masturbate.

1482
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:56,680
Masturbate.

1483
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,140
Masturbate.

1484
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,600
Masturbate.

1485
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:00,620
Masturbate.

1486
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:01,600
Masturbate.

1487
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,160
And I come back and do it again.

1488
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,680
And when I do, it goes away for a while.

1489
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,820
And it worries me.

1490
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,860
And I say, well, I won't do it anymore.

1491
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,820
It's like I've committed a crime or something.

1492
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,720
And when I do, I feel awful.

1493
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,320
It's just like I've committed a crime or something.

1494
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,340
And when I do control myself for a while, I end up with a wet dream.

1495
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,080
George, I'm really pleased that you can tell me about this.

1496
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,440
Perhaps it's because we've known each other for so long.

1497
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,640
There is still another reason why it is important to straighten this out.

1498
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,400
Sex pressures.

1499
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,260
Hmm.

1500
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:29,580
I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.

1501
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:29,580


1502
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:29,580


1503
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:31,320
But we'd be a lot better if I were bigger.

1504
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,480
I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis.

1505
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:38,060
This is an age of acne that Crank realized that the size of his genital organs.

1506
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,180
Would you believe it?

1507
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,180
What did you do then?

1508
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,640
I get so mad.

1509
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,480
I know.

1510
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,220
About the influence of the advertising world in stimulating sexuality.

1511
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,480
Titillating devices such as.

1512
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,040
Happiness.

1513
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,100
Titillating devices such as.

1514
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:52,680
Happiness.

1515
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,500
I see you're making more strips, Dr. Drummond.

1516
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,560
What we're just doing is you don't have to do that.

1517
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1518
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1519
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1520
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1521
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1522
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1523
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1524
01:04:59,560 --> 01:04:59,560


1525
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,040
I've been doing this silly question and answering thing.

1526
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,400
But there it is.

1527
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,340
Have you got a new one there?

1528
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,220
Yes, this is one that I.

1529
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,600
All right.

1530
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:07,840
Oh my gosh.

1531
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,920
I didn't see how you got it.

1532
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,380
Okay.

1533
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:15,880
Now, what does Kevin Nealon's asshole taste like?

1534
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,360
I think there's a signature there.

1535
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,260
There's a signature.

1536
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,840
It says, from Floyd.

1537
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,540
Floyd is very, very interested in Kevin Nealon.

1538
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1539
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1540
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1541
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1542
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1543
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1544
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:29,540


1545
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,540
He's interested in the flavor of Kevin Nealon's asshole.

1546
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,680
Well, you know, there's no point.

1547
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,480
Something he's dreamt about often.

1548
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:36,820
Yes.

1549
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:43,240
There's no reason for envying Hollywoodsters and their tropes.

1550
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,280
Look, I can tell you, Kevin Nealon's asshole looks just like everybody else's asshole.

1551
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,660
That's not the question, Philo.

1552
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,300
The question is not what it looks like.

1553
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,140
What it tastes like.

1554
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,420
I would imagine tastes are a lot like looks.

1555
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,200
They're very similar.

1556
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:56,460
No, they're different.

1557
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,520
That's why we have different organs of sex.

1558
01:05:59,520 --> 01:05:59,820
Different organs of sensation.

1559
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,300
A different sensorium.

1560
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,600
The taste...

1561
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,140
So now we're going to hear about Kevin Nealon's diet?

1562
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,600
Well, yes.

1563
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,200
That was what I was next going to speak of.

1564
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:10,520
Kevin Nealon is a vegetarian.

1565
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,220
In fact, he is even a vegan.

1566
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:22,360
Although he affects a sort of a not caring, stylishly nihilistic attitude.

1567
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:29,180
In fact, where he himself is concerned, where serving the inner man is concerned, he's not

1568
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:36,140
going to add to his food tube things like ho-hos, twinkies, Yankee doodles, or devil dogs.

1569
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:42,400
What he is going to eat are oats and groats and all that kind of stuff that people mistakenly

1570
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,020
ingest thinking they will live forever.

1571
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:55,340
Without a personal investigation into the taste in question, I would say that without

1572
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:59,020
the acids produced by the digestion of...

1573
01:06:59,020 --> 01:06:59,160
Just compounds.

1574
01:06:59,160 --> 01:06:59,160


1575
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:04,420
...meats, what you eventually have is a sort of an overall bovine impression.

1576
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,560
One of summer lofts, hay...

1577
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:08,920
Meadow muffins.

1578
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,800
Slightly decaying vegetation, floral scents.

1579
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:23,320
And then he's also a Hollywood guy and keeps himself fairly well cleansed, unlike those

1580
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,420
of us who have to labor in the rougher portions of the world.

1581
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,880
Kevin Nealon.

1582
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,140
I was sitting down there.

1583
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,220
They had a party for me, but Kevin didn't come.

1584
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,500
But he sent his regrets.

1585
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,740
Well, that was Dr. Howell.

1586
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,980
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

1587
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,900
Good night and Bob loves you.
