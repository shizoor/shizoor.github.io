1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,500
I met Bob when he came in the door when I came in the door to service today and Bob was was

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,940
formerly bound by the powers of darkness to a terrible degree whatever he says he gets a funny

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:36,980
feeling down inside when he sees the Boy Scouts and YMCA and they were doing these crazy things

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,320
of course that's just the start thank goodness that you know nobody I knew was there because

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,180
I thought I'd never going to another one of these as long as I live I mean you know and he was a

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,700
little nervous too when they grabbed his hands you know it was like this is not what we're used to

7
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,200
but we learned a long time ago is that you become with the people you associate with and so he

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,960
started associating with people in this business and I began to see the changes you know body was

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,920
a good person in a good way and I think that's what I'm going to do for the rest of my life.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,220
I started seeing the change of staying away from the people that he was hanging around with and

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,920
looking forward to the future and so I started getting a glimpse of what this business had to

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,200
offer. So will all you goonie birds answering this description please stand up you misfits in this

13

00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:57,900


24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:27,880
when the red fire and smoldering clouds outbreak one pipe to rule them all and in the darkness bind yes the dottle from Bob's pipe falls aloft from aloft on the roofs of the innocent and guilty alike and the wads of his wattle drape down upon those he is biting I think you're thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

25
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,260
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

26
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,580
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

27
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

28
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,540
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

29
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,760
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

30
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

31
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm thinking of that ceremony in front of me.

32
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,440

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,660
ThatAccture heaven

34
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,740
Mata

35
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:21,740


36
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,240
I already got a

37
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:25,740
let all of a sudden

38
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:25,780
I see

39
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:25,780


40
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:25,780


41
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,880
All at one of these days.

42
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,820
in the subgenius auction juggernaut.

43
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320
Oh, Bessie still has one more limb.

44
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

45
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,400
You know, I did receive Modemax's jacket in the mail today,

46
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,780
which was very surprising,

47
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,420
but one would hate to auction off such a thing,

48
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,160
particularly since it fits me fairly well.

49
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,200
I painted a picture of Bob in acrylic paint on this jacket.

50
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,580
He hired me to do it, and it still looks pretty good.

51
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,420
And he took his jacket off?

52
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,720
Well, today a big package arrived,

53
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,860
and instead of being plastic dinosaurs,

54
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,080
it was this package.

55
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,960
It was pretty strange.

56
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,620
We're in this little house up the top of the hill.

57
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,460
The house on the hill, dearie.

58
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,300
And this redneck cannibal pickup pulls up and honks,

59
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,980
and we're going, oh, no, what's going on now?

60
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,480
That was what that honking was.

61
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,960
I wondered what honking was.

62
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,520
Our hostess runs out and gets a package,

63
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,800
and it's from my P.O. box, but it's from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

64
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,120
Right.

65
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,880
It's on the outside.

66
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,820
Bob Dobbs.

67
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,840
Motomac just wanted to make sure if it didn't get to me,

68
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
it would get back to Stang,

69
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,640
because he's through with subgenius, mister.

70
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,660
He washes his hands of the entire slimy mass

71
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,220
of puelulating subgeniuses.

72
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,400
And to prove it, the jacket that he commissioned and paid for

73
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,920
that I painted with a great deal of labor

74
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,920
is now in my possession.

75
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,240
And if I were truly uncaring about this,

76
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,400
I would auction that jacket off.

77
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,880
I would auction that jacket off at the Bull Dada auction.

78
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,920
But I can actually wear it.

79
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,020
I think I know what happened.

80
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,600
What?

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,900
Bob himself killed Motomac, took the jacket,

82
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,600
thought it would look better on you.

83
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,480
He does that.

84
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,800
Because it really was from Bob Dobbs.

85
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,240
Well, that's what it said.

86
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,700
I wonder what the ladies of the post office would say.

87
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah, the post office.

88
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:16,940
I wonder if he talked to them.

89
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,920
They're not going to put up with any malarkey, that's for sure.

90
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,420
Mary sure won't.

91
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,200
She is tough.

92
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,860
I know the lady.

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,880
I, you know, when you're, when you do mail order,

94
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,480
religion for a living,

95
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,880
you have to try to be good buddies with the ladies

96
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,420
that work at the post office.

97
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,320
The crap you bring in, oh yeah.

98
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,760
I've gotten to know all those ladies by name,

99
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,100
and it always is ladies.

100
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,120
And they are grumpy.

101
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,640
God.

102
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,160
They may be to you, Stan.

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,620
They're always ready to go postal.

104
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,600
But they like me because I always prepare

105
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,680
a nice looking package.

106
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,880
And they see it and they went,

107
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,080
oh, look at that.

108
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,280
Look at all the time he took.

109
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,020
Got his package.

110
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,580
Now when they see me coming,

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,700
that means either their robo self-serve machine

112
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,920
has broken down again,

113
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,140
or I've got a bunch of overseas stuff.

114
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,820
Because it's tricky to send stuff overseas.

115
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,520
And about a third of our business is overseas.

116
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,440
Gosh.

117
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,680
There's a lot of Englishman Australians.

118
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,780
Staying, approaching.

119
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,280
But yeah, they have to retype.

120
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,560
Thanks, Chaney.

121
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,260
You.

122
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,860
You're sending it to Oranshan Kuchboz.

123
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,440
The postal people have to,

124
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,460
even though I have already written the address

125
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,040
on the thing and on the customs form,

126
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,840
they have to type it into their machine

127
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,460
and also surreptitiously get a picture of me

128
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,260
in case I'm Osama bin Laden in disguise.

129
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,440
With that beard.

130
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,800
You know, you're sending a mysterious package

131
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,600
over to Wadaladaland or something.

132
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,980
And they think that it might contain

133
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,420
volatiles, decaying food products,

134
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,120
gunpowder, pornography.

135
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,480
Reptiles.

136
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,560
Reptiles.

137
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,700
Does this package contain any explosives,

138
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,080
poisons, toxins, anthrax,

139
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,900
lizards, spiders, deodorant, batteries?

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,320
But they can say it so fast.

141
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,160
It's unbelievable.

142
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,180
They've had practice.

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,100
And they have to say it every time.

144
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,100
Well, no wonder they don't like it.

145
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,980
We all understand that it's a ritual.

146
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,880
They draw straws when they see

147
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,160
a tiny stang sidling up to the window.

148
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,760
That is just about right.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,040
No, I've tried.

150
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,980
I've drawn straws.

151
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,880
I try to go to Lisa's window

152
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,900
instead of Mary's or the other ones

153
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,140
because Lisa claims that she does

154
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,440
all that stuff later.

155
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,400
I think she just blows it off.

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,260
But she gets them through much faster.

157
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,380
I am speaking truly.

158
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,820
And although I was joking,

159
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,820
if you make the package look nice,

160
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,200
which means they don't have to do anything to it,

161
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,440
they love you.

162
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,280
Because people,

163
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,740
bring in unwrapped things and paper

164
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,700
and act helpless.

165
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,880
And so they have to do the whole thing.

166
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,480
Kids aren't taught how to mail things anymore.

167
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
And you have to reinforce the corners

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,720
with postal adhesive tape and all this stuff.

169
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,860
And when you do that right,

170
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,560
they just love the look of a traditional package.

171
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,560
And all barriers in your way.

172
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,180
They sweep away.

173
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,660
And if you don't have quite the amount of postage,

174
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,440
well, we can let it go this time.

175
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,720
That package looks so nice.

176
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:23,900
What?

177
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
Oh, yes.

178
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,880
Of course,

179
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,280
I'm not dealing with the true post office per se,

180
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,060
but with the mailing center near my house,

181
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,940
a block away from it.

182
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,560
And they deal with other things than the U.S. post office.

183
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,160
And actually,

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,180
they're also a store that sells ramen and things like that.

185
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,680
That's in my neighborhood.

186
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,240
San Francisco is truly the land of fruits and nuts.

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,840
Yes.

188
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,980
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard of.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,480
Yes, it is.

190
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,500
Ramen selling post office.

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,480
I wouldn't eat that ramen for nothing.

192
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,960
Isn't this the biggest rubber band ball in the world

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,220
still around the corner from me?

194
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,160
Sadly, no.

195
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,040
That rubber band ball is no longer there.

196
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,280
That was ramen.

197
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,320
You see, it was being assembled by the harassed operators

198
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,520
of this Arab grocery store, Billy and Sammy.

199
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,320
And for a while, they even had a painting of them outside,

200
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,740
none too well executed,

201
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,980
showing them standing by the 6,000 pound rubber band ball.

202
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,800
This would be a rubber band ball like this.

203
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,720
And it said, you know, 6,000 blah, blah, blah.

204
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,400
It had the exact weight and said,

205
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,700
wow, Billy and Sammy.

206
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,280
But then Billy and Sammy grew sour on the enterprise

207
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,980
because the huge rubber band ball is much heavier than it looks

208
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,320
since the interior is being compressed by the exterior constantly.

209
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,480
The interior is under pressure and is actually liquid rubber.

210
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,540
And the whole thing is massively heavy.

211
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,040
It's vile.

212
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,780
And if an earthquake ever happened,

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,240
this monster would start bouncing around

214
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,780
and do more damage as it went down the street.

215
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,920
That would be so cool.

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,800
It would be like a super ball the size of the Statue of Liberty's head.

217
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,960
That's exactly what it was.

218
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,940
Bouncing down the hill in San Francisco.

219
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,520
They also used to make other rubber band balls in the store

220
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,500
about basketball size or larger

221
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,200
to publicize the big rubber band ball that they had.

222
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,200
But it turned out another Arab grocery store

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,040
had made an even bigger rubber band ball.

224
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,780
And this put them in such an evil situation.

225
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:24,780


226
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,220
They put a blanket over it.

227
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
And if someone came in and wanted to take a selfie

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,080
with the giant rubber band ball,

229
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,840
No! You can't take the picture!

230
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,860
No! Buy something or you have to go!

231
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,860
And eventually they gave up the store.

232
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,400
And a younger, hipper generation runs it

233
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
that has Greek yogurt and other things

234
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,240
but they no longer have the giant rubber band ball.

235
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,640
And they never mention it.

236
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,780
And they always deflect conversation

237
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,200
if conversation happens to them.

238
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,580
Well, at least they avoided a giant rubber band ball jihad.

239
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,800
It could have happened.

240
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,780
Actually, you can deal with these things piece by piece.

241
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,220
They made chains, endless chains of rubber bands

242
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,180
which they wrapped around and around it

243
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,660
and it grew to monstrous dimensions.

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,160
And in order to keep it spherical,

245
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,600
the pressure on the outside is about the same

246
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,420
and the inside is under tremendous pressure indeed.

247
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,480
The whole thing, huge, heavy.

248
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,920
I can't wait for that earthquake!

249
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,660
I can. Unless it's right under Silicon Valley.

250
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,480
Hey, have you seen the movie?

251
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,280
The movie San Andreas?

252
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,660
The movie San Andreas with the rock?

253
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,540
Yeah, I heard about it.

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,620
I didn't see the movie. I heard about it.

255
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,440
I can't wait to see it.

256
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,700
I read the Cinefax article on it.

257
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,680
Yet another movie where the Golden Gate Bridge falls down.

258
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,180
Do you have any idea how many movies have shown that recently?

259
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,340
At the beginning of Pacific Rim,

260
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
it happens in the first 30 seconds of the movie.

261
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,040
Right.

262
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,080
People are afraid to go over it now.

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,880
It's been in so many movies.

264
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,180
There's probably a plug-in that the studios just sell to each other.

265
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,860
It's the Destroy Golden Gate Bridge plug-in.

266
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,700
Well, one might ask why there are so many popular movies

267
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,780
whose subject is the end of everything, the apocalypse.

268
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,920
Duh! Trying to compete with Bob!

269
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
Exactly. The conspiracy version.

270
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,860
Which offers mindless popcorn munching thrills,

271
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,720
but doesn't explain why it's happening

272
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,200
or the appropriateness of it happening.

273
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,560
Which you're supposed to intuit anyway.

274
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,460
And they make it all about some big ex-football player

275
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,440
trying to pick up his kids by helicopter.

276
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
During the whole thing,

277
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,600
those beautiful kids are in the middle of this,

278
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,800
and I'm not going to stop it.

279
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,980
While thousands of people are dying and screaming,

280
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,540
and falling,

281
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,080
I've got to get those kids!

282
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,400
But of course, that's the way it would be.

283
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,820
That is what you would do.

284
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,940
You wouldn't care about those thousands being...

285
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,820
Every X-Day there's a movie like that.

286
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,240
Yeah?

287
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,160
The end of the world movie.

288
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,880
The most egregious one was Independence Day,

289
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,480
which I think was, was that 96?

290
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,780
Well, what about 2015 or 2014 or whatever it was?

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,440
2012.

292
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,320
2012?

293
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,700
The day after tomorrow.

294
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,520
The thing of John Cusack is running,

295
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,960
and behind him the Earth is caving in,

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,160
and horrible things are happening.

297
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,860
When he slows down, it's still happening,

298
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,520
but now it's moving at his pace.

299
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,760
And then when he speeds up, the destruction comes.

300
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,940
It's always the same distance away, you notice.

301
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,760
But of course, that doesn't happen with everyone.

302
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,720
What is this year's blockbuster,

303
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,140
keep-em-away-from-Wisteria Hollywood movie?

304
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,740
Would it be the new Mad Max movie?

305
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,220
Well, that one came out like a month ago.

306
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,620
Everyone's still yakking about it, though.

307
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,640
Has San Andreas come out?

308
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,660
Because that would be a...

309
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,060
San Andreas was the giant earthquake movie

310
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,980
where both San Francisco and Los Angeles are destroyed.

311
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,840
They closed down my local theater because I never went.

312
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,040
Because I steal from mom-and-pop Hollywood multinational corporations.

313
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,940
Because he sits at home in his pajamas,

314
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,260
killing monsters, and movies are going extinct.

315
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,540
No, well, I get, I watch all the hit movies.

316
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,440
As soon as they come out on Redbox,

317
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,960
they also come out,

318
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,520
they float down the media ditch on the internet.

319
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,680
But how long is this...

320
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,720
You just find these movies laying there, unused.

321
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,180
You might as well pick them up.

322
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,480
How long is this a sustainable model?

323
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,460
You know, when is this going to die from being top-heavy?

324
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,180
Well, when the conspiracy gets smarter,

325
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,600
but then the pirates will get smarter yet.

326
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,540
It'll just go on and on and on.

327
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,500
Meanwhile, kids at home are making cool movies on their computers.

328
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,120
Right.

329
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,380
It sure is easier to rethink sound these days.

330
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,140
Like Escape from City 17.

331
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,260
I only watch movies with dead people in them.

332
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,180
I've noticed that.

333
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,040
Those are the only ones you can remember, right?

334
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
I heart dead folks.

335
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,700
Uh...

336
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,300
Uh...

337
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,620
Well, think about it this way.

338
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Everybody who's in a new movie is gonna be dead.

339
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,840
Can you catch up with all those Marvel movies later?

340
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh, oh, what's...

341
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,820
Well, no, you'll be dead.

342
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:21,940
Oh, oh.

343
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,500
By the time those actors are dead.

344
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,460
We don't...

345
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,360
Oh, I hope that's...

346
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Hopefully.

347
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:27,840
Oh!

348
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,620
My parents would watch Saturday Night at the Movies

349
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,600
and argue about the actors on screen.

350
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
No, that's Myrna Loy.

351
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,600
No, it's, uh, you know, uh...

352
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,680
Agnes Moorhead.

353
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,680
They didn't have M to both.

354
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,660
No, I tell you, it's, uh, it's Myrna Loy.

355
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,020
We were progressive because my dad rigged up a special device

356
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,120
which he attached to the back of the TV,

357
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,080
and you could click it like a lamp switch

358
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,240
and turn off the noise of the commercials.

359
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,120
Wow.

360
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,640
Princess Wee's uncle invented such a thing himself.

361
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,680
We had that back in the 60s.

362
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,340
Professor Farnsworth invented the thing-longer,

363
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,260
where you could change the volume on your TV

364
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,560
from across the room.

365
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,800
Professor Farnsworth actually invented the TV.

366
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,780
I have a stick. I used that.

367
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,380
Well, this is the later Professor Farnsworth.

368
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,840
Not Philo T. Farnsworth?

369
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,060
No, this was what, uh, the Professor Farnsworth on Futurama.

370
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,680
Oh, that Professor Farnsworth.

371
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,400
The descendant of the original.

372
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,760
He invented the remote control.

373
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,720
Uh-huh.

374
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,360
It was a new kind of remote control, the thing-longer.

375
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,980
That was in one of the first Futurama episodes,

376
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,580
and I was hooked from then on.

377
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,300
I actually took a length of bamboo

378
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,140
and put some tape on the end to increase the traction

379
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,120
so that I could just sprawl in my bed

380
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,200
and turn on the tape deck.

381
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,140
You're as brilliant as Professor Farnsworth on Futurama.

382
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,620
Yeah.

383
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,980
Who has stricken the Falzheimers horribly.

384
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,060
Stick technology.

385
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
The stick is my favorite simple machine.

386
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,600
Don't try to remember anything.

387
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,580
You'll just forget it five minutes later.

388
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,780
When you need a stick and you don't have one, you're stuck.

389
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,440
I liked the Slurm episode.

390
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,280
Oh.

391
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,700
It spoke to me personally.

392
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,540
Well, yeah.

393
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,380
Since I'm forced to drink all these artificial drinks

394
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,980
because of my medical condition,

395
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,620
I wanted some of that special Slurm, too.

396
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah, I've noticed these special drinks you have to have

397
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,180
because of your medical condition.

398
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,540
That Wild Turkey 101.

399
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,920
Yeah, I gotta drink it all the time, Doc.

400
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:20,780
Yeah.

401
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,240
Or else I really...

402
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,220
He's got a real conditioned condition.

403
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,700
I'll do the scene after I take my medicine.

404
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,060
I got blood pressure.

405
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
Um, yes.

406
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,080
Well, that isn't gonna happen.

407
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,640
It was supposed to be in an independent movie

408
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,520
and it was canceled.

409
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,200
So I won't be doing that scene after all.

410
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,840
Yeah, Dr. Hal occasionally appears in movies and video games.

411
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,280
In crappy movies you've never heard of.

412
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,880
And never will.

413
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,620
But Alex Cox was gonna be in this one.

414
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,060
Wasn't there one called Rise Up or something?

415
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,740
Oh, yeah.

416
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,560
Did they ever pay you for that?

417
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,860
Only in memories.

418
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:01,940
So much...

419
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,300
We're now back talking about old movies.

420
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,260
And I suppose we've already mentioned

421
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,200
The Octopus in this context.

422
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,500
Ever seen that one?

423
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,840
The Octopus?

424
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,800
No.

425
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,860
Well, that's the most...

426
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,040
The title is Shhh! with S-H-H at the beginning?

427
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,340
S-H-H-H exclamation point The Octopus.

428
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,160
That sounds...

429
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,160
That's a good title.

430
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,960
And it stars...

431
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,840
Sure it's not...

432
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,100
Wait a minute.

433
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,980
That implies that you have to be quiet

434
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
or the octopus will hear you.

435
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,640
The octopus will get you

436
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,360
because the movie is set in a lighthouse

437
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,740
and behind the secret panels the octopus is there

438
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,900
and he can reach out and grab you.

439
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,700
But also...

440
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,000
Porno.

441
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,180
Confusingly,

442
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,840
there is a secret criminal organization...

443
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,520
The head of which is known as The Octopus.

444
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,980
And everyone wonders who is The Octopus.

445
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,260
Or maybe he's The Octopus.

446
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,180
Maybe he's The Octopus.

447
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,920
Two dimwitted detectives are sent to investigate naturally.

448
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,620
One is Hugh Herbert.

449
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,680
Remember him with woo woo woo?

450
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,660
That guy?

451
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,560
Woo woo?

452
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,020
Hugh woo woo Herbert?

453
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,600
And in the end...

454
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,480
Well, I shouldn't give a spoiler alert but...

455
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
The Octopus...

456
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,680
I'm going to do it.

457
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,120
No one's going to see this movie.

458
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,720
The Octopus turns out to be...

459
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:15,820
You're kidding.

460
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,360
A sweet old lady who cleans the floors.

461
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,220
Suddenly she cackles and in one shot

462
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,400
turns into a hideous monstrous hag.

463
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,940
And this is ingeniously done.

464
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,480
While she's talking,

465
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,620
she turns into this horrible thing.

466
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,980
And they did it in the same way they turned Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde

467
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,340
in the 1933 Ruben Mamoulian version.

468
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,540
I'm trying to figure out how to stop doing that.

469
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,800
They painted the makeup on the woman's face

470
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,780
in red paint.

471
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,460
But the movie is in black and white.

472
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,580
And they put a red filter over the camera.

473
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
So while she's doing her scene,

474
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,460
they whip off the red filter

475
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,620
or take it off slowly and gradually.

476
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,460
Even while she's moving around,

477
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,200
these things appear on her face.

478
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,820
And her teeth become snaggly.

479
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,420
And she's, of course, aiding this with her performance.

480
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,220
They didn't even use CGI?

481
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,960
How is that possible?

482
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,480
It's an analog effect.

483
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,860
And boy, is it a beauty.

484
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
That's the Octopus.

485
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,500
I recommend it.

486
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,740
And then there's also the movie Earthworm Tractors

487
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,920
starring Joe E. Brown.

488
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,200
You remember Joe E. Brown.

489
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,800
Oh my God.

490
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
Everybody remembers Joe E. Brown.

491
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,740
The guy on Car 54.

492
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,460
Where are you?

493
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,360
Who would go, ooh, ooh.

494
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,200
That guy.

495
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,380
Oh, I hear he was a terrible person.

496
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,520
Well, he may have been.

497
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,760
But he's the star of this movie,

498
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,560
which is all about how earthworms pull tractors or something.

499
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Actually, I haven't caught up with that movie.

500
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,860
How can we make a subgenius movie now that that guy's dead?

501
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,480
And John Kelly.

502
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,260
And Cara Deen.

503
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,860
And who else?

504
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,280
Is Bruce Dern still around?

505
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,200
Barely.

506
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,840
But what we have to do is...

507
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:49,960
But Cara Deen Stanton.

508
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,920
Harry Dean Stanton.

509
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,420
Oh God.

510
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,160
There's no point even thinking about a subgenius movie without Harry Dean Stanton.

511
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,480
It's got to be Harry Dean.

512
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,300
You can create digital analogs of all these characters.

513
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,580
And their estates will only need to receive a tiny pittance.

514
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh yeah, right.

515
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,240
And if they don't want the pittance, then we can tweak it.

516
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,320
And so it's almost Harry Dean Stanton.

517
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,460
And then it's just like my parents advertising, I mean, arguing as though they were the only

518
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:13,460


519
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,720
characters they watched Saturday night at the movies.

520
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,540
I tell you, that's Harry Dean Stanton.

521
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,780
No, it's not really.

522
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,140
That's Victor Majore.

523
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,760
No, it's...

524
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,280
No.

525
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,660
No.

526
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,040
So it wouldn't be Harry Dean Stanton.

527
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,920
Well, when we do the giant big budget subgenius movie, Bob Dobbs, of course, would be done

528
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,280
with performance capture.

529
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,440
Because you can't photograph the real Bob.

530
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,960
And if you use an actor, then you've got the Sean Connery problem.

531
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,740
The Johnny Weissmuller problem.

532
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,400
They've got you over a barrel.

533
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,840
The uncanny valley.

534
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,040
But in Bob's case, that's perfect.

535
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,000
That's what you want.

536
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,120
You want the uncanny valley where Bob is concerned.

537
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,200
But now the whole cast is going to be like that.

538
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,300
Because Harry Dean Stanton's going to have to be CGI and Joey Brown.

539
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,820
Or that movie about redneck car racers where one redneck car racer died in a crash.

540
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,720
They CGI'd him.

541
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,400
Yeah, they made an analog, they made a computer version of him, which they ingeniously...

542
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,180
ingeniously slipped into the movie.

543
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,960
But again, you have the uncanny valley.

544
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:23,580
So it's between accepting him as the real person and as a digital effect.

545
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,440
It just...

546
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,920
There's something that can't be crossed there.

547
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,960
So far.

548
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,780
But beetle-browed scientists are working on it now to close it ever closer.

549
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,500
Now, I like the uncanny valley.

550
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,200
I do too.

551
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,400
Now, what was that movie...

552
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,380
It's hard to climb out of it.

553
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,600
They recently made a movie.

554
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,620
Was it the age of Ultron?

555
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,580
Where they had a character, Paul Bettany, who they started with the uncanny valley.

556
00:26:50,740 --> 00:27:02,060
They started at the other end and tried to make the actual person less human with all the computer effects and so forth and so on.

557
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,420
Right.

558
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,980
They wanted him to look not quite close enough to human to sell it.

559
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,880
So couldn't you take a guy, an actor, you know, put dots on his face and, well, do I have to draw you a picture?

560
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I mean...

561
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,240
You already did, Hal.

562
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,860
Okay.

563
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,260
All right.

564
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,480
So that's the way it'll be done.

565
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,860
Mark my words.

566
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:31,660
There was a TV commercial that had the George Washington from the dollar bill in riding around the back of cars and doing things.

567
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,620
With Ben Franklin.

568
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,500
Was it Ben Franklin or George Washington?

569
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,480
That was Franklin and Washington.

570
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,160
Oh.

571
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,620
It was kind of green and dot patterned and he always had his head to the correct angle pretty much.

572
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:54,980
So it had that goofy effect you get when you add a Dobbs head to any picture and the Dobbs head is always looking at you as the body is going back and forth.

573
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,020
But those who have actually experienced a meeting with Dobbs found that that was true.

574
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,520
Every time they looked at him, he was looking directly at them and you never saw him in profile.

575
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,060
I never saw him in profile even when he was shot.

576
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,060
I could just look straight on.

577
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,480
Probably rolled him over onto his stomach and his head remained pointed straight up, grinning.

578
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,080
Yeah, he was in a bad way at that time.

579
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,320
Even with that broken pipe.

580
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,460
He was in a bad way.

581
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,220
The pipe was broken but this is all a trauma of many years ago.

582
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,400
Well, it was the first time but it wasn't the last time.

583
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:32,880
No.

584
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,500
But it was near the last time because Bob put kind of a lot of effort into it.

585
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,180
Yeah, he was coming to subgenius shows, you'll notice.

586
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes.

587
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,380
Every time, it got to be a tradition of shooting him.

588
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,160
Well.

589
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,800
I don't blame him, you know.

590
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,540
I mean, it's hard to stand up to hot lead despite the allure of show business.

591
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,540
Well, is it time for us to...

592
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,940
He learned a trick from Superman.

593
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,500
People would shoot at him and the bullets would just bounce off but when they threw a gun at him, he'd duck.

594
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,120
Yeah.

595
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,820
They'd run out of bullets and throw the gun and Bob would duck.

596
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,260
It's just, you know, to...

597
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,280
And then endless fist fights with their hats on.

598
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,880
It was impervious to bullets but not to the gun.

599
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,360
Beating the bejesus out of each other.

600
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes, it's true.

601
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:26,220
Well, we have received some gorillas and demons forms and perhaps before this show is over, we should deal with them or I leave it to you whether or not we postpone, table this agenda until a future iteration.

602
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,560
Well, no, no.

603
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,000
We have a female voice here.

604
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,280
Are there any that are especially feminine that would sound better than Susan?

605
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,660
I think one of them is feminine.

606
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
As a matter of fact, when I read them, it seemed...

607
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, I always get stuck doing the ghetto voices.

608
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,080
You don't want to do a female gorilla?

609
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,340
Well, I'll do a female.

610
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,180
Do this one.

611
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,320
There's a gorilla and a demon.

612
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,800
Here's a gorilla is female in that one.

613
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,580
So, we are going to read now from the gorilla and demon forms which have been submitted.

614
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,860
If you're interested in channeling your own gorilla and demon, these forms are available at the table.

615
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,020
So, now we'll hear the complaint of gorilla number one.

616
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,740
Oh.

617
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,700
That's you.

618
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,820
My roommate is a dillweed.

619
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,940
He thinks sex is love.

620
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,280
My aunt is a dillweed.

621
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,460
She mocked Reverend so and so and he proposed to me.

622
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,860
My stepmother is a dillweed.

623
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,220
She left my dad and now he has to sell his house.

624
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,720
That doesn't sound very gorilla-like.

625
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,900
But that's okay.

626
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,220
Maybe you haven't known that many shows.

627
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,220


628
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,000
She gorillas.

629
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,460
My roommate, dillweed, thinks sex is love.

630
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,200
You could let Evil Susie do that.

631
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:49,400
Shall Evil Susie do the demon remark at the bottom?

632
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,540
The gorilla remark is at the top.

633
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,700
I'm afraid there won't be enough slack.

634
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Even while I already have it.

635
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I have to protect everyone from myself.

636
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,460
Some days it's too hard to fight to be myself.

637
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,880
Well, there you go.

638
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,220
What things have people said about you that you don't like?

639
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,880
Things that made you think or feel badly about yourself.

640
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,760
Yes.

641
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,660
Well, somebody has a gorilla inside them that says,

642
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,580
These goddamn honkies keep paging me.

643
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,660
Seriously.

644
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,040
I have to pay $19.99 per month to keep a pager service.

645
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,120
I hate all these secret codes.

646
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,900
They try to be secret agent asshole.

647
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,360
Jesus tit-licking son of Mary and Joseph.

648
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,120
And what's available other than...

649
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,380
Belt clips.

650
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,320
I don't even wear a belt.

651
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,420
What gorilla ever did except...

652
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,080
Fucking cock shit.

653
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,340
Except King Kong and you know how that turned out.

654
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,460
What a foul-mouthed gorilla.

655
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,140
Yeah.

656
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,340
And then the demon.

657
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,920
Oh, all right.

658
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,460
I'll have to do the demon at the bottom of the page.

659
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,260
I hope it was one of y'all that did these.

660
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,540
Please tell me more about deluxe carpet shampooing packages.

661
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:10,280
Are these carp waffles for sale?

662
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:16,420
May I be rude and ask you about that mole on your pubis mons?

663
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,160
Where has all the dish soap gone?

664
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,640
Is there any sense in trying to repair vintage leather when you only own woolen scarves?

665
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,560
Friends.

666
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,500
Finally something that made sense to me.

667
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,360
Let the demons and gorillas inside you out.

668
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,100
Set them free by filling out these little forms.

669
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,720
Just choose a demon and gorilla form available over there at the swag table.

670
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,400
Demons and gorillas would be really good roasted.

671
00:32:48,680 --> 00:33:01,980
Here at subgenius mind control experiment number 2203 at Exist Harvest Point training course annual subgenius migration to the Ohio breeding grounds.

672
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,540
Think how many burgers you could get out of one gorilla.

673
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,600
You know, these things come from elementary school.

674
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:17,320
Some elementary school teacher came to Ex Day and dropped off one or two of these forms and I was photocopying them ever since.

675
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,980
She gets little bastards to be quiet by having them fill out gorilla and demon forms.

676
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:28,520
There's another one where you end and it starts with some sort of nursery rhyme thing and you're supposed to end it.

677
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,680
It just now occurred to me.

678
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,800
Maybe these are done to ferret out child abuse.

679
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,840
Oh no.

680
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,900
Say if the kid says, come on, you know, sonny boy.

681
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,240
Let old father, let old father Mike show you what's under me cassock.

682
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:58,160
Ah, that's what the evil demon says, would say, you know, and the kid would write down the disturbing things that really came from, you know, father O'Malley.

683
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,820
Then they bring out the puppet.

684
00:33:59,820 --> 00:33:59,900
Then they.

685
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,940
Then they can start the cover up and protect father O'Malley.

686
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,040
Did father Flannilton touch you there?

687
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,220
Anyway, these, you know, just for fun.

688
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,000
If you have nothing else to do, fill out your gorilla and demon form.

689
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:22,020
Well, so from these, we've learned that one person has serious, was traumatized by the dill weeds in their family.

690
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,420
Yes, that rich dill weed and his aunt.

691
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,600
And here's a person who still might have slack, but.

692
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,060
Just doesn't have slack anyway.

693
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,160
And but that's pretty common.

694
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,500
That's, you know, I think there's a slit personality involved.

695
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,960
Tell it to dear Abby.

696
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,760
Not a split slit.

697
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,180
This person's gorilla simply doesn't like the pager service.

698
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,860
Well, no one likes to be paid.

699
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,820
This one has a lot of problems and has a mole on a pubis mons.

700
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,440
So we can friends.

701
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,040
We need to know who did this.

702
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,840
It's someone with a reverse mons pubis.

703
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,580
Why don't you just drop them britches now?

704
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,880
It might not be a mole.

705
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,740
We need to be sure about that.

706
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,820
We're doctors.

707
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,900
God, that's horrible.

708
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,560
What are we sinking to?

709
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,200
I don't know.

710
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,840
But now we've disposed of the gorilla and demon forms.

711
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,600
So we need to move on to new business.

712
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
And here it is.

713
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, can we get a mic down into the audience?

714
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,840
Yes, we can.

715
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,840
Yes, we can go all Oprah here.

716
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:35,160
Princess Wee, knowing that I can't hear anything in headphones, said, Mom and I have a bawdy piece prepared.

717
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,820
Could we bring a mic to the audience?

718
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,320
Yes.

719
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,880
See, if you undo this magic cord, this thing becomes a big, long, hard to manage mess.

720
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,400
Big, long, hard.

721
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,240
It'll go back to your chair.

722
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:58,240
We got yet another bawdy song from those rascally, that rascally duo, Wee Ma and Wee Ma Ma.

723
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,140
Ma, ma, ma, wee, ma, ma, ma, ma, wee, ma, ma.

724
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,440
Ready?

725
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:19,020
Cats on the rooftops, cats on the tiles, cats with syphilis, cats with piles, cats with their assholes wreathed with smiles as they revel in the joys of fornication.

726
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:25,880
The old hippopotamus, so it seems, very, very seldom has wet dreams.

727
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,720
But when he does, he comes in.

728
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,000
And he comes in dreams.

729
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,140
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

730
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,020
The elephant is a funny bloke.

731
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,840
And very seldom gets a poke.

732
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,060
So when he does, he lets it soak.

733
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,240
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

734
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,960
The ostrich has a funny dick.

735
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,380
And it isn't very often that he dips his wick.

736
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,520
So when he does, he dips it quick.

737
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,840
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

738
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,440
Promiscuous girls live under a strain, waiting for their monthly pain.

739
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,680
And when it comes, they smile again.

740
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,100
As they revel in the joys of fornication.

741
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,160
Oh, you revel in the morning with an upright stand.

742
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,280
It's urinary pressure on the prostate gland.

743
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,380
If you haven't got a woman, so you jerk it off by hand.

744
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,180
As you revel in the joys of fornication.

745
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,060
The priest of the parish has very little fun.

746
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,540
He doesn't even know how well it is done.

747
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,080
When it comes to fun, he gets none.

748
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
N-U-N.

749
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,060
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

750
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,980
The cocksucker blows his friend in haste.

751
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,100
Then he licks it up so it won't go to waste.

752
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,860
Then he drinks and gets odd.

753
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,440
It's a matter of taste.

754
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,600
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

755
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,080
Rats hide the captain as he thought.

756
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,360
These new ensigns are not thought.

757
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,660
And the admiral takes the best of the lot.

758
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,680
As he revels in the joys of fornication.

759
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,360
When you wake up in the morning with your belly full of joy.

760
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,720
And your wife's on her vacation.

761
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,440
And your daughter's being coy.

762
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,780
And you're pulpit in the asshole of the youngest boy.

763
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
As you revel in the joys of fornication.

764
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,120
Do you ken John Peel?

765
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,700
Yes, I ken him weel.

766
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,800
He sleeps with his wife, but he never gets a feel.

767
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,200
He sleeps by her side, but he never gets a ride.

768
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,560
And he wakes up in the morning in frustration.

769
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,020
Ha ha ha ha ha.

770
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,900
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya.

771
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,220
The White Lawanda Page.

772
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,840
Well there you have it.

773
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,000
Bring your mother-in-law to X Day.

774
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,960
Breathtaking obscenity, I'm so proud.

775
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,720
Ha ha ha.

776
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,280
The queen of the queen of all the UFOs.

777
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,320
And the queen of all the UFOs.

778
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,220
Did that wonderful duet.

779
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,260
My mind is literally duet.

780
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Beautifully sung too.

781
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,440
Nicely harmonized.

782
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,080
Yeah.

783
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,180
She woke up yesterday morning and said she had woken up with that song, but she only

784
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,540
had the hippopotamus stanza, so I typed two lines of it into a Yahoo page and bam, we

785
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,620
had all the lyrics.

786
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,520
So I mailed them to our hostess and she printed them out and we got to do it.

787
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,660
So you guys have to think of a name for your

788
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:53,960
band.

789
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,760
See, the internet is good for something after all.

790
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,240
Oh, we'll think of something.

791
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,980
Sand in the Crevice came up a couple of days

792
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,220
ago.

793
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,680
You don't like that one?

794
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,100
Okay.

795
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,000
P-Dog Night's usable again.

796
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:13,120
Well, it is four o'clock and we can excuse

797
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,720
ourselves.

798
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,500
We got started 20 minutes late.

799
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,300
What a mercy.

800
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,160
But it takes us 20 minutes to shut these things

801
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,440
down.

802
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,240
20 minutes late?

803
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,660
Then we should do 20 minutes more and you have the complete hour.

804
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:23,940
Yeah.

805
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,860
And then we'll be free, free.

806
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,800
As free as the-

807
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,400
A staying impression.

808
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,420
It's a good thing that monster movie music ran out in the background because I neglected

809
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,100
to pot it down when I was singing.

810
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,660
You played it so feebly that no one, especially

811
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,320
me, could even hear it.

812
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,940
Oh, it was back in there.

813
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,180
You have to be careful not to make it too loud.

814
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,900
I'm the anti-Wellman, you know, Dr. Howell.

815
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,780
Yeah, Wellman does play it a little bit too

816
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:53,940
loud.

817
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


818
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


819
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


820
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


821
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


822
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


823
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


824
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:53,940


825
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,340
Yeah.

826
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,480
Yeah.

827
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:54,680
Yeah.

828
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,840
Yeah.

829
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,120
Yeah.

830
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,280
He's a little bit different.

831
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,280


832
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,280


833
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,280


834
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,280


835
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,280


836
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm accustomed to hearing it.

837
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,060
There has to be a balance.

838
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,880
No, you can't hear it.

839
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
The audience can hear it.

840
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,700
But you don't ... I have the problem when I'm listening back to these things, I like

841
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:15,360
the music so much, I'm really listening to that and kind of not just ignoring the endless

842
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,200
comic book nostalgia, monster movie nostalgia.

843
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,620
Oh, remember that?

844
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,540
That just reminds me of that great movie, Fight, See, Touch.

845
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,820
It's showing down in the Grindhouse.

846
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,620
In the Grindhouse.

847
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,820
Unknown, unfortunately.

848
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,560
the grindhouse doesn't really work during the day it's not dark enough down there

849
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,860
the grindhouse is a great place to hide just down the path in the little dell there and uh

850
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:46,000
tonight there's an entirely new program there yeah that's usually a great lineup yep so um

851
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,580
yes friends i think we're going to wrap up another subgenius hour of slack you're going to wrap you

852
00:41:52,580 --> 00:42:00,840
we're gonna uh maybe later uh all right we're gonna wrap it up and put a bow around it and

853
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,380
throw it in the deep blue sea yeah that's called the internet right uh okay uh we're going to send

854
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,360
it out oceans the internet and the waters of the earth are being horribly polluted to send it out

855
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:20,340
into the newosphere the great artifact that humanity creates of all the extra somatic

856
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,260
information and now this

857
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:22,560
you

858
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:29,420
little slip of a subgenius show will float on its uh great uh untapped depths

859
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:38,080
the internet was so great when nobody knew what it was you mean back when the cia created only

860
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:45,120
only people who could read and write even oh the well that existed the well it was really

861
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:52,280
funny back then yeah yeah the the olden days it was called the well um but then

862
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,560
um

863
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,160
the next thing you knew everybody was on the internet it's just like tv now

864
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,520
just making people dumber and dumber and dumber on myspace yes

865
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:12,260
yeah whatever america online alt dot slack all those places fallen by the wayside and some were

866
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:20,380
closed down by indignant sensors so uh new roots and branches had to spring up out of the fertile

867
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,800
soil

868
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:30,040
well there's certainly enough fertilizer for that entire streams of uh subgenius uh creation were

869
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:40,460
cut brutally short by excessive pruning well now in the case of alt dot slack it just got to where

870
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:48,040
there were more pin kooks than subgeniuses or rather they were louder than the subgeniuses they

871
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,560
flooded it with youtube links and to the point where they were not being used for the purpose of

872
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,900
the point where we pretty much to make it became unusable and uh we had to go to a members only

873
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:05,000
thing but to tell the truth where it's really happening of course is facebook scrub genius is a

874
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:13,760
tiny little quiet i like it tiny i like it i like being with my own kind well i'm not going to get

875
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,580
in an argument with you but there's some really cool monster stuff on facebook the subgenius stuff

876
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,540
take it or leave it but the video is going to be a little bit more interesting i'm going to go to

877
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,140
vintage monster toys page yeah the classic universal monster movies or classic movies

878
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:36,880
stop motion movies and of course any facebook page with the word monster in it it's almost any

879
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:49,580
monster trolls yes monster shot album so anyway uh yeah uh you've been listening to the

880
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,100
subgenius yes right from a

881
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,480
subgenius mind control experiment number 2203

882
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:13,080
and still they come 1599 have a new uh arrival right oh evolution control committee truck is

883
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,420
here that's right trademark finally we'll get some control on this evolution crap we'll have

884
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,240
some real creative it's entirely out of hand you know the evolution control

885
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,260
committee is also going to be at starwood this year which is cheaper for subgeniuses than for

886
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,120
anyone else but it's pointless to tell you guys this well yeah

887
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,720
starwood loves subgeniuses so much that they'll let subgeniuses in for cheaper than anyone else

888
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,060
cheaper than the hippies so much cheaper that even if you hate the church of the subgenius

889
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,480
but wanted to go to starwood it's cheaper if you buy a subgenius membership and then toss it in the

890
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,900
church yes you can sulk in your tent like achilles all through x day and then when they make fun of us

891
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:05,920
and then when starwood starts when starwood starts you can emerge from your uh cocoon

892
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,420
your chrysalis yes and interact and intermingle with the virtuous pagans

893
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,060
uh yeah that's a figure of speech of course

894
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,460
yes of course

895
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,900
no actually um i think the reason that well the reason they used to allow me at starwood every

896
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:39,360
year is because the non-fundy pagans love to watch the fundy pagans get all ticked off and

897
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,600
that's what church the subgenius is good for they are humorless assholes they're more attentive to

898
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,220
your sermons there but the humorful assholes which is most pagans and subgeniuses really enjoy that

899
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,540
sort of thing they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't

900
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,140
mind it they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't mind it they don't

901
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:59,300
get a little fun poked and of course who does the church of the subgenius make fun of the most

902
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:10,560
us selves us selves and because that is the truest kind of snark well we know our own

903
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,720
motivations as far as everyone else is concerned we're only guessing at theirs and the humor can't

904
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,580
be as surgically precise mark twain said something i think it was him said something about how when

905
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,440
you're when you're

906
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:31,860
when you're young you're a satirist and you're making fun of everybody else but after a while you become a humorous because making fun of yourself is actually a little funnier

907
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,420
uh... and uh... what was it pogo said

908
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,180
we have met the enemy

909
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,720
and he is us

910
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,660
if they are us

911
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,280
and don't know why as long as no maybe it was your grandmother said so

912
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,420
grandfather used to say learn to laugh at yourself and you'll always be amused

913
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,540
learn to laugh at yourself and you'll always be amused

914
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,540


915
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,360
that will sell a said by princess leaves grandfather king go

916
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,540
and cast mile- challengers゙ ZHW then you'll end up with a mouthful of rain

917
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,580
he wasn't man who enjoyed his tim тран

918
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:16,220
he you know i don't know how karen right well on that note we're going to close this uh...��

919
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:20,340
special or benyeonal potentiallyération designate the subgenius our common7

920
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,620
assembled. But remember,

921
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,720
tomorrow there will be an almost

922
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,480
identically similar

923
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,820
show that it would take

924
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,860
expert scientific assistance

925
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,040
to tell from this

926
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,160
show. No, no, tomorrow's going to be

927
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,080
Ask Dr. Hal. So it's going to be more

928
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,000
expensive than this show. I was coming to that.

929
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,860
The Ask Dr. Hal show will be

930
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,060
appended to the end

931
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,720
of the hour of

932
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,460
slack. And then we'll have the Dr. Hal's

933
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,860
ass show. Not unlike

934
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,880
the searing flash that announced the

935
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,260
beginning of the atomic age.

936
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,760
So be sure to be there for the

937
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,740
Ask Dr. Hal show.

938
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,300
Will we have questions?

939
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,680
Think of questions. Start thinking of your questions now.

940
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,860
Write down your questions and send them

941
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,000
to me, Dr. Howland Owl.

942
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,740
And I will analyze

943
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,660
them as is my wont and

944
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,980
give you my

945
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,280
incorruptible answers.

946
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,840
Right. If you can supply your own pencil

947
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,360
and paper, that would be great.

948
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,780
But tomorrow we will

949
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,020
bring a bunch of cut up strips

950
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,820
of typewriter.

951
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,860
Yes, we always do that.

952
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,440
Tomorrow is Thursday, right?

953
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:25,900
All day.

954
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,960
Or is today Thursday?

955
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,480
Tomorrow's Friday.

956
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,680
Alright, I'm not up on these things.

957
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,800
And after

958
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
the Ask Dr. Hal

959
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,560
show, we're going to have the first

960
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,460
installment of the Bulldada

961
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,500
auction right here

962
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,560
on this stage in

963
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,680
Caffeina's restaurant.

964
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,080
No way to stop it.

965
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,400
This is a sealed

966
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,620
copy.

967
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,100
This is a copy of the

968
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,940
subgenius in-vogue game.

969
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,100
You see, we have really thought

970
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,680
that there isn't enough stuff,

971
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,220
but maybe we could be wrong.

972
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,460
And if we are, maybe the best

973
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,280
stuff will be offered first.

974
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,480
So you owe it to your little

975
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,840
avaricious self to scuttle

976
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,660
down here and be in the front row

977
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,860
when the auctioneering begins.

978
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,000
And you might walk away with

979
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,440
a huge towering, tottering

980
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,540
heap of swag, which you purchased

981
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,460
much cheaper than other chumps

982
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,140
would have to spend.

983
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,720
We haven't seen many tottering heaps of swag.

984
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,620
Well, we're hoping that we will.

985
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,780
We usually have seen some tottering heaps,

986
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,720
but not of swag.

987
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,200
All right.

988
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,940
That was a show.

989
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,380
I'm sorry.

990
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,400
That was ill chosen.

991
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,820
But what we're going to do is hope that

992
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,420
as often happens, people

993
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,660
come up with last minute contributions,

994
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,380
which makes the Bulldada auction

995
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,160
a remarkable thing.

996
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,540
That is followed immediately from six

997
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,280
o'clock to eight o'clock by the Cock and

998
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,500
Tail party at Caffeina's.

999
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,240
Oh, the drinkers.

1000
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,940
Drinking starts on Friday.

1001
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,140
Then at eight thirty, the Hypercube

1002
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,700
presentation begins.

1003
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,120
And at nine o'clock, the Ex Mortis

1004
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,060
Experience, the Rantathon and Doctors

1005
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,080
for Wotan.

1006
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,780
Oh my god, Dr.

1007
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,680
Vofilo better get here because he's

1008
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,100
the other half of Doctors for Wotan.

1009
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,540
At 1030 p.m., Andrew the Impaled will

1010
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,860
perform his painful set, Painful to Watch.

1011
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,180
Don't sit too close if you've got

1012
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,220
clothes that you don't want to wear.

1013
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,340
I don't want blood all over them.

1014
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,980
It is called the Physical Pain Set.

1015
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,540
And at 11 o'clock, the Evolution Control

1016
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,480
Committee, who just arrived at our

1017
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,200
spacious campground, will begin its

1018
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,800
presentation.

1019
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:37,320
And then after that, Liberty Hall, boys

1020
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,920
and girls, freeform rants, jazz, anything.

1021
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,100
That was pretty good last night.

1022
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:42,920
That's right.

1023
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,440
And so you never know what might happen.

1024
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,240
Yes.

1025
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,580
It's one madcap presentation after another

1026
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,100
to keep your head spinning until the

1027
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,620
spinning of the great saucer puts the

1028
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:59,600
kibosh on planet Earth.

1029
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,160
Praise Bob.

1030
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,160
Saturday's action-packed day because

1031
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,700
it's the Bobtism and more free food and

1032
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,060
alcohol.

1033
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,200
All right.

1034
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,360
Yeah.

1035
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,400
Let's talk about that too since no one

1036
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,180
reads the schedule.

1037
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:15,860
Saturday, we begin with the Pancakery Feast

1038
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,000
right here once again.

1039
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,280
Free pancakes.

1040
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,080
At Gatwick.

1041
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,060
And Scrapple.

1042
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,960
Free Scrapple, not to be confused with

1043
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,740
Eaton Scrapple.

1044
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,840
And pancakes with real maple syrup spiked

1045
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,820
from actual suffering Canadian maples.

1046
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,000
And then from 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock, the

1047
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,760
Bobtism in Old Sequoia's Lair, the pond.

1048
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,920
I was in it this morning and it was quite

1049
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,720
delightful.

1050
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,260
The pH problem of the water has been solved.

1051
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,220
The pond is open.

1052
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,000
That's great.

1053
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,060
And that is where we will be.

1054
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:51,020
We will have the usual traditional Bobtism.

1055
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,220
Oh, by the way, it's perfectly cool to wear

1056
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,580
a swimsuit.

1057
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,900
You can do that if you want.

1058
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:59,500
You do not by any means have to take all

1059
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,400
your clothes off.

1060
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:06,160
And then, following this debauchery, at 3 o'clock,

1061
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,320
I mean 3.30, is once again the live hour of Slack.

1062
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,620
Oh, followed by another Ask Dr. Hal.

1063
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,040
And then at 5.30 comes the Bobtism.

1064
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,180
And then comes the short and long duration

1065
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,260
marriage services performed by my golfing and prayer partner,

1066
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,100
Reverend Ivan Stang over here on my right side.

1067
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,100
I'm trying to talk that nice young couple into

1068
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,240
consummating their marriage right then and there.

1069
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,360
Then comes the costume ball followed by the

1070
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:44,300
potluck taco party where unusual taco meat of

1071
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,020
different kinds and species will be placed in the

1072
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,020


1073
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,340
traditional taco shell and consumed with robust relish.

1074
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,640
Finally, this is followed by the Bobby Awards.

1075
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,840
The coveted Bobby Awards where all who are thought

1076
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:08,160
worthy are given special valuable prizes which can be

1077
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,600
bequeathed as a rich legacy unto your issue.

1078
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:18,020
Then, then the, on the main stage, ranters jammed

1079
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,040
the

1080
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:34,220
No, it's different.

1081
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,100
It'll be different.

1082
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,960
That's when he sings.

1083
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,740
It's the audio pain.

1084
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,240
He hurts us instead of himself.

1085
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,540
The audio pain set.

1086
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,480
And at 11.30, The Burning by Stephen King,

1087
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,060
America's most popular author.

1088
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,840
Yes, this is actually The Burning of the Dobbs

1089
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,960
Eidolon, which will happen.

1090
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:58,700
And at 12 a.m., midnight, Arcology X with DJs Gravity,

1091
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,440
Sam Snow, 2B, Harry Haster, and Maynard Brainard.

1092
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,000
Be there for the end of the private life.

1093
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,420
And so on behalf of the Church of the Subgenius,

1094
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:16,940
this is Dr. Howland Owl and Dr. Ivan Stang signing off from this,

1095
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:23,060
this thing that we do and we'll be doing tomorrow and the day after that and on and

1096
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,760
on and more of it and more like this.

1097
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,380
Fly legs and spider heads through his brain.

1098
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,180
One sip and I'm gone.

1099
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,020
Oh my God.

1100
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,020
Then he got down to it.

1101
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:34,500
Bob.

1102
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,060
Perfect round black hole.

1103
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,560
Bob.

1104
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,880
Entry positions in the rear.

1105
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:39,620
Bob.

1106
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,260
Bob.

1107
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,000
Bob.

1108
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,740
Bob.

1109
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,080
Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

1110
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,820
Bob.

1111
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,640
Bob's, Bob's own Bob's head.

1112
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,180
Oh my God.

1113
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,660
I'm waiting for those dogs, has rained down on me

1114
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,960
I'm waiting for those dogs, has rained down on me

1115
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,080
I'm waiting for those dogs, has rained down on me

1116
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,420
From within that glowing cloud

1117
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,460
Radiation slack out, fall everywhere

1118
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:44,040
Radiation slack out, last for a year

1119
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,240
Radiation slack out, is already here

1120
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,580
In this beautiful music world

1121
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,680
Get ready to ping for the coming after you

1122
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,880
Get ready to ping for the coming after you

1123
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,180
Get ready to ping for the coming after you

1124
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,480
From that big glowing cloud to the cloud

1125
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,680
Radiation slack out, fall everywhere

1126
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,920
Radiation slack out, last for a year

1127
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,180
Radiation slack out, is already here

1128
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,680
In this beautiful music world

00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,160
Get ready to ping for the coming after you

Get ready to ping for the coming after you

1131

Get ready to ping for the coming after you

1132
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,660
We don't need a return, the sun is setting

1133
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:13,660


1134
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:13,660


1135
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:13,660


1136
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,760
Glowing all to clouds

1137
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,480
Radiation slack out

1138
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,780
Fall everywhere

1139
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,740
Radiation slack out

1140
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,360
Last for a year

1141
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,040
Radiation slack out

1142
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,620
It's already here

1143
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,860
In our beautiful music world

1144
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,720
Get ready, normal's coming after you

1145
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,900
Get ready, normal's coming after you

1146
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,060
Get ready, normal's coming after you

1147
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,240
In that beautiful mutant world

1148
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,760
Radiation slack out

1149
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,100
Fall everywhere

1150
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,640
Radiation slack out

1151
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,660
Last for a year

1152
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,280
Radiation slack out

1153
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,860
It's already here

1154
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,120
In this beautiful mutant world
