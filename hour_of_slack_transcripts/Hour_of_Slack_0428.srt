1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,760
Finally tonight, have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,680
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chants emanating from their apartment?

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,100
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,720
Now, I wanted to drive.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,460
And I said, man, we're in hell.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,380
And he says, yeah, ain't it groovy?

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,700
He just took the gun to his head and bang.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,460
He went back and got the razor blade and closed my eyes and sliced.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:51,220
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,320
That's right.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,080
And only in the city of...

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,540
Right here.

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,460
Oh, it feels good.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,420
I never had an overreach experience.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,340
Are you suffering from inflammation?

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:08,720
Hello?

17
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,980
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,660
I just kind of took more acid.

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,840
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,360
The subgenius hour of slack.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,960
What?

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
What is up?

23
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
We were brought up on your TV.

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,800
I love you.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,680
You live within the womb of a technological society.

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,140
The powers of a god.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,200
Will you just calm down? There's got to be a logical explanation for this.

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,360
Only, only a little bit more minute.

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,160

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,160

00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,160


33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,580
Well, you will.

00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:06,720


40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:06,720


41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:06,720


42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,320

75
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,400

78
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,220
dear friends and partners you may learn something

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,920
new about the church of the subgenius although i must

80
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,280
admit i learned something new about the other churches

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,640
i've got this little news this was in the news just yesterday

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,080
from a trusting the

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,080


84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:23,520
yesterday from uh steel netherlands a natural disaster ended a prayer marathon yes a natural

85
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:37,860
disaster ended almost a century of continuous prayer by the quote pink sisters unquote that's preserved by the quote pink sisters unquote that's pink sister stera friend and i'm not making any of this up at

86
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,460
at their convent in this southern Dutch village.

87
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,520
Since the Roman Catholic convent was founded in 1896,

88
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:54,220
at least one pink-habited nun from the Order of Servants of the Holy Ghost of Everlasting Devotion

89
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,000
was always in the convent chapel praying.

90
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
But Christmas night, floodwaters swept through Limburg province

91
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:11,500
and cut the heat and lights in the convent and forced the 40 nuns to evacuate to another convent.

92
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:22,160
You don't easily give up such a tradition, Mother Superior Maria Adjutrix told the newspaper Dagblad Vir Nord Limburg.

93
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:32,280
But when we sat for some time without electricity and heating, we decided to go to a nearby convent.

94
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,660
Ah, yes, well, the Pink Sisters.

95
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Hundred years of non-stop praying stopped by an act of God.

96
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:52,420
However, in other godly news, former Vice President Dan Quayle in Lancaster, California,

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:08:00,900
received a standing ovation at a Baptist church after telling churchgoers that America is a religious nation.

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,320
Yes.

99
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,880
Yes.

100
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,460
You won't believe.

101
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,900
I love this.

102
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,940
Dan Quayle said, quote,

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,600
Government is to protect religion from government.

104
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,880
It is not to protect government from religion.

105
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Mr. Quayle said Sunday as he helped dedicate the new $3.3 million Lancaster Baptist Church,

106
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,240
he warned that conservative Christians face bigotry.

107
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,260
Well, that's true.

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,480
In some cases they do.

109
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,320
And I ain't exactly feeling sorry for them.

110
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:43,300
Because they also face silent support from all the mainstream Christian yo-yos

111
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:51,080
who don't seem to care if those fanatics drag the behavior of their God through the mud.

112
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,380
But in the meantime, we here have an alternative.

113
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,880
A swinging alternative, friends.

114
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,460
As you can tell by this swing.

115
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,720
Swingin', swingin' music.

116
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,280
Let's just lean back and have a nice relaxing show, shall we?

117
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,560
Look at the picture.

118
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
See the skull.

119
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,580
The part of bone removed.

120
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,500
The master race Frankenstein radio controls.

121
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
The brain thoughts broadcasting radio.

122
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
The eyesight television.

123
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,120
The Frankenstein earphone radio.

124
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,020
The threshold brainwash radio.

125
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,440
The latest new skull reforming to contain all Frankenstein.

126
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,920
Frankenstein controls.

127
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Even in thin skulls of white pedigree males.

128
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,700
Visible Frankenstein controls.

129
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,080
The synthetic nerve radio directional antenna loop.

130
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,720
Make copies for yourself.

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,680
There is no escape from this worse gangster police state.

132
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,820
Using all of the deadly gangster Frankenstein controls.

133
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,780
In this little pamphlet you've given me, it says,

134
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
repent, quit your job, and slack off.

135
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,960
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die.

136
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,060
Is this your message to the world?

137
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,840
Those are sort of mind-catching slogans.

138
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,280
This is a church that does...

139
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,680
We do this particular sick mind-control cult

140
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
does give you back your mind after we're through with it.

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,560
When somebody needs to be killed,

142
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,960
you do it.

143
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,720
Oh, hello.

144
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm Dr. Howell of the Church of the Subgenius.

145
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,600
I suppose many of you,

146
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,940
even at this late date,

147
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,400
are somewhat confused and maybe a bit bothered

148
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,260
about just what are a subgenius anyway.

149
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,160
Okay, I'm Reverend Sterno Docks.

150
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,680
I front one of the official heretical offshoots

151
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,840
of the Church of the Subgenius,

152
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,480
the bleeding head of the World Cup Golfer Launcher Society.

153
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,120
And we encourage schismatics to join up.

154
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,020
We hope in our indoctrination centers

155
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,540
in Dobstown, Malaysia, to inculcate

156
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,040
a sort of sub-knowledge which will allow

157
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,600
even our most illiterate backward po-bucker initiate to...

158
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,040
bleep at it intuitively.

159
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,040
Take the leaper's face in the dark

160
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,620
and not fall down the stairs and shatter the milk bottle.

161
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,020
Oh.

162
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Hallelujah, take place, Lord!

163
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,820
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

164
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,720
Distractedly before injecting their helpless victims

165
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,500
with large phallic syringes.

166
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,980
In 1965, CIA gangster police beat me bloody,

167
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,940
dragged me in chains from Kennedy, New York, Airport,

168
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,940


169
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:31,940


170
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,280
since then I hide in forced jobless poverty, isolated, alone...

171
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,580
Are y'all out to put down outrageous cult groups?

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
What does this mean?

173
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,700
No, no, this is an outrageous cult group.

174
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,560
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

175
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,660
When you first look at it, some people go,

176
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,180
oh, I get it, this is a takeoff on weird cults

177
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,440
and conspiracies and kooks in general.

178
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Then they look a little bit deeper,

179
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,940
and if they're really an attuned sort of cult,

180
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:01,940


181
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,760
then they realize, oh, I get it,

182
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,500
this really is a weird cult with cosmic wisdom and dogma

183
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,260
that I've been needing all my life.

184
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
So, friends, grab the reins of this runaway stagecoach

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,240
and get back on the path to slacktown.

186
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,940
The lifestyle you save may be your own.

187
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,560
Whoo!

188
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,180
Whoo!

189
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,520
Oh, let's hear some more from that right, rigid Reverend Mike.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,760
Slactivism.

191
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,240
It's a word that we've just come across.

192
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,580
Dear friends, slacktivism means you gotta work for your slack.

193
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,880
You gotta fight some long, hard battles for your precious slack.

194
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,060
You can't just sit on your butt.

195
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,760
You gotta be prepared to break ties

196
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,900
with the people that can't maintain slack.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,060
Slack is freedom, but you gotta fight for it.

198
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,260
You gotta fight to keep it.

199
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,340
Slack is lifestyle, a philosophy, a state of mind.

200
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,560
To paraphrase Kris Kristofferson's Me and Bobby McGee,

201
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
the last and greatest song recorded by the immortal Janis Joplin,

202
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,620
a true incarnation of Connie Dobbs,

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,740
slack is just another word for nothing less than slack.

204
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,600
There's nothing left to lose, and nothing ain't worth nothing,

205
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,260
but it's $20.

206
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,180
Send it in.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,080
The long, bumpy road to slack is paved with all the normals

208
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,200
and all the normal institutions

209
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,640
and all the normals that should be in institutions

210
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,480
and all the normal philosophies that want to control you.

211
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,300
Control.

212
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,620
It's the control freaks,

213
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,360
the moralist control freaks,

214
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,220
the crusading control freaks you gotta watch out for.

215
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,360
Question authority.

216
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,020
Slack is not just goofing off,

217
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,400
although goofing off might be the ultimate form of slack,

218
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,480
but slack has gotta be taking responsibility for your irresponsibility.

219
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,860
You gotta be experiencing the joyous, creative anarchy

220
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,020
of your own life.

221
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,640
You gotta revel in some chaos.

222
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,360
You gotta revel in some chaos creatively.

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,740
You gotta rebel against your normality.

224
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,860
Slack does imply some guidelines for life.

225
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,580
Mainly, firstly, send in your damn $20.

226
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,980
Write the check.

227
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,660
Secondly, rid your life of everything that is in the way of slack.

228
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,240
Thirdly, cultivate the highest form of slack.

229
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,620
Make it a living art form.

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,940
Make your life a work of high weirdness.

231
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,800
A life of slack performance art.

232
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,540
Fourthly, help others to fill their lives with slack.

233
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,720
But don't fall into that trap of proselytizing missionary eyes

234
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,900
and don't ever force anyone to do anything,

235
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,060
to think anything,

236
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,380
to think anything.

237
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,840
If they can't take a joke,

238
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,420
don't bother telling them a joke.

239
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,620
Get on with your own life.

240
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,820
Get on with your own slackitude.

241
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,300
Occasionally, your approach might have to become overt and public.

242
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,720
You might have to wage some nasty public battles

243
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,380
when the normals and their ever-present institutions of control

244
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,160
begin aggressively robbing entire groups of people

245
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,820
of most of their slack,

246
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,540
such as we find today in Cobb County, Georgia.

247
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,100
Thus is born slacktivism.

248
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,880
Anal retentiveness.

249
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,680
It's the motivation of the control freaks.

250
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,240
Have you ever noticed that the most anal retentive person

251
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,760
in any organization is the person who is in charge of that organization?

252
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,140
Have you ever noticed that anal people seek high-level control?

253
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,580
They seek higher and higher levels of status, power, responsibility, influence,

254
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,640
bigger and better work details for more and more people.

255
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,300
They say they want more money, but they don't.

256
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,100
Because as soon as they get more money,

257
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,600
that's the very next thing they want.

258
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,700
Still more money.

259
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,040
It's a power trip.

260
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,160
An ego trip.

261
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,480
A control freak addiction.

262
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,860
Bigger and better work details for more and more people.

263
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
Gotta wear those uniforms.

264
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,960
Gotta wear those ties and tight collars.

265
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,480
Gotta wear those tight shoes.

266
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,220
Gotta wear those high-heeled shoes and pantyhose.

267
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,320
Hold yourself in.

268
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,300
Suck in that gut.

269
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,400
Clench that anus.

270
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,380
Hold that sphincter.

271
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,200
Hold that sphincter muscle tight.

272
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,480
Don't let anything out.

273
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,100
Play the game until you die.

274
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,120
More and more toys.

275
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,600
Bigger and more expensive.

276
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,420
Cars, houses, electronics, furniture.

277
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,420
More and more junk.

278
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,220
More power.

279
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,800
More power.

280
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:07,940
Higher.

281
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,380
Higher.

282
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,740
Higher.

283
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,480
More status.

284
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,120
More status.

285
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,220
Bigger and better work details for more and more people.

286
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,240
The one who dies with most toys wins the game.

287
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,180
Suck in that gut.

288
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,100
Clench that anus.

289
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,840
Hold that sphincter.

290
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,320
Tighter.

291
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:17,740
Tighter.

292
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,100
Tighter.

293
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,400
Higher.

294
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,560
Higher.

295
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,000
Higher.

296
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,800
Bigger.

297
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,140
Bigger.

298
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,380
Bigger.

299
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,600
More.

300
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:20,920
More.

301
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,160
More.

302
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,360
More.

303
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,520
More.

304
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
Really bitchin'.

305
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,120
Really, really bitchin' threads on a fast red car.

306
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:26,580
No.

307
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:26,880
Too.

308
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,100
Too fast red.

309
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,180
Super expensive cars.

310
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,560
Now.

311
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:29,820
Go.

312
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,240
Go.

313
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,460
Go.

314
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,060
Faster.

315
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,740
Faster.

316
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,300
Faster.

317
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,260
More power.

318
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,980
More power.

319
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,220
Go.

320
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,500
Go.

321
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:34,700
Go.

322
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,180
Consume like a son of a bitch.

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,360
Eat everything in sight.

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,080
You're gonna explode you bastard.

325
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,560
Maybe then and only then you'll know the meaning of slack.

326
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,920
Slack.

327
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
Slack to the future.

328
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,420
Subgenius talent should not be wasted.

329
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,380
Subgenius talent should not be spent in slavery to the pink boys of the multi-million.

330
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,460
Subgenius development should not be wasted in a society national, normal corporation.

331
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,140
Subgeniusity should never be allowed to languish in inactivity.

332
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,780
Slack to nature, slack to visum.

333
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,160
Build a new world devoted to slack.

334
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,860
Oh brave new worlds that have such slack in them.

335
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,040
Subgenius space colonies dotting the inner and outer solar system.

336
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,640
Millions of orbiting mini worlds devoted to nothing.

337
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,360
To the last.

338
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


339
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


340
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


341
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


342
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


343
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


344
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


345
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


346
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


347
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


348
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


349
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


350
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


351
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


352
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


353
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


354
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


355
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


356
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,360


357
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,260
but slack to meet, commune, and merge

358
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,880
with the coming race of super slack-tating saucermen.

359
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,380
A universe of slack.

360
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,220
You know, Susie, I gotta say,

361
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,760
you are listening to WREK Atlanta.

362
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,920
Well, I know you. You were.

363
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,300
If you were there.

364
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,120
Still dies anyway.

365
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,660
I think we need to hear from a fellow mutant here.

366
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,660
Ms. Marvel, who's kind of a...

367
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,320
No, we're not going to hear from Ms. Marvel,

368
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,040
but we did just hear from Reverend Mike Rolfone

369
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,820
doing that slack.

370
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,000
Slack-tivism rant there,

371
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,440
previously, originally broadcast at WREK Atlanta

372
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,780
on the subgenius show with Reverend Susie the Floozy.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,920
Ah, yes, and praise Reverend Mike Rolfone.

374
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,320
He sounds a little bit like Reverend Orton Nenslow

375
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,480
in that one there towards the end.

376
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,640
But in the meantime...

377
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,280
I'm...

378
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,540
I'm...

379
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,780
, I'm...

380
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:22,780


381
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm...

382
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,440
I'm...

383
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,440


384
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,440


385
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,440


386
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,800
I look outside my window, what do I see?

387
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,000
I see a nation's life, which is story and tragedy.

388
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,180
A world void of dissonance.

389
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,740
You see villains, priests, politicians.

390
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,520
Evil men and evil women who claim to speak the word of God.

391
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,100
Evil men and evil women who claim to speak the word of God.

392
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,620
I see all the words your leaders are saying.

393
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,000
I see the boss and rhetoric keep them in line.

394
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,200
I see the boss and rhetoric keep them in line.

395
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,400
Thank you.

396
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,520
Thank you.

397
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,900
Thank you.

398
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,740
Thank you.

399
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,820
Thank you.

400
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,080
Thank you.

401
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,020
Well, that's why.

402
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,260
The brazen, deadly gangster police

403
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,200
that spray me with poison nerve gas

404
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,740
from automobile exhausts and even lawnmowers.

405
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,700
Deadly assaults even in my yard with knives,

406
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,260
even bricks and stones,

407
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,520
even deadly-touched Tabin or electric shock flashlights,

408
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,600
even remote, electronically-controlled,

409
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,860
around-corners projection of deadly-touched tarantula spiders,

410
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,460
or even bloody murder accidents

411
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,080
to shut me up forever with a sneak, undetectable extermination

412
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,620
even with trained parroting puppet assassins

413
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,020
in maximum security insanity prison

414
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,280
for writing these unforgivable truths

415
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,580
until my undetectable extermination,

416
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,860
I, Francis E. Deck Esquire,

417
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,600
29 Maple Avenue, Hempstead, New York,

418
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,960
I stand alone against your mad, deadly,

419
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,140
worldwide, conspiratorial, gangster, computer god communism

420
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,380
with wall-to-wall deadly gangster protection,

421
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,580
lifelong sworn conspirators,

422
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,380
conspirators, murder, incorporated organized crime,

423
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,600
the police and judges,

424
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,780
the deadly, sneak-parroting puppet gangsters

425
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,580
using all the gangster-deadly Frankenstein controls,

426
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,360
these hangman-rope, sneak-deadly gangsters,

427
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,760
the judges and the police,

428
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,920
trick, trap, rob, wreck, butcher,

429
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,860
and murder the people that keep them terrorized

430
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,800
in gangster Frankenstein earphone radio slavery

431
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,900
for the communist gangster government

432
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,520
and con-artist, parroting puppet gangster,

433
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,220
playboy scum on top.

434
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,940
You can't stand the heat, you better stay out of the kitchen.

435
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
High priests of the unpredictable.

436
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,460
Bob, unlike other gurus,

437
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,340
doesn't demand that you believe in him all the time.

438
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,280
In fact, he pushes the idea of short-duration personal saviors.

439
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,520
You should have your own church.

440
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,260
You should make up your own church, ultimately.

441
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,260
Those who stay,

442
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,360
and subgenius,

443
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,440
and cling to it like Trekkies do to Star Trek,

444
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,220
are not really subgeniuses.

445
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,000
Those people are, unfortunately, humans.

446
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,160
Amen.

447
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,280
Yes, each individual has his own church,

448
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,020
each house, a kingdom,

449
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,320
each yard, a nuclear territory

450
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,220
to be defended to the point of total war.

451
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,380
And subgeniuses are not joiners.

452
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,560
They don't...

453
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,480
generally hate one another

454
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,320
almost as much as they hate everybody else.

455
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,240
From then on, there's no stopping the bomb

456
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,280
as it spreads from town to town.

457
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,600
Oh, speaking of hate,

458
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,300
I've got just the perfect thing to play right there.

459
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,960
This is the steriles.

460
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,900
Reverend Susie the Floozy found this.

461
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,540
This is her anthem on the rag.

462
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,680
I'm on the rag

463
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,320
Get me a Kotex

464
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,320
How about a pamperin'?

465
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,580
I hate men

466
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm on the rag

467
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,140
I'm on the rag

468
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm swollen like a pig

469
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:15,560


470
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:15,560


471
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,640
Get me a pamperin'

472
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,980
My boobs hurt

473
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,380
I'm on the rag

474
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm on the rag

475
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,040
Get me a Kotex

476
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm on the rag

477
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,980
I hate you

478
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,400
I hate me

479
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,560
So I'm on the rag!

480
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,420
I'm on the rag!

481
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,420
I'm on the rag!

482
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,120
Get me a Kotex!

483
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,740
I'm on the rag!

484
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,940
I'm on the rag!

485
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,300
I hate you!

486
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,920
I hate me!

487
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,780
So I'm on the rag!

488
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,620
I'm on the rag!

489
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,520
I hate men!

490
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,560
Don't even think of me.

491
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


492
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


493
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


494
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


495
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


496
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:15,560


497
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,420
I can't think of it tonight.

498
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,160
Of course I'd be wearing white.

499
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,380
I'm on the rack!

500
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm on the rack!

501
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,160
Get me a coattie!

502
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,980
I'm on the rack!

503
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,220
I hate you! I hate this!

504
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,060
I'm on the rack!

505
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm on the rack!

506
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm on the rack.

507
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,780
Get me ainalett central!

508
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,020
I'm on the rack!

509
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,840
I hate you! I hate me!

510
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm on the rack!

511
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm on the rack!

512
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,780
I'm on the rack.

513
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,340
Get me a pamphlet!

514
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm on the rack,

515
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,360
I hate you, I hate me, I'm on the run

516
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,460
I'm on the run

517
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,200
Get me a cup of tea

518
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm on the run

519
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,040
I hate you, I hate me, I'm on the run

520
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,720
And I can go horseback riding and swimming

521
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,700
And even put it in my sock

522
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,040
What the hell do you think you're doing?

523
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,820
Dragging your butt through the pain

524
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,640
Yeah, that's a good question, I've heard that part before

525
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in fact I'm afraid it comes up again during the show

526
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,660
Well, on the rag there, OTR by the Sterils

527
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,020
Thanks to Reverend Susie

528
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,020
And I should mention, by the way, that the Media Barrage material that I'm playing tonight

529
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,520
As we always play Media Barrage material in this case

530
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:23,820
Is largely coming off of a videotape done by a Danish subgenius

531
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,340
Yes, a videotape produced partially for Danish television apparently

532
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,520
By Reverend Sven Kristensen

533
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,760
Which I finally saw that tape

534
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,020
This week

535
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,020


536
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,340
This weekend for the first time

537
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,080
And it's amazing

538
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,940
It's a beautiful and horrible example of subgenius barrage editing on videotape

539
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,800
With good equipment

540
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,440
And I wish you all could see it

541
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,520
But apparently you can't

542
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,180
It was hard enough for me to see it

543
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,880
Because it was all

544
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,620
So good to hear a little bit of that old piece of

545
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,020
That's such a traditional piece of subgenius hymn music

546
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,640
Hirosaki there by D.K. Jones

547
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,500
And now back to the pain

548
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,500
Bob saves those who save themselves, my friend

549
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,900
Listen, before we lose people completely

550
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,100
Can you explain exactly what the Church of Subgenius is?

551
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,840
Well, if I could explain exactly

552
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
It wouldn't be interesting to me

553
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,240
Anymore

554
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:44,860
The Church of the Subgenius is basically a religion for mutants, misfits, sinners, disbelievers

555
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,360
Or people who believe anything

556
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,780
And particularly for people with a really sick sense of humor

557
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,720

Bye

593
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:27,900


594
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,700
You are a terrorized member of the master race worldwide.

595
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,860
Four billion eyesight, television camera, guinea pig, communist gangster, computer god, master race.

596
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,080
You're living, thinking, mad, deadly, worldwide communist gangster, computer god, secret, overall plan.

597
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,500
Worldwide living death, Frankenstein, slavery.

598
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,900
To explore and control the entire universe with the endless stairway to the stars.

599
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,340
Namely, the man-made inside-out planets with nucleonic-powered speeds much faster than the speed of light.

600
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,340
Look up and see the gangster computer god-concocted new fake starry sky.

601
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,660
The worldwide completely controlled, deadly, degenerative climate and atmosphere

602
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,900
through the new world-round, translucent, exotic, gaseous envelope

603
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,880
which the worldwide communist gangster computer god manipulates

604
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,720
through countless exactly positioned satellites.

605
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,280
The new fake, phony stars.

606
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,060
In the synthetic sky.

607
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,300
October 1980.

608
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,200
James Hoskins took over this Cincinnati television station.

609
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,680
After making a newscaster his hostage in the parking lot.

610
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,900
They've got their magnums.

611
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,580
I've got my magnums. I'm ready. I'm loaded.

612
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,480
Let them come and

613
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,120
I'm trying to hold them together.

614
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,480
57 Queen City.

615
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,720
You're a hundred hours.

616
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,320
Berserk.

617
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,300
We do not have.

618
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,180
No time. Democracy. At this time.

619
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,000
What am I gonna do?

620
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,720
You may have power for another minute or so.

621
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,700
On this tape.

622
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,220
Is there any other point you want to make?

623
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,400
Gangster government eyesight. TV gangster spy cameras.

624
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,040
Computer god. New world order. Degeneration.

625
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,140
Waiting for police to attack.

626
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,980
He sat in the newscaster's chair and shot himself.

627
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,800
Looks great on TV, doesn't it?

628
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,520
Let them get on their knees, Lord, right now.

629
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,200
I know that we're in hell.

630
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,620
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely because of your ministry.

631
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,260
What the hell do you think you're doing?

632
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,760
Dragging your butt through the day, selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

633
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,740
Deadly ape Frankenstein machines, degenerative disease to eternal Frankenstein slavery.

634
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,060
Overall plan through one world communism.

635
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,640
Top secret code word.

636
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,760
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in the church of the subgenius.

637
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

638
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,260
Bob comes to justify our sins.

639
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,480
Worldwide systematic instant plastic surgery, butchery murder,

640
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,520
fake aging.

641
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
So all people are dead or useless by age 70.

642
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:29,540
Done at night to you as a Frankenstein slave parroting puppet gangster slave.

643
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,800
Now, even you know I am a menace to your worldwide mad, deadly communist gangster computer god.

644
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,980
Therefore, I must go to extermination before I am exterminated by this gangster computer god,

645
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,900
concocted and controlled, worst mongrel, organized crime, murder incorporated gangster communist government.

646
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,660
It's us versus them.

647
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,600
Are you going to...

648
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,000
...try and hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

649
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,100
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

650
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,480
...rool...

651
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
Church of the subgenius eternal salvation or triple your money back.

652
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,460
God cannot lie. It's impossible for God to lie.

653
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,080
It's troubles or woe.

654
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
I have no fear of death no more.

655
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,140
Since on the path of egg.

656
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,740
Great hurt is he that...

657
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:30,700
...with his own spirit then taketh a city for inward rulership is the mastery of the masters.

658
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,980
This too can be yours.

659
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,960
For those at the grassroots and those in doubt who just don't understand.

660
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,660
Let your ears hear these few words.

661
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,220
...to clear out the snow in the autumn.

662
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,440
...to cut the...

663
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,000
...the orca's...

664
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,220

trans zur

668
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,060
I never offered choices I did what I was told

669
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,380
I lived this way until the day I turned 21 years old

670
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:44,100
I found the keys in the ignition I found the thrill was sweet

671
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:52,160
Behind the wheel of an automobile In the driver's seat

672
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:01,760
At 80 miles an hour The car just seemed to float

673
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,580
And I sat back against the seat Tipping whiskey down my throat

674
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:43,380
On on and over the stead

675
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:43,920
Yeah....

676
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,640
Cause we all know where we're headed

677
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,120
Life's a one-way street

678
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,920
But you must decide

679
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,480
If you just wanna ride

680
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Or live through in the driver's seat

681
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,360
Hey, I never saw him coming

682
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,900
I barely felt the shock

683
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,100
I dragged the broken bike behind me

684
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,500
Twice around the block

685
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,600
They never found the poor boy's body

686
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,340
Just some scraps of meat

687
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,200
But they found me

688
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,340
Where else would I be

689
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,640
Sitting in the driver's seat

690
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,840

Of the kitchen

692

If you can't stand the heat

693
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,000
If you don't like it hot

694
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,840

742
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,400
so you don't disturb the service tonight.

743
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,140
Because a lot of people came to hear me and not watch you running in and out of the building,

744
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,480
so you listen to what Bob's saying.

745
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,680
Ooh, hey!

746
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,520
Gonna gag.

747
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,120
Unless we, uh...

748
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,400
Let's have your finger.

749
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,280
Okay.

750
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,540
Ouch!

751
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,400
There.

752
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,700
That wasn't so bad.

753
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,760
Now, was it?

754
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,040
No, it only hurt a little, but it's...

755
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,260
Sure made me jump.

756
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,240
After the lab technician left, the nurse came in to get Matthew ready.

757
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,980
Hi, Matthew.

758
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,100
I have something for you.

759
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,660
Here's a little pill to take.

760
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,920
What's it for?

761
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,740
This pill is to make you feel nice and sleepy before we go upstairs.

762
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,220
I'm your mama, I'm your daddy, I'm that nigga in the alley.

763
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,080
I'm your doctor when you need, want some coke, have some weed.

764
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,920
You know me.

765
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm your friend, your main boy.

766
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,880
Thick and thin.

767
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,500
I'm your pusher man.

768
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,440
Bob.

769
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,540
This is Bob.

770
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,680
Everybody know Bob?

771
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:47,620
Yes.

772
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,440
Okay.

773
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,840
Is Bob safe?

774
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,320
I hope so.

775
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,760
Yeah.

776
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,880
His head's bumping up and down.

777
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,700
I don't know if that's yes or I'm just scared, you know.

778
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,580
But you all pray for Bob because your neck is very important for...

779
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,560
for living and breathing and eating and things like this.

780
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,880
So, no, don't you look, Bob. You just pray.

781
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,920
Bob's in an attitude of prayer now.

782
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,600
He's probably closer to the Lord than he's ever been.

But then, like an enormous billowing paper bag,

788
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,100
came the second.

789
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,700
back of Babylon by the Hittites, an Indo-European speaking people from Asia Minor.

790
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,200
Let us pause.

791
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,980
It's a little known fact that the great Egyptian civilization was founded by none other than

792
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:30,240
Ali Uke, the famous cartoon caveman, who, sent back in time by Dr. Wanmug's time machine,

793
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:39,200
led the first refugees from the defoliating Sahara region to the banks of the Nile River,

794
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:46,940
and founded, with his two performing lions, the first of the dynasties of the Egyptians.

795
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:53,180
Long before the pyramids were built, a high and flourishing civilization had effortlessly

796
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:58,840
evolved from the barbaric life of these primitive nomads.

797
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,220
Thank you.

798
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:09,120
Years later, Uke returned to visit the civilization he had founded, only to disappear once again

799
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:16,760
and return at a still further iteration to see the Sphinx being remade from his own face

800
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,300
to that of the reigning pharaoh.

801
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,100
That's me up there.

802
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,700
But Uke and the pharaoh fought a bitter battle.

803
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:29,400
And only after he had defeated the son of heaven was the caveman rushed upon by the

804
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,040
attendants.

805
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,220
Stop.

806
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,220


807
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:30,220


808
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,800
and guards of the Divine One. Fortunately, at that moment Dr. Juan Mug's time machine

809
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:47,180
scooped Oop up into the future, our path. Yes, these Oop antics occurred in 1947, our

810
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:54,280
human time. But far back to the ancient Egyptians, who know how they measured time? You know,

811
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,180
maybe it was when the sun was right overhead, that was noon. That was the way they did it.

812
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,560
And yet, a complicated mathematical system caused the pyramids to be erected. The vulgar

813
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,980
believe that the pyramids were created by Jule Brinner and Charlton Heston and the back-breaking

814
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:18,520
labor of slaves who grunted and sweated under a boiling sun to bear fartholes. And when

815
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,840
they might their quietus have made with a bear botkin, well, this is nothing but a tissue

816
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,700
of horseradish.

817
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,580
Mustaches drank beer and hung out like the guys everywhere.

818
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,860
Exactly. They weren't slaves. They had a

819
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,160
hell of a life.

820
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,140
They had a hell of a time building those things. Why, just think of how it would solve

821
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,960
unemployment problems in our own country.

822
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,760
Vacation.

823
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,540
We'll put the homeless to work building some giant classy marble pyramids which will

824
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,280
be around forever to impress all other civilizations.

825
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,100
Cool, man. Sure, I'll join up.

826
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,640
Yeah, we'll solve our problems right there. We don't need to invent new fancy schmancy

827
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,660
solutions. Just build some pyramids and obelisks and monuments and set up an acropolis. Get

828
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:56,700
everybody working on it. Don't use power tools. Hire more people and have them shift the stones

829
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,140
by hand. Like I said, we're not going to be able to do it. We're going to have to do it.

830
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,300
The

831
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


832
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


833
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


834
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


835
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


836
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


837
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,300


838
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,320
Like they did when great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,

839
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:09,800
great, great, great, great, great, grand papa was a little boy. During the periclean age.

840
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:15,920
Yes, I remember it well. I may be older than Johnny Carson but I'm not that old. Oh yeah,

841
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,980
I guess I am that old. Because I remember it. And I may not be as old as Herb Gein

842
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,700
but I guess...

843
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,580
All right, all right, all right, um now.

844
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,120
Nobody took part in the protest.

845
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,120


846
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,700
Follow in your book and repeat after me.

847
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,920
Well, all right, then don't.

848
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
We've got to do a little lesson.

849
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,180
Gosh, I...

850
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,600
Go ahead, Hal.

851
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,680
I'm afraid the test was already given, but you can take a makeup test.

852
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,080
Well, I think you'd better.

853
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,400
Your makeup is not looking very good this evening.

854
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,580
Oh, thanks, Hal. I appreciate it.

855
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,740
We are slightly deficient in history, according to...

856
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,100
What? Okay, yeah.

857
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,420
What were we hearing?

858
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,560
Well, of course, that was Dr. Hal and puzzling evidence there

859
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,620
on the KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley.

860
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,160
And before that, we heard some butthole surfers

861
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,880
and a little bit of media barrage type of material that came off of a tape.

862
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,680
Actually, a lot of the music also came off of a tape

863
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,660
by our good friend Reverend Gary Blaine in Akron.

864
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,660
There, and even before that, some frapping music

865
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,840
by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

866
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,100
And, friends, you know, you can get more of the same.

867
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,680
Not that you'd necessarily be wanting it all that badly right now,

868
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,320
but you could.

869
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,000
Were you to simply write for free information

870
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,940
from this marvelous church of the subgenius.

871
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,540
I'll be giving that post office box in just a second here.

872
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,360
You know, you only have to address that...

873
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,920
That...

874
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,960
Request for free information.

875
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,540
That self-addressed stamped envelope to Bob.

876
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,380
Just address it to Bob.

877
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,180
And these few little numbers I've got coming up,

878
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,100
that's at post office box, right?

879
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,940
Bob at post office box 140306.

880
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,940
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

881
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,120
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

882
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,040
Zip code 75214.

883
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,800
So simple.

884
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,780
You could almost just write Bob 75214.

885
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,280
It'd probably make it here.

886
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,920
But just in case right in that box 14306...

887
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,380
75214...

888
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,920
How do I adapt this music?

889
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,900
As the world grows ever stranger

890
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,280
and our traditional values seem to lose their meaning,

891
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,760
thousands of Americans have rushed into the arms

892
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
of bizarre religious cults

893
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,260
to find a sense of spiritual security.

894
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,280
Shoot!

895
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,660
Some people go crazy at this point.

896
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,060
Perhaps the strangest of these cults

897
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,260
is a little known group called the Church of the Subgenius.

898
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,120
Tell that whore to get off the phone.

899
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,860
The first rule of the Church of the Subgenius is

900
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,000
the subgenius must have love!

901
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,920
Why must he have love?

902
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


903
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


904
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:22,920


905
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,460
Why must he have love?

906
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,480
Why must he have love?

907
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,480
It's a religious experience.

908
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,460
Dear son,

909
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:35,680
you ask my reaction to long hair or beards on young people.

910
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,320
Some great men have worn long hair and beards.

911
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,840
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

912
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,760
If to you long hair or a beard is a symbol of independence,

913
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,740
if you believe in your heart that the principles of this country,

914
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,900
our heritage,

915
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,900
is worthy of this display,

916
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,520
a display of pride,

917
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,800
that all men shall remain free,

918
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:02,020
that free men at all times will not inflict their personal limitations of achievement on others,

919
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,940
to demand your own rights as well as the rights of others,

920
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,980
and be willing to fight for this right,

921
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,900
you have my blessing.

922
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,020
You ask that I not judge you merely as a teenager,

923
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,680
to judge you on your own personal habits, abilities, and goals.

924
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,380
This is a fair request.

925
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:25,320
And I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager.

926
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,780
If you will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation

927
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,880
judges people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin,

928
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,380
and that this is no more right than saying all teenagers are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers.

929
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,980
If you will judge every human being on his own individual potential,

930
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,080
I will do the same.

931
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,360
You ask me,

932
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,620
if God is dead.

933
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,340
This is a question each individual must answer within himself.

934
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,220
Could a warm summer day with all its brightness,

935
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,760
all its sound,

936
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,020
all its exhilarating breathiness,

937
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,360
just happen?

938
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,360
God is love.

939
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,040
Remember that God is a guide and not a storm trooper.

940
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:15,500
Realize that many of the past and present generation,

941
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,460
because of a well-intentioned but unjustifiable misconception,

942
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,300
have attempted to legislate morality.

943
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,660
This created part of the basis for your generation's need

944
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,740
to rebel against our society.

945
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,920
With this knowledge, perhaps your children will never ask,

946
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,380
is God dead?

947
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,060
I sometimes think much of mankind is attempting to work him to death.

948
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,140
It was simply a very bad situation.

949
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,400
The second war of the 15th century.

950
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:46,980


951
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:47,920
Yeah!

952
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,060
Too much!

953
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,620
It's always better than not enough!

954
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,280
Now, let me give you an example.

955
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,020
War!

956
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,260
Hey, baby,

957
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,520
das ist ein starker Verharr.

958
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,260
What a relief to everybody if videos could be edited at home.

959
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,700
Well, now you can.

960
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,780
Hmm, well, that sounds easy enough.

961
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,640
Let's get started.

962
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,940
There's too much data.

963
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,680
Gotta work out a gun.

964
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,880
Mental fatigue, what can you say?

965
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,740
I hand you the secrets to save the entire human race

966
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,120
and the entire universe.

967
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,780
Donate money or even a manual typewriter to me.

968
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,520
And then an edited tape with no boring bits.

969
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,780
It tends to put even the most polite guest to sleep.

970
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,700
Will you turn on your television set?

971
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,200
Well, I'll blind you!

972
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,640
Oh.

973
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,660
Then I dealt with it by taking drugs.

974
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,680
Now, Bob.

975
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,160
The face appeared, and it's Bob.

976
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,920
That's the Holy Spirit.

977
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,580
That's Bob.

978
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,060
He's kind of kind of Bob.

979
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,200
Bob's is all man.

980
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,820
The red-blooded he-man that every woman really wants.

981
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,560
I think his face says it all.

982
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,080
Each.

983
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,460
Dot.

984
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,900
Is a raging ideogram of lustfulness, which somehow manages to convey its message.

985
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:29,400
Those who are sexually troubled one way or another should not stare too strongly at this drawing.

986
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,240
Look with your closed eyes at your genitals.

987
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,980
And say to your genitals,

988
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,360
in your mind,

989
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,480
relax.

990
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,220
The Reverend Ivan Stang, who doesn't want his real name used to protect his wife and kids,

991
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,820
says he'll offer an immense cash prize to anyone who can prove that Bob Dobbs is just a piece of clip art.

992
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,220
Now.

993
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,060
You think I'm crazy, right?

994
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,380
Now, you've never seen the man himself, have you?

995
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,620
No, I managed to turn my face away in the nick of time.

996
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:16,160
My partner was not so lucky and is now hideously disfigured by the love,

997
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:22,720
the radioactive love and money that emanates from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

998
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,040
Bob serves the path of least resistance.

999
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,140
That's how Bob does it.

1000
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,420
He follows the path of least resistance.

1001
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,360
It's about eating the damn thing in the world.

1002
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,880
And there's no reason you shouldn't be doing it, too.

1003
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,460
Having your cake and eating it, too.

1004
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,820
That's what this is all about.

1005
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:45,900
All past wars have been dirty, unfair, immoral, bloody, and second-guessed.

1006
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,660
However, history has shown most of them necessary.

1007
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:56,000
If you doubt that our free enterprise system in the United States is worth protecting,

1008
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,980
if you doubt the principles upon which this country was founded,

1009
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:06,400
that we remain free to choose our religion, our individual endeavors, our method of government,

1010
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:13,940
if you doubt that each free individual in this great country should reap awards commensurate only with his own efforts,

1011
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,140
then it's doubtful you believe in the world.

1012
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,740
You belong here.

1013
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:26,020
If you doubt that people to govern us should be selected by their desire to allow us to strive for any goal we feel capable of attaining,

1014
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,000
then it's doubtful you should participate in their selection.

1015
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:36,460
If you are not grateful to a country that gave your father the opportunity to work for his family,

1016
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,320
to give you the things you have,

1017
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,880
and you do not feel pride enough to fight for your right to continue in this manner,

1018
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,900
then I assume the blame.

1019
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,020
For your failure to recognize the true value of our birthright.

1020
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,420
And I would remind you that your mother will love you no matter what you do,

1021
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,940
because she is a woman.

1022
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,280
Jesus Christ! What are you crazy out there?

1023
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,260
I'm a sinner, Lord.

1024
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,620
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

1025
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,060
Then this guy wants to .

1026
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,660
I said, yeah, all right.

1027
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,680
You want to lay it right over there by the graveyard so you won't have too far to fall.

1028
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,460
Charles Manson is one of the greatest philosophers of our age.

1029
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,760
That you do.

1030
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,020
I trust the only person left to trust.

1031
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:31,740
Me.

1032
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,720
Get off the air!
