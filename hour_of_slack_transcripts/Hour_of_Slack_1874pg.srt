1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Ready? One, two, ready, go!

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,440
Thank you.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,080
Like to drop by the testy pad

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,980
Well, welcome to the hour of slack

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,840
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,680
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,360
Look what you get. You get the non-stick crab basket.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
You get a package of elastic chicken cakes.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,780
And one more thing, folks.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,620
Of course you're going to get pot.

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,660
Please return it to us.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,080
My house smells inside.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,480
My favorite thing is that the food comes out.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,680
My husband hates chicken.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,520
So I made the chicken the other night.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,540
And he's like, chicken, chicken.

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,640
I really appreciate the fat on the meat.

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,080
Another thing that's really nice, you can have a cocktail.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,460
My favorite thing.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,200
Is the fact that it's my family.

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,260
You salmon is too dry, a little too soggy.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,600
And the family kept saying,

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,840
The boss, the boss.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,700
I like the oven.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
I came home and made my husband chicken.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,980
Such a wonderful shock.

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,460
We just love that machine.

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,280
The machine surprised me.

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,760
In the woods, it's fabulous.

30
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,280
I love the electricity.

31
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,360
Call now and order the all-purpose chicken video

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,980
and an instructional non-stick platform.

33
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,400
Order right now.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,420

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,280
Order right now.

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,500
And you'll also get the $30 dual chicken ties

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,920
for only 400 easy payments of only $19.99 plus SNH.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,660
Or send $99.99, $99.95 plus SNH to Beverly Hills, California.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,320
Hurrah!

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,560
As soon as you're born, they make you feel small.

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,600
By giving you no time instead of it all.

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,640
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,420
A working class hero is something to be.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
A working class hero is something to be.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,720
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school.

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,920
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool.

47
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,640
Till you're so f***ing crazy you can't follow their rules.

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,660
A working class hero is something to be.

49
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,260
A working class hero is something to be.

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,320
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,180
Then they expect you to pick a career

52
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,140
When you can't really function, you're so full of fear

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,940
A working class hero is something to be

54
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,020
A working class hero is something to be

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,240
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,120
And you think you're so clever and clever

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,420
And classless and free

58
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,000
But you're still f***ing peasants as far as I can see

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,940
A working class hero is something to be

60
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,420
A working class hero is something to be

61
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,120
There's room for more than one person in the room

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,220
At the top they are telling you still

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,700
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill

64
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,420
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,100
A working class hero is something to be

66
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,560
A working class hero is something to be

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,940
A working class hero is something to be

68
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,260
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,080
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

least 20 people. We produced thousands of tons of sarin nerve gas. These actions killed

75
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,740
or injured at least 20 people. More than six people died in the attacks. And surveillance

76
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:23,520
weapons. Every chemical and biological weapon of the war in 91. And we do, despite isolation

77
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,160
from the civilized world. How she got that way will never be known. In a region where

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,700
more than 135,000 American civilians with a likely range of hundreds of miles that could

79
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,760
be used to disperse chemical or biological areas. We're targeting Saudi Arabia, Israel,

80
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:51,880
and other Turkey nations without leaving any fingerprints. And of course, all that might

81
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,180
be required are a small

82
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,640
container in the United States to deliver it. Now you're talking, talking like a man.

83
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:08,160
And that is including 12 Americans killing an American passenger. We know that Iraq and

84
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,960
the United States of America go back a decade. We know that Iraq and the United States have

85
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,160
had high level contacts. These include chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that

86
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:44,220
wars will continue on the air. That trade off and weapons andischen

87
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,220


88
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,580
private-operated military operation that may end Maar al-Babég's life to the present

89
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,140
before it's exposed to eternity.

90
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,140


91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,980
Gentlemen, as good, loyal Americans,

92
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,780
I think we should take a note that the secrets of Jed Clampett's awesome experiments

93
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,140
will never leave this room.

94
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,720
Yeah!

95
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,040
I can't look. I can't look.

96
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,460
The top of his head is shaved.

97
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,760
Let's just shut the hatch.

98
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,420
Oh, my God. Now he wants to get in.

99
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,480
He's banging on the window.

100
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,280
No, we should just shut the hatch.

101
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,040
The joke's over, you know?

102
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,820
We just need to get out of here now.

103
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,220
What's that smell?

104
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,100
What's that smell?

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,100
What's that smell?

106
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,040
I don't think we should.

107
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,460
If one of those crowd gunners get a music on,

108
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
maybe we should.

109
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,860
Stop firing on the beach now because it's quiet here,

110
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,380
and the second batch are droning over now.

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,120
I can hear them.

112
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,500
I can see them.

113
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,180
They're casting off the gliders as they circle around over the beach.

114
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:25,980
I can see them.

115
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:40,740
I can see them.

116
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,260
I can see them.

117
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,460
I can see them.

118
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,460
I can see them.

119
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,940
I can see them.

120
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:31,940
I can see them.

121
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:57,160
I can see them.

122
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,000
I can see them.

123
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:33,340
I can see them.

124
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:41,920
I can see them.

125
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,200
I can see them.

126
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,860
I can see them.

127
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,700
I can see them.

128
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,140
I can see them.

129
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,360
I can see them.

130
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,960
I can see them.

131
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,140
I can see them.

132
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,220
I can see them.

133
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,500
I can see them.

134
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,020
the Mystery Girl of the Week contest closed

135
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,000
and opened the envelope.

136
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
Mystery Girl of the Week this week

137
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
goes to North Korea

138
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,060
who dumped

139
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,020
that one. I love the way they dumped

140
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,940
the news. They were in a meeting

141
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,740
and they just sort of looked at the Americans and said,

142
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,020
Of course we have the bomb,

143
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,660
you moron!

144
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,120
I think pretty much

145
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,140
Zimbabwe's got the bomb.

146
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,760
I think

147
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,020
Upper

148
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,460
Mongolia or whatever it's called,

149
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,840
yeah, Outer Mongolia might have the bomb

150
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,960
too. I think we've reached the level

151
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,660
that they talked about. The Tagalog Islands.

152
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,860
Yes. Pongo Pongo.

153
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,600
Timor has a 200

154
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Nuki. So what

155
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,920
are you going to do about that? You're just going to go plowing

156
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,840
every place, waving the bombs and hoping

157
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,080
they don't bomb everything back?

158
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,960
It's kind of silly. Well, you've got to deliver the bomb.

159
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,800
I mean, you can't just

160
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,920
have a bomb. Right.

161
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,300
You've got to have one of those mailage postage systems.

162
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,980
You just have a bomb and you detonate it, then you blow yourself

163
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,420
up. Yeah. You have to

164
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,500
deliver it somehow. Yeah, you have to make it go

165
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,440
somewhere else to, you know, whoever, whatever

166
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,340
you don't like, and then have it blow up there.

167
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,500
And you need one of those mailing systems too, because

168
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,640
I did download a tactical

169
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,140
nuke video

170
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,740
that was amazing.

171
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,680
It was shot with like a

172
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,200
50 or 60 foot long

173
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,280
cannon. Really? Yeah.

174
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,300
Big recoil thing. One of those track

175
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,580
going back a little. Yeah, those tubes

176
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,460
they use now. And the thing shot, and then

177
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,780
about two seconds later,

178
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,360
the mountain range way off in the

179
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,680
distance just went white.

180
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,900
And then

181
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,660
worship the gods of war.

182
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,600
Stand at the

183
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,500
stone feet of the red god

184
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,440
of war. This was just punched

185
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
with a cannon into the hill, you know.

186
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,480
They call them tubes now. There's a lot

187
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,360
of baby acrimony going around in

188
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,420
the svelte world. They're probably letting

189
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,360
a lot of these type videos out

190
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,400
so that, you know.

191
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,140
I've also noticed a lot of stories

192
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,540
that kind of talk about how

193
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,340
cool it is that when

194
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,280
America goes to war, it goes to war

195
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,460
packing everything. And they started talking about

196
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,380
how weird that some of

197
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,080
the things being ordered for the war

198
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,400
and being packed was, well, a sumo

199
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
wrestler's suit was one of them.

200
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
That's not much of a suit.

201
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,240
A sumo wrestler's suit was going along with

202
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,820
the rest of the guy's gear? Yeah.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,400
Well, jeez, they're going to have some entertainment there.

204
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,440
They call it sumo wrestler

205
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,240
for the news purposes, but what they

206
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,080
really mean is the extra costume for the

207
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,160
superhero. Oh, and the

208
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,280
belt that he's wearing actually goes up his

209
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,220
crotch, actually propels him over

210
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,160
Baghdad and drops him asunder like

211
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,280
some mighty sack of... All that mutant stuff,

212
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,480
all those movies with Spider-Man,

213
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,980
all these mutant power guys

214
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,200
and so forth that are coming into vogue now.

215
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,000
Real big budget, exciting,

216
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,080
well done comic book movies.

217
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,040
It's all based on...

218
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,220
The gist of the stories are generally that

219
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,420
nobody goes to war like the U.S.

220
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,160
does. Nobody

221
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,220
takes as much stuff with it.

222
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,000
Sheesh, man.

223
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,100
It's kind of self-facing

224
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,920
not self- but, you know, too

225
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,140
overconfident. Pretty arrogant, really. Yeah, arrogant, that's

226
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,160
the word. I knew it started with an A.

227
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,800
They sort of control space.

228
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,440
Every blade of

229
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,240
grass, dang. They want to control

230
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,980
every blade of grass and every

231
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,400
molecule on the planet.

232
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:26,960
They have

233
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,600
good surveillance.

234
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,120
That was scary watching Dave do that

235
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
one. Well, because I'm not

236
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,080
going to look over there anymore. I'm not

237
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
looking over there anymore. I'm looking...

238
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,080
Stay in the wrong direction. I missed it. I'm going to go look at

239
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,720
porn on the internet or something.

240
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,040
I don't want to see that again.

241
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
I could see Donald Rumsfeld as a superhero.

242
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,160
Couldn't you? Like wearing

243
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,340
a sumo belt, bare chested,

244
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,840
bare legged, like maybe with long

245
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,800
lawyer socks on.

246
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,820
And the power belt

247
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,540
between his legs

248
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,840
propelling him through space.

249
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,080
They said he was afraid

250
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,020
of birds, but wasn't he

251
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,100
some sort of Pleistocene bird

252
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,700
himself?

253
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,800
Wasn't that beak?

254
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,980
Made for chopping land chops?

255
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,280
Isn't that nozzle made for

256
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
eating human flesh?

257
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,340
Donald Rumsfeld!

258
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,320
Don't look under your television

259
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,020
set. He's

260
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,420
back.

261
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,980
How about Dick

262
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,920
Cheney? How about

263
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,120
Dick Cheney?

264
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
The grandson of Lon Cheney.

265
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,480
He is actually...

266
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,840
A man of a thousand billion dollar

267
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,320
faces.

268
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,840
The man of a million petrodollars.

269
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,500
Tonight in your theater.

270
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,820
Don't come if you've got a heart

271
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,560
condition or wear sunglasses

272
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,760
past twelve. Don't come

273
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,620
if your knees are too...

274
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,220
Huh? Your pants.

275
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,680
Oh, I don't know what happened.

276
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,720
The Senate will come to order.

277
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,760
The chaplain will leave the Senate

278
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,440
in prayer.

279
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Gracious God, you have made grief.

280
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,080
As a Senate family, we thank you

281
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
for our dear friends' untimely deaths.

282
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,940
We are grateful for Saul and Sheila

283
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,620
Wellstone's courageous deaths

284
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,920
and his indefatigable commitment

285
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,140
to help the debt of our society.

286
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,460
We praise you for grief for all people,

287
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,200
particularly police officers and those

288
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,460
who serve to make the Senate run smoothly.

289
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,700
Dear God, you have enriched all of our lives

290
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,980
so generously through their untimely deaths.

291
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,680
Heal our grief over maintenance personnel

292
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,480
and fill us with your untimely deaths.

293
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,340
Amen.

294
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,000
.

295
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,300
.

296
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,640
.

297
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,760
I thank you.

298
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,080


299
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,280
.

300
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,400
.

301
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,400


302
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,420
.

303
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:17,440
.

304
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:17,440


305
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:17,500
.

306
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:17,520
.

307
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,540
.

308
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:17,560
.

309
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,220
.

310
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,380
.

311
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:26,400
.

312
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,400


313
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,780
telling us.

314
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,780
My pups are barking, boy.

315
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,260
My pups is dead.

316
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,680
I'm a smelly friend.

317
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,800
You know what I mean.

318
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,080
Yeah, you got to feed them.

319
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,920
You got to feed those puppies.

320
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,100
I've just been so walked and beaten down by the conspiracy,

321
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,500
I just gave up.

322
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
You know what they like, Stan?

323
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,740
They like when you trim your toenails, you grind them up,

324
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,240
you put them in a little bit of hot sauce,

325
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,700
and you drip them back on your self-same toes.

326
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,920
That's appreciation for you.

327
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,380
Recycling?

328
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Yes, it's a form of internal sacrosanctivity.

329
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,060
You know, you make yourself holier than you vow or something every day.

330
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,940
At least I do.

331
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,360
I gave up on vow, holiness, and than.

332
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,600
Well, making yourself holy.

333
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,500
I just gave up.

334
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,860
Give up!

335
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,960
I can see it.

336
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,640
Give up!

337
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Give up!

338
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,900
Holy and holy.

339
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,000
The loudspeaker spoke up and said,

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,660
Holy and holy.

341
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,240
It is holy and holy.

342
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,080
Holy and holy.

343
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,980
To think of the end.

344
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
Christianity is stupid.

345
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,180
Isn't it about the shamanism?

346
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,080
Shamanism is good.

347
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,560
Do you have a copy of that?

348
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,240
We could play it real loud.

349
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,480
Common sense is stupid.

350
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,560
Common sense is stupid.

351
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
The very idea of offing yourself

352
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,040
because of some stupid little problem like that

353
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,540
makes me think,

354
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,260
well,

355
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:51,600
well,

356
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,920
what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

357
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,460
So what I want you to do

358
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,900
is imagine that you're in the car with the windshield wipers going

359
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,880
and you're listening to this religious show on the radio.

360
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,620
Okay.

361
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,980
And you're wondering to yourself,

362
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,740
who are these guys?

363
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,560
Gotcha.

364
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay, I'm there.

365
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,920
I'm driving.

366
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,640
I'm driving.

367
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,620
I'm beginning to...

368
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,460
I'm beginning to visualize now.

369
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:25,840
Oh, well,

370
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
don't take your eyes off the road, though.

371
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,680
And now I can see it.

372
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,460
I can see it.

373
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,600
I can begin to see the beginnings of it.

374
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,360
And...

375
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,400
Tranks and tucks and sump.

376
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,540
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,

377
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,860
driving around Texas.

378
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,380
You know, Texas.

379
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,460
I understand that.

380
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,340
Texas is about the size of Iraq.

381
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:56,960
Really?

382
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,420
Yeah.

383
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,640
Is that true?

384
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,680
So when they say,

385
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,020
go ahead and see if you can find some nukes,

386
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,400
my test would be,

387
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,400
well, let's go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas somewhere and say,

388
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,440
now go see if you can find it.

389
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,840
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.

390
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,640
You know, I think that...

391
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,360
That would work.

392
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,100
You could build an invisibility chamber,

393
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,020
if you had to,

394
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,460
and put it into the...

395
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:24,640
Hide it in Texas?

396
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,340
And hide it in Texas.

397
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,540
You could put it up by Amarillo next to Cadillac Ranch,

398
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:28,800
and then...

399
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
I'd take it out to the...

400
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,860
They just wouldn't see it.

401
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,520
To the Texas Triangle,

402
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,120
which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda Triangle,

403
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,460
but on land in Texas,

404
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,840
and I would just put it out in the middle,

405
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,460
and it would disappear.

406
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,440
Wow.

407
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,160
Until I needed to find it.

408
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,260
That was, dear friends, puzzling evidence.

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,780
Dr. Philodrum and Dr. How...

410
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,080
How...

411
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,240
A funny Dr. Howell on KPFA in Berkeley.

412
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,260
This genius more-than-an-hour, less-than-a-show type show.

413
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,680
The show that dare not speak its name.

414
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,080
And now...

415
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,880
The past year resembles nothing so much as

416
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,400
the bad alternate timeline

417
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,320
that the hero of a cheap science fiction book

418
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,160
has to go back and fix.

419
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,000
It certainly resembles that to me.

420
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,760
The listener are that time traveler.

421
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,280
Yes, you, humble listener.

422
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,520
Only your memory can be restored to you.

423
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,800
You are the humble time traveler.

424
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,340
I know what you mean, though.

425
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,980
It does...

426
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,220
Yeah, that would explain a lot.

427
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,580
It would explain the wooden-headed people

428
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,520
coming up to us while we're taking our sulfur baths.

429
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
It would certainly explain all the money

430
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,300
that's now going to be flowing into arms.

431
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,640
And legs.

432
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,360
And think of how fully well laundered that money is.

433
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,300
It must be very squeaky clean by now.

434
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,420
Mm-hmm.

435
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,980
Just think about George the Bushy,

436
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,860
the be-haired one himself,

437
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,100
and counting that money back in some room.

438
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,120
He's got to replace those cruise missiles.

439
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,340
Behind the oval orifice.

440
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,380
That's not what this is all about.

441
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,640
No.

442
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
It's all about revenge.

443
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,540
That's it.

444
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,580
Taking over Mars.

445
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,800
And to, yes, eventually to take over,

446
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,660
to take back Mars.

447
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,120
Yeah.

448
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,940
Take over Mars.

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,900
To take Mars back.

450
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,240
Our rightful home.

451
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,440
That we, the true Martians,

452
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,180
were expelled from

453
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,900
so that they, the oil sheiks,

454
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,400
and the oil billionaires,

455
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,360
and all the oily characters would have some...

456
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,240
So we're living in the Martian time slip?

457
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,560
Oh, I can grok to that.

458
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,720
In this time continuum.

459
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,860
I can grok to that, my water brother,

460
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,460
but by the same token, when do we...

461
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:34,880
We were enslaved.

462
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,120
We've got to go back in time and kill Bob's mom.

463
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,200
The psychic shackles us to a soft fire.

464
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,400
After Bob was born.

465
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,500
Enslaved.

466
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,820
For Martians.

467
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,020
Thousands and millions and bazillions of years ago.

468
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,400
Does this mean that there's a big bin

469
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,740
with all the money we want

470
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,920
here in front of our house

471
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,760
and we can pick it up and just...

472
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,340
It doesn't mean anything like that.

473
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:53,560
No, man.

474
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,740
It just means that we were kidnapped

475
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,880
from our home world

476
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,900
and we're stuck here

477
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,000
with you twerps.

478
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,380
Yeah, you guys.

479
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:00,800
You guys.

480
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,800
You guys.

481
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:01,900
Yeah.

482
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,260
Yeah.

483
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,220
Yeah.

484
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:04,620


485
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:04,920
Yeah.

486
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,580
Yeah.

487
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:06,580


488
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:06,580


489
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,460
Yeah.

490
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,060
Yeah.

491
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,060


492
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah.

493
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:18,700
Yeah.

494
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,420
The Cubans and the Mafia said, man, he'll be okay

495
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,940
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

496
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,520
Defeat the force of evil with his whistling

497

Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be denied

There's pot roasts on the table, medieval villains to roast outside

500
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,260
He's fighting all the criminals who stopped on single

501
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,240
The whiteys came from Europe to kill, you know they wouldn't

502
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,440
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

503
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
Defeat the force of evil with his whistling

His mama says, come on in, boys, his mama's got a plan

507
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm gonna fight the men in white sheets who come from the Klu Klux Klan

508
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,800
They're fixin' to kill a black man who grows by the name of Sam

509
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,400
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

510
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,740
Defeat the force of evil with his

Well, the space junkie cowboy, he will not be coerced

514

His mama says, come on in, sir, his mama has been cursed

515
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm set to fight a bad man who's killing all the men in white sheets

516
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,440
All the Jews, making mincemeat of his continent

517
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,060
Gotta stop him before he's through

518
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,500
But the cowboy and his space gun have got to save the day

By Drexel

530
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,920
Yes, that's a D-R-E-X-E-L

531
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,760
Drexel from Drexel, Ohio

532
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,540
That's the album name

533
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,740
And they are at this website

534
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,180

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760


537
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,160
That's D-R-E-X-E-L-L-E-N-T

538
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,680
And now back to, um, well, some Lemur-ish cut-up collages

539
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,860
Hustling evidences, howling over men

540
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,220
Lonesome cowboys and Chaz right here

541
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,980
Well, we were through the looking glass with David Ferry and Nico

542
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,040
One, two, three, four

543
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,400
That's good, there we go, George

544
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,920
You're looking good on camera

545
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,920
Yeah, don't worry about it

546
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,280
Your hair looks fine

547
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,340
Uh, boss, we want to make sure his hand stays up in the wave gesture for a long time

548
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
We got a little off over here

549
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,260
Looks like there's about 45 of them ready to go

550
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,820
Mr. President, 30 seconds

551
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,600
Do you want to take some of the shine off the big guy's nose?

552
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,760
I can't get back in there again, it smells like

553
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,320
BEEP

554
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,340
BEEP

555
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:42,620
BEEP

556
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,640
You commies keep talking like that

557
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,540
I'll be throwing some food over the concentration camp fence to you

558
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,020
How's that?

559
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,080
Right after the baths, eh, Stank?

560
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,680
Come on in and take a bath

561
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,980
Hey, look at this special emollient they put in the bath water

562
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,800
It makes you feel so good, you don't want to think about things

563
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,580
Yep, yep, yep, yep

564
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,920
Knee pads truly make a world of difference

565
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,340
Yep, yep, more proof that makes knee pads possible

566
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,680
Yep, yep, yep, yep

567
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,500
Call now to order the two-piece ratchet knee pads or clamp set

568
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,080
737-338-1300

569
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah

570
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,300
Then of course there was the time when the old woman came out of the house

571
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,140
And tried to fit the baseball bat in my corner

572
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,540
I think you can't use that either, man

573
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,460
And then there was

574
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,900
MK Ultra

575
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,380
MK Ultra?

576
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,600
Hey, he knows about the mind control experiments

577
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,220
Wow

578
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,960
What, did they, did they, you?

579
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,600
Hey, you know what, they, they

580
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,480
Oh, he signed off because he's scared

581
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,340
He was silent

582
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,900
He was scared

583
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,960
They stopped him

584
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,460
Well, they stopped him mentally a long time ago, in the past

585
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,520
See, that's what he doesn't understand, it was also a time control experiment, much like the Turing experiment

586
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:48,780
Interesting

587
00:30:49,520 --> 00:31:02,220
But it also started

588
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,460
And he began escaping

589
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:10,200
See the answer

590
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,200


591
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,200


592
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,580
Learning

593
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:10,620
A Across

594
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,120

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
Re sang

596
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:14,900
The

597
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:14,900


598
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,460
No, sure

599
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,480
Sure

600
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,480


601
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,480


602
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,500
There I go

603
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,100
Oh, not, but no, no, because he's not revealing great conspiracies.

604
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,360
I'm talking about the really great conspiracy.

605
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,380
Well, maybe they've lost their twang or their old epizoodle.

606
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,220
Why haven't the conspiracies silenced them?

607
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,220
Well, the silence is probably something arranged by the conspiracy.

608
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,780
No.

609
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,840
Beforehand, it's like the time control experiments.

610
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,220
Think of it that way, if you can.

611
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,860
Huh?

612
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,700
For example, you know, people look at an elephant and it just looks so enormous,

613
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,100
but, or someone told me earlier, you know, you eat a,

614
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,940
or given enough time they can, can an ant eat an elephant?

615
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,200
Precisely.

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,920
By eight properties, I don't think you could.

617
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,720
It'd be impossible.

618
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:08,120
For example, you folks all are now unsophisticated barbarians.

619
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,680
And breaking news out of Bethlehem right now,

620
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,940
Israeli forces leaving a trail of sludge to prevent gunmen from seeking refuge

621
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,180
in the explosive device.

622
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,720
A checkpoint lay this afternoon.

623
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,020
This in retaliation for a Palestinian church in Jerusalem.

624
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,680
The passenger apparently grabbed the sludge, killing 11 people.

625
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,840
Cleanup boats menace the coastline, causing an environmental hazard.

626
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,140
Tom Daschle and other wannabes are creating security threats to his family.

627
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,540
Hard Car correspondent David Schuster has the story.

628
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,640
The question is, has Tom Daschle gone too far, or is Tom Daschle a sore loser?

629
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,160
This program is known for asking you to call him.

630
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,160
With his majority.

631
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,220
With his majority gone and his party floundering, Tom Daschle handling defeat poorly.

632
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,920
But Democrats routinely unpatriotic and un-American.

633
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,300
Tom Daschle shrill, nasty, and dangerous.

634
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,160
In Washington.

635
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,620
Foment hatred, the very essence of anger that we love.

636
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,460
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende, Lee Moore.

637
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,560
I often want to say to a couple,

638
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,180
I put him down for my pizzeria.

639
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,560
And then she shrieked.

640
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,440
We're hungry for you.

641
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,860
Guy back off.

642
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,760
Guy back off.

643
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,660
Guy back off.

644
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,660
Guy blown away.

645
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,940
And they buried the dog in the cracks with mouths full of my cheese.

646
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,340
Ah, my cheese.

647
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,680
Ah, my cheese.

648
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,040
Ah, my cheese.

649
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,160
Ah, blown away.

650
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,760
As husbands and wives come together,

651
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,220
Ah, creates a glow within you.

652
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,140
We really lost our minds and I needed to do something else.

653
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,780
I was struck recently by a hole.

654
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,400
And they're seeking cheese.

655
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,960
And they don't get it.

656
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,080
Oh, you mean that kind of bone crushing time.

657
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,060
That kind of bone crushing.

658
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,420
God died unexpectedly in an automobile accident this weekend.

659
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,940
And they don't get it.

660
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,060
They are normal.

661
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,900
Bob threatened to be ripped asunder by God.

662
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,260
And Jesus has been in a series of unsatisfying relationships with men.

663
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,340
Invites him into a relationship with Bob.

664
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,980
And they buried the dog in the food.

665
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,320
But I can't say that.

666
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,760
And they don't get it.

667
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,500
Like wouldn't it sound like a 2011 movie?

668
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,360
Isn't thatальномy broadcasting that?

669
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,980
It seems very recording-inexpensive.

670
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:39,980


671
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:39,980


672
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:39,980


673
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,000
I've had myaros shows lately...

674
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000


675
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000


676
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000


677
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,000

680
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,600
Welcome to hell.

681
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,820
I am Satan.

682
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,000
I'll be your hostess for eternity.

683
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,920
Gotta be f***ing kidding me.

684
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,180
Slacker.

685
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,520
Heart ignition.

686
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,520
And now, Lemur.

687
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:53,160
We believe in any inflationary set of pressures that might emerge and any negative effects that we put in place.

688
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:03,640
Similarly, the reason for this chronic and growing gross P in the United States continuously rising or rising as much.

689
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,980
That means that our short P induces P in the United States.

690
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,800
And that's been going on to prevent this from continuing.

691
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:20,240
Well, I have argued the best we can judge for decades either way.

692
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,180
I'm having a heart attack.

693
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,780
Can't be the same till I get my baby back.

694
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,260
She's gone and left me broken hearted.

695
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,260
Came to stay but now we've parted.

696
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,700
Like a transcontinental island burning and floating across the seven seas.

697
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,500
Causing the cost of formation of delicate bacteria.

698
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,560
Cuted in a mustard keg.

699
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,060
Her love had made a beautiful sunset.

700
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,080
She's gone and left me.

701
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,280
What shall I do?

702
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,000
She got back to her residence on Trunkstown Boulevard.

703
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,640
Where the residue of her love had shined through.

704
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,640
I got bit and stroden by a Ned fly.

705
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,580
Was swelled up into a baby.

706
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,520
And floated away up into outer space.

707
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,900
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon.

708
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,800
Jacob Barley took a dullaxe.

709
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,780
And bled his tiny Kim and all his little friends.

710
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,620
Visiting from Scarsdale.

711
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,240
And now, Lemur.

712
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,500
We believe in any inflationary set of pressures that might arise.

713
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,500


714
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,500


715
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:13,500


716
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,220
And I'm going to steal those

717
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,220


718
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,280
Don't forget my name with everything you know.

719
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:41,080
Just let me know, and I'll put these Huks right down in the corner.

720
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,360
And I'll give you the whole description at the end.

721
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,600
Thank you all for watching.

722
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,400
See you next time.

723
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,280
See you tomorrow.

724
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,280


725
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,320
Back where residues are such that full of ard

726
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,860
Where the residue of our love is shined through

727
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,580
I got bitten and strode up by a midfly

728
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,840
And spun up into a baby and swallowed away up in outer space

729
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,660
I got Jules Verne hot air blown

730
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,260
Jacob Worley took a doax

731
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,660
And bloodied Tiny Tim

732
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,920
And all his little friends

733
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,220
Visiting from Skyfield

734
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
That's why I'm having a heart attack!

735
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,540
Can't be the same till I get my baby back!

736
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,420
She's not a lefty broken hearted!

737
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Can't be the same but now we've parted!

738
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,180
I'm having a heart attack!

739
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,660
Zoot's Rift, dear friends.

740
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,320
This is coming off of a 30th anniversary

741
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,060
Tuesday.

742
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,420
CD-R set that has 175

743
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,100
Zoot's Rift songs from 1971 to 2001.

744
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,220
The great, great Zoot's Rift

745
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,280
can be reached by you

746
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,820
if you have a pencil ready.

747
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,200
Um, at, got that pencil ready?

748
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,820
Now?

749
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,160
Zoot's Rift at,

750
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,780
thank you Flying Lion Brothers,

751
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,820
at, at, subgenius heaven.

752
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,940
He boarded the saucers prematurely, friends,

753
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,620
long ago.

754
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,240
But long after this show was assembled in 2002.

755
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,800
For this is a rerun of number 868.

756
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,740
A war show.

757
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,960
It was a different war, but hey, many things never change.

758
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:28,080
I had to resort to a rerun because I had to nurse my injured dog buddy who was in a war

759
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,760
with other dogs.

760
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,200
A civil war.

761
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
And now this.

762
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,340
, this is the voice of London.

763
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,300
Yes, my young.

764
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,160
This is the voice of the BBC.

765
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
Somebody's parked a bus in my butt.

766
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,400
Well, there's an explosive device in there.

767
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,520
We're talking about a code yellow.

768
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,820
You are not using the force.

769
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,760
We are.

770
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,460
We are a code yellow right now, you guys.

771
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,740
I'll have you know that.

772
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,960
Code yellow in what?

773
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,440
In, uh, in Portuguese, which is

774
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,820
Gauta Jaureda.

775
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,200
Yeah.

776
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,200


777
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,200


778
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,560
These are not the drugs you're looking for.

779
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,060
Amarillo.

780
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,180
No, we're, we are at code yellow right now.

781
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,000
The force is not with us.

782
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,820
You silly arses.

783
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,820
Come on, man.

784
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,300
First place cops looked was at, at.

785
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,320
I've fallen and I can't get up.

786
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,360
Just lays there.

787
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,640
She's lying.

788
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,800
You're going to say pack the car near Havignyad or something.

789
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,780
I mean, come on boys.

790
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,180
Let's stop this inane game here.

791
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,000
Let's nail the hammer on the head.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
The president.

793
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,860
Oh yeah.

794
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,000
Right.

795
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,280
Okay.

796
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
Trying to attack Canada.

797
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,460
I can do the president, the prime minister of Canada.

798
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,860
I can do a Sean.

799
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,920
I can do his voice and we are tired of what they're saying.

800
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,240
South of the border.

801
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,940
We have the right.

802
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,300
So how many people showed up on the mall in DC to protest the war that you didn't hear

803
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,020
about in the news?

804
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,800
Bob was there.

805
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:05,980
Somebody sent me a picture of Bob at the, uh, standing there with a couple of, of kids.

806
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,440
With their faces fuzzed out in the photograph because the kids didn't want to get caught.

807
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,620
But there was Bob often shows up at protests.

808
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,860
Um, and in fact has even been filmed by CNN and the like, but in this case, some friend

809
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:29,320
of one of the kids saw Bob photographed and sent it in, got a rim job.

810
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,960
And that was the totality of Bob's involvement in the, uh, protest.

811
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,800
Is this part of the success seminar thing that he's doing down there now?

812
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,080
Or no, he works for the CIA sometimes.

813
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,880
He was just taking the success seminars, just like a pizza front for the, for black ops

814
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,420
for the CIA.

815
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,820
No, that's church of the sub geniuses.

816
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,460
Is the pizza front for now?

817
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,080
Which is more or less.

818
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,400
Yeah.

819
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,820
Okay.

820
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,240
But okay.

821
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,240
Which is the core of the black ops?

822
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,260
Is it the CIA or the church?

823
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,500
The Austin office.

824
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,220
That's the church.

825
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,760
The Austin office or the church.

826
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,860
Are those guys are naked.

827
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:05,940
They're naked.

828
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,260
They are crazy.

829
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,140
They get 10 bucks for every, uh, address.

830
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,520
For every address.

831
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
So they can actually come around and say, we know where you live, right?

832
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,580
Well, see, the thing is now because of the new law, they can just get it off the internet

833
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,760
for free.

834
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,700
Your computer is part of the internet.

835
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,780
My computer is.

836
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,820
And if you touch your computer, your brain is part of the internet.

837
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,700
So, and they, and it's all recorded.

838
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:35,720
Every bit of it is on google.com, which will soon to be called a big brother.com.

839
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:35,880
Yeah.

840
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,220
I don't know if it's something like that, but it's, it's all going to be one, one thing.

841
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,320
I'll be able to look up your thoughts.

842
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
You'll be able to look up my thoughts.

843
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,300
It's a beautiful thing.

844
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,660
It's a, well, that cough's going to get worse.

845
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:55,620
In some ways, the evil doers can no longer hide their evil, but by the same token, uh,

846
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,440
you know, every, it all just evens out.

847
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:05,820
There's just such a flood of endless information about everybody's inner thoughts that, for

848
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:05,920
the most part, it's just a flood of endless information.

849
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,100
And finally it just becomes a sort of a slurry, a blank mush because it's just overload.

850
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,020
It's just a blight static.

851
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:17,840
And when you see the sign that says our beak, our back, maxed free, you'll know that you're

852
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,860
going to finally get some work done around here.

853
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,300
Right.

854
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,000
Look at those smoke stacks crackling.

855
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,880
Everybody gets to toggle in, man.

856
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,180
Yeah.

857
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,660
When it started going, going down this week, I started, uh, sweeping up my leaves in the,

858
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,360
in the yard.

859
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,120
Did you?

860
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,040
That's all that's left to do.

861
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,300
That's all you can really do.

862
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:53,560
What's left to do is flee.

863
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,660
You get set up outside in

864
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:58,660


865
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:01,520
That's it.

866
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,840
It's always a più need to me all you need in the day of a

867
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:04,860
possible worker.

868
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,280
Little retracement that you would need is a little more knowledge, as we spend the

869
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,280


870
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,640
They love shoes and pajamas.

871
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
God has gone before to...

872
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm persuaded.

873
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,520
God, hallelujah.

874
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:23,740
What we are engaged in is essentially a struggle for communication.

875
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,740
The corporate industrial complex is a heavily armed fortress

876
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:35,800
dictating the baloney propaganda we are fed daily via multimedia channels.

877
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,540
We hear only what they want us to hear.

878
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,800
So long as the man prevents the message from reaching the masses,

879
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,660
justice is impeded.

880
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:54,160
The Unabomber used terrorism to gain publicity as an end in itself.

881
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,700
Notice how the press seeks to channel the public's interpretation of the Unabomber

882
00:44:59,700 --> 00:44:59,720
into a more public opinion.

883
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,540
They are covering it as a serial killer story of crime and insanity

884
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:09,020
while deliberately excluding consideration of the ideas themselves.

885
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,380
Imagine, if you will, mass communications not subject to corporate control.

886
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,580
Why, people might say anything, even things not fit to print.

887
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,960
Exactly.

888
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,920
When the ABC nightly news gets renamed Disney World,

889
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,240
you'll cherish the memory of your Unabomber vote.

890
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,460
Don't waste your vote, friends.

891
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,060
Unabomber in 1996.

892
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:42,640
Whoa!

893
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,000
And, uh...

894
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,960
Yes, that was from www.paranoia.com,

895
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,660
which is a fun little website.

896
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,460
Oh, what the hell?

897
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,160
According to my records, I've sent you 33 pages of information,

898
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,040
plus a postcard.

899
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,620
Most of what I sent you proves beyond a shadow of a doubt

900
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,460
that much of what you've sent me is crap.

901
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,140
Only a person like you, with your almost total lack of...

902
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,120
...

903
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,500
...

904
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
...

905
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,260
...

906
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,440
...

907
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:21,520
...

908
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:21,640
...

909
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:21,660
...

910
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:21,980
...

911
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:21,980


912
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:21,980


913
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,080
...

914
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,080


915
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,080


916
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,120
...

917
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,660
...

918
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:38,800
...

919
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:38,800


920
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:38,800


921
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:38,800


922
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,800
...

923
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


924
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


925
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


926
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


927
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


928
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


929
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


930
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:40,800


931
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,320
Hey, everybody thinks it's not the same

932
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,120
We can put up with the things that we so like

933
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,740
Got to turn around and turn it inside and out

934
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,540
Because the final answer now that you're hanging down

935
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:51,860
...

936
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,660
Watch as we colossal the people that you trust in the famous father, peace as even light.

937
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,340
Let everybody sing.

938
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:01,660
It's an urgency.

939
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,840
Let everybody sing.

940
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,140
It's an urgency.

941
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,040
Like the things that they've got in vain, it's only good until the last card is played.

942
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,480
Six over and half a dozen of the other is lots of bitch.

943
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,800
The bitch is a mother.

944
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,800
A monster moving forward, he wants to crack a heart.

945
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,620
A monster take over the world, monster heart.

946
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,540
Let everybody sing.

947
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,840
It's an urgency.

948
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,980
Let everybody sing.

949
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,160
It's an urgency.

950
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,120
It's an urgency.

951
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,500
It's an urgency.

952
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,700
Let everybody sing.

953
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,240
Take cover, the team.

954
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,060
Oh, my God.

955
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,180
Oh, my God.

956
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,180
Oh, my God.

957
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:50,940
Oh, my God.

958
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,620
Oh, my God.

959
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,240
Oh, my God.

960
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:20,560
Oh, my God.

961
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:50,920
Oh, my God.

962
00:51:51,040 --> 00:52:18,480
Oh, my God.

963
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
Oh, my God.

964
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:51,820
Oh, my God.

965
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:54,160
Oh, my God.

966
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:54,480
Oh, my God.

967
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:10,420
Oh, my God.

968
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:35,160
Oh, my God.

969
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,300
Oh, my God.

970
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,460
Welp.

971
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,600
Bye-bye.

972
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,020
Bye-bye.

973
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,260
I did read a story that there are drone planes already flying the southern parts of Iraq, destroying anything they see.

974
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,340
That's what they're selling.

975
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,560
They've already started that.

976
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,400
They've been doing that for ten years, haven't they?

977
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,880
Have you seen the army commercials?

978
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,860
Well, they unleashed like a fresh batch of them, like just go terrorize everything.

979
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,420
Have you seen the new Air Force commercial where the kid is out with his little plane?

980
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,780
Hey, what is drone a euphemism for?

981
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,780
What?

982
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,900
Are they really sending out little drone robots?

983
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,060
Or are they dressing up little drone men as drone robots?

984
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:28,940
It's the chimpanzee clone syndrome and those crazy right-wing evangelicals behind it.

985
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,100
They're unmanned planes that just fly around looking for targets.

986
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,820
But have you guys seriously seen those spots, those Air Force commercials that show the kid flying his little robot plane?

987
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,100
And then in the last scene, he's like moving one of those joysticks and you see one of those random shots over Iraq.

988
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:45,960
Really?

989
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,520
Oh, yeah.

990
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,220
This is for real.

991
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh.

992
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,940
Yep.

993
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:49,360
Wow.

994
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,880
They're silly.

995
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,900
They're selling the remote robot clone planes pretty good nowadays.

996
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,380
Gosh, with the sun setting on our show soon.

997
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,860
And the sun setting on the American Empire.

998
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:58,320
Of course.

999
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,300
Yeah, yeah.

1000
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,500
I know.

1001
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,720
With Anna Nicole's new show, I think we have a chance.

1002
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,200
Well, and now that rim jobs have come back into popularity.

1003
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:12,960
Really?

1004
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,700
With Anna Nicole.

1005
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,500
Although I, frankly, to me, I think that that's just really weird.

1006
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,980
Specific rim jobs?

1007
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,100
Yep.

1008
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,780
Well, there's a big, there's a...

1009
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,660
Man, that's pretty wild.

1010
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,460
Specific rim jobs.

1011
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,680
Let me put it this way.

1012
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,640
That's pretty twisted.

1013
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,980
You can use your butt.

1014
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,520
You can use your butt for sitting or you can use it for...

1015
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,060
And I say there is one H of a difference between sitting and...

1016
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,600
Till next week.

1017
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,940
Till next week.

1018
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,320
Keep your head on tight.

1019
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,480
That wins.

1020
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,960
Now keep your eyes...

1021
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,500
This is Anthony Sass.

1022
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,560
Focused upon your solar plexus.

1023
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,040
As the electromagnetic waves go by.

1024
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:09,080
You are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

Praise the Lord.

1029
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:37,580
Praise the Lord.

1030
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,500
Praise the Lord.

1031
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,400
There is a place called Amsterdam.

1032
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,400
There is a place called Amsterdam.

1033
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,680
Where tea and coffee is hard to spin.

1034
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,620
Where it's bad, my thoughts are where my prayers become.

1035
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,180
Where it's bad, my thoughts are where my prayers become.

1036
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:18,960
Randy, you all are doing the right job.

1037
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:18,960


1038
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:18,960


1039
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,240
My heart died to turn it

1040
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:30,840
I leave my bed and I'm alone

1041
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:37,780
The old moon will come back

1042
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,220
Moonlight is shining across the sky

1043
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,600
The morning feast is in our eyes

1044
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,860
We both sing slap a slap a slap a

1045
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:09,560
The water can't get me down

1046
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:17,320
The important part of my head

1047
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,480
Is you and me

1048
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,460
The most beautiful reason

1049
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,080
I try the most

1050
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,780
We're all in love

1051
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:28,160
And find each other

1052
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:43,000
Quite often

1053
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:54,820
Yellow fur in the eyes

1054
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:03,280
We may find across the sky

1055
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,780
Flowing faces in our eyes

1056
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:17,860
Leave us slackers, slackers, slackers

1057
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,680
We may find across the sky
