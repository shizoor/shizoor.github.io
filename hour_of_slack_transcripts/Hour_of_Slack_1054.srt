1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm filing false statements.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,140
President Bush is hungry.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,500
Americans understand that you should live in poverty.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,120
In stocks 494141, this is PR News.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,180
PR News.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:16,740
PR's bad.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,380
Iraqi justice officials say state troopers have the power to arrest PR News in Washington.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,120
Car.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,580
Is it them?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,380
I think so.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,900
It's the self-genius.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,360
Power of the self.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,080
Stop.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,480
God.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,700
Bob.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,040
Bob.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,080
Bob.

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:57,700
Bob.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,880
Bob.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:01,880


22
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,420
Bob.

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,020
Bob.

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,620
Bob.

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
Bob.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,680
Bob.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,080
Bob.

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,120
Bob.

29
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


30
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


31
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


33
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


35
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


36
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,120


37
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,140
Bob.

38
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,140


39
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,140


40
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,140


41
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,140


42
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,240
ABBA.

43
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,080
ABBA.

44
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:11,500
ABBA.

45
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:11,540
ABBA.

46
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,300
ABBA.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:53,500
This is the hour of Computer Science Senseiwhat-is-it nel

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,260
Thank you.

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,500
Thank you.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,120
Thank you.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Dave's are here in the studio.

52
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,880
Just covered with snot and sputum and all sorts of other weird membrane erections and heads.

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,320
Yeah, we just got back from 9X Day.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,640
And, oh, and this is in the background.

55
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,460
You can hear the Billy Nair show.

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,220
We got some good recordings of them.

57
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,080
But only nine people showed up and all of them were holograms.

58
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,460
Well, no, that's not true.

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,040
What about those?

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Could you believe what those women were doing?

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,540
I couldn't believe anything I saw there.

62
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,820
I'm still in a state of total disbelief.

63
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,540
I've got your mic turned up as far as it'll go and mine turned down to balance us.

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,540
I'll try this one.

65
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,720
Does this one work better?

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,780
I can't tell any difference.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,540
There's no difference.

68
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,740
See, we're friends.

69
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,660
The world didn't end.

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,440
There's no difference.

71
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,960
But it almost did.

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,100
I'm certain that it almost did.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,980
Oh, wait.

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,960
Maybe I have the wrong.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,840
Here we go.

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,800
I had the wrong mics.

77
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,460
Now you can.

78
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,300
Now you're louder.

79
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,200
Now I'm louder.

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,620
Yeah.

81
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,620
I'm not loud.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,080
There we go.

83
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,340
There we go.

84
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,480
Friends.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,700
Friends.

86
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:36,300
Like I said, the world didn't end and we're exhausted after this incredible two-week X-Day.

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,120
It's only supposed to last a week.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,720
Yeah.

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,720
And you're not supposed to have like a protracted period after it with all these invasive procedures

90
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,020
to make sure this implant is going to work and that implant is going to work.

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,160
And, you know, they had us ready to go, but nothing happened.

92
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,500
Or was it something?

93
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,120
Well, that's again.

94
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,380
Again, it's like every X-Day, something happens at 7 a.m.

95
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,000
And, well, as here.

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,100
Look, here's one.

97
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,720
Here's one.

98
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,940
There's a crack in the horizon.

99
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,000
There's a diminution in the dimensional shift, they say.

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,480
That's what they, you know, that's this fake sign, the pseudoscience reason they give for

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,840
why something does happen every X-Day.

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
But the X's don't.

103
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,300
Well, we don't know.

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,260
Maybe they did come.

105
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,100
Well, as far as.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,040
As far as a lot of.

107
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,640
I don't know about them.

108
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:29,940
They came, all right.

109
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah.

110
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,380
But it was obvious that a lot of the subgeniuses were all over, especially after.

111
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,340
Right in the middle of the robot pajama ball.

112
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,800
That was disgusting to me.

113
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm not sure you're.

115
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,840
Well, I have.

116
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,380
You notice I had to stand up there and announce that I had never seen anything like this at

117
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,180
an X-Day before.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,360
And it was not planned by.

119
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,860
Oh, here's the recording of your band on Friday night.

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,380
I think.

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,160
Oh, this was.

122
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,260
Yeah.

123
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,740
Let's see if Princess.

124
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,460
She was here.

125
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,660
She can sing.

126
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,380
You can sing.

127
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,140
I probably should.

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,340
Does it sound pretty bad?

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,020
This is a bad.

130
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,400
When they blow the world away.

131
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,360
We shall have paradise.

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,020
Subgenie of the world unite.

133
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,160
Alien sex every night.

134
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,160
Subgenie of the world.

135
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,800
Subgenie of the world.

136
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,980
Subgenie of the world unite.

137
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,020
We shall have paradise.

138
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,900
Alien sex every night.

139
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,940
Alien sex every night.

140
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,700
Subgenie of the world.

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,220
Subgenie of the world.

142
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,960
Subgenie of the world unite.

143
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,580
Oh, and this is back to Billy Nayer show.

144
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,220
There you go.

145
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,180
It was not a naysayer show.

146
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,920
That's for sure.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,580
Everybody was full go.

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,120
But things still didn't go exactly the way they had that gravity machine where the guy

149
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,180
could skip along back and forth in front of the stage and he kind of float.

150
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,620
Yeah, it's like he was.

151
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,900
He his gravity was set to about.

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,540
What?

153
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,860
Maybe two thirds of what the rest of us.

154
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,820
I thought you said three fifths before, but whatever.

155
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,180
It's still.

156
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,820
I tried to get on the on the thing and do it and it tickled so bad I couldn't stand it.

157
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,480
He must practice on it.

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:53,780
Well, the part that kind of freaked me out was that I think you always have to have on hand at least two or three paramedics, not just the ability of a paramedic or two somewhere there.

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,620
You know, there were three emergency room surgeons.

160
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,840
Yeah.

161
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:08,460
You know, I mean, I've never had a surgeon subgenius as at my next day, but they shared each other's medicines and they were all completely passed out when a little problem happened.

162
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:16,180
And I can't believe that Nikki Death Chick was able to sew that hole up in that guy.

163
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
He was just using a girl.

164
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:18,680
Right.

165
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,980
And I'm trying.

166
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,040
Yeah.

167
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,860
Oh, twine.

168
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,540
It was twine.

169
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,080
Friends.

170
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,600
Yeah.

171
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,740
When subgenius is camp out.

172
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,340
Yeah.

173
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,740
There should be doctors around and there should be doctors conscious.

174
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,640
There should probably be the National Guard circling the perimeter with bayonets affixed to.

175
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,580
Don't you think?

176
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,200
Well, I certainly do.

177
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,920
Actually, there's after getting shot in the eye with a toothbrush for crying out loud, man.

178
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
It was a strange X day.

179
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,980
And a lot of people I'd never, ever seen before.

180
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,100
And I don't think anybody had ever seen before.

181
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,840
You know what I mean?

182
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,440
Were they really?

183
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:56,820
People.

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
Well, you know, we had that warning about that U.S.

185
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Any employees of the U.S.

186
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
Government had to present identification and present their weapons and stuff.

187
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,120
And there were three of them that did.

188
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,780
But then there was that other guy.

189
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,320
Yeah.

190
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,120
The 10 percent.

191
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:14,620
Yeah.

192
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,860
Friends.

193
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,620
Oh, here's a good.

194
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,180
This is a song by a Cleveland band, which we should shut up for.

195
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,380
This is a really good song.

196
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,420
The Kirkendall Boys.

197
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,980
This is a good song.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,600
This is a good song.

199
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


201
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


204
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,600


205
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,260
When we were out on that Saturday night.

206
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,740
Oh.

207
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,900
Oh oh.

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,620
When I saw Sunanda there?

209
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,000
It was lonely right?

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
I went into a ship with a little green man.

211
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:41,660
Oh.

212
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
nasty Kosci.

213
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,780
He was singing this song.

214
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,920
Stern.

215
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,600
Cathy.

216
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:55,840
acy.

217
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,280
members of the human race

218
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,500
It's time for

219
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,060
Playing 69 from Outer Space

220
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,600
Calling all the members

221
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
of the human race

222
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,280
It's time for

223
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Playing 69 from Outer Space

224
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,520
Playing 69

225
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,400
from Outer Space

226
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,060
Playing 69

227
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,860
from Outer Space

228
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,780
Playing 69

229
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,500
from Outer Space

230
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,240
Playing 69

231
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
from Outer Space

232
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,940
Bandit because

233
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,760
they are the stories

234
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,380
Bandit because

235
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,060
they are the stories

236
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,820
Playing 69

237
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,460
from Outer Space

238
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,240
Playing 69

239
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,980
from Outer Space

240
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,660
Playing 69

241
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,440
from Outer Space

242
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,060
Playing 69

243
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,780
from Outer Space

244
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,160
Calling all the

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,840
boys and girls

246
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,420
Girls in the U.S. of A.

247
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,740
It's your full plan 69 from outer space.

248
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,360
Doesn't really matter if you're black or white.

249
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,840
Anything is fine if it feels all right.

250
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Calling all the boys all over the world.

251
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,700
Grab yourself a girl and give it a whirl.

252
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,180
Calling all the girls all over the land.

253
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,520
Grab yourself a man and a wingman fan.

254
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,500
Life in a spaceship.

255
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,020
It's out of this world.

256
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,020
Love in a spaceship.

257
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,460
Love in a spaceship.

258
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,880
It's out of this world.

259
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,960
Love in a spaceship.

260
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,760
Playing 69 from outer space.

261
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Playing 69 from outer space.

262
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,960
Playing 69 from outer space.

263
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,340
Playing 69 from outer space.

264
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Come on, little girl.

265
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,540
I don't pop a word on the phone.

266
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,940
Can one of you play this song?

267
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:03,940


268
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,580
That 50% is the thing I skiing from girl!

269
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,860
The guy I've been bangin' all day.

270
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,780
If you meet your girl and you do a hundred percent 1.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,300
Into her head I'm a-"Lambretta."

272
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,420
No, she thinks you're the fucking king of her song.

273
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,740
That's all the world out there.

274
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,180
The wide range of their Hitler dressed withancials.

275
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,340
wrath and all that they desire.

276
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,540
Get together.

277
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:25,620
Hell yeah.

278
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,740
69 from outer space.

279
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,140
69 from outer space.

280
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,220
Plan 69 from outer space.

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,840
Outer space.

282
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,000
That's a Cleveland band or somewhere around here called the Kirkendall Void.

283
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Yes, and they have an Eddinoid on the background.

284
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,800
It's just wonderful.

285
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,260
What about the tombs?

286
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,100
Not in the band.

287
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,480
They weren't.

288
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,120
They weren't able to show up and we couldn't afford them.

289
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,120
No, I'm not referring to the band, the tubes.

290
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:40,260
I'm referring to the tubes meant to enclose the individuals who get too close to certain of the activities.

291
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,960
What happened?

292
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Did they just discard them the way they discarded those Iraqi tubes?

293
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,000
You didn't see the giant colon educational walkthrough display?

294
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,300
I was part of that.

295
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,420
Oh.

296
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:55,900
I was.

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,840
I was.

298
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,680
We were lucky to get that.

299
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,380
First to be a part of it.

300
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,440
There's always some weird props out there at Brushwood that the hippies leave.

301
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,680
Like there was a motorized dragon one year, remember?

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,480
And there was like a crash flying saucer one year.

303
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,580
A strap on third leg that you could just impress people with.

304
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,680
And yeah, I remember a lot of strange appurtenances and devices.

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,960
Well, you get a lot of crazy people at these subgenius gatherings and some of them are kooks.

306
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,140
Yeah.

307
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,720
They're kind of, you know, go to a regular, get up in the morning, go to a regular job every day and believe the world is round.

308
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,080
You know, crazy people.

309
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,540
Classical schizophrenia is what it's referred to.

310
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,540
Yeah.

311
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,800
God.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,620
Friends, we had a slack day, believe it or not, at a subgenius event.

313
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,440
We actually slacked off on July 4th.

314
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,920
All we did was take time control lessons and we took turns watching Jupiter through a telescope.

315
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,760
And, you know, when the, finally, and then later on CNN, they started putting it on TV.

316
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:16,360
When the two storms on Jupiter formed that pipe and then erupted and those monolith things lining up in pairs shaped like X's, it was totally, totally weird.

317
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,180
Took my breath away for three and a half hours.

318
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,360
Once again, paramedics were nowhere in sight.

319
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,480
I had to be pounded vigorously by various subgeniuses.

320
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,680
The subgeniuses who passed by take a turn trying to revive Dave.

321
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,600
Did you know that Nikki was selling chances to pound your chest and try to bring you back to life?

322
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,040
I heard about it, but I didn't get any firm confirmation.

323
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
She made like five bucks.

324
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,380
Yeah, well.

325
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,120
Because she was only charging 50 cents.

326
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,360
It was just a joke as far as the money went.

327
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,080
We really did try to bring you back to life, and I'm sorry.

328
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,420
What a hell of a way to do it, to have extremely large women, like, bang their buttocks against my forehead.

329
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,580
Other large women bang their buttocks against my chest, screaming, breathe, breathe, you son of a, you know.

330
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,880
Well, some of those pagan.

331
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,520
Is that medicine or is that?

332
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,820
Yeah.

333
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,600
In fact, I saw a workshop about that at Starwood once.

334
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,440
So now you're importing this, you know, this yimmy glammy hippy hippy stuff to X days.

335
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,540
Hey, you weren't complaining when those large women were enrapturing you.

336
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,320
Well, I was having a dream at the time.

337
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,220
I was semi-conscious.

338
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,400
Large pink women.

339
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:22,900
Yeah.

340
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,460
I noticed.

341
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,720
Literally pink.

342
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah.

343
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,860
Yeah.

344
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,700
Which meant they were under 38, I guess, or something.

345
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,660
Isn't that the way they say?

346
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,520
I was jealous, Dave.

347
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,420
Because I like them.

348
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,260
I like those big gals.

349
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,120
You were jealous and I was jaundiced.

350
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,680
Yeah.

351
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,340
It's always that way.

352
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,380
Always...

353
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,000
And I noticed the smell that, you know, like I'm diseased or something.

354
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,460
It's like following me around.

355
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm wondering if it's following me.

356
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah, a lot of people know that.

357
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,360
I noticed that smell following you around.

358
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,460
Did it follow from brushwood or...

359
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes.

360
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,700
Oh, okay.

361
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,100
I can still smell it.

362
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,600
Because...

363
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,100
Well, that...

364
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,740
You know what it probably is?

365
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,320
Is you probably got a little bit of layer of unburnt pyroflatulation on you.

366
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,280
Because I noticed...

367
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,060
I got too close to that one, yeah.

368
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,320
We had this chili cook-off of So Genius International World Chili Cook-Off.

369
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,400
And there were some very, very weird chilies.

370
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,160
But...

371
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,320
And then we had this pyroflatulation bout about...

372
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,460
Five hours later.

373
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,900
There were some scorched eyebrows, believe me.

374
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah.

375
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,280
Worse than that.

376
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,760
One guy actually...

377
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,340
Did you see that?

378
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,620
One guy actually burned a hole through his pants.

379
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah, I saw the blisters.

380
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,040
Like, it exploded.

381
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,560
He was a typical, you know, subgenius Bobby showing off the scars and the...

382
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,820
The amateurs, they don't even believe that you can really pyroflatulate.

383
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
Half of them had never seen it done before.

384
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,360
They thought it was an urban legend.

385
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,320
And then when that first six-foot-long flame came out of Rocknar...

386
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,300
There's always...

387
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,760
You could see that half of the people there just about died.

388
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,020
Yeah.

389
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,660
Because they thought...

390
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
They really thought it was going to be special effects or something.

391
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,040
But it was the real thing.

392
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,860
It's not even a laugh at first, you know.

393
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,960
When a crowd sees that for the first time, it's like a...

394
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,060
The sad thing is we don't know whose chili was the most productive.

395
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,580
Because everybody had a little bit of each kind of chili.

396
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,380
There was some kind of dolphin chili that really did have dolphin in it.

397
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,980
Yeah, no tuna, all dolphin chili.

398
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,060
And there was a can of those.

399
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,400
There was a guy...

400
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,400
The guys from Australia had that roo chili.

401
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,560
Yeah, the pouchy pocket they called it.

402
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,740
Which really did have dried kangaroo jerky in it.

403
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,240
And they served it in a pouch pocket, yeah.

404
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:32,840
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,560
It was kind of gross.

406
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,280
Well, I think what is weirder is the fact that nobody still knows whose it was.

407
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,180
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,460
Not the chili, but who lit...

409
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:43,860
Whose...

410
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,300
Well, we got videotapes.

411
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,860
Whose equipment made that happen?

412
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,140
Well, we have...

413
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,440
We're going to be looking at the videotapes.

414
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,100
I think...

415
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,040
I think...

416
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,260
Rocknar won with that very first blast.

417
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:01,540
But it's real hard to see the inch measurements on the tape measure.

418
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,820
So it's like a toss-up between Rocknar and Reverend Funny Name.

419
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,280
Then there were all kinds of people hanging around.

420
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,220
There's like five people called Reverend Funny Name.

421
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,700
Are there five people named Reverend Funny Name?

422
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

423
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,500
I'll have to change my name to Reverend Funny Name.

424
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,520
I noticed that afterwards there were all these people crowding around the dental tent.

425
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,360
Yeah.

426
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,020
I couldn't believe this.

427
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,100
Teeth were actually ripped out of their head, brother.

428
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,460
They wanted to do that, too.

429
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,140
They were in the whipping tent.

430
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,700
Yeah.

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,600
Like, my arm got tired.

432
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,180
They really enjoy that.

433
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,380
I got tired of watching it.

434
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,360
It reminded me of The Passion or whatever it was.

435
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:36,900
Yeah.

436
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,120
I had to go to sleep for another half an hour.

437
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,180
And then I was rudely awakened again by more of this malodorous faulty ball.

438
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,960
You know, people trying to amuse themselves with their body parts or without them.

439
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:48,960
Yeah.

440
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,800
Which was even more frightening.

441
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I was kind of surprised that some of the people had such...

442
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,540
Low inhibitions.

443
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I would not be able to do that in front of people.

444
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,700
Me neither.

445
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,020
And I don't think they're legally supposed to.

446
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,360
Yeah, no.

447
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,420
It is against the law, especially in New York State.

448
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,780
And isn't there an age limit?

449
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,440
Like, people over 90 are not allowed to do that?

450
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,880
Well, it's a health hazard.

451
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,080
They have to sign a release or something with their power of attorney and their children.

452
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,320
Did you see the liability waiver on the back?

453
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,400
Here, I'm going to read it.

454
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,160
I was exposed to it.

455
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,720
This is what people had to sign to come into X-Day.

456
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,160
I, the undersigned, do hereby certify that I must be completely insane to walk into this place

457
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,040
where I might witness or be induced to perform terrible acts,

458
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,820
which acts will probably be filmed and streamed to the internet.

459
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,200
That'll start next week.

460
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,920
And I likewise recognize that I will be much safer staying outside the X-Day gates.

461
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,460
That's what they have to sign right after they pay the $60.

462
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,700
It basically says,

463
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,320
I could get hurt and you will film it and make a fool of me and I can't do anything about it.

464
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,040
Sign release, put wallet here, go lay down.

465
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,580
Although, actually, Dave, every year or so,

466
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:11,260
I have to spend a night removing breastages from the Subgenius website

467
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,800
because every year some formerly young girl decides it's time to get a job

468
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,120
or talk to her family again and they suddenly go,

469
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,840
Oh, my God.

470
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,000
All those pictures of me.

471
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,080
All those pictures of me running around naked at X-Day.

472
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,720
Especially the woman with three breasts, you know.

473
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,920
Please take those down.

474
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,620
It's kind of fun because I have to find the pictures.

475
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,220
And you know how it is when you're editing pornography.

476
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,020
It gets to you after all.

477
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,620
I one time was in the office of Screw Magazine in the layout office.

478
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,940
Remember Screw Magazine?

479
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,760
Alan Goldstein.

480
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,900
Yeah, Alan Goldstein's thing.

481
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,140
I think, I guess it's still around.

482
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,500
No.

483
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
Well, he's in bad shape.

484
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,480
But anyway, at the time that Screw was flying high, so to speak,

485
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,400
the layout was being done by a subgenius woman named Sister Chris,

486
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,740
who is now married to subgenius Reverend R. Stevie Moore.

487
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,460
Sister Chris worked, did the layout of Screw Magazine

488
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,680
and she invited me to come meet her at work when I was in New York one time.

489
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,140
And I walked into this room and had a long conversation

490
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
with a young woman.

491
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,160
Young woman my age.

492
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,540
I was young in those days.

493
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,500
Surrounded by photographs of oral activity.

494
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,700
That's wonderful.

495
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,760
Everywhere the eye went, there were BJ shots.

496
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,440
Nice black and white prints.

497
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,200
Which is benign German.

498
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,520
I mean, it was an awkward and strange hour.

499
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,180
Broward.

500
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,880
Because everywhere you looked, there was this, you know, mouthful happening.

501
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,780
Ballsy, germane.

502
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,020
I'm like, you know, Hank Hill.

503
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,620
That kind of makes me nervous to be, you know, in mixed company in a room full of hard, hardcore

504
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,460
pornography.

505
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,560
Well, it-

506
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,000
Sister Chris was a real sport.

507
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,120
I think-

508
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,740
I think her deformity was like a third neck.

509
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,780
That was her deformity?

510
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,020
Yeah.

511
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,560
Because I was just going to say, I noticed that a lot of, speaking of New York City and

512
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,960
the subgeniuses who come from New York City, the women that you mentioned, I noticed that

513
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:22,960


514
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,180
a lot of them in the banking industry are afraid to expose a third breast.

515
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:36,160
Because there are federal banking laws prohibiting the, if not wearing, the actual growing of

516
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,840
a third breast.

517
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,920
Now, I don't know what this has to do with the flow of gold or how people in foreign

518
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,940
countries and the Euro and the, or what it means.

519
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,360
But boy, you got a hard time the next day after the next day with the eraser on the

520
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,760
old computer.

521
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,760
Getting rid of that middle.

522
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,440
The middle breast.

523
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,720
You don't want to expose these people to, not the law, I guess it's the Uber law or

524
00:23:59,720 --> 00:23:59,840
something.

525
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
See, I pay extra for those.

526
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,340
Oh, of course.

527
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,020
But then you know, you've got these-

528
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,340
For the uncensored ones, the unphotoshopped, three-breastage teasers.

529
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,300
But once one of the secret society weirdos sees one of their own cavorting around in

530
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,760
a thing like X-Day, then there can be problems.

531
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,100
Duct tape and the old Comet cleanser.

532
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,640
Lonesome cowboy Dave, it's true that Princess Wee returned from an X-Day once and they were,

533
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,060
her photo was her coworker's screen saver.

534
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,600
Oh, jeez.

535
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,460
It had not taken long and she had to beg the person not to go giving these links around

536
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:43,980
to everybody.

537
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,660
She had her clothes on and everything because she's a space princess.

538
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,600
You know, we don't do, we do more like fantasy.

539
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,080
Yeah.

540
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,140
We do more like art postcards.

541
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,960
Not that-

542
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,760
It's more tasteful.

543
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,120
Yeah.

544
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,200
It certainly is erotic, but you know-

545
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,340
Yeah.

546
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,140
I did all the hard-

547
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,320
It's not blood time.

548
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,180
The hardcore stuff.

549
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,480
My hardcore career is behind me basically.

550
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,680
Well, it looks like it's behind you.

551
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:05,880
Yeah.

552
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,340
Me and Ron Jeremy have similar problems nowadays.

553
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,080
Yeah.

554
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,160
Well, you know-

555
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,720
And Hendrix.

556
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,300
Hendrix had the same huge problem.

557
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,080
He had an engorged sphincotta?

558
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,420
Yeah.

559
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,020
You've got to look forward to X.

560
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,280
10.

561
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,820
And things that should never, never be done.

562
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,420
Every year is like a learning experience.

563
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,160
If you don't want an engorged derriere, if you don't want pictures of women with three

564
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,500
breasts, if you don't want doctors actually taking each other's medicine and not giving

565
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,280
it to the people who need it, you know, you write these things down, you put them on your

566
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,340
spreadsheet, and then you go from there.

567
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,540
10.

568
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,820
X Day 10.

569
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,540
Yeah.

570
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,460
Oh, that'll be the real X Day, because it'll have an X for the 10.

571
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,560
You know, X means 10.

572
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah.

573
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,800
It'll be the true X Day.

574
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,820
X Day X.

575
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,100
Yeah, you'll say X Day X.

576
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,900
And that's what it'll be on the artwork too.

577
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,740
And if there was an ad for it, that would be X Day Ad X, which would be a palindrome.

578
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,020
Bob is a palindrome of mine.

579
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,820
It's an old song by Norbert.

580
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,240
It'll probably be shortened to XX.

581
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,520
By the way, that music that was on in the podcast-

582
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:18,520


583
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:18,520


584
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,400
In the background earlier, the first musics were by Lonesome Cowboy Day from his Friday

585
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,900
Night Concert, but the hip saddick did the Where's Bob one using an old Onan Canobite

586
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,080
riff.

587
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,740
And I think, oh, and then Ed Fred did Ghetto Bob.

588
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,740
That was the very last one.

589
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,640
And now we're hearing the Moog Cookbook.

590
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,520
Smells like...

591
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
Teen spirit.

592
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,020
Teen spurt.

593
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,080
And it did smell that way backstage.

594
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,500
I thank God there were a lot of younger-

595
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,740
God, the X Day stage, friends.

596
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,060
On Saturday night after X Day-

597
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,580
Seaman's Day is at your service.

598
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,540
The stuff that you...

599
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:15,160
You cannot walk across the stage without slipping on the fluids, the foul ichors and eruptions

600
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,740
of, I don't know what, pus and other things.

601
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
They're just like indescribable body fluids.

602
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,660
Some are clear, some are white with a slight pink stain.

603
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,100
And broken glass everywhere, broken televisions.

604
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,800
People walking on broken glass and having no-

605
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,420
Broken amplifiers.

606
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,360
No pain, no...

607
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:37,500
Well, the amino acids always break their equipment and all these TVs.

608
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,260
They get these cheap TVs and they make a wall of TVs that's on the whole show.

609
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,540
And then they do Mongoloid and then smash everything.

610
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,880
And only this time, they carried it the next logical step further and actually did the

611
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,660
human sacrifice, so to speak.

612
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,940
I don't think the guy died, but-

613
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,260
Well, he was a Mongoloid.

614
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,080
He won't be breathing without a machine's help for a long time, maybe ever.

615
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,780
I think you can expect some complaints from, if not the SPCA, but the Society of Prevention

616
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,440
of Cruelty to People with Autism or whatever it is.

617
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
But no, it's-

618
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:13,720
I don't know if you can expect that.

619
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,340
I think it's the actual Mongolism.

620
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,940
But, you know, I think that went way over the line.

621
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,040
Taking an actual Mongoloid and sacrificing him to Icarus by putting wings on him and

622
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,060
trying to get him hot.

623
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,340
He loved it, though.

624
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,100
He loved it.

625
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,340
He really thought he was going to be flying to the sun.

626
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,580
Yeah, right, right, right.

627
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,400
But how easy is it to fool a Mongoloid?

628
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,700
Did you hear the part where he goes, well, if I get too close to the sun, won't the wax

629
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,800
melt and the feathers will fall off?

630
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,740
It was as if he had heard the original legend or something.

631
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,420
Right.

632
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,620
Or he was smarter than most of us because he thought of it first on his own.

633
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,640
Well, it could have been engrammatic.

634
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,420
We don't know if it's stamped into the template of all our DNAs.

635
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,140
We don't know if this myth-

636
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:57,460
The myth that if you reach for the sun, you will get burned and die and everybody will

637
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,620
laugh at you and go, look at this subgenius.

638
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,580
But look at what Wilbur and Frank Lloyd Wright did.

639
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,980
I don't know what they did.

640
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,420
Forget it.

641
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:04,780
I'm sorry.

642
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,340
Now, those were Ohio boys, weren't they?

643
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,800
They were Ohio Dayton boys.

644
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,300
Yeah.

645
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,560
Yeah.

646
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,380
That's what gets invented out here every now and then.

647
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,220
The seersucker suit.

648
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,080
Really?

649
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
The X Day Jughead hat.

650
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,180
You remember those?

651
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,220
Those were the first few, actually.

652
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,680
They kind of phased out.

653
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
Those were before my time.

654
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,320
That was when Dobbs was actually running the X Days himself.

655
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:27,680
Yeah.

656
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,320
The old guy himself.

657
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,040
Yeah.

658
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,020
I don't buy it.

659
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,600
Why does he never really show up?

660
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,140
I mean, really?

661
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,080
Because he's tired of getting shot at.

662
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,800
There's always somebody who goes, yeah, Bob.

663
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,580
Kill Bob.

664
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,100
Yeah.

665
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,100


666
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,320
And they think, they usually really assume that some guy playing Bob, and they always

667
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,300
assume, oh, well, he's got like a body armor on because they always say kill Bob, dude.

668
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,040
So they kill an actor, literally, you know?

669
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,060
Well, yeah, right.

670
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,580
Well, not kill him so far, thank God.

671
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:56,940
Or thank Dobbs, dude.

672
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,660
That's why we have the liability waiver.

673
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,620
You know, we ought to play a song.

674
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,020
This is like the ultimate name dropping song by Saint N. Because I think it names every

675
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,040
subgenius except you, Dave.

676
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,980
Oh, well, I'm glad to be listening to this, then.

677
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,760
I can hardly wait.

678
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,120
That's great, it starts with a handshake.

679
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,320
Exits UFO's outer space.

680
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,240
J.R.

681
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,540
Dobbs is not a freak.

682
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,260
He is the eye of a hurricane.

683
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,260
Watch your money burn.

684
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,720
Thinks of their own needs.

685
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,880
Yet he's of your own needs.

686
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,880
Feeding on a purse with grand gay strength.

687
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,380
End times are close at hand.

688
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,460
Uber woman, over man.

689
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,540
Lyra in a fire representing all we hate.

690
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,980
With a government for higher end.

691
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,000
We're the only one who can do it.

692
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000


693
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000


694
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000


695
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000


696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,800
We're the only one in a combat site.

697
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,960
The best is less a genie in a hurry with a con breathing down their neck.

698
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,100
Group by group, normals falsified.

699
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,980
Full fox, look at that load playing.

700
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,040
Fine, then.

701
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,480
Uh oh, oh no.

702
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,680
Population, they don't know.

703
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,760
Save yourself, serve yourself.

704
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,060
Pink, serve their own need.

705
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,220
Yeti, serve your own need.

706
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,340
Time to plunge your own seat.

707
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,660
Yeti with a rupture in the rubber in the right, right.

708
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,560
You super slack maniac.

709
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,980
Slam, fight, bright light.

710
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,420
Feeling pretty psyched.

711
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,480
It's the end of the world as we know it.

712
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,980
It's the end of the world.

713
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:07,980


714
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:07,980


715
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:07,980


716
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:07,980


717
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,800
As we know it.

718
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,000
Bob feels fine.

719
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,000
July 5th, X day.

720
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,240
Pleasure ships are on their way.

721
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,840
Quit your job.

722
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,380
Keep your slack.

723
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
Jared Os is got your back.

724
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Hail Connie, hail Bob.

725
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
On your knees, stop right to slog.

726
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,040
Give it up, give it in.

727
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,120
Find yourself, you Yeti kid.

728
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,040
New religion, radio.

729
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,420
Help, hope gonna blow.

730
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,640
Pay to find out what you know.

731
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,160
Pass the pipe.

732
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,800
Take a check.

733
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,980
I'm telling you, this is no joke.

734
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,080
Spirits see, steer clear.

735
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,960
Turn a minute, turn a minute.

736
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:37,960


737
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:37,960


738
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:37,960


739
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:37,960


740
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:37,960


741
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,640
Turn a minute, lie.

742
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,780
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives and I decline.

743
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,280
It's the end of the world as we know it.

744
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,940
It's the end of the world as we know it.

745
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,900
Bob feels fine.

746
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,520
It's the end of the world as we know it.

747
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,800
Bob feels fine.

748
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm leading a family so I wanna make sure they left an homeland too soon.

749
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,820
Oh, it's the opening night.

750
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,820


751
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,820


752
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,820


753
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,820


754
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,820


755
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:07,840
Threw her, heroic.

756
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


757
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


758
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


759
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,940
Don't askика was Hemery Callar, do you need to ask the lies if you want it.

760
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:07,940


761
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:07,940


762
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,520
It's the end of the world

763
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,100
The other and other, John Tom Mars, Immortals living behind bars, Yeti driving fast cars, bang!

764
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:57,360
Reverend Ivan Stank, Jesus Christ and Princess We, Smoking for Auburn, so do we, Reverend Susie, such a floozy, Dr. Piss off St. Anne, one more time, I know you can, anti-Christian, Reverend Geo, doctors getting right, right!

765
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:10,700
It's the end of the world as we know it, It's the end of the world as we know it, It's the end of the world as we know it,

766
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,000
And Bob feels fine!

767
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:29,340
It's the end of the world as we know it, It's the end of the world as we know it, It's the end of the world as we know it,

768
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,420
And Bob feels fine!

769
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,200
It's the...

770
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,560
...end of the world as we know it.

771
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,800
It's the...

772
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,980
of the world as we know it

773
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,220
It's the

774
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,700
end of the world as

775
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,860
we know it

776
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,880
And Bob feels fine

777
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,280
One

778
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,720
Take me off to space

779
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,300
Take me off to space

780
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,100
Come on down you saucer man

781
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,020
And take me off to space

782
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,560
Take me off to space

783
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,820
Take me off to space

784
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,620
Come on down you saucer man

785
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,600
And take me off to space

786
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,920
Stick needles in my belly

787
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,180
Take samples of my skin

788
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,680
I don't want to be

789
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,840
I don't care as long as I

790
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,360
can live with Saucerman

791
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,440
I know that you don't take requests

792
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,220
but I'm a special case

793
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,900
Come on down you saucer man

794
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,820
and take me off to space

795
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,040
Take me off to space

796
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,240
Take me off to space

797
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Come on down you saucer man

798
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
and take me off to space

799
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,000
Take me off to space

800
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,200
Take me off to space

801
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,980
Come on down you saucer man

802
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,660
and take me off to space

803
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,380
Hey, cattle mutilators, let me join your crew.

804
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,740
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

805
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,180
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly fiend without a face.

806
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,360
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

807
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,100
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space.

808
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,480
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

809
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,820
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

810
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,260
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

811
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,600
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

812
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,020
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with wide and clammy paws.

813
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,280
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace.

814
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,760
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

815
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,460
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space.

816
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:07,460


817
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,220
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

818
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

819
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,860
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

820
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,220
Woo!

821
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:22,980
Yeah!

822
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,080
That was just wonderful.

823
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,180
And we know you're here.

824
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,220
You're just a nut sack.

825
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,380
The Reverend Ivan Stein is going to perform a three-way,

826
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:37,460
three-way performance.

827
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,360
A performance operation with the...

828
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,840
No, I said I'm not going to do the three-way.

829
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,140
Oh, yes, you're going to have to because...

830
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,840
I'm not going to do the three-way, Daddy.

831
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,440
You signed the way, and the way we know, so let's get right on down.

832
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,480
I'm not going to get in a barrel with that brain cell.

833
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,340
Put your hand in there in the brain cell.

834
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,520
No, I'm not going...

835
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,500
I don't want to touch the brain cell.

836
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,220
In the barrel, in the barrel, you know!

837
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,740
I don't want to touch the brain cell!

838
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,040
In the barrel!

839
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,600
Friends, that was Take Me Off to Space,

840
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,300
performed and written by Nen Slow,

841
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,760
the most hated subgenius on alt-slack, also the most talented.

842
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,280
And somewhat beloved, most beloved, in his own peculiar way.

843
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,280
And I believe Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger was playing guitar.

844
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
There was a now-famous girl singing in the background.

845
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,040
Well, two of them, two authoresses.

846
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,640
Mrs. Nen Slow, Donna Cossey, who wrote the book Kooks.

847
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,460
About you.

848
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,760
She and Nen Slow, yeah.

849
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,280
And...

850
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,500
And everybody, the brain eaters and everybody.

851
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,500
She and Nen Slow live in a house called the Kooks Museum.

852
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,260
The Kooks Museum.

853
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,280
Oh, and also Pagan Kennedy, who's some sort of an essayist now,

854
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,520
and social critic.

855
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,060
But he's not a real pagan.

856
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,900
The name is Pagan.

857
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,460
It's an old Irish name.

858
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,300
Pagan.

859
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Pagan Kennedy?

860
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:55,980
Yeah, Pagan.

861
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,000
She always said pagan.

862
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,860
Oh, well, I had it wrong then.

863
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,440
I stand delivered.

864
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,340
And delivered.

865
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,280
She was a cute little nerd girl back in the day.

866
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,080
She said, deliver us this day.

867
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,900
That was a long time ago.

868
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,280
That was a long time ago.

869
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,140
Oh, and before that, the end of the world takeoff there was St. Anne and Helena Handbasket.

870
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,080
I guess there won't be any more productions from them because they broke up.

871
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,640
Well, they didn't actually break up.

872
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,200
Part of their synapses became diffused.

873
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,960
Yeah, actually they...

874
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,440
And the molecules started drifting.

875
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,060
That's what happened to all of us.

876
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,360
That's how we ended up at Brushwood waiting for flying saucers every single year.

877
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,060
That's why we're so tired now.

878
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,600
It takes a lot out of you when you come out to dinner again and the priest and...

879
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,480
You know, I never found Philo the whole time.

880
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,500
He had the frock and he owed me a bunch of it.

881
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,600
And every time I'd go where I thought he was, people would go, oh, he just left.

882
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,620
Philo is just here and he just left.

883
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,440
Did you get that too?

884
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,640
Everybody saw that guy, but nobody could say where he was right then.

885
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,200
Right.

886
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,180
And then they'd walk up and say, hey, where's Philo, man?

887
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,180
He told me to be here, blah, blah, blah, whatever clock.

888
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,640
Of course, clocks are irrelevant.

889
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,680
But he...

890
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,880
Well, or meant to be smashed or stabbed.

891
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,860
But, you know, and then they'd say, well, he just left and he was with a couple of people.

892
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,020
He walked off this way, you go over there and he just left and he just left.

893
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,380
And I think he spent most of his time just leaving.

894
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,880
Leaving, yeah.

895
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:28,220
Well, I saw him leaving with those two girls, the great big old one and the real little young one.

896
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,460
Yeah.

897
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,180
And nobody saw him for like a day after that.

898
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,500
Well, how do you hook up with that fantasy twist?

899
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm curious as an alligator.

900
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,040
He's an overman.

901
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,160
An ubermensch.

902
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,720
He's the overman.

903
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,120
The ubermensch.

904
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:46,140
He's the only one who has been successfully, who has lived through the overman transfiguration in Dobbs Town.

905
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,700
Philo is an ubermensch.

906
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,200
Sorry, I had to accentuate that.

907
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,940
Because he is in a certain way.

908
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,200
Dave, listeners, I want you to know that Dave uses toilet paper.

909
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,640
Once in a while.

910
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,100
And that's how he gets those weird voices that he does.

911
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,720
I don't use it.

912
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,960
When it sounds like he's yelling through a tube or a cup.

913
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:11,800
Sometimes it's a Styrofoam cup that he fishes out of the trash with the AIDS all over it.

914
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,620
It also sounds like a very old radio drama.

915
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,340
Do you know where you're going, Mr. Tompkins?

916
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,320
Put that gun down.

917
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,140
Right.

918
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Dave has special, really cheap tricks to make a good microphone sound like a really crappy old one.

919
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,100
And this is the only time I ever do use toilet paper.

920
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,500
To create video effects.

921
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,740
In the radio station at WC.

922
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:30,740


923
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,980
WCSB in Cleveland.

924
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,900
And I have been able to make some other audio effects with toilet paper.

925
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:40,040
But none of them are quite, what's the word, cogent enough to be written down and transcribed.

926
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:48,840
Well, to paraphrase Terry Pratchett, Dave, your smell, I think, sometimes leads a life of its own.

927
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,240
Of course.

928
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,700
Because I've heard people say that it goes out.

929
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,960
You needn't quote Terry Pratchett because that is a very old saying.

930
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,440
It goes out to movies and things.

931
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,220
Your smell, your odor.

932
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,520
Yeah.

933
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,460
Goes out to sushi restaurants.

934
00:40:59,500 --> 00:40:59,900
Yeah.

935
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,700
And gets the octopus with the cucumbers and stuff.

936
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:02,880
Yeah.

937
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:03,200
Right.

938
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,760
Well, you're at home.

939
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,940
Well, unfortunately.

940
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,460
You know, working.

941
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,980
Whatever you do at home.

942
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,060
I sit at home and cry.

943
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,080
No, I pretend to cry.

944
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,880
Actually, I just like stare and wonder what the hell is happening in my brain.

945
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,960
Maybe something isn't happening.

946
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:24,280
Well, that's what we all, that's where we're all trying to get to as subgeniuses.

947
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,880
That's what we want to, we want to reach that state where truly nothing at all is happening in our brain.

948
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,260
Well, what about the little yellow trucks?

949
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,400
You're sitting home alone.

950
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,980
At alone, of course.

951
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
You're sitting home alone.

952
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,300
You're trying to get some work done.

953
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,960
You're trying to create.

954
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,040
You're trying to just relax, not do anything.

955
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,820
And next thing you know, the poppers come by.

956
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,860
The poopers, as they call them.

957
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,840
And the little yellow looks like a short bus for the muscular dystrophy truck or sometimes

958
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,300
the mental disability truck.

959
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,440
You see them too?

960
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,060
Yeah.

961
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,940
And every time I am seriously destabilized.

962
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,300
Oh, thank God.

963
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:55,420
Oh, thank God.

964
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,660
I thought I was alone.

965
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,700
I can see the yellow truck.

966
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,860
And, um, I'm not sure.

967
00:41:59,860 --> 00:41:59,860


968
00:41:59,860 --> 00:41:59,860


969
00:41:59,860 --> 00:41:59,860


970
00:41:59,860 --> 00:41:59,860


971
00:41:59,860 --> 00:41:59,860


972
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,740
I see it going down the street and I know the job has been done and I've been done.

973
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:05,660
So.

974
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,020
They don't even need to use the yellow truck anymore.

975
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,920
If you urinate, then they can track you.

976
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:11,740
Well.

977
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:16,960
If it enters the pub, unless you just go in your backyard, if you ever flush the toilet

978
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,440
and any part of that, anything that's been in you goes down into the city's water system.

979
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,280
Your body parts.

980
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,180
They know what you've been doing.

981
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,080
They can tell the insurance company what you've been lying about.

982
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,840
What you've been doing.

983
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,440
What you've been thinking about.

984
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,220
Unfortunately, now we're into thought crimes.

985
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,120
It's little pieces of the follicle of the brain actually escape into this.

986
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,740
They know who you voted for by analyzing your urine.

987
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,240
Your urine.

988
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,740
Not just mine.

989
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:44,900
Everyone's urine.

990
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,680
Yeah.

991
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,360
And what a way to live.

992
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,460
It's not the Amerikey that I grew up in.

993
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,140
Not the Amerikey I grew up in either.

994
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,840
When I was growing up in the old Amerikey, if somebody said, oh, well, sure, we'll hire

995
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,840
you if your pee is good enough for us.

996
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,620
Substantial.

997
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,240
In the old days, people would have gone, you are insane.

998
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,460
And they'd never be able to hire anybody.

999
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,580
Now there are people lining up going, oh, please give me a job for 20 grand a year and

1000
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,280
no benefits.

1001
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,100
Please.

1002
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,060
And dictate my life.

1003
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,140
Tell me I can't cuss or smoke even when I go home.

1004
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,040
Keep peeing in a cup and keep being analyzed and keep being returned.

1005
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,480
They're welcome to have a taste test if they'd like.

1006
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,900
That's what I should have told that Christian broadcasting station that wanted to hire me.

1007
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,900
Well, the Christian broadcasting guy had no business being at X Day number one.

1008
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,120
Nevermind the guy who didn't hire you.

1009
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,200
Don't these people know what they're getting in for?

1010
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,500
He claimed he did.

1011
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,900
You know, the funny thing is he was scared away, not by the third breastages or the guy

1012
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,720
that got killed or any of that kind of stuff.

1013
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,240
Or the double horns even.

1014
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,740
You know what scared him away?

1015
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,080
Yeah.

1016
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,340
The Christmas star decoration thing about five feet high.

1017
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,320
Not a real nativity scene.

1018
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,660
Yeah, just a star that they hang up, that Brushwood hangs up at Christmas.

1019
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,920
But it was laying next to a barn upside down.

1020
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,120
So it was pointing downwards.

1021
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,540
And that freaked the guy out.

1022
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,920
To him that was a clear sign, you know, the work of the Pentagon.

1023
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,520
The five-pointed star pointed down.

1024
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,160
You know what my favorite part of X Day was, though?

1025
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,360
Prussian blue.

1026
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,500
Those two young racist girls.

1027
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,560
The girls that did that Nazi music.

1028
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:30,960
Yeah.

1029
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:31,860
Yeah.

1030
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,540
They were...

1031
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,040
You saw them, didn't you?

1032
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,380
When?

1033
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,300
At X Day.

1034
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,940
Last weekend.

1035
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:37,600
Last weekend?

1036
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,260
Oh, he's another one that doesn't remember.

1037
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,680
The time control lessons.

1038
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,560
Well, I remember them seeing...

1039
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,020
You went to the time control lessons and you were still sitting there four hours after

1040
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,340
the teacher had stopped.

1041
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,580
And that's when I knew you were good at it.

1042
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,400
I thought it was two weeks ago.

1043
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,980
I was wondering why it showed up.

1044
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,840
No, it was just last...

1045
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,960
No, we just got back.

1046
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,480
To me, that's one of the best things.

1047
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,240
That was the weird thing.

1048
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,340
It was only supposed to last a week and it lasted two weeks.

1049
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,060
Total protraction of time.

1050
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,460
Inversion of time.

1051
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,600
You can go anywhere you want.

1052
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,620
You can have it be the beginning of X Day week.

1053
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,920
You can have it be the end.

1054
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,880
Anytime you go into time control.

1055
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,640
I think that's the only...

1056
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,240
Probably the only really beautiful thing about the artifact.

1057
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,560
Well, I guess that means it's not too late to check it out then.

1058
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:19,860
Yeah.

1059
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,960
If the time control is...

1060
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,640
Like a bloody leg.

1061
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,140
But there's the one...

1062
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:28,460
The problem that time control must always go around.

1063
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,900
I don't know if you knew that.

1064
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,040
That's one of Bob's oldest statements.

1065
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,700
Yes, it is hard to control.

1066
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,340
He was really young when he said that old, old statement.

1067
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,020
What's the word for that?

1068
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,760
What's the word for when something is fraught with...

1069
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,220
You know, you have a clear path and yet at the same time...

1070
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,700
You know the old Murphy's Law, how they say it in science.

1071
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,460
Dayfish? Is that what you mean?

1072
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,360
No, that's SJ. That's subgenius.

1073
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,540
You know, what's the real scientific word?

1074
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,620
Randomness. It's filled with random...

1075
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,040
I don't know.

1076
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,840
Chaos?

1077
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,140
You know, don't you?

1078
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,820
Dr. Sinister knows. He knows all the scientific terminology.

1079
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:05,840
Random versus chaos.

1080
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,600
Entropy.

1082
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,180
Yeah, chaotic, entropic.

1083
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,460
Uh-huh.

1084
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,420
Yeah.

1085
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,100
That's why there's some ash around the edges of Bob's body.

1086
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,320
Really?

1087
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:24,000
I mean, you know, if you want to sign away, you know, a release form for anything, I mean, that's the thing you got to worry about is time control.

1088
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,860
Once you step into the room, anything can probably happen.

1089
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,940
Well, it won't happen.

1090
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,380
You know, when you said time control, it reminded me to look at my watch.

1091
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,480
Well, you do that every time. You mentioned the word time. You always subconciously glance...

1092
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:42,400
Well, I have a clock in my head. I don't actually need a watch. I just, I keep it so I don't scare people.

1093
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,800
You have one of those little digital lead clocks that go on the top of the bed alarm clock.

1094
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:55,340
I'm an emergentile. Emergentile subgeniuses often have a little clock in their heads. That's why I don't ever relax.

1095
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,560
Another beneficial of being part of the Uber.

1096
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,940
You know that the Grim Reaper is breathing down your neck every second.

1097
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:11,860
Well, you're not programmed for that. You're programmed just to react to the appropriate times. You're not supposed to hallucinate a big freaking Grim Reaper breathing down your neck.

1098
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,540
Sure, but you're just programmed to say that. You're just the robot that's programmed to say that.

1099
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,480
Of course, and you're just programmed to agree with me and disagree with me in the same...

1100
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:22,740
Yes.

1101
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,320
Yes.

1102
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,260
Not.

1103
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,160
Yes.

1104
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:25,720
Yes.

1105
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,660
Yes.

1106
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,160
Yes.

1107
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:42,560
My least favorite part of X Day 9 was when the New York State Highway Patrol smashed right through the, what do they call the buntresses, the flagellers, the big...

1108
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,920
The barricades.

1109
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,820
The barricades. That's the word I was thinking about, French riots in the 1970s.

1110
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,300
Yeah, yeah. That's where we learned how to build those.

1111
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,180
But broke through the barricades. The petrol bombs started going, we call them gas bombs. We're in America and stuff.

1112
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:03,120
And the gunshots started going and not enough people were diving for coverage. That was one... Did I say it was my favorite or least favorite?

1113
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,980
That was your least favorite.

1114
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,120
My least favorite.

1115
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,540
Yeah.

1116
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,340
It's hard to tell.

1117
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,220
It's hard to tell.

1118
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,840
Especially after time control.

1119
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:21,260
Especially after the stuff is so weird out there. You get in such a strange state of mind, partly just because you're in an unfamiliar place. You're outdoors and camping and everybody is perverse and weird in some way.

1120
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,720
Most of us.

1121
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,260
So of course you're kind of off.

1122
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,640
Most of us.

1123
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:32,320
And the drumming that's always going on. And the naked women parades. Have you seen... Did you catch those every afternoon?

1124
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,680
The different naked women parades?

1125
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,820
Breasts for Peace.

1126
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah.

1127
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,260
Breasts... What is it called? Breasts Not Bombs?

1128
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,660
Yeah. Breasts Not Bombs.

1129
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,340
Or Breasts of Bombs or something like that. It was spelled B-O-B.

1130
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,580
Mammal Mommies Against the War.

1131
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,080
Yeah.

1132
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,240
There were all kinds of interesting and exciting names.

1133
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,020
I liked that. I think that's a really cool way of... Hey, I need to play a song or something.

1134
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,640
That's what my spidey sense says.

1135
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,720
I noticed your hair is on fire so that means...

1136
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,840
So I'm going to play... This is by our sister station in Champaign, Illinois.

1137
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,160
And the Ouroboros Rex, who is a DJ there, did this lovely song.

1138
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,180
That was the Swinging Love Corpses in the background from X Day.

1139
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,260
Okay. Let's see. One of these buttons should...

1140
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:39,940
So while since X Day, I guess I should believe, maybe next year will be better than the last.

1141
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:49,840
I still remember the last thing that Bob said as he was leaving.

1142
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,720
Now the drills go by so fast.

1143
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,640
And it's one more day up in the saucer.

1144
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,720
And it's one more night in Rushwood.

1145
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:13,140
If a Friday Jones could be my high list.

1146
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,680
I wish she would.

1147
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,820
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

1148
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:26,200
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na yeah

1149
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,560
The smell of big boys and their normals And the feeling that they all can't help

1150
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,200
But sit in my face

1151
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,460
With my third eye I look across the mill

1152
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,280
No way to see he exists

1153
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,820
On their way to burn this place

1154
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,060
And it's one more day up in the saucers

1155
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,780
And it's one more night in brushwood

1156
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,080
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie

1157
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,740
Maybe I could

1158
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,160
Na na na na na

1159
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,600
Na na na na na

1160
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,820
Na na na na na

1161
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,020
Na na na na na

1162
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,460
Yeah

1163
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,020
Na na na na na

1164
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,880
Na na na na na

1165
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,920
Na na na na na

1166
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,120
Na na na na na

1167
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:39,860
Yeah

1168
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,880
I cruise this ladder mansion sometime after 2am

1169
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,320
And talk a little while about the church

1170
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:01,900
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower

1171
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,240
Makes you talk a little lower

1172
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,760
About the church

1173
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,440
About the day that we take over

1174
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,180
It's been a while since X-Day

1175
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,040
And I guess I will believe

1176
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,400
Maybe next year will be better than the last

1177
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:29,100
I can't remember all the times I played the hourglass

1178
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:34,080
And wished my wish would make it come to pass

1179
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,740
I can't remember all the times I played the hourglass

1180
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,400
And wished my open-ended world

1181
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,200
And wished after our own ends

1182
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,200


1183
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,400
No sign that I'm moving

1184
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1185
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1186
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1187
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1188
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1189
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,400


1190
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,360
It's 1701 in brushwood

1191
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:56,680
I have never made it to a next day

1192
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,080
I guess I should

1193
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,240
If I could

1194
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:05,740
I'd go home

1195
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,700
Na na na na, na na na na, yeah

1196
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:20,320
Na na na na, na na na na, yeah

1197
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,080
Na na na na, yeah

1198
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:32,800
Na na na na, na na na na, yeah

1199
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:47,200
Na na na na, na na na na, yeah

1200
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,100
Yeah

1201
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,280
Yeah

1202
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:04,660
A robberous rex

1203
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,760
Mickey Mouse and Pluto

1204
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,860
To their movie stars in Disneyland

1205
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:17,600
Oh, friends, I should mention

1206
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,520
This will hopefully keep me from getting more emails about this

1207
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,320
For two weeks now, I've been warned daily

1208
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,640
About GameSpot website

1209
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,840
CNET

1210
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,260
Using Bob's head

1211
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,620
A giant company, yeah

1212
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,420
One of their spinoffs, GameSpot

1213
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,500
Was having a grads and dads special sale

1214
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,500
And a Dobbs head with glasses added on it

1215
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,480
Was being used as the

1216
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:47,640
Dad

1217
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,400
And I wrote to them, their lawyers

1218
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,020
And said, that's a trademark

1219
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,300
And the lawyers wrote back and said, no it's not

1220
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,780
We found it on the web, on the trademark web

1221
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,220
And that trademark has

1222
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,700
Expired

1223
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,760
And I was able to say

1224
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,700
Yes, that's true

1225
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,720
But you were looking at the old trademark

1226
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,800
We have re-trademarked it under these

1227
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,500
Different new categories which cost a million bucks

1228
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,940
And therefore you

1229
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,200
Must take it down

1230
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,080
And they did, today, it's down

1231
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,160
Oh, well then

1232
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,880
They replaced it with a false Bob

1233
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,200
That was like another guy

1234
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,080
And another dad looking guy with glasses in a pipe

1235
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,900
But it was not the mark owned by yours, truly

1236
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,300
So, we cannot expect Oxo, Bloxo litigation

1237
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,000
And lots more money for you

1238
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,600
No

1239
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,100
No

1240
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,320
No, we don't know

1241
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,540
Because you don't press things like that

1242
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,820
Unless you really have to

1243
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,760
Because only the lawyers win, Dave

1244
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,760
In a lawsuit

1245
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,140
Only the lawyers win most of the time

1246
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:45,320
And the hams

1247
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,100
The big hams

1248
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,400
Lawsuits mean a lot of money for lawyers

1249
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,540
Their lawyers and your lawyer

1250
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,800
I don't have a lawyer staying

1251
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,280
Princess

1252
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,220
I mean not

1253
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,580
Princess Magdalene

1254
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,980
Her custody case thing

1255
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,940
Has been going on

1256
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,060
Last Friday and tomorrow

1257
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,520
She may know something

1258
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,300
Next couple of days

1259
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,180
She'll be at X day

1260
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,840
Jesus will be at X day

1261
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,920
In time control land

1262
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,140
In yesterday's X day

1263
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,420
So he'll be in and out

1264
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,820
Like Philo

1265
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,260
Perhaps

1266
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,080
Where you never can see him

1267
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,860
But he's there

1268
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,600
He's always just out of eye shot

1269
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,000
Here's Philo

1270
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,400
Turn on

1271
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,140
Tune in

1272
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,100
And slack off

1273
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,120
I thought that was Timothy Beerle

1274
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:31,500
No

1275
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,480
That was one of Philo's

1276
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,060
Alter egos

1277
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,480
Philo was

1278
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,600
Timothy Leary

1279
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,900
And he shed him like a dead body

1280
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,380
Yeah

1281
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:44,860
Yeah

1282
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,740
He moved

1283
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,060
He moved on

1284
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,260
I like besties disguised

1285
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,860
Just like a former KGB agent

1286
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:51,820
That drinks too much

1287
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,220
And has a bladder infection

1288
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,960
This is Bill T. Miller

1289
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,380
In the background

1290
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,460
You can go to BillTMiller.com

1291
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,760
If you want to

1292
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,500
And download

1293
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,800
This and much more

1294
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,500
That's the guy with the ponytail

1295
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,880
Who like runs around screaming

1296
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,440
Look at me

1297
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,220
I'm built like a woman

1298
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:11,960
Why do they want to

1299
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,040
Pick on me like this right

1300
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,180
No that's Philo

1301
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,720
Philo not Philo

1302
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:15,940
Has a

1303
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,980
No wonder I couldn't recognize him

1304
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,060
He now has a ponytail

1305
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,800
Yeah

1306
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
Oh I thought

1307
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,280
Well you know

1308
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,520
And he's got that new wife

1309
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,660
Reverend Chaos

1310
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:26,380
Bobcat

1311
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,320
Something

1312
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,060
She changes her name every week

1313
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,100
She's a regular

1314
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,060
That's the way to do it

1315
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,700
On the San Francisco

1316
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,780
That is the way to do it

1317
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,480
By the way

1318
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,260
You know

1319
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,400
Change your name weekly

1320
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,320
Just like I should change my

1321
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,360
Or your underwear

1322
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,240
Thank you

1323
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:41,840
Are you offering

1324
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,760
Is that an offer

1325
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,040
I'm offering to change

1326
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,180
Anybody's underwear

1327
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,520
Who wants it

1328
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,220
Underwear

1329
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,400
The undermensch

1330
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,720
That's a fly

1331
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,920
A little buzzy fly

1332
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,000
Is the undermensch

1333
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:55,940
Well

1334
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,440
We're going to have to be

1335
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,380
Moving out of here

1336
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,140
Because this show

1337
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,040
Is ending soon

1338
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,620
And oh I should say

1339
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,420
This has been

1340
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,080
Hour of Slack

1341
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,440
Number

1342
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,740
One thousand

1343
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,980
Fifty four

1344
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,000
With a

1345
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,340
Live

1346
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,060
This time live

1347
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,580
In WCSB studios

1348
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,220
With Lonesome Cowboy Day

1349
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,780
And Dr. Sinister

1350
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,100
Who wandered

1351
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,300
In

1352
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,920
And yours truly

1353
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Reverend Ivan Stang

1354
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,040
There's more information

1355
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:19,700
About the Church

1356
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,580
Of the Subgenius

1357
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,920
At subgenius.com

1358
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,960
And this is

1359
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,380
Sivit Stang

1360
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,300
Taking us out

1361
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,020
Pretending love's

1362
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,140
Beside me

1363
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,620
In the dark

1364
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,840
His dogs in pipe

1365
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,440
They guide me

1366
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,720
Without love

1367
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,960
I smell his drop

1368
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,360
Around me

1369
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,080
And I'm in love

1370
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,800
And when I have no slack

1371
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,760
I touch my clown

1372
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,440
And Bob has found me

1373
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,300
On my job

1374
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,920
The noddles act

1375
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
Like dog slits

1376
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,300
Without slack

1377
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,880
The sweat runs down

1378
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,220
My armpits

1379
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,680
The next day

1380
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,000
I'll see the saucers coming

1381
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,220
And all I need

1382
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,180
Is Bob and me

1383
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:14,640
Forever

1384
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,080
And I'll see

1385
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,440
Bob and me

1386
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,000
Forever and forever

1387
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,960
But until

1388
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,780
I spend my thirty bucks

1389
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,500
I'm just

1390
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Ranting to myself

1391
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,400
And not to Bob

1392
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,620
And although

1393
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,400
I know

1394
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,040
That I am screwed

1395
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,420
Still I say

1396
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,040
There's a day

1397
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,080
Of pain

1398
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,100
I love Bob

1399
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,540
But when the rupture's over

1400
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,940
He'll be gone

1401
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:59,960
The earth will be in ruins

1402
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,680
Without him

1403
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,040
The world around me changes

1404
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,800
The conspiracy is everywhere

1405
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,300
The malls are full of pink boys

1406
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,980
I love Bob

1407
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,060
But every day

1408
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,080
I don't spend

1409
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,640
That thirty bucks

1410
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,940
I'm only just pretending

1411
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,880
Without me

1412
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,380
Bob's world

1413
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,280
Will go on burning

1414
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,040
Our next day

1415
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,420
Bob will have this life

1416
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,060
That I'll never know

1417
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:43,440
I love Bob

1418
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,040
I love Bob

1419
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,380
I love Bob

1420
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,760
I love Bob

1421
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,580
I'm only

1422
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,980
On my own
