1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,660
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,100
Nor that one.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,820
The subgenius. Power of...

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,840
SWITCH!

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,280
Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Oh really?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,560
4-4-0. At the tone, please record your message.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,900
Finished recording. You may hang up or press 1 for more options.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,140
Hi Dave, I think I called the wrong phone. I'm gonna call your house now, bye.

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,740
I wonder what happened today.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,280
Dave, did he miss our appointment?

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,420
Bye Bob.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:01,560
Hello?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,960
Oh Dave, there you are. Just about gave up. I thought you'd missed your anointment by Bob.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,160
My ointment?

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,740
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,980
Put some pig grease on me and argue with me about something. I forget it.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,240
Ptolemy versus Toltecs and the Iron Fist of Wonder.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,720
You know, you got a bunch of Japanese...

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,380
Suzuki poets in there and going on. Haiku guys and...

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,200
It's supposed to be quite a big deal but I can't attend.

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,500
You're talking about wrestling, right?

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:44,840
Yeah, I'm talking about men with large breasts who don't mind showing them off and they wear leotards and high shoes and stuff.

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,200
Yeah, superheroes. Worldwide wrestling and stuff.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Well, a lot of worldwide wrestlers, not, you know, superheroes.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,920
Have a certain forbidden gene. I guess it comes out every Tuesday or something like that.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,620
It's like a weekly thing. And it definitely has been declared an omnibus.

30
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,300
There, Bill.

31
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:18,220
Oh, we're going to be playing some cuts from that show Omnibus at some point when I need reruns real badly.

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,280
It's a show where they talked about the Church of the Subgenius for one episode.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:24,900
Well, they do.

34
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,360
They talk about different things each time. They're smart guys that talk good on a podcast.

35
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,700
And I was going to play that Sunday.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, that sounds like a...

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,760
Yeah, I forget what the point of all that was, but...

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,440
Well, it sounds like a very great idea. You know, there's a theme.

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:52,980
And you can even have some kind of vague format, you know, call them like signposts or boys, mechanical boys.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,640
A format.

41
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,840
That's what we need for this show, which is the hour of slack.

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,280
I guess we are actually doing a show again.

44
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, but it's got an obvious format. You say something, I say something. If we's are out, she says something.

45
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,740
And, you know, anybody else wants to say something, they get to say something they do in that format.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,780
Speaking of anybody else, where's Princess Wei?

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,700
I don't know, Stan, but she's certainly not here.

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,920
Princess Wei!

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,840
Yeah?

50
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,580
You can come be on show if you want to.

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,500
Okay.

52
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,000
We're at Tarzan's radio station. I just set it up.

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,340
I panicked for a minute there because I thought that my mixer wasn't getting power.

54
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,280
And since it's about 50 years old, it's actually, yeah, it's almost as old as me.

55
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,760
I can understand its problem.

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,120
But it was that I didn't have the headphone plugged in all the way.

57
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,860
Silly me.

58
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,800
Silly Tarzan.

59
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,920
Who is the cheetah, or not cheetah, the chimpanzee to this, to the Tarzan studio?

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:03,820
Buddy.

61
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,280
Has to be a requisite buddy?

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,080
Yeah. He's a dog.

63
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,200
He's a dog. But we don't have any chimps yet.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,840
We were, we had dreamed of replacing me at D5.

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,520
It was true.

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,320
It was at the current contest.

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,820
Or maybe we had, Iagn was at the contest.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:45,940
Oh.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
And I didn't have aэ

70
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,560
That would free you up a lot, so you could go around scratching your armpits and going,

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,780
Exactly, that was the whole idea.

72
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,660
But then there'd be like two of you carousing on the same pine yard,

73
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,080
and neither one have the correct idea of what's going on,

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,720
because you know that chimpanzee, guess who I am today, I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,140
No, it's not like he'll just go grab a banana and frighten one of the little girls.

76
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,100
Well, that was the problem. That's exactly what happened.

77
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,320
And he kept getting out.

78
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,040
Well, I mean, not certainly of age, little girl.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,820
He was one of those face-eating chimps on Prozac.

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,500
We thought we were going to save money. It was a bad idea.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Anyway, so the new cheetah around here would be,

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,580
well, actually, I guess it would be Claudia,

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,120
who looks very much like some kind of a primate.

84
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,780
As much of a primate as a dog.

85
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,300
I never saw, I didn't know that.

86
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,880
Her face does. Her face is uncannily similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong.

87
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,160
And she's got a boxer face.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,500
And about five times the size of her body.

89
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,700
A boxer face, that means that she's got like cauliflower ears and broccoli breasts and all that.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,940
Yeah, an undershut jaw.

91
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,820
Yeah.

92
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,900
Well, that could be, that could be, they could turn on you in a moment's notice.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
You never can tell what those were.

94
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,060
Princess, Princess, we just sat down.

95
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,840
Oh, there, you pull it down.

96
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,500
Here.

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,580
No, I can't.

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
I can't hear you either.

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,920
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,580
How about now?

101
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,640
Can you hear you?

102
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,100
Yes, how now, Brown Cow?

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,340
Can you hear the music?

104
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,180
Yes, yes, yes.

105
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,620
Okay, technical exercise over.

106
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,480
Tarzan's is fully functioning.

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,100
And recording, everything's going fine.

108
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,420
No trouble.

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,860
Except for how would someday, would it be possible that I could hear the music too?

110
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,440
Because I can hear the music, but it's not the same music you're playing.

111
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Right.

112
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,340
The heavenly chorus of the few thousand of the people who died at the Gallipolis in the Stonewall Adventures of 1920.

113
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,860
What was that?

114
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, just imagine, Dave, that you're listening to Brian Henke's album,

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,120
Seven Magical Days.

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,980
Six Magic Spells.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,180
Okay, I can't remember the content of Henke's album.

118
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,500
It's a rug of pretty guitar music.

119
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,640
Beautiful guitar instrumental.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Sweet and gentle.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,460
Yeah, very gentle music.

122
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,600
I use it for my home movies of the ranch insects and snakes and buzzards.

123
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,500
Yes.

124
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,440
And we're at the ranch now, listeners.

125
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,900
We're at Stang Ranch in Fossil House at Tarzan's Radio.

126
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,100
Yes.

127
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,100


128
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,100


129
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,100


130
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,100


131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:55,140
We're at the radio station with a bear head looking down on us, a real one, painting a

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:04,600
pappy on horseback glaring at us with a weird idiot grin and two casts of dinosaur tracks

133
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
that we made ourselves.

134
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,240
Yes.

135
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,060
Down at the creek here in front of us.

136
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,500
And the dog's sleeping.

137
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,700
Claudia's sleeping on the dog bed right behind us.

138
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,980
And the sun is setting.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
So, you know, it's cool.

140
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,000
Right.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,580
The little hound dog's poking around causing trouble.

142
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
It's just like normal.

143
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,760
We're out in the country, out in the woods.

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,480
Well, we're in the house.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,200
But since all the windows are broken out and, you know, there's no roof, we might as well

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,660
be outdoors.

147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,280
But it's really beautiful.

148
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,920
It is.

149
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,240
It's a beautiful ruin, Frankenstein's Fossil House is.

150
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,080
It is.

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,620
Did you survive the blizzard all right?

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,880
Princess Weed looks like she's hearing devil.

153
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:46,980
I'm in the temple of the devil.

154
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,920
The pagoda?

155
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,780
Oh, yeah.

156
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,720
You've been hearing devils?

157
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,860
It's our little boy dog.

158
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,280
He's making all kinds of squeaks and squawks.

159
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,620
How can you hear him over Dave and this music?

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,860
Oh, I have magical ears.

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,660
You have to talk closer to them.

162
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,440
Magical ears.

163
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,100
Yeah.

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Yeah.

165
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:04,940
Yeah.

166
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,040
So, any minute now, the cows are going to start trampling through the living room, followed

167
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,840
by the goats.

168
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,440
And there'll be cool sound effects.

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
I'll turn the music down for that.

170
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,540
Yeah.

171
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm going to go.

172
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:16,960


173
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,500
But it's great.

174
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,500
We made it.

175
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,360
That's the important thing.

176
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,940
We're not dead.

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,640
We were almost dead several times.

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,520
I was actually injured.

179
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,560
We were both injured and traumatized by the final days of the, well, the final months

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,280
of the house repair and move.

181
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:44,660
And then the packing of the U-boxes and the driving on I-65 with a five-hour traffic jam.

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,820
But praise Bob.

183
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,900
We're here now.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,840
And as far as I know, I'll never, ever have to drive on I-65 or I-40 ever again.

185
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,420
Well, moving does beat you up pretty well.

186
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:56,820
Yeah.

187
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,260
And those two interstates suck.

188
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,520
Well, sure.

189
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
I can only agree with that.

190
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,700
I heard that you had a temper tantrum right in the middle of the third rail.

191
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,740
Oh, I had real good reason to.

192
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,420
I had real good.

193
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,860
Yeah.

194
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,860
I was peeing mad standing right there on top of the third rail.

195
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,120
It was shocking.

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,280
I heard all crazy people say I was peeing mad.

197
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,160
Yeah.

198
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,500
Well.

199
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,560
That's their excuse when the EMT arrives with a zapper gun to calm you down.

200
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,980
Or you would be too if you had to deal with that motel clerk that I had to deal with.

201
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,940
And that traffic jam.

202
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,540
Wouldn't you say in any major venture or any big move there has to be at least one

203
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,240
motel seven or motel clerk?

204
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,480
We know all of them along that route.

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,820
I've driven that route.

206
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,640
I've driven that route something like 30 times both ways.

207
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,840
We knew them intimately.

208
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah.

209
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,640
Yeah.

210
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,780
And some of them have gone downhill on our list.

211
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,400
Yes.

212
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,480
No More Econo Lodge in Jackson, Tennessee.

213
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,520
That's a shame.

214
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,620
That used to be a great place.

215
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,980
Yes.

216
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,900
It was grand in its day.

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,740
But it's a ruin now.

218
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:10,580
Anyway, so our motel reviews are available online at subgenius.com where you can also

219
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,760
get Neighbor World.

220
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,100
Yeah.

221
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah.

222
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
And we're going to be talking about a new incredible sizzling new novel by best selling

223
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,520
New York Times author Dave DeLuca who couldn't be with us today.

224
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,000
Instead we have lonesome cowboy Dave DeLuca here.

225
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm packing his place.

226
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,040
Yeah.

227
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,620
Yeah.

228
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,980
And I'm wearing his soffits too.

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,780
You ever see those like what the kids, the little paper boys and everything used to in

230
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,120
the 1930s that come up to your leg or your kneecaps and then you wear like these weird

231
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,200
long socks and these really goofy looking shoes?

232
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,700
No.

233
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:42,780
No.

234
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


235
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


236
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


237
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


238
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


239
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


240
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


241
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:42,780


242
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,180
No.

243
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,320
Have you never done that?

244
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,760
No.

245
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,680
No.

246
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,120
Why not?

247
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,300
Dave, are you like living in the past before you were even alive?

248
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,300
Yeah.

249
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
When you were dead before you were alive?

250
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah.

251
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,480
Why not?

252
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
Before my previous death and aliveness.

253
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:58,820
Well, I mean.

254
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,480
Well, two lifetimes ago in Hell's Kitchen which is not far from Paradise Alley.

255
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,700
Two lifetimes.

256
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,300
Two lifetimes.

257
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,360
That's a new one on me, Dave.

258
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,260
I didn't know you had two.

259
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,780
I'm sorry.

260
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:12,780


261
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:12,780


262
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,020
I think everybody has at least a few or four or five.

263
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,100
The Gopati Buddha says each person has about a thousand because it takes a long time to

264
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,500
get it.

265
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,280
Only Bob and people who hang out with Bob.

266
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,820
And I haven't been invited to those parties yet myself.

267
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh, yes you have.

268
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,600
No, I haven't.

269
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,880
I never have been invited to one of Bob's parties.

270
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,720
It's like I'm the help, you know.

271
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:41,020
They don't even let me, they don't even hire me to videotape them.

272
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,780
Can't you even like serve food?

273
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:42,780


274
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,120
Can't you even like serve shrimp over an icy table?

275
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,540
No, they won't let me do anything.

276
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Won't let me anywhere near those parties.

277
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,640
I never hear about them until afterwards.

278
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,200
I understand.

279
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,220
You should have been there.

280
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
Thanks, Philo.

281
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,620
I guess those things are like national holidays in Peru.

282
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,640
Oh, all kinds of stuff.

283
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,900
You never know what it's going to be.

284
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
And I never know for sure.

285
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,060
I hear about them later.

286
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,560
Just they rub it in, you know, especially Philo.

287
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,600
Oh, that's what I was going to say.

288
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,200
If I was going to have Philo and Onan on this show, we could have a show about wrestlers.

289
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,420
Those guys are experts in the world of and Sphinx Drummond also.

290
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,940
Yeah, but if you had Philo, you could also do have like Greek drumming too and stuff because of like Philo Do.

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,860
That's a different Philo.

292
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,420
Oh, it's Philo actually.

293
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,620
I just thought they were mispronouncing it, but I guess they were.

294
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
I think we've had people call Philo, Philo.

295
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,160
Like they never heard the name Philo pronounced out loud.

296
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,660
And Princess Wee, people call her Princess Way.

297
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,200
Yes, often.

298
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,060
Well, there is a Chinese name, Wee, that's spelled the same way and it may be pronounced way.

299
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,940
But this isn't the Wee Way.

300
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,360
This is the Wee Wee Way.

301
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,000
It's a small Wee Way.

302
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,260
Wee Wee Way Way.

303
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,360
Yes, the French small Wee Wee Wee Way Way.

304
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, because in my mind I can see those like autographed, what do you call them?

305
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,300
Those body tapes, those booty tabs or those urine holders when you're in the hospital and stuff like that.

306
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,500
Oh yeah, I've got three of those.

307
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,060
You've got three of them?

308
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,020
In the car, yeah.

309
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,360
And three more in the bedroom.

310
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,420
You've got to have them, man.

311
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,240
You don't want to be caught with your pants down, so to speak.

312
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,720
I use mine for coffee or tea in the morning sometimes.

313
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
I'm so dependent on them.

314
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,180
I hear you about the depends and dependency and all that.

315
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:38,700
It's sad.

316
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,540
It's really way too much.

317
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,820
It's the indignities, man.

318
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,340
Princess, you have to lean into the mic.

319
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,360
She's so slack.

320
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,360
She's such an emergentile like Susie.

321
00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:03,280
She'll eventually slouch back away from the mic because it's just crouching at the mic requires, well, crouching the way we do it.

322
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,680
Well, remember Crouch on Mars was a great citizen of the United States.

323
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,240
And forever may he reign.

324
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,760
Or Snow, one of those articles of faith that you have to keep on your pants.

325
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,700
Dave, you're doing it now.

326
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Dave's leaning.

327
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,780
He's slacking back away from the mic.

328
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,120
Dave, Dave, Dave, how can you do that?

329
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,240
You must lean into the phone.

330
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,480
Is it less slacked off the microphone now?

331
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,860
Yeah, that's better.

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,480
Much better.

333
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,520
Yeah, use your TV voice, you know, your radio diction and stuff.

334
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,760
Hey, you know, I was just wondering about the last thing you just said.

335
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,840
What kind of diction should we use or can we use?

336
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,620
Well, it's a wonderment to me.

337
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,940
Everybody here at the W.

338
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,840
You sound like one of those 1950s radio announcers.

339
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:04,080
Yeah, I was going to do like Pottery Stoop, but that's actually like a radio show like Jim Chain, Private Detective, you know, that kind of thing.

340
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,500
Well, we used to do that.

341
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:07,500


342
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,380
Back when you and Psychopath Finder were writing insane plays every week.

343
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,700
You guys would like the Firesign Theater.

344
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,300
I got to be in those a few times.

345
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,460
Yeah, I was just going to play Firesign Theater.

346
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:19,900
I did too.

347
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,900
You know, Nick Danger was very dangerous for a long time.

348
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:30,200
You know, I was involved in, well, the Chameleon Club, the people that put on Starwood.

349
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,700
They had a group called the, what was it, the Firesign Clones?

350
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,620
Oh, yeah.

351
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,140
Yeah, the Firesign Clones.

352
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,940
And we would stand up on the Starwood stage in the afternoon and read a radio play.

353
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,300
We'd perform one of those albums from the big book of plays or whatever.

354
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,820
And I was banned because I read my part twice and I only got to perform with you guys one time.

355
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,420
Anyway, they let me play Nick Danger and I thought I was doing a great job.

356
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,280
I thought I sounded just like Phil Austin.

357
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,020
Oh, you suck, man.

358
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,500
When I listened back to the tape, I happened to have it playing at the same time as the original Firesign tape.

359
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,980
As far as the timing went, everybody had it exactly in sync with the original album, just from memory.

360
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,000
But Nick Danger sounded like he was the Texas Nick Danger.

361
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,420
And I was doing my best to not sound, you know, I wanted to sound like an L.A. detective guy.

362
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,720
Out of the fog and into the smog.

363
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,260
You sure you didn't sound like Nicole?

364
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,260


365
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,180
Sound like Nicole Dangerous, you know what I'm saying?

366
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,880
Yeah.

367
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,480
Yeah, anyway, it didn't work.

368
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,820
I realized that I was not really slated to be a character actor or a voice actor of that kind.

369
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:59,020
Unless it needed to either be a little bit kind of slightly Texas-y, no matter how British I might try to sound or whatever.

370
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,420
Or Claude Rains.

371
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,120
But those are the only options.

372
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,480
Well, he certainly does.

373
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,340
You were talking about Depends and There You Go Again, Claude Rains.

374
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,900
Just like, remember, what's his name in high school?

375
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,940
In the seat behind you in Study Hall, Claude Balls or whatever his name was.

376
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,360
Hey, we could change, we could add to Claudia's name.

377
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:26,220
Claudia Rains, or Gabrielle Tirebiter St. Clair.

378
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,980
Now, she didn't get, Claudia didn't get her name Tirebiter from the Firesign Theater.

379
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,960
She got it from literally biting and flattening.

380
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
Mower tires.

381
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,000
While they were moving.

382
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,000
Through a fence.

383
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,980
Through a chain link fence.

384
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,040
Well, no, it's a livestock fence.

385
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,220
Livestock fence.

386
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,020
Still.

387
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,780
I hope she doesn't have the Hitler Syndrome.

388
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,640
You know, when they...

389
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,440
Yeah, she does.

390
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,960
Sounds a little crazy to me, you know?

391
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,720
Yeah, she does.

392
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,600
The only thing she hates are loud machines that roll around.

393
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,540
Ah.

394
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,800
Like mowers and trimmers.

395
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,580
And, uh...

396
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,320
And she hates female dogs.

397
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,660
She doesn't really like vacuum cleaners either.

398
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,900
Anything that moves around that's loud like that.

399
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,320
Yeah, yeah, she'll attack them.

400
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,580
Yeah.

401
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,760
She's part pit bull, part Terminator, part boxer.

402
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,420
I can see her in a pair of boxer shorts right now in my mind.

403
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:23,820
Eyeball.

404
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,900
Boy, that's kind of got me a little nervous.

405
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,920
She barked furiously at Stang yesterday because he was repairing a trimmer.

406
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,580
She barked at you?

407
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,040
She must have barked at you for 40 minutes.

408
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,100
Well, she was warning me not to turn it on.

409
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes.

410
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,720
She's going, don't repair it, don't turn it on.

411
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't fix it, don't turn that on, don't use that around me.

412
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,960
Well, I don't.

413
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,640
She was very, very, very clear about it.

414
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,680
Oh, it's so bucolic out here, Dave, in the woods.

415
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,220
Uh...

416
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,880
Bucolic means kind of like sleepy, though.

417
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,260
Yeah, yeah, it is.

418
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,000
It's very sleepy.

419
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,580
It's actually literally sleepy now because the sun...

420
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,560
We left a curtain on it.

421
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:12,400
The curtains open over here, and the afternoon sun was blinding me for the whole first half

422
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,060
of this show.

423
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,420
Now I'm deaf.

424
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,180
My eyes are okay.

425
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,740
Well, Homer was blind.

426
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,680
You know, the guy that transcribed the Odyssey or the Iliad, Homer was blind.

427
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,820
They say all the great barters...

428
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,020
No, Homer works at the power plant.

429
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,460
Yeah, that's his brother's...

430
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,540
His brother-in-law has the same name, and it was a big deal back at the time.

431
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,540


432
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,840
And at the saxophone parties, don't you remember?

433
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,140
No.

434
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,500
He said, look, I'm not...

435
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,760
They didn't invite me to those parties either, Dave.

436
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,280
Me neither, but I used to.

437
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,500
It's a pretty good dope on what they were trying to say.

438
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,140
Yeah.

439
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,660
Well, I wish I knew what we were trying to say.

440
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,660
Oh, yeah, praise Bob.

441
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,140
That's it.

442
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,080
We're supposed to talk about Church of the Subgenius and how the weirdos have been held

443
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,760
down by the normals and how the Nazis have taken over America.

444
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,740
You call it dogs?

445
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,200
Huh?

446
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,200


447
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,220
They're called dogs, I think.

448
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,060
They're called dogs, but they're not dogs.

449
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,060


450
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,060


451
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,060


452
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,160
I think they're called dogs.

453
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,160


454
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,660
Bucolic dogs.

455
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,960
Bucolic dogs, symphonets, chimpanzees.

456
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,920
And the world is ending.

457
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,020
And our chimpanzee is a dog.

458
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,500
And our Tarzan tree house is actually just a living room in a barn-like structure.

459
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,200
Lined with fossils, at least.

460
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,540
At least we have lots of rocks.

461
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,220
Lined with fossils and books.

462
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:28,900
Yeah.

463
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,220
At least it's not a living being because you don't want to go in there hiding from having to do some work or something.

464
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,060
I'm going to sneak off into the Bucolic tree forest.

465
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,100
And you're up there in a tree house.

466
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,060
The next thing, a dog is right next to you, ready to snap at your snapper.

467
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,120
Well, actually, the deer hunters have had trouble with that.

468
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,340
Where they were trying to hunt deer and suddenly our dog would show up.

469
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,820
Which, it doesn't help, you know, lure deer.

470
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:09,880
But, so we had to keep, keep damn it, in when it was dinosaur hunting season and deer hunting season.

471
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,100
Oh man, yesterday I saw a deer try three times to jump over a barbed wire fence but fail.

472
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:26,660
And each time this poor little thing failed, she would slam herself into the upper part of the fence, chest first, and bounce back real hard.

473
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,140
You know.

474
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,840
It's like a big spring.

475
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,620
And this barbed wire.

476
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,400
Poor thing.

477
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,220
Yeah, so on the fourth try she finally kind of floated over like they're supposed to.

478
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,440
Oh no.

479
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,540
Yeah, I, like, I wasn't, I kind of surprised four of them.

480
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,900
And the little one wasn't real good at getting over the fence yet.

481
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Aw.

482
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,720
I'm sure she's got scars on her chest from that.

483
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,260
So this is the kind of things you see out here.

484
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,100
Oh.

485
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,520
I was just going to say if you were more of an opportunist, never mind.

486
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
I forgot my...

487
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,320
Well, I could shoot them and eat them.

488
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,700
Well, I was going to say you could sodomize them without them knowing that you were sodomizing them because they're so preoccupied with these...

489
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,120
Not funny.

490
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:11,920
Triggered.

491
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,540
Triggered.

492
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,660
I'm having a flashback.

493
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,600
Did you sodomize a dog named Trigger or something?

494
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,680
No, no, no.

495
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,920
I got accused of triggering people by talking about this.

496
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,200
Or allowing somebody...

497
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:34,880
I think I was talking about sodomizing in a long, weird allegory about fear of camping and animals.

498
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,820
And I got...

499
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
You know how people get in trouble now?

500
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,460
Real bad trouble for things they did 20 years ago.

501
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,880
Or said in their high school yearbook or something.

502
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:56,340
And now they're 60 years old and they can't be king because they said pink boy in their yearbook.

503
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah.

504
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


505
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


506
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


507
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


508
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


509
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


510
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


511
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


512
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


513
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


514
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,320


515
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,660
In 1970 or whatever.

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
Or they put a powder puff on their head.

517
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,740
Yeah.

518
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:09,660
Well, I've got a long trail of things like that that guarantee that I can never be respectable or on the Supreme Court.

519
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,760
Well, I could be on a Republican Supreme Court.

520
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,560
Ironic.

521
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,860
It's ironic, isn't it?

522
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,580
It's weird.

523
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,740
It's all my sins are the kind that they reward you for now.

524
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,460
Unfortunately, it's true enough to make me weep like a baby.

525
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,080
Yeah.

526
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,280
Me too.

527
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,040
No.

528
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,440
It's true.

529
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,900
We were guilty of being un-PC, but we didn't know how...

530
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,420
At the time, it just seemed really, really funny.

531
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,780
And the funny thing is, it still does.

532
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,500
Especially when a woman recites it.

533
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,580
The evil story of the ripe bear.

534
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,200
Actually, there's a bunch of ripe bears.

535
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,620
But it wasn't the bears.

536
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,060
Oh, if only it had ended after seven years with the bears.

537
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,320
Oh, if only it had ended then.

538
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,860
But it went on.

539
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,840
And on.

540
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,680
And on.

541
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,800
For seven years.

542
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
When Dr. Leguim first...

543
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,960
For seven years?

544
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,980
When Dr. Leguim first told that story, which I can't recite or play on the radio, not broadcast radio.

545
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,620
It's been on the X-rated versions.

546
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,460
But when he did that, everybody who heard it was crying.

547
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,900
They were laughing so hard.

548
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
Because it just...

549
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,860
It got worse and worse and worse.

550
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,140
And you just couldn't believe how imaginatively worse it got.

551
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,860
Kind of like the aristocrats.

552
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,840
Yeah, sort of.

553
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,880
And...

554
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,680
Yeah.

555
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,700
Then suddenly, like ten years later, ten years after, suddenly it was this terrible, terrible thing to even refer to.

556
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,160
I think it was because of this one girl.

557
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,340
I guess she, you know, had trouble with something.

558
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,620
Something.

559
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,840
And so that...

560
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,720
Well, she wasn't really a girl, was she?

561
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,380
Or a boy or a neutral gender.

562
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,420
Oh, it doesn't matter.

563
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,100
X-day.

564
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,300
Forced sex?

565
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Whatever they call it.

566
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,360
You can't even tell.

567
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,260
No, it was just that this person was triggered by it.

568
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,140
And it spread like a disease through the community.

569
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,000
Well...

570
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,440
The hate.

571
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
What's trigger have to do with...

572
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,680
I was wondering if you guys are using secret spy language.

573
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,960
Like, you know, you trigger and somebody goes out and shoots a cook or something like that.

574
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,020
No, no, no.

575
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,600
It refers to Roy Rogers.

576
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:26,840
Roy Rogers.

577
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:26,840


578
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:26,840


579
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,440
Horse trigger.

580
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,680
When you trigger someone, that means you ride them off into the sunset and make them rear up.

581
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:41,000
And it's abusive because of the animals that wouldn't do that, you know, willingly.

582
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,880
It's animal abuse because you've trained the horse to do what you want and you ride on it.

583
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,320
So, you know, there's a lot of unfair things out there in the world.

584
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,400
Speaking of which, I saw strangers looking at Gus.

585
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,800
Our one last remaining ancient horse.

586
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,620
Strangers?

587
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,580
The family horse.

588
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,560
You know, the entire clan's one horse.

589
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,420
Strangers?

590
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,100
Yeah, young, clean-cut looking strangers.

591
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,540
Well, they weren't totally strangers, Gus.

592
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,320
So, I'm leaving my brother's drive...

593
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Going into my brother's driveway earlier.

594
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,380
It was a blue pickup truck.

595
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,040
Maybe they wanted to buy some goats or some Emerald City jam.

596
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:25,860
Horse meat.

597
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,260
You know.

598
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,360
Horse meat.

599
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:27,880
I don't know.

600
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,540
Oh, yeah.

601
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,580
They're going to take old Gus and cut his feet off, turn him into glue.

602
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,320
Then they'll turn his meat into horse meat.

603
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,560
Then they'll put him to sleep.

604
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,240
They better not.

605
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,020
Gus is a handsome, nice old guy.

606
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,260
Anyway, yeah.

607
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:51,260
We could go on and on about the bucolicness of this completely opposite world that we now live in.

608
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,420
If anybody really needs a house in the city...

609
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,520
Well, it's not downtown or anything, but it's not far from downtown.

610
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,880
In Cleveland Heights, real nice neighborhood.

611
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:09,700
It's a high-class, upper-middle-class street right next to our street.

612
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,160
That's close, you know.

613
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,660
I can't say ours is an upper-middle-class street or house, but it is a very good house.

614
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,600
And it's historic.

615
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,840
Buddy jumped out of a third-story window and survived by landing on a second-story roof.

616
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,220
But.

617
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,960
And the church at Subgenius was in there for nigh on to 20 years.

618
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,320
It is a gorgeous piece of architecture.

619
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
And it's a nice old house.

620
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,360
Now that we're out of it, and it's been completely recovered and repainted on every surface,

621
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,580
all the doors finally work.

622
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,100
The last day we were in there, all the doors and windows worked beautifully.

623
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,580
And everything was clean and spotless.

624
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,760
The last, we had one day in which it looked like our first day.

625
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,160
Yes.

626
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,060
A big, empty...

627
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,700
A big, empty, inviting shell.

628
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,780
With nearby amenities, such as a shopping center with a post office, bank, city hall,

629
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,580
a police station, fire station.

630
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,580
So, it's a little noisy up on the corner, but not where we are.

631
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,880
And, walking distance.

632
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,160
It's walking distance.

633
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,480
Indeed.

634
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,100
That's what it is.

635
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
It's walking distance.

636
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,940
You can just walk.

637
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,360
You can just get out and just walk.

638
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,040
And nobody will beat you up when you walk on this street.

639
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,280
It's never happened to us.

640
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,540
It's a little sample of suburban living right in the middle of the town area.

641
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,360
Yeah.

642
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
You even have to worry about mowing lawns and stuff like that.

643
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,300
Well, yeah, you do.

644
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,940
Oh, you sure do mow your lawn.

645
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,340
Oh, the city will come and...

646
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,160
And they're very strict.

647
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,440
The very city of Cleveland Heights is very, very strict.

648
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah, they are.

649
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,880
They won't let you have your car up on blocks.

650
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,200
They wouldn't let us, anyway.

651
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,020
They wouldn't let us do all kinds of po-buckery things.

652
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,020
They'd force you to act like you got clout.

653
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,020


654
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,020


655
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,020


656
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,360
You'd get a glass.

657
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,700
Or they'd fine you.

658
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,440
You know, it's one of those.

659
00:29:60,000 --> 00:30:01,760
You can't paint your house purple.

660
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,160
I mean, I guess you can, but...

661
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,220
I think the city...

662
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,400
The neighbors wouldn't get after you.

663
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,380
The neighbors would go, yeah, right on, go for it.

664
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,660
But the city would go, oh, we won't have purple houses here.

665
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,060
Yep.

666
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,120
I painted with Charlie in Cleveland Heights, and boy, sometimes it reached the point of

667
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,780
silliness, especially when they started going back and forth and Charlie got real angry

668
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,240
and stuff.

669
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh, God, I bet.

670
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,460
First thing was that he had to present a retaining method or a way of getting chips

671
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,220
of paint down off, other than just taking the usual way that everybody else does in

672
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,100
every other city in the planet.

673
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,500
You just take a broom and sweep the stuff off there as hard as it'll go.

674
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,560
And it'll go pretty hard if you want it to.

675
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,760
Oh, you hit it hard enough, it'll vaporize and just go into orbit.

676
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,420
And produce a new superhero in its wake.

677
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,700
But usually you don't do it that hard, because Cleveland Heights won't let you do it.

678
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,500
It's against the rules.

679
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,660
You can't get a permit.

680
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:06,180
They'll send somebody out to complain with a clipboard and act very seriously.

681
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,220
And he's talking, you know, this is forbidden in the city of Cleveland Heights.

682
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:09,960
Right.

683
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,300
Everything is, just about.

684
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,460
Except cohabitation.

685
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,620
Shaving.

686
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,480
Oh, he's just cohabitating all over the place.

687
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,060
I can tell.

688
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,120
Abdomen and leg shaving is forbidden.

689
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,820
Or...

690
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,480
Never mind.

691
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm sorry.

692
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,440
So, anyway, how long have we been...

693
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,420
Dave, are you shaving your knees again?

694
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,460
Yes, I am.

695
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,520
I don't know how you do that.

696
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,820
Really?

697
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,840
I don't know why you do that, really.

698
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,360
It's silly.

699
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,300
No one cares about your hairy knees.

700
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,840
I can rub secret emollients into my skin and fabricate new worlds to dream upon.

701
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,980
It's mine, don't you see?

702
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,560
It's mine.

703
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,360
Mine.

704
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,800
It's mine.

705
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


706
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


707
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


708
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


709
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


710
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


711
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


712
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


713
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


714
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


715
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


716
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


717
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:51,800


718
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,500
It's mine.

719
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,500


720
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,500


721
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:52,840
Your knee?

722
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,520
My knee.

723
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,540
What about my knee?

724
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,520
I don't have enough my knee.

725
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,320
That is tiny.

726
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,540
I want more my knee for my knee.

727
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,900
My knee hurts.

728
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,660
The only thing that will make me feel better is money.

729
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,860
So help up, knee.

730
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,080
This is a good time to help the Church of the Subgenius and poor old Reverend Stang with

731
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,780
my knee.

732
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,380
Yeah, my knee hurts.

733
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
So you can come and rub my knee.

734
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,740
I don't have to shave it.

735
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,120
There's no hairs on my legs.

736
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm so old.

737
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,640
It just all fell off.

738
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,440
Bald.

739
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,960
It's sad when you don't have any.

740
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,240
I saw a person with a lot of hairy legs on their knees,

741
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,040
and I was just amazed at how little I had over the last past century.

742
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,780
Spider-knee people.

743
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,700
Spider-knee people.

744
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,340
Spider-knee people.

745
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, speaking of spider-knee people,

746
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm going to take Princess Wee to the Texas State Fair.

747
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,220
She's never been, and I haven't been there in 15, 20 years.

748
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm very excited.

749
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm going to show her the mutant livestock and the giant mutant po-buckers

750
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,640
and the giant mutant American po-buckers and just all kinds.

751
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,620
And giant mutant crafts, arts and crafts and stuff.

752
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,320
I can't go on any of the rides.

753
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,840
But the arachnid show is becoming famous across the United States.

754
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,660
They're reporting it on national news.

755
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,660
No, they outlawed them.

756
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,560
I mean, even in Texas.

757
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,780
You can't have arachnid shows.

758
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,660
You can't show real normal mutants for money.

759
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, they're just introducing it in the rest of the country or something

760
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,200
because they just heard a little program about arachnid,

761
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,020
and there'll be all kinds there, and they'll all be alive,

762
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,540
and they'll be, you know, stuff like that there.

763
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,320
I think it might be Pennsylvania.

764
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,460
No, I think you're talking about our shed out back.

765
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,480
That's pretty.

766
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,640
Well, I don't know.

767
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,620
That describes the shed out back.

768
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,600
You smoke some boneless meat out there, too.

769
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:00,160
You smoke lots of spider if you want, if you're mean, if you're that mean.

770
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah, I'll smoke anything, man.

771
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,640
Most of them are harmless.

772
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm sorry, Martin.

773
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,060
No, I mean, if they're not venomous, you can smoke them.

774
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,240
Yep, that's what I heard.

775
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,260
I mean, you've got to dry them out first.

776
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,900
Kind of crumble them up a bit.

777
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,460
What if you were a pig, and you were pretending to be a cowboy,

778
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,760
and you're sitting around the campfire at the night wearing a pair of sunglasses,

779
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,700
and everybody's kind of looking at you funny like,

780
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,300
is that a real cowboy person, or is that a pig with sunglasses?

781
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,460
What if?

782
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,040
That is, you know, what if?

783
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,340
Dave should have a TV show called What If?

784
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,860
There's a Todd Rundgren song devoted to that subject, exactly.

785
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,320
What if?

786
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,000
Does he have a pig wearing sunglasses fooling a bunch of cowboys?

787
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,680
No, I don't think so.

788
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,320
No.

789
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,800
I believe so.

790
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,420
That's the kind of thing you'd see on a silly cartoon show.

791
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,300
Meridian Leeward.

792
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,980
Yes, that's the song.

793
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,780
Meridian Leeward.

794
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,740
Oh, I love that nautical terminology.

795
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,640
It makes me feel so feisty and American, you know.

796
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,240
I want to say, carve it down, lads.

797
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,260
Carve it down.

798
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,220
Or something, you know.

799
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,500
Yes.

800
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,820
That's not Portuguese either, by the way.

801
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,460
That's not Portuguese.

802
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,620
Have you seen the white whale?

803
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,740
Have you been the white whale?

804
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
Ah, boy.

805
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,040
You could certainly do a lot of whale jumping nowadays, you know what I mean?

806
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,780
Which way the world is going politically, I might add.

807
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,120
Well, the way the world's going physically, partly as a result of the politically part,

808
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,300
and the way everything's going to hell in a handbasket, a flaming handbasket.

809
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,320
Of course, if you're going to hell in a flaming handbasket, you kind of fit in.

810
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,860
That's, you know, natural.

811
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,180
Right.

812
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:04,160
Perfectly natural, you know, but with methane literally boiling out of the Arctic, you know,

813
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,640
I think it's all going to happen a little bit quicker than even I was thinking.

814
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,660
Because I was thinking, I'm not going to live to see any of the really bad stuff.

815
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,980
Now I'm thinking, good Lord, you know, I might very well live to see some of the really bad stuff.

816
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,020
But not for long.

817
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,180
Because when it's really bad, it'll just kill everybody.

818
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,160
Where are all the birds hiding?

819
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,520
Because I just heard a thing saying that 30% or one-third of the birds in, I think it was Ohio,

820
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,700
I hope it's not the whole United States.

821
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,740
No, it's the whole United States.

822
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,380
They're endangered.

823
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:42,580
They're saying, you know, it could be down to one-third as many types of birds 50 years from now.

824
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,820
I can't believe it.

825
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,960
If the temperature, average temperature goes up.

826
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:50,020
If it goes down or up, you know, up more than 1.5 degrees.

827
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,000
That sounds a little hinky to me.

828
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,160
I think birds are a bit more adaptable than that.

829
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:02,320
But when you combine the warming, which, of course, doesn't make everything warmer.

830
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,000
It makes some places colder because it changes the Gulf Stream.

831
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:06,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

832
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:14,460
And, you know, the acid rain and buildup of gases in the atmosphere.

833
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,260
And the...

834
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,280
Loss of habitat due to development.

835
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:18,980
Well, yeah.

836
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,900
All the forests.

837
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,400
That's a big one right there.

838
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,920
The forests and everything burning up.

839
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,500
And the permafrost melting, which is going to not only release enough methane to poison the ocean,

840
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:40,280
and some of the air, but it also can release frozen woolly mammoths, giant mutant woolly rhinoceroses,

841
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,940
giant mutant sloths, giant mutant cave subgeniuses,

842
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,920
giant mutant cave bigfoots.

843
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,640
I mean, we're...

844
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,900
No, no.

845
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:00,160
In the permafrost, just in the dirt in the Arctic and the Antarctic, both.

846
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,700
I know.

847
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,520
Oh, that's funny you should mention that.

848
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,920
We've...

849
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,260
saw so many woolly bears while we were packing yes that young man this young man was that we

850
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:29,960
hired to help us pack and be my spine uh he was fascinated by the bears and he found oh i'd say a

851
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,780
dozen he couldn't believe one day yes what did those turn into where you could be stepped on

852
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,820
and i haven't seen hardly any what what kind of what did those turn into like werewolves or

853
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,800
wasps or octopuses what i mean they're caterpillars right i think that's the entire

854
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,500
that's the entire limits of their existence that's a wait a minute no they got to turn

855
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:02,680
into some some winged thing or else it's just a little thing oh don't look it up then i don't

856
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:10,740
care you don't want to believe me i'm sorry i can't i don't have one of those devices well

857
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,580
well all of our

858
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:21,440
all got our own devices the so-called woolly bear caterpillar becomes the isabella tiger moth

859
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:30,920
we haven't noticed any shortage here uh of grasshoppers oh goodness scorpions brown

860
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,740
reckless spiders tarantulas the cactus cactus is perfectly most of the cactus are healthy

861
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,620
baby dragons and reproducing buzzards

862
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,600
yeah coyotes

863
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,340
and and zombie deer of course we get the you've heard about the zombie deer right

864
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,320
oh yeah they get hit like numerous times they keep on trying to cross the road

865
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:03,620
yeah yeah they drool and they can't be stopped yeah it's gross really gross it's not funny

866
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,340
either because it's it's actually spreading quite fast why i say i saw a deer throwing

867
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,800
itself into a barbed wire fence over and over again

868
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,180
poor yesterday morning is that yesterday it was yesterday i spent all day today carving trails

869
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:26,980
they're wonderful restoring trails in the grass with my gas powered trimmer that i had to repair

870
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:34,900
eight times and then he took the dogs and the princess for a walk it was wonderful i showed

871
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:41,080
off all the new trails they're same old trails but see if you don't have the trails the in the

872
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,540
woods the the

873
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:50,720
branches reach out and scratch you and snare you and snare your hair except for you dave and uh and

874
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,740
they in the grass the the snakes hide and horny toads hump on you and uh the birds that get all

875
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:06,100
over your bare legs and your shorts and chiggers and red ants and blue ants oh the actually we

876
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,860
you know we don't have the chiggers now you miss the chiggers

877
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,660
princess

886
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,360
happened to my background bucolic music stopped hours ago probably so i don't know anything

887
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:12,220
i haven't heard a murmuring in in the last half an hour i hear a kind of a borborygmus

888
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,520
sound that comes from either your phone or my phone or something

889
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:29,080
i'm not hearing any phone noise i could hear you know because i'm actually holding the phone to my

890
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,620
mouth sometimes it'll go up sometimes it'll go down and you can hear it real good oh yeah i know

891
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:42,000
i'm acutely aware of that it sounds it doesn't sound cute okay okay come on

892
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:49,580
but there's no i'm struggling with the this remote control on a dvd player just trying to play a cd

893
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,940
i'm not trying to get pictures out of it boy i hear the strangest

894
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,900
sounds in the background weird rumbling perhaps perhaps you're having those

895
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:11,080
the ghost in the machine you hear kind of a fluttering uh-huh that's the fart so that's

896
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,700
the fart effect

897
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,540
oh is that something that's a feature of your phone no it's a feature of your phone you haven't

898
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,420
even looked at it yet well they did update two days ago it updated itself it's like they

899
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,460
reproduced themselves you know it sheds its skin and it's suddenly a bunch of stuff looked

900
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,520
different and i didn't know how to do things anymore i had to learn new ways i hate that

901
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,000
i hate that too that's why i had to remind you sternly please please be aware of everything

902
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,800
at all times but but dave what's your opinion on that i don't know i don't know i don't know

903
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,720
what should what should the kids and the listeners and us do about all the problems that we're that

904
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:54,340
are facing not only american society and canadian and english-speaking societies but just about

905
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:01,740
everywhere what do we do about these these horrendous challenges do we post on facebook

906
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:10,300
and show how virtuous we are yeah that would be a good one that's i think that's what everybody's

907
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,780
doing

908
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,540
fights with the other whoever they're getting you know people who aren't enough like them

909
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:24,120
secretly mean sounding names like well you're a busy grodner you know he knows what a busy

910
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:30,180
i've gotten into real bad i've been gotten in trouble for just not just for not hating somebody

911
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:36,580
as much as i was supposed to be hating him according to somebody else who then started

912
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,260
hating me because i didn't hate their hatred i mean their their other hated person enough

913
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:42,940
to be a bad person and we're going to have to get started with the latest news

914
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:42,940


915
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,440
yeah well you know what it's getting it's very confusing especially with the last five statutes

916
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:52,060
the ones that they carved most recently out of you know it's like at my age

917
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:59,260
i don't look at life as a bunch of other people's faults that i have to correct

918
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:12,800
i look at all of that as something that's put here for my entertainment well you are right in assuming that i mean sometimes it doesn't work out and then everything collapses that's well yeah when i had that pinched

919
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:12,800


920
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:19,540
nerve a month ago, I wasn't that philosophical at all. I wanted to die. I thought I was going

921
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:25,660
to die within a year. I thought, okay, that's it. My back is just falling apart. I've got

922
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,020
osteonecrosis or something, and I've got cracks all up and down my spine. Every time I pick up

923
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:37,660
a cup of coffee, I'm going to get a new broken spine bone, a crack in my spine. It's going to

924
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:48,080
be incredibly painful. There's reason for me to be that paranoid due to some family history.

925
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:56,480
As it turns out, I just have arthritis, big deal. I just moved a house. But I spent the last three

926
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:04,260
days trimming high grass, and I think it's good for my old back. Exercise is good. It hurts like

927
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,120
hell as soon as I stop.

928
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:15,180
I wake up in the morning, it's insanely painful. But as long as I keep forcing myself to move

929
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,540
constantly and work and slave and toilet things, then my back doesn't hurt.

930
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,920
Goodness, the work that you got done is amazing. I really enjoyed walking.

931
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:34,340
I don't have any choice. I'm like that guy in that movie Crank. If I stop stimulating myself

932
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,640
insanely and expressively, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die.

933
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:37,640


934
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,700
I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to

935
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:39,700


936
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,660
I'll die. My heart will explode. Those are cool movies, by the way, Dave. There's Crank and Crank

937
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:55,140
2. That's the theme. This guy has to keep doing crazy stuff, or he'll die. They're so much fun.

938
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:55,940
They are fun.

939
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:56,580
Yeah.

940
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,880
Even I enjoy it.

941
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,040
Yeah, the second one, I'll go ahead and do a spoiler. The second one ends with the guy

942
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,240
walking straight towards the camera, shooting the finger at the audience,

943
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,180
while his face is on fire.

944
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,320
That's the last shot of the movie

945
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,440
before it cuts to the loud rock music.

946
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,280
Walking towards the camera,

947
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,780
shooting the finger at the audience

948
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,980
with his face in flames.

949
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,500
He's got a huge grin.

950
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,960
Now, is it that weird green fire

951
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,440
that the guys like Sturmey and Wacky

952
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,480
from Pittsburgh use?

953
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
You know what I mean?

954
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,020
The garden variety sideshow

955
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,800
through the Sturmey-Hedrickson breach?

956
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,620
Oh, you can still get burned real bad with that.

957
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,020
No, this is painted on computer fire.

958
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,820
You know, they're not going to burn up

959
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,460
what's-his-name, the actor.

960
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,140
You know, the famous, super famous actor.

961
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,400
What's his name?

962
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,920
Jason something, I think.

963
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,120
Argonauts, right?

964
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,620
Jason Argo.

965
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,680
I don't know, one of those Jason guys.

966
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,960
Not Jason Momo.

967
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:01,820
He's a Brit.

968
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,720
Not the long-haired biker Aquaman guy.

969
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,100
He's a Brit.

970
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:05,720
Yeah.

971
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,260
British action guy.

972
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,480
Whatever.

973
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,400
Anyway, yeah, that's a sign of Alzheimer's

974
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,860
when you can't remember the names of popular actors.

975
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,540
However, it's a sign of health

976
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,980
when you can look him up on IMDAB real fast

977
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,700
and go, oh, yeah, that guy.

978
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,860
What's his name?

979
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,100
Yeah, but it might breed a whole breed of compatriots

980
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,100
who think that you can't access anything

981
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,860
if you don't have a device around.

982
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,560
You can't.

983
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,640
What are you going to do?

984
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,400
Go to a payphone?

985
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,620
Read a newspaper?

986
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,080
Can't access a movie without electronic devices.

987
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,820
I did.

988
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,360
That's why my back was broken.

989
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,220
I carried this damn T-Act reel-to-reel four-track

990
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,260
all the way from Texas to Ohio and back again.

991
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,280
And with a few side trips in Little Rock

992
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,680
to record Doctors for Bob.

993
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,840
It's a true story.

994
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:04,440
Mm-hmm.

995
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,400
At New Year's.

996
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,540
Horrible night.

997
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,820
My father-in-law died at the same moment.

998
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,780
Anyway, that was a different father-in-law.

999
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:15,940
Yeah.

1000
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,920
Yeah, I have a lot of old analog equipment

1001
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,220
and I don't know why I'm keeping it exactly.

1002
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,380
And I've got all the analog media.

1003
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,700
That's why I had to build a shed,

1004
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,900
insulate it, and put two air conditioners in it

1005
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,700
to keep all the analog media.

1006
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,580
Mostly reel-to-reel.

1007
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,340
VHS and cassettes.

1008
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,300
Some Betamax.

1009
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,400
Some 35mm film.

1010
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,300
Quite a bit of 8mm film.

1011
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,160
Mimeographs.

1012
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,480
Ditto reproduced documents.

1013
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,740
I just heard somebody refer to a...

1014
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,420
Stone tablets.

1015
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,920
CD player.

1016
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,360
You know, bark.

1017
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,300
Papyrus.

1018
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,860
We've got papyrus.

1019
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,720
We've got movies animated on handmade...

1020
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,880
Made papyrus by prehistoric Indians.

1021
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,320
Little movies.

1022
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,520
They were like pictographs.

1023
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,160
Simple animations.

1024
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,940
You'd have to blink while the medicine man

1025
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,660
pulled the pictures haltingly down.

1026
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,400
Only they went up.

1027
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,820
Unlike movie film which goes downwards.

1028
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,900
They went up.

1029
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,360
Is it like a scrabble board where you twirl with your thumb

1030
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,660
and it shows a little girl taking a ride in a vomit train?

1031
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,040
Or a little boil?

1032
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,480
Yeah.

1033
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,660
It doesn't matter, Dave.

1034
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,740
We shouldn't have to even think about that kind of gendery stuff.

1035
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,780
That's sick.

1036
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,880
To even use the word gender is kind of twisted.

1037
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,620
There must be some new word that doesn't offend people.

1038
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,280
Just kind of gives me the creeps just saying the word gender.

1039
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah, if you say it enough...

1040
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,180
You get in trouble.

1041
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,340
I'm not saying it's a bad word.

1042
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,620
It's serious trouble if you make a slightest mistake.

1043
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,880
With some people.

1044
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,760
Some people.

1045
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:11,860
What do you mean why?

1046
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,180
Subgeniuses respect all five sexes.

1047
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,520
But there are only five.

1048
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,320
And if anyone invents a sixth one, they must die.

1049
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,300
No, I'm just kidding.

1050
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,780
That's just a funny joke.

1051
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,080
It's a take off on fascism.

1052
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,380
It's supposed to...

1053
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,920
See, when you laugh at the enemy,

1054
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,100
you deflate them in the eyes of others and themselves.

1055
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,640
So satire is a powerful tool against the man.

1056
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,200
So when you act like a jerk,

1057
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,940
you're really making fun of the jerk, so it's okay.

1058
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,460
As Bob said,

1059
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,240
but we're only offending idiots.

1060
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,760
He was right, too.

1061
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:57,720
What's wrong?

1062
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,060
We're only offending idiots.

1063
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,740
I don't think anything truer has ever been said other than,

1064
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,180
we're only offending idiots.

1065
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,160
Well, at the same time, though,

1066
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,940
I must quote Dr. Argus Fox.

1067
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,840
He said the truest thing,

1068
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,760
it just sums up the human condition,

1069
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:15,960
for me, anyway.

1070
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,380
He said, he just blurted out one day,

1071
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,720
I'm not a rebel, I'm just an idiot.

1072
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,640
He said it with such vehemence.

1073
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,720
And I felt like he was speaking for me.

1074
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,940
I'm not really a rebel, I'm just an idiot.

1075
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,720
Okay, well...

1076
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,280
Well, it's kind of true.

1077
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:35,720
It's going around.

1078
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,900
You know, really, if we truly look in the mirror,

1079
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,120
if we, you know,

1080
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,760
if we see not just what people say to our face,

1081
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,760
but behind our back,

1082
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,620
we're not really rebels, we're just idiots.

1083
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,380
Although we prefer the term subgenius.

1084
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,140
That's a much more polite, you know,

1085
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,780
idiot, the I-word.

1086
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,040
That's kind of offensive.

1087
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,360
Kind of triggers me.

1088
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:04,700
When I was a kid, being called that by my father repeatedly.

1089
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,380
Uh-huh.

1090
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,920
Well, and as a 30-year-old, and as a 60-year-old,

1091
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,420
being called the I-word by my subgenius father.

1092
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,340
What's the I-word again?

1093
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,120
Idiot.

1094
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,100
I don't like to say it, the I-word.

1095
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,180
For subgeniuses, that's a, it hurts, you know.

1096
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,300
It's from the day.

1097
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,160
It reminds us of when we were held down.

1098
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,360
Well, we still are.

1099
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,020
It reminds us that we're still held down.

1100
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:34,140
Subgenius is respectful.

1101
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,880
Idiot is put down.

1102
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,620
So anyway, I think we've done enough of an hour.

1103
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,860
You know, I'll have to do the credits later

1104
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:49,140
for if I play any music or whatever,

1105
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,440
because I don't know what's going to be.

1106
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,020
I just started the show.

1107
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,660
I know.

1108
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,540
I didn't, Tarzan's wasn't even set up

1109
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,120
when I sat down at this table.

1110
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,560
None of this stuff here was plugged in

1111
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,240
to where it's supposed to go, but it was ready.

1112
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,640
Just like at X Day.

1113
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,580
You know, it was like I'd gotten everything out,

1114
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,900
and I'd done everything but the final plug-in.

1115
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,360
So I even had the plugs near where they plug into.

1116
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,260
And I got it all going, and I panicked

1117
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:16,980
because it didn't work.

1118
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,320
And then I fixed the one thing that didn't work,

1119
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,220
and then it was okay.

1120
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,480
And then I thought, well, I'll call Dave

1121
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,400
and see if it works.

1122
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,820
And then we were doing show all of a sudden.

1123
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,960
And that was almost an hour ago.

1124
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,380
Yeah.

1125
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,860
Now there's a purring sound that sort of sounds like

1126
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,220
someone has a card in the room.

1127
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:33,220


1128
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,980
And it's in the wheel of the spokes of their bike.

1129
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:35,560
Yeah.

1130
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:36,840
Yeah.

1131
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,980
Well, I have that in my tree, in my tree fort,

1132
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,620
but my bike's in the basement.

1133
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,440
Oh, you know what I think it is, Princess Wee?

1134
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:44,720
No.

1135
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,200
It's at the back of my throat.

1136
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,700
There's that little fluttery thing.

1137
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,060
Uh-huh.

1138
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,020
It's just fluttering.

1139
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,720
You think that's it?

1140
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,260
It's coming through my mic.

1141
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,560
I see.

1142
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:54,920
Metallic shards.

1143
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,480
Oh, yeah.

1144
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,120
It got louder when you opened your mouth.

1145
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:57,380
Yeah.

1146
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,200
Well, aren't you a Labrador retriever and a half?

1147
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,200
What's your name?

1148
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:03,240
I'm a Labrador.

1149
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,220
Way to go, simpleton.

1150
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,680
You know, I think that's quite remarkable.

1151
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,760
The sun just came out again.

1152
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,780
I'm being blinded.

1153
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,360
But it looks great behind Princess Wee.

1154
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,540
It makes her hair glow.

1155
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,820
She's glowing like a space princess or a radioactive monster.

1156
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,260
And we do have a nuclear power plant out the window.

1157
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,820
I'm not actually looking at it from this window,

1158
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,260
but if I walked over the other window,

1159
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,280
I would be looking at the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant,

1160
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,660
two cooling towers.

1161
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,460
Twin towers.

1162
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:39,980
Yep.

1163
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,060
So we don't have to worry about losing power.

1164
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,640
I mean, we could still lose electrical power,

1165
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,900
but it'll always glow.

1166
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,100
Did you hear what they're doing in Ohio?

1167
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,200
What they're doing to make the taxpayers pay for keeping the nuclear power plants afloat

1168
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,560
because they're losing money?

1169
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,640
They're not producing enough power and enough revenue.

1170
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,700
And so they've, and guess who they, they decide to be the enemy,

1171
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,940
where it's like, if you, if you sign the petition against it,

1172
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,100
you're supporting the Chinese.

1173
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,340
I couldn't believe it.

1174
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,000
So you obviously haven't heard of it either yet.

1175
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,300
Yeah.

1176
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,440
Well, no.

1177
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,660
Well, I'm not getting Ohio news anymore because I fled.

1178
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:30,000
No, it was going on while you're, it's been going on for a year now.

1179
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,620
Kind of reached ahead when you were here, actually.

1180
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,960
It was a topic we could have discussed on previous shows even.

1181
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:42,880
But they're asking the Ohio taxpayers to take on the cost of...

1182
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,080
Yeah, to fix the, to, yeah, to pay for the mistakes of a bunch of rich guys.

1183
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,640
That's nothing new.

1184
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,280
Exactly, yes.

1185
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,200
Yeah, get everybody to pay for the mistakes of some rich guys.

1186
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,300
Yep.

1187
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,780
Yeah, funny how that works, isn't it?

1188
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:57,940
Yeah.

1189
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,900
Yeah, just not funny, ha ha.

1190
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,040
Well.

1191
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,300
Well.

1192
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,720
Well.

1193
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,440
Well, hell.

1194
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,340
Well, hell.

1195
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,460
Well, hey, hey, I know.

1196
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,160
What we need to do is get rich.

1197
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,080
So, friends, you should look at, oh no, I can't tell them that on the broadcast radio.

1198
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,120
Friends, you can look at subgenius.com on the internet.

1199
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:30,940
It's got interesting things to see, say, and do, and hear, including pretty much every,

1200
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,300
you can, you can hear every hour of Slack now, I think.

1201
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:41,760
David Bochner and Steve Siddick had access to the, my master cassette tapes, starting

1202
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,640
with hour of Slack number one from 1985, and they copied them all to MP3.

1203
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,800
The ones that, that Bochner hadn't already done in the 90s.

1204
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,500
So, basically, every one that we have a copy of is online.

1205
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,480
Wow.

1206
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,100
Yeah.

1207
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,220
That's an amazing project.

1208
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,480
There was some that I didn't do.

1209
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:06,300
There was a time when I was actually working far away, and Willa Dobbs, my employee, would

1210
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,940
do shows.

1211
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,260
But he mainly just played music.

1212
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:11,820
He didn't rant.

1213
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,460
And anyway, okay, that was, that was the olden days.

1214
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:16,820
I actually remember that now.

1215
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,260
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1216
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,360
So, so Dave, oh, yeah, Neighbor World, Dave's book.

1217
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,600
You can, you can, you can, you can find Dave's book, Neighbor World.

1218
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,560
It's spelled Neighbor World.

1219
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:36,700
Your auto spell will try to turn it into two words, but it is in fact one word.

1220
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,800
And it's got a picture by Dave on the front and a picture of Dave by Tori on the back.

1221
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,100
Mm-hmm.

1222
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,660
Or Apostasy Fenord, I should say.

1223
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,820
Fenord.

1224
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,320
Did the portrait of Dave.

1225
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,080
Yeah.

1226
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,200
Which we have in our room.

1227
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:53,700
That's nice.

1228
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,980
We had to take it down, in fact, to put your new file cabinet there.

1229
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,340
I know.

1230
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,540
So we've got to put it in a new place.

1231
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,380
We'll find a new place for it.

1232
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,900
A new place for the Dave face.

1233
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:03,860
Yes.

1234
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,460
Okay, Dave.

1235
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,540
It's exciting, at least exciting.

1236
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,500
Amen.

1237
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,540
I didn't mean to laugh at the Lithuanian there.

1238
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:15,980
I'm sorry.

1239
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,080
You were signing off or some way.

1240
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,060
Well, I was advertising your book Neighbor World.

1241
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,780
I remember that.

1242
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,960
And which is, you can learn about it.

1243
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:27,960


1244
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:27,960


1245
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,260
Do because I'll leave the link in the chat box.

1246
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1247
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1248
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1249
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1250
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:28,260


1251
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,800
Yeah, at subgenius.com.

1252
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:33,020
Yes and no remembering lonesome proceeds.

1253
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,000
No, remember no chin go fund me.

1254
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,540
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1255
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,080
Lonesome.

1256
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:47,860
It needs for friends and life and there is, ok.

1257
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,040
We're ending the broadcast show right now.

1258
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,420
Good bye everyone

1259
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:53,880
Jarrett wake up.

1260
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,840
because we're gonna talk about details on the internet version now.

1261
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,140
But you can't hear it.

1262
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,620
But you on the internet can.

1263
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,260
I can't beg for money on the radio like I did on Facebook the other day.

1264
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,340
And the sad thing is, Dave, I posted this little short.

1265
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,180
I was trying to be kind of easygoing about it.

1266
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,900
But I actually literally didn't have enough money in PayPal after this move and paying for two houses.

1267
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,140
I didn't have enough money for postage to mail the CDs right then.

1268
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,360
And I begged one person to buy one $40 thing.

1269
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:34,060
And only five people, no, seven people responded.

1270
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,040
So I cried like a baby.

1271
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:43,120
And then I got a flood of orders.

1272
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,460
Everybody was, all the bobbies that never sent a penny and been on Facebook subgenius pages for years.

1273
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,740
Finally, well, about 20 of them finally.

1274
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,800
Did what they'd been saying they were going to do for 10 years.

1275
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:57,780
Wow.

1276
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,120
Yeah.

1277
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,860
So it solved our problem for a month.

1278
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,480
We're subgenius rich again.

1279
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,320
That means we'll have to do this again in a month.

1280
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,660
Oh, God.

1281
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,040
Unless the house sells.

1282
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,940
Buy that house.

1283
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:11,980
No, I can't say that.

1284
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,320
Learn of that house.

1285
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,940
It's got a for sale sign in front of it.

1286
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,240
Email me.

1287
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,400
I'll tell you the realtor's name.

1288
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,040
That's the way it's done.

1289
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:23,880
Yes.

1290
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,540
Friends, there is a GoFundMe for Dave.

1291
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,260
And Dave really, really needs money.

1292
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:35,640
I was literally just trying to get $40 in my PayPal account.

1293
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,780
But I'm not in dire straits.

1294
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
I'm surrounded by family.

1295
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,940
And this house we're in is paid for.

1296
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,120
It's just the other one's not.

1297
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,840
But Dave needs help.

1298
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:53,540
And if any of you who helped us or didn't yet, help Dave instead.

1299
01:01:54,140 --> 01:02:00,380
And that GoFundMe link is on subgenius.com on the radio page.

1300
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,560
It says radio, HOS, Hour of Slack.

1301
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,780
Click on that.

1302
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:09,200
And there's the GoFundMe link for Dave to help Dave.

1303
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,160
There's also one for Reverend Susie the floozy that's been there forever.

1304
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,240
But Dave's is further near the top because it's newer.

1305
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,920
And I can guarantee you that I'll be very ungrateful just like I always am.

1306
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,540
Yeah.

1307
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:24,600
He helps out.

1308
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,920
Princess, did you talk to Dave about the band?

1309
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,420
I did not yet get to.

1310
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,980
I left a message.

1311
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,160
Bob Mosick wants to have an ESO reunion.

1312
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,240
At Starwood 40.

1313
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,240
That's next summer in July.

1314
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,640
He wants to have an ESO band reunion.

1315
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,200
I don't know who's going to play Chaz.

1316
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,120
I'm sure that Bob has someone in mind.

1317
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,780
But it would be Bob, Dave, and Michelle at least.

1318
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,280
Yes.

1319
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:00,540
And there'd have to be some keyboard.

1320
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,260
Maybe Ron Slade.

1321
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,240
Ron Slade, maybe.

1322
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,120
Maybe.

1323
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,020
He doesn't do that rocking kind of thing.

1324
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:13,720
He'll probably have Michelle's mate, Mark.

1325
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,380
I can't say his last name.

1326
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,260
Well, anyway.

1327
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,060
Very long and complicated.

1328
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,480
Friends, yeah, there's some exciting news for you.

1329
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:23,840
Yeah.

1330
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,120
Yeah.

1331
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:24,120


1332
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:24,340
Yes.

1333
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,580
An Einstein Secret Orchestra reunion.

1334
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:33,020
Well, minus Professor Chaz at Starwood.

1335
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,960
And Dave's book, Neighbor World.

1336
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,540
And Dave's begging.

1337
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:40,600
And, of course, our begging, too.

1338
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,100
We're all begging, Stan.

1339
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,060
We've got the alms bowl right in front of us.

1340
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,480
We're waiting for the next guy to give us a candle and a couple rupees, you know?

1341
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,340
Yeah.

1342
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,620
I was begging for Sterno a couple of years ago.

1343
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:54,680
Yeah.

1344
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,980
Because he was really, really sick.

1345
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,080
Yeah.

1346
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,580
I remember when he had holes in his body.

1347
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,060
Yeah.

1348
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,540
For real.

1349
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,260
Well, they took a...

1350
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,520
The exus came and took one of his...

1351
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:04,500
An entire kidney.

1352
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,240
Yes.

1353
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:06,640
Yeah.

1354
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:11,700
I gripe about my back hurting, but I haven't lost any big parts yet.

1355
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,220
So, anyway.

1356
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,220
Yeah, friends.

1357
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,140
Subgenius.com has everything.

1358
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,700
And for those of you who...

1359
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,600
Wait a minute.

1360
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,880
If you're not on the internet, then there's no way you're hearing this, so it's pointless

1361
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,740
to give the address.

1362
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,020
But I will anyway.

1363
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:24,340
Anyway.

1364
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:35,200
It's Subgenius at Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1365
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,140
Yeah.

1366
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,100
Box 807.

1367
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,160
That's a simple one.

1368
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,680
Glen Rose is two words.

1369
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,440
And it's a sleepy, weird little town.

1370
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,140
Kind of like Twin Peaks crossed with Northern Exposure, crossed with Gunsmoke.

1371
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,120
Gunsmoke.

1372
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:54,140


1373
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:59,560
Boy, that noise from my throat is getting louder and louder.

1374
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,000
It is.

1375
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:00,420
I should probably quit.

1376
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:06,140
What else were we supposed to advertise or sell or cheer somebody up?

1377
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,820
There's all kinds of terrible tragedies out there.

1378
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,340
Everybody's...

1379
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,580
That's one thing I learned when I was begging for money.

1380
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,440
This is the brokest anybody's been.

1381
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,260
Everybody is.

1382
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,700
People are really, really, really...

1383
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,400
What Bleepo said, it was something like this.

1384
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,940
Everybody's broker.

1385
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,640
They're doing better than I've ever seen them before.

1386
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,820
Not everybody.

1387
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,780
The rich, of course, are doing better than ever.

1388
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,420
But everybody else is right on the edge.

1389
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,600
So you're saying that our beloved president, a man of formidable value, is taken upon and

1390
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:46,400
treated upon to somehow rob the American people?

1391
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,500
Oh, I'm not blaming him.

1392
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:47,680
I'm not blaming him.

1393
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,620
He's just a symptom of the control of the...

1394
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,060
Mangled for air people.

1395
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,040
Basically, the education of America.

1396
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,840
The education of America by a bunch of rich fucks is what it amounts to.

1397
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:02,840
Rich fucks have dumbified America rather consciously, I think.

1398
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,540
I'm beginning to think that it was kind of a policy.

1399
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,360
They've dumbified Americans to the point where they're easier to control with simple, stupid

1400
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,340
slogans.

1401
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:17,900
Act like a dumb shit and they will treat you as an equal.

1402
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,400
And that's how you get along on the job, kids.

1403
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,080
Act like a dumb shit.

1404
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,020
Don't try to tell the boss.

1405
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,200
Don't try to tell the boss what he's doing wrong.

1406
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,980
That doesn't work.

1407
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,500
Even if you're right, it's the wrong thing to do.

1408
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,020
It's the way people are.

1409
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,700
When you become a boss, kid, you'll be the same way.

1410
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,640
That's the horror and that's what we mean by the conspiracy.

1411
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,200
One of a million things that we mean by the conspiracy.

1412
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,720
Including when the bus is late.

1413
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,960
As Onan put it.

1414
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,640
That's a really good description.

1415
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,000
We've got to get away from this fluttering noise.

1416
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:55,680
Listen to that.

1417
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,620
What's the fluttering noise?

1418
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,340
I'm not hearing on this end of the ear.

1419
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,180
Oh, it's fluttery.

1420
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,180
It's really fluttery.

1421
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,220
It sounds like a card in the spokes of your bicycle wheel.

1422
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,480
Here, I'm going to turn Dave down.

1423
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,380
Still there.

1424
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:08,900
Uh oh.

1425
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,040
It's not Dave.

1426
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:10,380
Nope.

1427
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,020
It's not Dave.

1428
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,860
I would say Tarzan has eaten-

1429
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,000
Okay, man.

1430
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,700
Okay, man.

1431
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,020
I'm glad we're back to doing shows again.

1432
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:23,720
Me too.

1433
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:23,960
You too.
