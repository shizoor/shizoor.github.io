00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello, all of you nice people. I thought maybe you'd like to see some...

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,320
Who could that be?

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,720
I'll go see that.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,920
Yes?

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,000
Who is this?

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,720
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,980
It's alive.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,840
Kill it.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,280
It has a head, arms, legs, a body.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,440
Legs.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,060
Something terrible is taking place inside that glass tank.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,720
That's true, but...

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh, I think that's true.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,140
Well, unfortunately, it's true.

15
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,180
Yes, Ted, it's true.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm afraid so.

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,260
I know it sounds fantastic, but that monster was a fantastic monster.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,520
Look how it crawls back and forth through the lab.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,680
Quick, it's coming this way.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,980
Some elementary organisms are like that.

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,140
Thanks to Pete Forkins for launching PSP.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,460
And now to Mr. Shakespeare.

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,600
And contrapedier.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Quest

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:12,680


26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,820
Are you sure?

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,420
Yes.

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,460
That's great to hear.

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,220
Look, best friend.

30
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:27,900
God bless you.

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,420
Come along around here.

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,960
Praise Bob.

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,720
Praise Bob.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,400
Praise Bob.

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:43,920


37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
Praise Bob.

38
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,080
And now Chief Bob with a special message.

39
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,040
But first, boys and girls, let's listen to this.

40
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,960
Five bells.

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's go.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,080
Let's go.

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,860
Presenting the true to life story of fire, fire.

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,160
Fires burning and fire burning and fire burning fire.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,700
Fire.

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,760
Oil cans next to the hot cinder box.

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,300
In a moment, you can help fire.

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,600
But first, boys and girls, let's listen to this message.

49
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,960
Hello, boys and girls.

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,480
I suppose a good many of you do your playing after school in dried leaves, rubbish, separately,

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,420
or a combination of them that always seem to be around town.

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,580
If you and your friends would make a possible fire menace, it would be a nicer place to play.

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,940
You just remember that.

54
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,660
Now, until we meet again next time, so long.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,180
Be sure to join us next time for another exciting episode of Fire Fighters.

56
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,020
Let's take another caller here.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,900
Hello, you're on the air.

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Yeah, I just wondered if everybody.

59
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,740
Else's hair was on fire.

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,620
If it was just me.

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,360
Is that Dave that just dragged himself in?

62
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,460
Yeah, I dragged myself in.

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,140
I caught my hair on fire a little while ago.

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm not saying I caught.

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,600
I think it could be spontaneous combustion.

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,400
Well, it could be either spontaneous combustion.

67
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,780
It could be, you know, like government ray guns and stuff like that.

68
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,640
It's your brain, dude.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,900
It's that sexy brain you have.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,300
Your brain is so hot.

71
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,740
It set your hair on fire.

72
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,600
Okay, then that could be number three.

73
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,680
And number four could be that I was reaching under barbecue and I hit my head.

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Ooh.

75
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,880
And put a.

76
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,100
Oh, you turned it on.

77
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,380
Ooh.

78
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
I don't know what I was doing, rustling around under there.

79
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,940
Maybe that didn't happen either.

80
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,740
Well, hopefully cooler heads will prevail.

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah.

82
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,420
Everything costing more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,360
Help, help, help, help.

84
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,600
The sky turned black over parts of Texas.

85
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,380
This is Bob.

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,500
The good news is the 100 sexiest women in the world.

87
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,480
Number one this year.

88
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,780
Hurricane Katrina.

89
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,720
It's incredible.

90
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,320
Katrina, get over here.

91
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
No synthetics.

92
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,580
Yes, yes.

93
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,220
No, no.

94
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,900
Yes, yes.

95
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,500
No, no.

96
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:25,520
My real social security number is 457-555-462-555-552-425-554-6666-5777-555-462-2645-555-774-555-854-8080.

97
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Mm-hmm.

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,340
Hillary is.

99
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
Something's wrong with her.

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,320
Mom, Hillary's a terrible person.

101
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:31,880
Probe.

102
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,460
President Bush.

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,220
The Democratic presidential candidates are increasing their president's entertainment tonight.

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Psychiatric disorders.

105
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,820
Berserk, you know, you know.

106
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,980
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

107
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:55,280
Yes, listening can make you berserk in this modern age, especially if you're listening to the hour of slack number 1,160.

108
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,560
That cut was by noralpref.com.

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,880
And before that and next, some radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

110
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,480
host Dr. Sinister, guests Rocknar, Pisces, yours truly and others.

111
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,420
And before that and later, Leemur, Fernanda Leemur's collages.

112
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:27,220
And there was a beatbox sort of song there called Ba Box, which is by The Large, whatever that is.

113
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,380
And if you listen longer, this show will continue to rape your very brain.

114
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:40,040
My brain has been made love to too many times by too many pipe-smoking salesmen.

115
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,380
Oh, okay.

116
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,440
And I bought every time. I fell for it. I bought it.

117
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,040
Stang's brain is easy.

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,320
Yes.

119
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,760
Yeah. Wasn't there a movie with that title?

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,060
Stang brains are easy?

121
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,900
Yeah.

122
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,020
They're not bad over easy, I've heard.

123
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,540
Hmm.

124
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,020
There was that one, you know.

125
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,420
Your brain is kind of angry?

126
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:08,440
You know that there was a Hannibal Lecter movie where Hannibal Lecter drugged a guy

127
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,380
and then cracked his skull open carefully and fed it in his brain while he was still alive.

128
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,600
That's based on the subgenius initiation.

129
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,020
Yeah.

130
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,900
I'll never forget that day.

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,580
Except for the brain is not eaten. It's just gently licked three times and then given the old middle finger pat.

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:39,020
Oh, sure. Nowadays. But back in the old days, they actually did take a straw and sup of the brain, the gray living human or subgenius brain.

133
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,460
If you can trephinate well enough, you can just get a straw in there and have a couple slurps and then the person goes resumes life normally.

134
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,580
Or at least.

135
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


136
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


137
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


138
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


139
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


140
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


141
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


142
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


143
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


144
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


145
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:47,580


146
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
However they lived before.

147
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,400
Well, we're talking about subgeniuses, so it's hard to tell the difference.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,580
Between what?

149
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,140
Well, between before and after the lobotomy.

150
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,720
You sound so scrumptious.

151
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,900
Right. You're not, you know, there's not that much more missing than was already missing after that operation.

152
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,520
Ah.

153
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,580
Have I been missing out on the person?

154
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm sorry, Pisces. I'm sorry. I guess you didn't get that invitation, huh?

155
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,960
No.

156
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,220
It was sent psychically.

157
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,760
We'll have to correct that oversight. I'm sure you'll get an invitation to the next brain orgy.

158
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,620
Oh, we don't want to leave anybody out.

159
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,980
It's like ordering an EF.

160
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,400
Well, we leave the brains out.

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,900
That's all. Until people have had their fill.

162
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,080
You can be rejected, but if you're aware, you will get an invitation usually.

163
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,360
Maybe you just didn't check your inbox.

164
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Maybe you've already been to one and that's why you don't remember.

165
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,240
Right.

166
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,360
That's my problem.

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,660
You're missing now.

168
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,940
I don't know how many times I've been the main course at one of those things.

169
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,880
Mm-hmm.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,740
My brain is so insatiable. I'm surprised.

171
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
And it may just be that, you know.

172
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
My brain just didn't think that the brain orgies were enough.

173
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,900
You know, maybe my brain just forgot about it because it wasn't fulfilling enough.

174
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,580
Maybe I just weren't.

175
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
I've never eaten brains, but then.

176
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,260
I've never been to that paradox that the apostate Jainer Hypercleits enunciated,

177
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,580
which is that you can't think about your own brain.

178
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Right.

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,600
But some will instruct you to do so.

180
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,100
You can't be clear of those people because they're trying to confuse you.

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,900
If you concentrate on your own brain too long, it will evaporate just like bad water.

182
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,600
I've never actually eaten brains, but one time a brain tried to eat me.

183
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,780
Oh, man.

184
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,520
You don't want to get into one of those things, especially an emergency room, trying to explain it.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,400
Yep.

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,140
My brain is eating me.

187
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,620
Okay, sir, sit down for a minute.

188
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
Somebody will see you shortly.

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,760
Yeah.

190
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,000
But my brain is eating me, you know.

191
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,180
No.

192
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,660
You got a problem, Jack?

193
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,680
Well, I'm just trying.

194
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm just.

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Start him, show him, and I keep being interrupted.

196
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
You want to.

197
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,640
Show him.

198
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,380
Show him, interrupt him.

199
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,280
Show him, Jesse him.

200
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,940
What?

201
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,140
You don't understand that Jesse.

202
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,920
Don't flip on me.

203
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm off him.

204
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,040
Jesse.

205
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,740
Not Jesse.

206
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Get Jesse away from the microphone.

207
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I don't want to talk to Jesse.

208
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,980
And tonight on Viewer's Playhouse, we have The Valley of Slug Women, four stars.

209
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,160
And there's a great synopsis, too.

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,180
It says, a story blazing from the pages of.

211
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,580
History.

212
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,360
Now Mammoth Pictures presents the event of the epoch, two million years in the making,

213
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,960
Hannah Banana in the Valley of Slug Women.

214
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,940
The Valley of Slug Women, the age long saga of Ooh La La, the tall, shapely, incredibly

215
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,540
attractive prehistoric woman whose civil rights and rights as a woman and right to be free

216
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,220
to be you and me are brutally suppressed by the sexist reactionary, hairy male chauvinist

217
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,900
macho tribe.

218
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,820
See Ooh La La leave the lowbrow Neanderthals far behind as she invents fire, the wheeled

219
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,080
language.

220
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,780
Printing movable type, the steam engine and the female response.

221
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,640
See the voluptuous Ooh La La as she must totally submit time after time to the brutal sexual

222
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,040
advances of Bruto.

223
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,660
Bruto and his band of slumbers.

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
Who plays Bruto?

225
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,380
In that version, I mean.

226
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,100
A lumpy, incredibly unattractive caveman.

227
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,980
And she doesn't enjoy it one bit.

228
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,220
She just gives in to her superiority and everything.

229
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,900
Now the most significant event of our time.

230
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,960
Don't miss out.

231
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,640
Get in line now to see the first in the Slug Women trilogy.

232
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,060
The Valley of Slug Women.

233
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,460
Slug Women from the fashionably trendy paperback novel by G.E.M.

234
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,840
Awful.

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,560
The Valley of Slug Women.

236
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,220
Looks like she's working on the pretty dress over there.

237
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,560
The Can of the Bear Slug Women.

238
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,380
And the last in the series, The Cave of the Bear Slug Women.

239
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,020
I mean, some kind of reproduction machine there.

240
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,040
The Valley of Slug Women.

241
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,340
He lived in the tunnels and only come out at night.

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,980
His mind was gone but...

243
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,100
Ooh.

244
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,340
Good.

245
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,860
Pa?

246
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,760
Mark?

247
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,760
Pa.

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Mark?

249
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,520
Mark?

250
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:15,720
Mark.

251
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,160
Mark?

252
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,560
Mark?

253
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,020
Mark?

254
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,660
Pa!

255
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,620
All right.

256
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,640
Hold it.

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,860
Mark, what are you doing in there?

258
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,920
But, Pa.

259
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,380
There was more gold than one man could use.

260
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,100
That's gold to me, Mark.

261
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,840
Real gold.

262
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,400
The gold was there.

263
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Right within reach.

264
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,000
We have gold?

265
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,960
I touched it.

266
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,300
That's gold, isn't it?

267
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,120
You're right, Pa.

268
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,220
We really are rich.

269
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,700
We're very rich.

270
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,140
You know something?

271
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,180
Huh?

272
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,120
Huh?

273
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,320
Huh?

274
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,440
Huh?

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,200
Huh?

276
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,460
Huh?

277
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Huh?

278
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,480
We're rich.

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,480


280
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,480


281
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,480


282
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:58,520
Pa!

283
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,640
Pa!

284
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,300
All right!

285
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,240
정방 대�손!

286
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,600
But I was a good old man.

287
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,040
Uh-huh.

288
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I loved that poor marital home, but stop.

289
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:08,820
I liked that.

290
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,820


291
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,820


292
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,140
né SyBACK的时候

293
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,200
Susytherenne tếm 훢 벙건

294
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,600
and why they were flat, they didn't have that sub-carrier wave that kind of gets you off now

295
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,540
to the new TV. And I understand that next year you'll have to buy the new TV set with the new

296
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,080
improved brain control waves, right? Yeah, that is correct from what I understand.

297
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,800
You will not be, unless you're watching an old VHS or a DVD, you will not be permitted

298
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,840
to watch television either unless you have the special equipment on your body.

299
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,240
This is the night of the Holy Hand. So there's been all this talk in science. Let's talk science

300
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,140
for a minute. Well, can I ask you one question? Kind of a scientific question. What? Is it true

301
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,880
that you've heard that there is a dangerous sorcerer or a demon, perhaps it speaks from

302
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,760
Dick Cheney's navel? Really? I don't think that's scientific. Well, I don't think it is either. I

303
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,400
think it sounds like superstition. It couldn't possibly be true. It has nothing to do with it.

304
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,120
That sounds like an urban legend to me.

305
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Oh yeah, that's not science. That's pseudoscience. That's false science. Okay.

306
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,940
But now scientists are pretty convinced that, we're talking all about this lately.

307
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,640
The day of the Lord is at hand. They're pretty convinced that

308
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:33,700
we need to deprovincialize ourselves one step further. And we thought that this universe was

309
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,980
the only one. And it turns out that they're pretty convinced that there's just multitudes

310
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,660
of varied universes all existing. They're real convinced of that, huh?

311
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,180
Well, if dogs can have multitudes.

312
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,880
If we can have multiple orgasms, why can't we have multiple universes?

313
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,420
Mathematically.

314
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,960
Have you ever done the math with your slide rule and your calculator?

315
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,220
No, but I'm open to whatever. You know, people come up with just as valid as anything I come across

316
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,840
anywhere else.

317
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,940
Well, you know as well as I do that for all you know, all that math that they keep talking about.

318
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,860
It's not real math.

319
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,540
Might as well be the same as the totem pole that some medicine man tells everybody to worship.

320
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,840
Maybe, but it's the best bet we got.

321
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,860
Well, it's an invasion.

322
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,180
I mean, it's led us farther than we thought. Well, it's an invasion.

323
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,400
It's more like a meta.

324
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,920
We have probes going all over the universe.

325
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,520
What telephone poles have taken us to the moon, Larry?

326
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,380
I've been to the moon.

327
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,620
Not on a telephone pole.

328
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,540
Not the way you're talking about.

329
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,620
And I don't see no weird like eagles or thunderbirds on top of any ladder of numbers.

330
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,560
We're building a space station that got, you know, science, you know, we understand a lot about a lot of things, DNA.

331
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
Well, Hitler almost built a science station with the world of fire and ice.

332
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,120
So it's gotten us a lot farther than all the other, you know, things.

333
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,820
You've actually gotten things.

334
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,700
But Hitler built, almost built science with fire and ice.

335
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,400
Science is the most exacting religion.

336
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,960
They don't know what I'm talking about.

337
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,820
The theory of fire and ice.

338
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,000
Hitler's theory of science was totally whacked out and yet he produced all this weird stuff.

339
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,940
Well, he didn't produce anything.

340
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,940
Well, they had the best Nazi flying saucers in the whole hollow earth.

341
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,080
Well, they believed in all this anti-grav stuff, but, you know, it didn't have any...

342
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,220
And they came out with that movie, Ilse, She-Wolf of the SS.

343
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,400
Well, that was pure science right there.

344
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,480
They work for the CIA now.

345
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,360
Who does? Elsa?

346
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,140
Where are all those Nazi scientists, dude?

347
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,560
No, they're all in their 90s now. I think they're too old unless they're taking Islan.

348
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,500
Islan?

349
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,420
Islan.

350
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,720
Your island paradise on the moon.

351
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,720
Attended to your every wish by a Nazi scientist from the year Zip.

352
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,200
Here's Klaus Freudrich, an early inventor of the U2, preparing to offer you a jelly donut.

353
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,580
And here's you, spending over a log in a hot sun.

354
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,760
As Ilse, the She-Wolf of the SS, hands you her slide roll.

355
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,780
Freud will make you his jelly donut.

356
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,220
And he has to.

357
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,320
You hear a lot of talk about the ecumenical movement.

358
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,620
They say that we should get together and all be one big family.

359
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,700
Has it caught a sign that you who put a smile on my face?

360
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,980
I guess they want the devil to be the ecumenical man.

361
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,460
I'm not the devil.

362
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm the devil.

363
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,380
I'm the devil.

364
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm the devil.

365
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm the devil.

366
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,380
I am God.

367
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,360
You are God.

368
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,680
We are all God.

369
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,960
You're preposterous.

370
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,260
I am God.

371
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,460
You are God.

372
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,520
We are all God.

373
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Our God doesn't operate that way.

374
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
I am God.

375
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,380
You are God.

376
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,620
We are all God.

377
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,600
You're preposterous.

378
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
I am God.

379
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,200
You are God.

380
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,520
We are all God.

381
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,360
Ridiculous.

382
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
I am God.

383
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,160
You are God.

384
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
We are all God.

385
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,420
Nonsensical.

386
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
I am God.

387
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,140
You are God.

388
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,460
We are all God.

389
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,860
How can cultists go twisted for her?

390
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,960
The brain is supposed to be the brain.

391
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,100
But the Bible actually says.

392
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,280
Our churches today are full of a bunch of spiritual retards

393
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,420
with a bunch of brain flexors for preachers.

394
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,260
And they haven't figured out that this thing is for real.

395
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,300
And that we are in a war.

396
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
I push off.

397
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,980
I am God.

398
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,240
We are all God.

399
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,300
You are this everywhere.

400
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
We are all God.

401
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,540
We are free from danger.

402
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,980
I am God.

403
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,900
You are God.

404
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,120
We are all God.

405
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,500
We are free from danger.

406
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,000
I am God.

407
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,280
Nonsensical.

408
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,800
I am God.

409
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,960
Not again.

410
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,040
I am God.

411
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,920
You are God.

412
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,400
Inner balance.

413
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,100
We are all인.

414
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,040
We are all God.

415
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,920
We are free from danger.

416
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,660
And good things come from fear.

417
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
I am God.

418
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,940
May all beings everywhere be enabled.

419
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,060
We are all be enabled.

420
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,700
I am God.

421
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,800
You are lives in peace.

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,120
We are all God.

423
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:42,060
And unless we are free of fear,

424
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,920
and as far as I'm concerned,

425
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,400
are peaceful and happy,

426
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,980
I'd be glad when black people,

427
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,840
we cannot fully bring another to peace and happiness.

428
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,900
So just once more with feeling.

429
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,500
If I had my way,

430
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,860
I would be God Almighty and just wipe them off the planet.

431
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,580
Because as you know, as well as I do,

432
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
white people are damn to damn nation.

433
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,620
Don't see them and they can be saved.

434
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,780
Oh, shit.

435
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,040
I am God.

436
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,500
I am God.

437
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,320
Accursed.

438
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,340
You are God.

439
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,180
Anguished.

440
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,660
We are all God.

441
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Burned.

442
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,100
Condemned.

443
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,460
I am God.

444
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,000
Made.

445
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,520
All.

446
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,260
You are God.

447
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:22,820
Everywhere.

448
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,560
We are all God.

449
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,200
Free.

450
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,320
From danger.

451
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,440
Demon.

452
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,420
I am God.

453
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:28,820
Free.

454
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,300
You are God.

455
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,720
Destruction.

456
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,620
We are all God.

457
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:32,960
Scared.

458
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,020
Horrible.

459
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Tribulation.

460
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,380
I am God.

461
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:36,940
Made.

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,480
Fearful.

463
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,320
You are God.

464
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,340
Fiery.

465
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,660
We are all God.

466
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,240
Judgment.

467
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,820
Free.

468
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,140
From the darkness.

469
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,300
I am God.

470
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,900
Rude.

471
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,280
The first.

472
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,160
You are God.

473
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Perish.

474
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,420
Free.

475
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,500
We are all God.

476
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,160
Punished.

477
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,220
Wail.

478
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,960
Sweet.

479
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,580
Every.

480
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
There are lots of gods out there.

481
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:53,820
Every.

482
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,240
But the God of the Christian Bible is the only one.

483
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
Death is absolutely.

484
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,220
I am God.

485
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,300
Until the end.

486
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
You are God.

487
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,860
From the beginning.

488
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,440
We are all God.

489
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,140
And He was the only one.

490
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,260
He was the only one.

491
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,180
I am God.

492
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,800
And yet.

493
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,220
You are God.

494
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,020
Our people don't understand.

495
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,020


496
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,640
We are all God.

497
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
What we have learned.

498
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
I am God.

499
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,060
You are God.

500
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,600
We are.

501
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,540
We are all God.

502
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,000
We are able.

503
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,560
To carry on.

504
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
And unless we are free of fear.

505
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,040
Yes.

506
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,240
Yes.

507
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,300


508
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,040
Yes.

509
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,360
Yes.

510
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,380
Yes.

511
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:03,840
Yes.

512
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,500
And Bob, that was by

513
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,360
Negative Land from their album

514
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,660
Free, and before that we heard some old

515
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,060
ESO radio from WCSB

516
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,960
Cleveland with the host

517
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,860
the late Chaz Smith

518
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
who was early

519
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,060
and who was early

520
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,240
getting the Planet X.

521
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,660
That was one of the things that blew our minds.

522
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,760
And then the other thing that blew my mind was cocoa wheat.

523
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,100
Cocoa wheat?

524
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,540
Cocoa wheat is apparently another Michigan specialty,

525
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,440
which is basically chocolate cream with wheat.

526
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,140
No, they have cocoa wheat in Ohio as well.

527
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,960
My brain just could not process that concept.

528
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,840
I can't believe they don't have cocoa wheat in the D.C. area.

529
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,240
They don't.

530
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,000
I thought cocoa wheat were everywhere.

531
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,520
Well, that's okay.

532
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,840
I thought grits were everywhere when I was growing up.

533
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,340
Yeah, no kidding.

534
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
How about Weetabix?

535
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,660
Weetabix?

536
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,240
It's New Zealand cereal.

537
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,660
It's made out of those Witta bugs.

538
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,500
It's great, actually.

539
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,280
You know, like shredded wheat, that kind of thing.

540
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,500
Yeah, yeah.

541
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,940
In fact, it's being made in the U.S., but it's crappy.

542
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,620
That kind of cardboard-tasting stuff.

543
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,640
It's labeled organic, which usually means it's just not going to taste very good.

544
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,540
If it's in a box, you know, as opposed to vegetables,

545
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,040
but supposedly has some nutritional benefit.

546
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
That's not even the idea behind it.

547
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,940
Actually, all organic means is that it is not, you know, used to...

548
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,340
They don't use a synthetic fertilizer or bug spray or whatever.

549
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,560
It may not be good for you, but at least it doesn't have bug spray.

550
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,040
What about the good old days?

551
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,020
When you put organic on the label, that meant there were some damned organs in there, you know?

552
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,360
Yeah.

553
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,160
Not anymore.

554
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,740
Not anymore, no.

555
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,500
Especially sense organs are all taken out of the cereal.

556
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,800
It's a good selling point, though.

557
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,920
They say that organic may be better for the soil.

558
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,380
You know, when you just dump a whole bunch of nitrates into the soil to make your crops grow faster,

559
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,540
that eventually depletes the nutrients in the topsoil.

560
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,680
And, you know, they just use this really simple potassium, nitrogen, phosphorus fertilizer that is sorely lacking.

561
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,860
And the kinds of trace minerals you would expect to find in rich earth.

562
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,100
And, you know.

563
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,040
And it also poisons the water supply, too.

564
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,060
Well, we get a lot of vegetables from the farmer's market, luckily, because Princess Weave works downtown.

565
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,000
And is able to go in there real easily.

566
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,340
And that way, you don't know what you're getting.

567
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,840
But at the supermarket, you know you're getting it covered with bug spray.

568
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,700
Right.

569
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,120
At the farmer's market, you have no idea.

570
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,420
So it's possible that it really is organic.

571
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,620
Like they say it is.

572
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,500
And more unlike the edible watering.

573
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,020
Yeah, I like bug spray, you know.

574
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,680
If you eat enough pesticide-laden foods in the summertime, it'll keep the mosquitoes away.

575
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,940
That's a good insecticide.

576
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,820
Your own repellent.

577
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:08,980
Good.

578
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,060
You're a mean one.

579
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm straining both personal and government budgets.

580
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,080
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says,

581
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,900
Freeze the overseas assets.

582
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,660
Freeze the biggest assets.

583
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
Gas and gases.

584
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,960
Brown not speaking today.

585
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,660
Mr. Bush said that Pakganister FTAF test of Stankist's bait and Stankist's tank is packed right to scan fat there.

586
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,860
PR has more from southern PR's in a stand.

587
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,100
The PR's in any government suffered further embarrassment on Friday night in PR's stand.

588
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,700
On Wall Street, down 49.9.

589
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,860
President Bush says this is PR news.

590
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,880
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is one of the most important challenges facing the nation.

591
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,660
Bernanke falls into 3.0.

592
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,640
Three major areas.

593
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,440
Improving access to PR for the millions of Americans who lack PR news.

594
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,320
Improving the quality of PR and controlling PR news from Washington.

595
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,620
One and a half foot tall.

596
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,880
Focusing on one person really indicates to me people don't understand the scope of the mission.

597
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,140
Terror is bigger than one person.

598
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:22,740
And he's just a person who's now been marginalized.

599
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,760
His network is his host.

600
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,480
His host.

601
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,000
His host government has been destroyed.

602
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,040
He's the ultimate parasite who found weakness, exploited it,

603
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,060
and met his match.

604
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,720
If he's alive at all.

605
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,920
Who knows if he's hiding in some cave or not.

606
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,160
We hadn't heard from him in a long time.

607
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,480
You know, you were talking about the next step in human evolution or so-called human evolution.

609
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,100
Oh, that was a little paid sent along the time continuum from our friends in the far ahead.

610
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,680
Well, you know, I came across an idea of my own there and I wiped it off and I said,

611
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,100
what about the next step in evolution being that of schizophrenicus rationalis?

612
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,080
How does that strike you?

613
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,660
Well, there's a good reason.

614
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,340
There's a good reason to think that there's not going to be any more evolution.

615
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,720
So, whoop it up.

616
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,980
Well, we gotta, we gotta pretend like there's a future.

617
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,920
I mean, what's the point?

618
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,600
I ain't saying there's no future.

619
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,360
I'm saying there is no more evolution.

620
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,260
That is, no more extrasomatic forces that cause evolution.

621
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,840
So, we've hit the ceiling, as it were.

622
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,580
Not necessarily, but we're going to have to take charge of it ourselves now.

623
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,800
Why?

624
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,440
What do you mean?

625
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,960
Well, because your evolution, your natural selection, if you are a good Darwinian,

626
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,920
is a result of what happens to you.

627
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,860
But if you are one of these so-called intelligent beings, you're controlling what happens to you.

628
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,780
That's what the Nazis...

629
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,020
Thus, you're a monkey in evolution.

630
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,580
That's what the Nazis tried to do, wasn't it?

631
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,460
They tried to take matters into their own hands and shape the genetic pool themselves.

632
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,020
Well, that was one slight aspect of it.

633
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:21,220
If it had turned out that breeding for their so-called Aryans, which, of course, don't actually exist in genetics,

634
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,760
if that had been for good survival characteristics,

635
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,260
then they might have indeed improved the race.

636
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,040
But unfortunately, that was not really their intention.

637
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,280
It was not evolutionary.

638
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,100
It was a bit of a fuzzy thinking, I guess.

639
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,420
Well, I wouldn't call it fuzzy, but they believed some strange things.

640
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,680
For example, most of your top-flight Nazis believed that giant chunks of ice were flying through space

641
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,700
and were going to hit the Earth and cause the doom of everything.

642
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,240
Really?

643
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,020
Yes, it was called the...

644
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,740
Well, I forget the German, but it was called the World Ice Theory.

645
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,940
And the top-end...

646
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,940
The USS man believed in it, even though this was scientifically thought to be absurd.

647
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,780
No one dared complain about it.

648
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,300
So they embraced the...

649
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,040
It was one of the ritual beliefs that was fostered by Heinrich Himmler and his pan-Germanism.

650
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,480
Does that relate to Velikovsky or anything?

651
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,040
It's even more absurd than Velikovsky.

652
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:18,660
But, of course, your unstable political minds are always susceptible to these cosmic mish-mashes of nonsense and non-sequitur.

653
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,700
So they like destructionism and everything, right?

654
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,740
No, they like fundamentalist Christians

655
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,980
and other misguided souls like to live in a tiny, cozy, neat, orderly universe that they can comprehend

656
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:36,740
instead of the large, unfathomable, and frightening evolutionary universe that we actually are forced to inhabit.

657
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,700
Yeah, the rationality just breaks down when you try to apply it to the universe.

658
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,920
It just doesn't work like that.

659
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,900
We're surrounded by things that just don't make sense.

660
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,160
Well, I don't know about that.

661
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,540
I'd rather choose to suppose that...

662
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,920
How do you explain mass murders and earthquakes killing...

663
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,720
That's the fact that we don't make sense.

664
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,400
The universe makes perfect sense.

665
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,980
We're the nonsensical particle in the equation.

666
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,340
And yet, without a position outside the spectrum of logic and truth, how could we observe it at all?

667
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,420
Otherwise, it would be a case of not being able to see the forest for the trees or the flowers for the bees.

668
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,760
In this great land of ours, from sea to shining...

669
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,300
It's a rabbit.

670
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,460
And so, once again, fat triumphs over thin, tall triumphs over short.

671
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,680
And big triumphs over little.

672
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,520
In the coming order, everyone will wear special shiny shoes.

673
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:37,280
And on each shoe will be a portrait of the Fuhrer, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

674
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,160
And so Hal became crazed with radio power.

675
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,040
And soon he had Dobbs' image all over every color.

676
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,900
Even yours, Frank Bent, even Frank Bent was bent for the will of Uncle Harry.

677
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,960
We were stabbed in the back by the politician.

678
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,820
It is our destiny to go forward.

679
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:03,540
We will eliminate the inferior orders so that the true, big, alien race can suppress the inferior orders upon the face of this planet.

680
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,500
Well, get out, or I'll shoot out the car from underneath.

681
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,380
It is every subgenius' duty to exterminate these vermin.

682
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,300
They say we are prejudiced against minorities.

683
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,400
But I say we, we, we are the minorities.

684
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,000
We are the ones who are the most powerful.

685
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,980
And so we witness the self-immolation of an entire religious group.

686
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
My soldiers, I salute you.

687
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,380
I want you to go out and kill for old subgenius tech.

688
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,160
I want you to give them a person they won't forget.

689
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,260
Hey!

690
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,940
Hello, you're on the air.

691
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,100
I'm talking to you from inside, Bob.

692
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,600
Hi.

693
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,420
Oh, good.

694
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,940
I'm trying to give a speech here.

695
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,260
Get this man off the reviewing stand.

696
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,840
Oh, I'm coming back.

697
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,340
There he goes.

698
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Steel-toed boots.

699
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,960
Well, you didn't have to hang up.

700
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,120
We were trying to rescue you.

701
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,840
Uh-oh, Frank Grant has been frustrated.

702
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,560
He's being carried away now by the security forces.

703
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,060
This is my last territorial demand in Europe.

704
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,340
Yes, HAL has lost his show mind.

705
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,900
Absorb the power he needs.

706
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,640
The greater subgenius Reich will last for a thousand years.

707
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,300
Why, your radio personality so decreed.

708
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,620
Lost in power, he struts down Shatter Cavern.

709
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,100
People call emergency services.

710
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,380
There's nothing the Berkeley police can do.

711
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,140
Out of my way!

712
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,840
But for you, caller, it's just another pretty night.

713
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,700
Sieg Freud on KPFA.

714
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,940
Sieg Freud.

715
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,280
It's Zupan!

716
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,540
The Adventures of Zupan.

717
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,800
Hello there, gang.

718
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,320
You know, one of the girls in the gang is colorful and nifty-looking.

719
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,560
Found to be a beauty.

720
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,000
Like that picture of Zupan himself, complete with soft red hair.

721
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,720
And that battered old top hat.

722
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,100
And Zupan insignia.

723
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,560
What's more, it's a load of dungs.

724
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,980
And now, the Adventures of Zupan.

725
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,120
After a dry spell in the Freeville area, Zupan disappears.

726
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,520
He's gone.

727
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,260
Weird. Listen.

728
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,940
Freeville. Where's that?

729
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,120
Oh, just down the street.

730
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,160
Wait a minute, that's not true.

731
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,080
I just left Freeville this afternoon.

732
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:28,780
Go on.

733
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,020
Look, gentlemen, let's waste time making jokes.

734
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,020
Okay, right.

735
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,200
Sorry.

736
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes. Okay.

737
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Now do you get it?

738
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,380
We'll return in a moment to find out.

739
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,840
Say, gang, there's the same sort of thrill for you when Mom opens a new package of Goofy Soup, man.

740
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,300
The Adventures of Zupan.

741
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,720
2728 Cold Sex Positions.

742
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,220
The cornerstone of civilization.

743
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,060
Sex Positions.

744
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,440
On demand. Forever.

745
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,360
You sexy mother.

746
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,080
Ready?

747
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,440
Homosexuality is proper, normal, and a healthy expression of love.

748
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,980
David and Jonathan were homosexual lovers.

749
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:18,140
104 skins and 10 reasons why he is a practicing homosexual, homosexual lesbian discipline.

750
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,700
Listen to me, America.

751
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,720
Present the homosexual lifestyle as normal, healthy, and exciting.

752
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,600
To give you an idea of the penetration, how to be gay, think about it.

753
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,500
Gender, identity, and expression.

754
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,140
Please.

755
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,960
President George W. Bush.

756
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,120
Some people just choose to be gay.

757
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,080
And I personally should be surely put to death.

758
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,240
Practice the homosexual lifestyle.

759
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,860
Male prostitutes, homosexual offenders will inherit the kingdom of God.

760
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
That's clear to me.

761
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,340
Boy meets boy.

762
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,020
One of the best things on television.

763
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:15,940
Boy meets boy.

764
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:15,940


765
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,420
Two homosexuals living together.

766
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,580
Two men in love.

767
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,080
Three men in love.

768
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,000
They're healthier.

769
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,800
They have fewer heart attacks and other diseases.

770
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,060
They have fewer problems with alcohol.

771
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,100
Behave in less risky ways.

772
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,120
They have more sex and more satisfying sex.

773
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,960
I don't know how they measure that.

774
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,800
I don't know.

775
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,040
Just groove to your own tune.

776
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,640
Do your own thing and arrive where you want to be.

777
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,340
Embrace homosexuality.

778
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,480
Go all the way.

779
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,280
I want to address all of the homosexuals in America who endorse homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle.

780
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,400
I've gotten to where if I bite into a Hershey bar, it's like drinking a Coors.

781
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,940
You know, it's like, oh God, this is a hideous mockery of real talk.

782
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,940
And a deli.

783
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,600
I've been exposed raw bone to the true American culture, which is very watered down.

784
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,620
And now you're not fitting anymore.

785
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,540
You take something good and you water it down.

786
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
That's the secret to Americanizing anything.

787
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,840
I can't believe how much Miller Lite I drank in my life.

788
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,820
It makes me sick just thinking about it.

789
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,340
It made me sick when I drank it.

790
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,980
I smoked Lucky Swine.

791
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,340
I lived on the edge of the pool until they, you know, put me back in the institution.

792
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,140
You know, every day it's day to day.

793
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,320
You know, it just keeps...

794
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,380
I'm glad they're making a lease going topless on the buses now,

795
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,100
because that will encourage people to ride.

796
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,280
Really?

797
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,600
Right.

798
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,340
What if you're blind like me?

799
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,180
Does that encourage us to feel?

800
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,500
Right.

801
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,660
Yeah.

802
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,660
If you're on the metro in Vegas, I mean, somebody, some girl at work was telling me

803
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,560
that she was so lonely that no man would touch her.

804
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,540
And I said, well, ride the metro.

805
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,300
A woman was complaining that no man would touch her?

806
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,360
No man would touch her?

807
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,280
She must be picky.

808
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,660
She's just, she's one of those, you know, it frustrates me.

809
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,540
And it tends to be women who are at least late in Yeti.

810
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,140
It's not Yeti who are so clueless that they don't realize that men are hitting on them

811
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,020
because I don't know what they're waiting on.

812
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,500
I don't know if they're waiting for some magical sign from the heavens.

813
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,740
But, you know, the guy's sitting there smiling and grinning and drooling on himself.

814
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,680
Of course, you know, real, real, the pink men typically don't talk to us uberfits.

815
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,100
They're scared of us.

816
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,960
So then you're stuck with these Yeti men who are also scared, but when they talk,

817
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,600
they tend to sort of stutter and drool.

818
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,140
Hmm.

819
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,960
Yeah, and it's true.

820
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:06,160
They don't know when you're hitting on them because the idea of a woman hitting on them is so far-fetched to them.

821
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,260
What?

822
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,200
You know.

823
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,660
What's really sad is when they explain 15 years later that, hey, I was hitting on you.

824
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,600
What was wrong with you?

825
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,820
Oh, yeah.

826
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,080
I've done that several times.

827
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,700
Also consider that stuttering and drooling are definite assets in oral sex.

828
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,000
You know.

829
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:24,580
Hmm.

830
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,020
You could get a lot of mileage.

831
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,000
You should be quite happy to have Yeti men.

832
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,420
And to the point where the minister makes his comment about the air and thoughts and not being WCSB.

833
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,320
I think I've already aired all the required disclaimers.

834
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,340
Okay, good.

835
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,880
We were not crossing into the obscene there.

836
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,780
It's merely indecent.

837
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,700
Yeah, there's a difference.

838
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
We're still decently indecent.

839
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,000
I don't know.

840
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,200
The subgenius, the typical subgenius Bobby does not understand it.

841
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,900
And I guess it's because they're so used to the pink women who just sort of laugh at them.

842
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,640
Right.

843
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:13,740
That they just don't realize that the Ubercom really just wants you to generally shut up and get down to it.

844
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,240
Yeah, sometimes it just has to be explained.

845
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,760
And that takes all the fun out of it.

846
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,460
That is true.

847
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:23,920
Right.

848
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,860
You know, that's like, if I have to explain it to this guy, it's just not the same.

849
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,540
It's not worth it at that point.

850
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,280
You know, it's like, wow, I just wasted a whole bunch of time.

851
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,640
I could have been doing something else.

852
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,540
See, you guys are painting a picture now.

853
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:45,720
And what I see is like a woman who is like, resembles like a queen bee or an ant or something,

854
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,840
who has a large thing hanging out of her backside.

855
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,140
And she's pointing her backside at the Yeti man.

856
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,560
And the Yeti man is going like that.

857
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,580
That's pretty much it.

858
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,820
That's kind of sick.

859
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,660
Isn't it?

860
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,620
It's the Yeti mating.

861
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
I mean, that's how it works.

862
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:15,580
I mean, most Yeti mating rituals, I mean, tend to be instigated by the female.

863
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,100
And it takes so long, too.

864
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,660
You know, I've witnessed these things in the field, you know, on watching television programs about Yeti mating rituals.

865
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,280
And it takes like days for them to get it on.

866
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,760
Well, that's because the male Yeti is so clueless.

867
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,060
He's just sitting there.

868
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:37,440
Yeah, it's like the female is lubing up and getting ready for action.

869
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:44,080
And the male is still talking about some Lost in Space episode.

870
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,020
Or wishing he could get laid.

871
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,600
Exactly.

872
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,740
Or talking to his buddy about how much he wishes he could get laid.

873
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,460
And inherited some of those instincts.

874
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,800
That's the problem.

875
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:01,680
I mean, it's the only thing I could ask of the Yeti men in the Church of the Subgenius.

876
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,300
For them to just shut up and get on with it.

877
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,380
Well, you know, as Pope David N. Meyer said, some life forms have ironic sex lives.

878
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,500
Yeah.

879
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:12,800
Hmm.

880
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,760
There is certainly a lot of ironic tendencies there.

881
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:28,500
I mean, you know, I try to tell people, oh, but all I really want to do is have sex with your brain.

882
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,340
That's all I really want to do.

883
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,160
Squick.

884
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,840
Their brain isn't listening.

885
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,720
So what do I do?

886
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,420
How do I, tell me, thing, how do I get to have sex?

887
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,320
Wank.

888
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,500
Wank as if your very life depended on it.

889
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,680
Of course, I'm preaching the same.

890
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,040
Pisces is the original wankstress.

891
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,500
Yep.

892
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,660
I am the founder of Wankers for Bob.

893
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,320
And if you think you don't enjoy the company of others and you consider yourself kind of an innate solipsist or something like that,

894
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,600
just, you can wank mentally.

895
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,800
You don't even have to touch yourself.

896
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,960
You can get so far into this selfness that you would just, that you've wanked already.

897
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,560
You can also wank verbally, which is what we've been doing this whole hour.

898
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,620
Yeah, it does seem like it.

899
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,560
Yeah.

900
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,500
That may explain why I'm stuck to the chair.

901
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,820
Hmm.

902
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,360
Again.

903
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,480
Hmm.

904
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,160
Hmm.

905
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,340
It happens all the time.

906
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,980
Oh.

907
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,320
You're not into self-asphyxiation or any of that kind of stuff.

908
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,100
No, no.

909
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,620
I'm really into brains.

910
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,500
And I'm into interesting brains.

911
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,900
Not necessarily, you don't have to be the brightest brain in the bunch either.

912
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,560
You have to be an interesting brain.

913
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,860
You have to be one of those girls who likes a big brain, you know.

914
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:47,680
No, I'm not necessarily looking for an Einstein or an astrophysicist.

915
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,220
What I'm looking for is an interesting brain.

916
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,480
An inch brain baby.

917
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:57,960
Because, you know, the brain copulation, the sex with brains is not necessarily about intelligence per se.

918
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,740
As much as the different sort of textures and feelings of the different brains.

919
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:13,000
I mean, you know, for example, a brain like yours, for example, Dave, would be a totally different experience than, say, a brain like Tooby's.

920
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,380
It's a different feel.

921
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,060
And boy, my sense of touch and feel is so, so precise now.

922
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,740
Oh my.

923
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,560
I can definitely tell the difference between a brain.

924
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:27,560


925
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,540
A brain that's on the up and up and a brain that's on the low and low.

926
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,460
Just by waving the hand over the brain or a, well, a huffing and a huffing.

927
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,720
Are you trained in phrenology?

928
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,120
It's innate knowledge.

929
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,960
Once again, we're back to that paradigm of Plato's cave.

930
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,140
Plato's TV set.

931
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,020
Yeah, unfortunately.

932
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,680
Guys, we are running out of time here.

933
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,740
Uh-oh.

934
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,520
Plato's radio show.

935
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,420
Yep, yep.

936
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,880
I know, I know.

937
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,220
When you start losing a sense, your other senses get better.

938
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:14,660
Like, for instance, my hearing has gotten worse and worse and I've become louder.

939
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,660
My voice has become louder to compensate.

940
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,240
There's no question at all.

941
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,640
You're supposed to say your eyesight has gotten better.

942
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,400
You're not supposed to say your voice got louder.

943
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,800
No.

944
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,720
No, that's fine.

945
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,620
I grew up with a father who worked in a factory, so when Stan talks, I don't even really notice that he's talking louder.

946
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,520
It's something that I, because I grew up, my father worked in a factory 12 hours a day.

947
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,120
So when he came home, he was yelling and all my friends would come over and they'd say,

948
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,180
Why is your father yelling all the time?

949
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,280
He scares me.

950
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,020
And I'm like, what?

951
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,580
Speak up.

952
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,160
It's only what we are going to go around to.

953
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,120
Believe me, I know that very, very well.

954
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,020
But it's, you know, I certainly can understand Stan better.

955
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,920
It doesn't really matter.

956
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,740
He can lose his hearing and I'll just learn to talk to him like I talk to my daddy.

957
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,200
You know?

958
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,260
Because Stan is really all of our daddy.

959
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,300
I mean, Stan is everybody's daddy.

960
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, right.

961
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,020
Unfortunately.

962
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:19,620
Yeah.

963
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,820
And you're all latchkey kids, I hope.

964
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,820
Yes.

965
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,520
Today, everybody tells us we should talk about sex, but nobody tells us just how.

966
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,780
Talking about sex.

967
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,220
Sex.

968
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,720
Extremely unusual sex.

969
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,740
When should I begin?

970
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,900
It's a bugaboo.

971
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,260
You can begin at the beginning.

972
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,220
Really?

973
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,440
How about Ed?

974
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,580
It's a joy to ask.

975
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:41,980
Yes.

976
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,340
And quite exciting, too.

977
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,660
I'm referring, of course, to masturbation.

978
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,260
Let me at this point make a clear-cut scientific statement.

979
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,820
Masturbation is not important at all.

980
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:16,620
If you want to say hello to the business end of the law.

981
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
See what you want

982
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,500
Put on a show

983
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,560
Or have a hobby

984
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,740
Take a joke

985
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,620
Take a joke

986
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,420
Take a joke

987
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,180
Take a joke

988
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,780
If you want to make a splash

989
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,520
You don't need to make cash

990
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,160
Gather your friends

991
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,060
Make them laugh

992
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,020
But the last laugh will be on you

993
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,440
Take a joke

994
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,340
Take a joke

995
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,140
Take a joke

996
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,600
Take a joke

997
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,360
Take a joke

998
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,600
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

999
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
If you hurt their little feelings

1000
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,320
Boy, you better run away

1001
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:46,600
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

1002
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,080
If you hurt their little feelings

1003
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,800
Boy, you better run away

1004
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,720
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

1005
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,780
If you hurt their little feelings

1006
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,480
Boy, you better run away

1007
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,320
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

1008
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,280
If you hurt their little feelings

1009
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,180
Boy, you better run away

1010
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,940
Girl, you better run away

1011
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,840
If you hurt their little feelings

1012
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:09,840


1013
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,860
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

1014
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,240
Don't really matter what you do or what you say

1015
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,420
Girl, you better run away

1016
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,740
If you hurt their little feelings

1017
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,540
Boy, you better run away

1018
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:16,580
If you hurt their little feelings

1019
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:16,580


1020
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:16,580


1021
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,400
So it ain't matter what you do or what you say

1022
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,200
If you're hurt then it'll be the term you better run away

1023
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,820
It don't really matter

1024
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,660
No, it don't really matter

1025
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,360
It don't really matter

1026
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,800
It don't really matter

1027
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,680
Oh, it don't really matter

1028
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,500
Matter, matter

1029
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,540
Shaz-Bot!

1030
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,900
Shaz-Bot!

1031
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,440
Shaz-Bot!

1032
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,600
Shaz-Bot!

1033
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,560
when you're jamming that thing in there.

1034
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,960
Say you make contact right, and you can find the head,

1035
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,160
whether it's a Hex or a Phillips, it doesn't matter.

1036
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,280
We all have a different unit in our ear canals.

1037
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,500
But say you get that right, and all of a sudden you're daydreaming a little bit

1038
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,460
before you turn the switch, so to speak.

1039
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:08,700
You know, you're done, at least on this planetary sphere.

1040
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,560
You know, you can talk to people who aren't in this room, you know,

1041
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,880
and it wasn't fun.

1042
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,800
It was horrible.

1043
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:20,460
Aw.

1044
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,720
Yeah.

1045
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,420
I'm sorry to hear that.

1046
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,860
Yeah, it was like a life-changing experience in two seconds or less.

1047
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,080
And it'll never go away now.

1048
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,660
It's like a stain.

1049
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,580
Most people do have that, a life-changing experience that lasts only two seconds.

1050
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,200
Well, it's like, you know, the old merchant sailor's semen stains.

1051
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,480
You just can't wash the guy.

1052
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,480
You can't wash the guy out of the service.

1053
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,560
Just remains and remains.

1054
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,740
Good old semen stains.

1055
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,100
R.R.

1056
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,080
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1057
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,320
And now, back to the adventures of Superman.

1058
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,560
Suffering catfish.

1059
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,480
I never felt worse in my life.

1060
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,260
There are more.

1061
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:13,540
There are more.

1062
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:13,540


1063
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,640
There are more thrills and surprises in tomorrow's exciting episode,

1064
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,460
fellows and girls.

1065
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,460
The adventures of Superman.

1066
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,520
Superman is Superman and is brought to you at this same time.

1067
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,560
Hello?

1068
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,500
Hello?

1069
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,100
From PR News in Washington, I'm home.

1070
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,140
The Discovery crew is broke in Des Moines, Iowa, this morning.

1071
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,460
Discovery delivered a Japanese inmate to the,

1072
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,320
International Space Prison in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

1073
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:53,320
Japan's Prime Minister has called on troops and volunteers to help with the 850 inmates.

1074
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:04,440
The mission lasted about two weeks.

1075
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,340
Firefighters remain underwater.

1076
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,060
Bob has details.

1077
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,960
U.S. military officials say at least this is PR news.

1078
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,520
Wow.

1079
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,800
Ah, snake oil.

1080
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,720
Snake oil.

1081
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,860
In a dream, Jesus, the Lord, the Lord came to me and said,

1082
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,060
I have been walking with you.

1083
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,940
Here's your path.

1084
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,720
And he showed me the path of my life.

1085
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,500
And all along the way, there was two sets of footprints.

1086
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,480
Yes.

1087
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,500
But every now and then, there was only one set of footprints.

1088
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,880
And I turned to the Lord and I said, Lord, what's going on there?

1089
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,620
You want me to do it like scabby?

1090
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,040
Yeah.

1091
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,800
And what did he say, brother?

1092
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,680
What's going on there?

1093
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,820
Jesus, come here.

1094
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,600
And what did Jesus say to you now?

1095
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,140
There's only one set of footprints here and here.

1096
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,800
And one of the worst times of my life, there was only one set of footprints.

1097
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:32,520
And the Lord said, well, son, that's when I abandoned you.

1098
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,700
Couldn't take your misery.

1099
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,620
You're a pathetic loser at those times.

1100
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,000
I couldn't stand looking at you.

1101
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,600
Thank you for that wonderful interpretation of the usual retreat.

1102
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:42,980
Retreat.

1103
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,820
I'm real loud.

1104
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,980
It's good to be a loser.

1105
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,720
It's good to be an idiot.

1106
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,340
It's better to be an idiot.

1107
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,360
No one, they don't know what, what wrong with you.

1108
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,800
You are forgiven.

1109
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,180
I thought you were going to end that with, well, scabby, that's when I was humping you on the neck.

1110
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,320
God so loved the idiot and the drunkard that he protected him in the car wreck.

1111
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:02,940
That would have been much better.

1112
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,260
I should have gave it to you.

1113
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,560
Jumped on your back and humped him.

1114
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,680
The hardworking house mom was instead taken by the angels.

1115
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,400
Come on.

1116
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:12,800
Get down.

1117
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,480
Your clam cakes, they're alive.

1118
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:24,100
For God loves drunks and protects them and lets hardworking moms fall by the wayside in his great vengeance.

1119
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:24,480
What is that?

1120
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:25,720
Chaz?

1121
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,080
Chaz?

1122
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,320
Could you help me?

1123
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,360
I think Rogers died.

1124
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,300
And he was.

1125
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,240
And he was died.

1126
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,100
He's gone.

1127
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,260
The stark fist of removal is.

1128
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,800
The wheel, my friends, and it hovers over each and every one of them.

1129
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,100
And that's when you tied your shoe boots today.

1130
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,160
For the very last time.

1131
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,280
You're good on time tonight.

1132
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,480
Will the undertaker be untying them shoes tonight, friend?

1133
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,180
Are you ready?

1134
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:07,480
Have you made peace with your god or goddess or thing or totem pole, whatever it may be?

1135
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,420
I'm afraid that Jolly Roger is really flying the skull and crossbones this Saturday.

1136
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:12,960
Afternoon.

1137
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,860
You're a guardian angel or you're a guardian demon or you're a little guardian alien gray or you're a lucky rabbit's foot.

1138
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,040
Or you're a winning lottery number.

1139
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,020
Or you're a special anti-baldness formula.

1140
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,060
That inorganic penis liquor, that's one demerit.

1141
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,620
You're ear candling equipment.

1142
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,480
You're auto jack.

1143
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:39,940
You're...

1144
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,400
The frozen peace pipe in ivory.

1145
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,340
You're a hobby.

1146
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,900
You're addiction.

1147
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,780
You're crutch.

1148
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,340
Your elation upon riding into the little train tube, that's 60 merits.

1149
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,240
Face it.

1150
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,100
You're hooked.

1151
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,620
Kick that crutch away, my friend.

1152
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,420
Become yourself the crutch of Bob Dobbs.

1153
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,260
Let Bob lean on you.

1154
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:06,860
I see the light.

1155
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,400
And you'll walk again.

1156
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,600
Kick that crutch away and walk.

1157
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,380
I walk.

1158
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,420
I let go.

1159
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,180
Bob, limp on you.

1160
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,260
But I...

1161
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,920
I never could wash.

1162
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,260
Throw yourself into that pipe.

1163
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,940
And light yourself up.

1164
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,600
Keep those atoms in one place, for God's sake.

1165
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,420
Those atoms are yours now, but they won't be forever.

1166
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:30,900
No.

1167
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,880
They're gonna be in some other burning hydrogen sun in some other alternate...

1168
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,260
That's right.

1169
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,900
Further on in the universe.

1170
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,400
They're gonna all be...

1171
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,980
One day there will be a blast.

1172
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,580
Perfect day on Earth.

1173
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,100
And then the sun will start to shrink.

1174
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,200
And they repulse.

1175
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,760
They'll shrink a little bit.

1176
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:56,300
And then it'll expand out, consuming Mercury, Venus, and Earth inside of itself.

1177
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,580
Now, that's...

1178
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:02,320
Eventually, after that, the sun will slowly use up the...

1179
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,720
The hydrogen's gone.

1180
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,400
Now it's just the helium burning.

1181
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,580
As the sun's uterus slowly contracts...

1182
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,720
And it becomes a white dwarf.

1183
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,200
...this phagmatic form here shown at the top of the comet.

1184
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,560
Only about the size of a...

1185
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,140
...the Earth.

1186
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:18,100
You notice Randy and Tina are still having fun with their used condom.

1187
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,420
...than just a little bar of black schmuck in space.

1188
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,340
Especially when impregnating different cosmic varieties of planetary stellar things.

1189
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,160
Of course, if the sun was a lot bigger, it would turn into a black hole, though.

1190
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,640
Hey, man, uh, you don't know where I could get some of that, uh...

1191
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,340
Neutron matter?

1192
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,440
Black dwarf neutron matter.

1193
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,200
Oh, yeah, man.

1194
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,100
You want neutron matter?

1195
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,820
A teaspoon full of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

1196
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Let's sing this song.

1197
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,080
Shall we sing this song?

1198
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,180
It'd weigh as much as 19 Earths.

1199
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:46,460
Come on, guys, let's not...

1200
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,540
Let's sing this song.

1201
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,040
An atom of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

1202
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,160
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine go down.

1203
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,600
Come on, let's sing it now.

1204
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,380
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine go down.

1205
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,480
Are we supposed to be funny now?

1206
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,580
No, I don't think so.

1207
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,600
...my little desk, and I have a jar full of gummy bear vitamins.

1208
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,980
Well, if you think of it all as...

1209
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,520
It's quanta.

1210
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,660
Everything that you guys just said means it's like, you know,

1211
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,640
remember that old poster from the 60s, Phi Zappa Crappa?

1212
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,800
And not only that, it's God sitting on the toilet just releasing all this quanta.

1213
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,160
It's just, it's like fiber that goes right through them.

1214
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:26,900
It doesn't stop.

1215
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,300
And once again, prunes.

1216
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,740
That brings us back again.

1217
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,100
What you cannot get away from that subject.

1218
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:36,740
Prunes.

1219
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,560
It's the answer to so many of man's questions.

1220
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,980
And I'm afraid I might have to...

1221
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,620
I'm going to have to prune the panel here pretty shortly.

1222
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,720
We've got about 13, make that 12 minutes left in the program.

1223
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,260
And as much as I have enjoyed this conversation,

1224
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,880
and as much as I have enjoyed your contributions tonight,

1225
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,500
I think I might want to open the phone lines up just to let some other people have a chance.

1226
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,800
The branch that is dead must be pruned and cut.

1227
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,600
Prune your family tree.

1228
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,320
I would prune myself.

1229
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,180
You know, maybe jump out the window.

1230
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,000
All of this talk of prunes has made me think that I may need to visit the facility.

1231
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,460
So I will be gone.

1232
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,680
All right, Pisces, thank you so much.

1233
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
This show is a spiritual laxative.

1234
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:16,760
Yes.

1235
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,260
It is.

1236
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,560
And with that note...

1237
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,640
If you were...

1238
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,440
If you were...

1239
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:21,820
Oh, gosh.

1240
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:22,840
Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.

1241
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,240
If you were full of crap before, you won't be after listening to this show.

1242
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,660
We guarantee it.

1243
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,440
The oral laxative.

1244
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,360
All right.

1245
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:34,060
Well, I've got to let you all go at once because I can't remember which line is which.

1246
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,620
So thank you all.

1247
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,580
All right, all right, all right.
