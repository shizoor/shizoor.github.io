shall rise again though lovers be lost love shall not and death shall be gone

12
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:48,140
I hope you're not lonesome for long and friends we just attempted to bring lonesome cowboy Dave into

13
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,600
this episode of the hour of slug

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:04,200
would end up being number 1200 and something yes once a week for 26 years a weekly show how's been

15
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,320
doing it even longer on on the West Coast and we're still doing it but I sometimes ask myself

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,180
shouldn't I get a life flashing those lights at me sir and and pump get those strange chemicals into me

17
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,260
foreign

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,520
this is just

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,200
silly this isn't funny this is just this is not funny and it's not serious

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,600
no I won't be talking about good things and bringing people up yeah

21
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,880
marvelous technology is at our disposal

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,060
and what do we do with it instead of we威

23
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,940
up to new heights and improving communication.

24
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,620
We're just, the radio's broken.

25
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,740
And we're doing stuff like exit stage left.

26
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,560
What is this?

27
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,080
This is called the radio is broken.

28
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,400
Most of the people wish their radio was broken right now.

29
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,440
And they're so sleepy they can't get up to turn it off.

30
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,120
Except for you in the cab right there.

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,160
You got in the wrong cab, lady.

32
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,620
Now you're going to go really fast.

33
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,500
And when you get out, it'll be a super reality.

34
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,360
Michael Jackson will still be alive.

35
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,220
And Bubbles will be president.

36
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,700
Frank Zappa will be secretary of state.

37
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,200
All the dead stars will come back and function in our government.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,640
The Kipper kids will be gigantic spiders.

39
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
Gigantic spiders.

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,400
Yeah.

41
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,660
The Kipper always plays the harmonica.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Okay.

43
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,100
All right.

44
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,120
Friends, welcome once again to X Day 12.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
It won't be a drill this year.

46
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,320
And I predict it won't rain for much longer.

47
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,780
I can't say it won't rain, but it won't rain for much longer.

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh, these pictures behind me being projected are unseen before.

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,400
Even by me, photographs made by Doc Fropp and Sister Decadence.

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
And I hope there's nothing embarrassing on there.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,300
You never know.

52
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,700
That's my...

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,080
Look, there's the little Fropp drive collection tin that you made.

54
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,720
Yes.

55
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,720
That didn't do you much good.

56
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,520
On the contrary, it was entirely successful.

57
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Oh, it was?

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:41,860
Oh, good.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,460
Yeah, these are somehow pictures of last X Day from...

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,120
Flying saucers bombard...

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,560
Flying saucers bombard...

62
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,600
These are what you missed.

63
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,280
That was the big house in the background.

64
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,060
The rustic cottage painted by Thomas Kinkade, painter of blight.

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,980
Boy, that guy, Thomas Kinkade, makes a lot of money off of picture puzzles, I've noticed.

66
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,100
He makes the picture puzzles that I don't buy.

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,680
He's a fundamentalist Christian.

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
Well, you know, I guess I had a good whiff reading then.

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,200
Yeah.

70
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,800
I must have whiff read that.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,940
Although, personally, I don't have anything against Christians.

72
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,520
Yes, but this one...

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,780
This one is an exceptionally poisonous...

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,260
Only the ones that I've met do I hate.

75
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:32,500
This one is an exceptionally bad one who deceives others, runs them out of business, steals from them.

76
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,580
But he's the painter of light.

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
Yeah, we're the church of light.

78
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,240
We make your wallet lighter.

79
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,580
God appears and God is light to those who dwell in realms of night.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,500
But does a human form display to those who dwell in realms...

81
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,300
of day?

82
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,400
Well, we do hope our brother and fellow communicant, lonesome cowboy, Dave, will arrive and that

83
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,980
his vehicle has sufficient strength and vitality to transport him hither.

84
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,860
But, of course, as you get closer to Brushwood, as I said the other day, as when two magnets

85
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,220
are brought together, the pull becomes stronger as you approach these precincts until finally

86
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,520
you are inextricably...

87
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,360


88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,880
irrevocably drawn here to the pulsating heart of X-Day.

89
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,720
Twelve X-Day, the stroke of midnight, the stroke of doom.

90
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,560
The doomsday clock is only five minutes away.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:46,580
Princess Priestess Pisces is passing out special doomsday dials, which will help you in time

92
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,500
control in your first phase aboard the Pleasure Star.

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,640
This is the Which of the lost stars of the X-Dchts.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,160
Well, she's passing those out, other sub-geniuses are just passing out.

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,560
Or passing strange to something stranger.

96
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,980
You'll notice on the photographs on screen we have actual UFOs here.

97
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,900
That's the inexplicable black turd-like thing that appeared in the sky a few cycles

98
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,500
ago.

99
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,500
Friends, you see, when you get to planet X it's like the big hole.

100
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:20,500


101
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:20,500


102
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,560
rock candy mountain the snow falls up the rivers run with beer or wine or

103
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,020
whatever you want it you know could be diet soft drink you that was expressed

104
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,480
in a pink commercial years ago where that some kid wanted all the oceans and

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,840
waters of the world to turn into orange crush and it took a lot of speculating

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,040
to figure out what effect that would have on the old planet but it wouldn't be

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,860
pretty yes friends on you on your new cat planet that even the cactus are made

108
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,700
of rubber edible everything is made of rubber if you want it to be city I

109
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:14,380
predict cities made entirely of rubber by the year 1998 good old Criswell

110
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,960
actually said something like that what an idiot man

111
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
I can't wait a lot of predictions but

112
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,200
wrong mostly like a fool now the boy those excess will be here any minute now

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,200
well maybe solve a movie son of flubber where they showed some of those new

114
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,380
buildings you drop the baby deliberately on the floor and he bounces back up into

115
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,800
your arms have they ruined the flubber series by remaking oh they did

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,380
definitely with Robin Williams the kiss of death to anything so let's not

117
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,640
mention the right the anti-crime right yes of course and I or Jim Carrey

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,120
or even Pope David Lee black because we have to move to somewhat serious and

119
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,900
portentous matters as the great star spanning ships of the exists draw ever

120
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:08,660
closer and we all have to get right with Bob in the final convulsions of the pre

121
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,760
econo cataclysm well by definition everybody here is right with Bob so we're

122
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,000
preaching oh yes by definition sure by the book if they want to go by the book

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,240
you know the bucket of Vicodin the the bathtub full of pills all of those

124
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,020
things that were just sort of funny subgenius jokes can be real but be very

125
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,100
clear how you visualize them or else it doesn't come out right it's like saying I

126
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,220
wanted you want a goldfish bowl full of fish so you say I want a bowl of fish

127
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:45,900
what you might get is well not what you visualize so be clear about it and in

128
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,180
life it behooves us to

129
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,560
visualize exactly what we want and not leave this important quiddity in the

130
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,060
realm of the vague because one cannot realize what only exists in idealized

131
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,060
warmness is smoky in co hate shape a staying now I know you don't like to

132
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,920
tell them about that port authority building but the saucers do land

133
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,940
somewhere eventually and that is where we are all supposed to go

134
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,060
You know you have your other questions.

135
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,660
Yeah well now if you have read your pre scriptures.

136
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,780
You know that they don't land a blind out across it from North

137
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,220
South over the International Dateline and let the Earth turn they don't land

138
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:36,260
here but when they come back when they return you may remember the diaphragm of

139
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:43,320
the path of the pilgrims which appears in Revelation X that Bob A porque- je fun

140
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,860
starting with that.

141
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,260
Self-same port authority building where you can

142
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:48,740
either go to wrap up stone andsubmit up a note here and you want to leave the

143
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:48,740


144
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:48,740


145
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:55,340
to Christian heaven which we consider to be subgenius hell or continue on the

146
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,420
sinusoidal path which eventually takes you after ascending through numerous

147
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:08,940
lifelines and lifetimes to what we call the punchline you remember friends you

148
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,100
can have anything you want as a subgenius did you ever want to fuck

149
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,360
Cleopatra her mummy is still around overrated you can fuck the mummy of

150
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,640
Cleopatra in the Church of the subgenius just think about that's why you're

151
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,540
hearing a little bit of eruption in the pink world about hey was that Egyptian

152
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,900
archaeologist who believes he's found the tomb of Marcus Antonius and

153
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,020
Cleopatra the sixth this of course is the distorted conspiracy version of the

154
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,080
events which Reverend staying is talking about

155
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,420
how they're having a field day of Johnny on the pony action with the unfortunate

156
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,960
mummy of the late Egyptian ruler of the upper and lower kingdoms oh and here is

157
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:02,660
a modem act with the famous bullhorn I assume he is now called the faithful to

158
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,500
prayerful worship and they will assemble here soon to receive their last modules

159
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,660
of subgenius indoctrination

160
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,840
stop stop stop

161
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:20,180
stop stop stop stop stop stop I was needing just that we will try to do it

162
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:26,460
again now pop culture that desire to give a taste of it more I just need you

163
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:35,600
to know come from behind us completely and utterly now I know you can come come

164
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
what what he is out blow this horn is the woman who blew that I didn't know

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,640
that she was about to blow that

166
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:51,840
but it fit and it was really my pleasure I do need to doubt the author author

167
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:05,860
we are mean greedy evil people we are disappointed at the lack of emphasis on

168
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:14,080
slacks anyway to open it up a little bit more we do hope you'll stick around for the next episode of the show.

169
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,080


170
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,500
or ask doctor how when that happens and we are going to be doing our classic

171
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,960
historic broadcast at this time here from the brushwood folklore center

172
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,220
pavilion at xa 12

173
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:44,080
soaking wet brushwood folklore pavilion but perhaps now the rain has spent its shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and soundless deep maybe the sun will be the light of the day

174
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:54,860
will come out and we can endure his burning axle tree and bright thrown we will welcome him for his last few appearances above our globe

175
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,620
destroy the warming sun

176
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,620
too far away

177
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,120
yeah now remember it's good and it's the theme less costume ball tonight so

178
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,840
seamless but not seamless I actually have a for those who didn't think about it I have a giant

179
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:43,820
sack of cheap rubber monster masks in the back of the I fan so if anybody starts to feel like they're too normal looking later in the afternoon come see me and I can abnormal you up real fast and ladies if you ask her nicely reverend Susie the floozy might have the accoutrement which screams to be worn by you that's right yeah yeah she carries all kinds of she's already been bestowing cross dressers would die for what she does.

180
00:14:43,840 --> 00:15:13,820
her trunk later on as it were in a manner of speaking friends that and most of this show was recorded on July 3rd of conspiracy year 2009 actual year unknown at the brushwood campground at the 12 X day or what could also be termed the 14th X day drill we started drilling for 1998 in 1998.

181
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:43,820
1996 and we still haven't hit 1998 yet before that we heard a quickie collage by reverend norrell prep who has more a lot more at norrell prep dot com and at the beginning we heard titles by lemur and some puzzling evidence with Phineas narco from KPFA Berkeley but X day drills aren't all talk there are also insanely stupid stunts secret rituals and nightmarish moments.

182
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,580
of horror such as this one from the amino acids live at 12 X day.

183
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,100
!!

184
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,160
.

185
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,480
yeah yeah.

186
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,080
yeah yeah yeah.

187
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,700
yeah.

188
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,700
the hell.

189
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,600
.

190
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,900
.

191
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,780
.

192
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,820
This is a fairly bloodless, stag-eating, neon-haired show.

193
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,840
Usually there's all this accounts of blood and spine organs.

194
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,380
This year they were very gentle.

195
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,260
They used Leslie on his Canadian left feet.

196
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,240
For God's sake, who owns this Canadian here?

197
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,300
Are you singling me out again?

198
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,020
I am, I am going to die.

199
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,700
Welcome to your last day on Earth.

200
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,420
I feel good.

201
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,420
I feel very happy.

202
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,860
I feel very sad.

203
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,220
Hope I didn't startle you, hon.

204
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,440
Are you feeling better?

205
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,740
I like it here.

206
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,380
Nothing beats setting up camp in the desert at night, just toasting s'mores and getting glowy.

207
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,700
Baby, we have to talk.

208
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm on a radiation vacation, soaking up the gamma.

209
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,100
All the He-Men do their bomb testing just over the ridge there.

210
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,980
Can't you smell it?

211
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,700
Baby, there's a possibility that your problem is coming back.

212
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,000
There's nothing wrong with me.

213
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,620
I'm just little Miss Suburbia, two gene pods and a purse full of credit cards.

214
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,340
My husband had an erection once.

215
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,360
Silly, really.

216
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,600
I want you to go upstairs and pack a suitcase.

217
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm taking you back there.

218
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,320
This flicker is my vortex.

219
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,160
See the neon?

220
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
I got an EKG you can dance to.

221
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,620
Everybody limbo.

222
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,380
I had a legendary twitch in Nagasaki.

223
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,260
Uh-huh.

224
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,720
I want to tell you a secret.

225
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,700
If you look at the way the humans are going, as the growth of the internet, which we all thought,

226
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,980
wow, it's gonna make everybody have to learn how to read.

227
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,740
No, it just turned into more TV.

228
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:38,140
I'm not putting down those of you, 99% of you, who spend all your free time watching somebody else's

229
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,400
video on TV.

230
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,040
Is it about cookies?

231
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,380
That's the slack of many a reward.

232
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,880
But the humans, you know, I mean, look at the way it's going.

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,580
That movie Idiocracy, that happened yesterday, man.

234
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,020
That was LA last week.

235
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:05,120
So sometimes I think I don't want to live forever aboard my escape vessel because every now and then

236
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,560
I'll see what's happening to the humans left behind on earth.

237
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,940
And that's depressing.

238
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,500
It's an awful thought.

239
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,360
So let's not take a break.

240
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,360


241
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:13,620
Let's think about that.

242
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,680
Let's think about the big rock candy planet.

243
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,400
What?

244
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,080
I was thinking about...

245
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,420
That's where we're all gonna go.

246
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,240
Rock candy?

247
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,940
Well, that's mine.

248
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,340
Mine.

249
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,320
You're all welcome to come to my planet when we're ruptured.

250
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,640
The big rock candy planet.

251
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,220
The birds and the bees and the cigarette trees.

252
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,180
Yeah, there's cigarette trees there.

253
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,440
The Saudi water fountain.

254
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
With lemonade springs where the bluebird sings.

255
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,280
You know, some people don't have meaning in their lives.

256
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,840
To them, life is just one big hiccup.

257
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,880
In the midst of a bunch of nothingness.

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,120
There's a lake of stew and a whiskey too.

259
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,540
You can paddle all around in an old canoe at the big rock candy mountain.

260
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,620
That's my plan.

261
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,220
Yeah, that song is what I started basing my planetary plans on.

262
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,160
In the big rock candy mountain, all the cops have wooden legs.

263
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,880
The binnacle bars are attached to the stars and the hens lay hard-boiled eggs.

264
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,220
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth.

265
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
And the railroad bulls are blind.

266
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,240
The

267
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:34,440
There's got to be a difference between fantasy and faith, or else Jesus don't mean nothing.

268
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:41,740
I'd like to say that who is so concerned whether or not one is an escapist or trying to escape?

269
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,820
Those who are not.

270
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,040
Those who have the most concern for this are jailers.

271
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,340
And how happy do we want them to be?

272
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
I knew when I first seen you that you didn't have nobody or nothing but Jesus.

273
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,680
I see you. Yeah, I knew it.

274
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,220
That's right.

275
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,500
Standing around acting like you got wires of blood and anybody else, but you ain't.

276
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,220
Because I'm the one that has it, not you, me.

277
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,160
What are you talking about?

278
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,420
About I know things I ain't never learned.

279
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,520
How I can see signs.

280
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,620
And something that just happens.

281
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,400
And I got to do some things sometimes.

282
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,580
I got to do some things sometimes I don't even want to do.

283
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,380
And sometimes inside me I can feel it.

284
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,900
I can feel it pulling and tugging at me and pushing.

285
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,860
And I can feel my blood beating.

286
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,600
And I got to do this thing right now.

287
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,340
It's wise blood.

288
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,820
Ain't everybody has it.

289
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,040
See, it's a gift.

290
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,240
It's a gift, like the gift of the prophets.

291
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,740
Now, I ain't saying I'm a prophet.

292
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,460
No, it ain't like that, but it's like that.

293
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:42,800
You're crazy.

294
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,480
Crazy boy.

295
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,040
Well, we're going to put in another cassette.

296
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,580
Dr. Howe, you know what's missing up here?

297
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,160
A topless babe.

298
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,480
Or even just any kind of female creature.

299
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,360
Now, Pisces, you're standing around over there doing nothing.

300
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
I'm not doing nothing.

301
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,140
Are you saying she should reveal herself unto Bob?

302
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,060
One of y'all girls need to get up here, otherwise the Sausage Fest legend will be true.

303
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,480
Well, many legends are true.

304
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,580
Many have a basis, in fact.

305
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,780
I had some great sausage last night here at Aspen.

306
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,120
I'm not going to say this is a sausage fest.

307
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,120


308
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, it is a sausage fest.

309
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,660
There's some really good, high-class sausage on this campground.

310
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,520
If you say so.

311
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,360
No, there is.

312
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,460
Maybe you didn't know the right thing.

313
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,700
I had some sausage that was so authentic it had bristles.

314
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,620
I'm not kidding.

315
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
It was great.

316
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,160
It did have two boar bristles sticking out of one end of it.

317
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:47,360
Anyway, there are plenty of unusual viands and drinks for the adventurous here at X Day.

318
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:55,880
You don't have to wolf down plasticine food generated by blind-eyed robots in sad factories.

319
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,460
We finally got the babe up here.

320
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,180
You asked for it.

321
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,880
You got it.

322
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,800
She's not topless, but her diapers may need to be changed any minute now.

323
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,320
How easily Stang swivels to a different kind of thrill.

324
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Adaptability.

325
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,060
I learned it from you.

326
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,680
That's the watchword.

327
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,000
I learned it from you, Dad.

328
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,740
Do you want to get in front of the...

329
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,960
Well, sir...

330
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,000
She can now sit down and make noises.

331
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,620
There you go.

332
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,420
Say something.

333
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,820
She'll say Bob.

334
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,680
She's a silent renter.

335
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,200
Not everybody can say Bob on cue.

336
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,120
Actually, you would...

337
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,240
I tell you, manager, it's my boobs.

338
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,780
That's the problem.

339
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,780
In fact, the first sentence that my son...

340
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,520
My son spoke, the first complete sentence was, Bob, pipe, hot.

341
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,720
Bob.

342
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,720
The little shaver was burned by Bob at an early age.

343
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,020
That's right.

344
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,060
Bob, pipe, hot.

345
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,660
Seared and scorched.

346
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,140
It's first more than one or two words strung together.

347
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,880
Well, we used the pipe to help toilet train the child.

348
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,720
Yes.

349
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,300
If he didn't do it right, we'd burn him.

350
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,420
You gave him the dottle treatment.

351
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,200
The dottle treatment.

352
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,320
The dottle treatment.

353
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,820
What do you want, the bottle or the dottle?

354
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,900
Well, I think they come around quick when they're given that choice.

355
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,860
Yeah, then they're climbed.

356
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,940
No, quite seriously, folks, any of you who are parents or end up being parents by some

357
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:28,920
horrible mistake later on, for some reason, the sight of the Dobbs head aids toilet training.

358
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,680
Something about it makes them want to let go.

359
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,940
...was the first one to discover that.

360
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:42,860
And his daughter, who we now know as Reverend Baz otherwise, was once a piddling in her

361
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,920
pants little baby.

362
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,020
I even knew her then.

363
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,240
She was born on my birthday.

364
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,080
I christened her.

365
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:54,860
But she was unable to use the little toilet until the day she saw a rise on TV.

366
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,600
And when she saw Bob on television, she suddenly went, poop, and ran to the toilet, laid her

367
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:03,620
pants, and then she was out.

368
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,620
And I remember her first properly done little set of vlogs.

369
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,280
And, you know, friends, to this day, for all we know, if it weren't for Bob, Reverend Baz

370
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,880
otherwise would still be pooping in her drawers.

371
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,980
Oh, thanks.

372
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,920
She's 22 or 23 years old by now.

373
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,600
A hottie.

374
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,260
Yes.

375
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,700
She's a hottie.

376
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,520
However, she goes to Starwood instead of X Day.

377
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,320
Now, why is that?

378
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,880
I don't know.

379
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,200
Oh, it's because her parents, that's what her parents do.

380
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,380
Or she might not wish to spend an entire festival in the grip of incontinency caused

381
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,260
by seeing that grinning face everywhere she turns around.

382
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:45,620
It would mean numerous humiliating trips to the porta-potties.

383
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,100
Speaking of the porta-potties, I see the Jenkin Chamber signs have already been removed by

384
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,520
somebody.

385
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,300
By our tireless friends at Rushwood.

386
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
Yeah, I don't understand that.

387
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
It says, don't flush.

388
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,340
We're using the chem...

389
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,600
We have just the chemical toilets, not the flush toilets.

390
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,980
We use the chemical toilets as Jenkin fermentation chambers.

391
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,740
Why not?

392
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,100
That's what they are anyway.

393
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,260
Yes, but...

394
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,940
And yet, when we put, when we state that fact, when we put up a sign saying what this

395
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,640
object already was, the staff go around and take the sign down.

396
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,840
It says, do not flush, but you can't flush a chemical toilet.

397
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,400
It doesn't matter.

398
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,380
So what is their problem?

399
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,320
It's their problem.

400
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,000
It's the thought.

401
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,800
The thought that someone...

402
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,560
The mere thought of the Jenkin.

403
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,320
The mere thought.

404
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:35,320


405
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,300
Because they're squeamish.

406
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:46,380
The liberal, sensitive ears of the modernist doesn't want to hear about Jenkin, even though

407
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,200
it's the most organic type of getting high.

408
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:49,720
Why?

409
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,480
You know, you don't have to care for...

410
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,660
It's not like LSD, which requires a laboratory to make.

411
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,060
Yes.

412
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,840
Or cocaine, which requires acres of toiling Indians.

413
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,320
Yes.

414
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


415
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


416
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


417
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


418
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


419
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


420
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


421
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


422
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


423
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


424
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


425
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


426
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


427
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


428
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


429
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:00,320


430
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,260
Or, you know, you can, you can...

431
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,600
I mean, good God.

432
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,980
It's God's gift, a subgenius kind.

433
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,900
It's recycling.

434
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,860
And you can, and it makes you see your ancestors too.

435
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,680
That's what all the Jenkin users say.

436
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:15,900
Which ones?

437
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,740
I actually haven't tried it yet myself to tell the truth.

438
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,520
The people are represented by heretics.

439
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,400
You know who I am?

440
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,020
Pretty instantaneous.

441
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,760
The FBI.

442
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,320
Got no proof.

443
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


444
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


445
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


446
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


447
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


448
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


449
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


450
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


451
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


452
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


453
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


454
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,320


455
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,920
No prints of value.

456
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,660
No DNA.

457
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,600
Heretics.

458
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,560
Dim bones.

459
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
Right, right.

460
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,380
Bob.

461
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,660
Technically, I think he was schizophrenic.

462
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,500
I studied psychology.

463
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:39,980
Yeah.

464
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,220
He got money from somewhere, but chose to live on the street.

465
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,420
I mean, he yells at people on the street sometimes.

466
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,960
You know, but he's harmless.

467
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,720
He had a following.

468
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,540
He was so crazy.

469
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,840
I don't mean crazy, crazy.

470
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,300
Just crazy.

471
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,940
We thought people would like the image.

472
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,760
Crazy.

473
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,280
Crazy.

474
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,300
He's got a brother in California who hasn't seen the image.

475
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


476
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


477
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


478
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


479
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


480
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


481
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


482
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


483
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


484
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,300


485
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,740
I haven't seen him in years.

486
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,280
The KGB is after him.

487
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,320
No more pole vaulting ever.

488
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,820
The KGB and mind control.

489
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,320
You are Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

490
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,020
Waiting for Bob.

491
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,500
The man who did 20 years for racketeering.

492
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,340
A psychotic roller skater and big expansion.

493
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,500
We have some questions about Bob.

494
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:19,840
Why?

495
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,220
Why?

496
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,540
Bob.

497
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,920
It's high verbally.

498
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,860
You're a big fan of Bob.

499
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,780
And Bob is as dumb as a sack of hair.

500
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,700
Yes.

501
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,700
Bob.

502
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,560
He's a paranoid schizophrenic and he incorporated Bob, Bob, Bob.

503
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,600
So he's not completely crazy.

504
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,540
Bob.

505
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,200
Bob guilty or not guilty.

506
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:37,840
Now.

507
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes.

508
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,560
Bob came to help me.

509
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,600
Did you ever see Bob outside the office?

510
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,900
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

511
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,640
Overruled.

512
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,980
The witness may answer.

513
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,160
You're going after Bob.

514
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,260
Bob.

515
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,700
Yeah, you know that secret town near Moscow?

516
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,620
That's where we met.

517
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,840
How do you like my English?

518
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

519
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,680
He's maintaining his life.

520
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


521
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


522
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


523
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,680


524
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,580
As long as he's on the drugs.

525
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm out of here.

526
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,580
Because as we know, Bob will provide.

527
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,380
Yeah, that's what I've been telling people for a long time.

528
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,820
I'm kind of still whiting myself for a couple of things that were promised.

529
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,840
Oh, Bob's been good to me, to me.

530
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,300
So I say thank you, Bob, for giving me the tee hee hee that helped me fight the conspiracy.

531
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,360
Oh, Bob's been good to me.

532
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,020
Praise Bob.

533
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,800
Yes.

534
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,520
We all know.

535
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,440
We all know from our infancy, from our earliest sensations in our cradle that Bob is out

536
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,700
there lurking perhaps just beyond the edge of the cradle or somewhere not immediately

537
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,420
visible.

538
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:50,440
Then in our later years, we make crude images of Bob and come to a greater understanding.

539
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,040
And finally, we reach the effulgent Dobbs head itself.

540
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,760
Now we are on that unstoppable.

541
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:03,180
Unstoppable magnetic track, which will ultimately end at the punchline.

542
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:04,940
Yeah.

543
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,700
And by the way, you don't want to be indoors at 7 a.m. this Sunday.

544
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,480
You can be jerked through the roof.

545
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,980
No matter what is overhead.

546
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,040
And jerked out of your skin as Apollo flayed the satyr Marcius.

547
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,660
It'll only hurt for a little while.

548
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,640
It might seem like an eternity, but in truth, it won't be long at all.

549
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,440
Like ripping off the bandage.

550
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,020
It's something that I've been doing for a long time.

551
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


552
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


553
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


554
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


555
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


556
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


557
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,020


558
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,820
It's something that needs to be done in this little moment of wakefulness.

559
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,260
And after that, an eons load of bliss.

560
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,620
Right.

561
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,120
When you see your fellow subgeniuses screaming and bursting into flame.

562
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,080
Or just bursting.

563
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,780
And it starts to happen to you.

564
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,480
Don't worry.

565
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,500
It's just like throwing off an old shoe.

566
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,980
And don't try to put them out.

567
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,960
Please don't put them out.

568
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,840
As a snake shakes its skin, or perhaps even as a newly fledged butterfly emerges from

569
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,300
the chrysalis.

570
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,520
It's given up grubby prison.

571
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,380
The cicada leaves its exoskeleton on the tree.

572
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,360
When I give up, when I shed my body, I'm going to eat it just like our newt eats its own

573
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,800
skin every time it sheds.

574
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,600
Yeah, you are supposed to eat that stuff.

575
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,040
It helps you in your new life.

576
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,140
Well, it helps build up immunities too.

577
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,260
Build strong bones, including some you didn't have before you were ruptured.

578
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,520
Some subgeniuses.

579
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,380
The bacula, for example, gentlemen, you'll have one of those.

580
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm going to have one of those.

581
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,480
Some subgeniuses are what we would call health food nuts.

582
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,140
Yes, they look like they're at death's door.

583
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,000
They're thin, starveling, wispy, gray.

584
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,920
They look as if a good strong wind would knock them ass over tea kettle.

585
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:51,280
And maybe it would, but they are not at least chomping down the toxic garbage-filled tit

586
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,180
of the conspiracy.

587
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,200
Well, on the other hand, though, there are subgeniuses who do deliver.

588
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,180
They deliberately chomp down the garbage of the conspiracy because it's part of the

589
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
industrial diet.

590
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,120
It creates immunities straight through disfigurement.

591
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,100
It creates mutation, as we call them, mutants.

592
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,700
Booger eating is something that will increase your immunity.

593
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,200
They did a study in England and found that people who ate their own boogers generally

594
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,280
got sick a lot less than everybody else.

595
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,880
Well, they just thought they were eating the regular English diet.

596
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,960
If anybody, you know, I've got plenty here if anybody wants to use a...

597
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,800
Oh, you're talking about interpersonal booger eating.

598
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
That is a different matter.

599
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,520
No, no.

600
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah, I was just kidding.

601
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,160
Oh, speaking of kidding, friends, the Bob back there, that's really a dummy.

602
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,220
That's not really Bob.

603
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:51,260
I just wanted, in case some of you subgeniuses get overeager, it's still good for...

604
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,780
A lot of overeager things.

605
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,020
A lot of all the things.

606
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,880
A lot of the things Bob's good for.

607
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,460
As she's finding out right there, you can get your hand right up there and you can go,

608
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,340
hoo-ha!

609
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,660
And you'll notice that he's been used a bit.

610
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,320
But then who hasn't?

611
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:06,460
He's been around.

612
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,600
He's been at many an ex-day.

613
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,600
Nobody's a fair-haired boy anymore in this organization.

614
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,760
There's some wear and tear.

615
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:20,000
He was used for archery target practice at one point.

616
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,860
And arch remarks and snarky comments.

617
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,320
Just bounce off his hide.

618
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,740
Is that for Hal?

619
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,080
No, this is for Hal.

620
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,380
Oh.

621
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,800
Did you need one?

622
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,440
No, I'm fine.

623
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:37,700
Yes, ladies and germs, we plan to deliver on every promise.

624
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,040
And if you don't believe me, just see Reverend Ivan Stang.

625
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,580
No.

626
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,080
No, friends.

627
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,460
Just kidding.

628
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:46,860
Please.

629
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,800
This Sunday morning at 7, I know most of you are going to sleep in.

630
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,840
I know from experience that you're going to sleep in.

631
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:52,840


632
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:52,840


633
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,140
I know from experience.

634
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,360
Only at the heartiest few are out there.

635
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,360
Assemble in the middle of the downpour.

636
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,400
At 7 in the middle of the downpour.

637
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,960
But we will have Kool-Aid, I hope, this time.

638
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,080
We will have the Kool-Aid.

639
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,260
Historically, it should be Flavor Aid.

640
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,100
By the way, did you know-

641
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,000
Flavor Aid?

642
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,800
Yes.

643
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,200
At Jonestown, they drank that, not Kool-Aid.

644
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,300
Flavor Aid.

645
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,160
F-A-V-R-A-I-D.

646
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,820
That's like, what's the name of that?

647
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:22,820


648
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:22,820


649
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,640
We Are Dough.

650
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,220
In my nightclub act, if I may mention that for just a moment, this is the only time I

651
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,580
ever will, we use three chairs at the place we are in now, the Bob Dobbs Memorial Hall.

652
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,800
Those three chairs came from Jim Jones People's Temple, the chair that I, the host, and the

653
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,500
guest sit in.

654
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:43,580
Wow.

655
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,620
I did not know that.

656
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,180
Yes.

657
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,260
I didn't know that either.

658
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,080
We use them.

659
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,960
They have a certain emanation that helps us during what we call the K-Rob moment.

660
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,800
Is that something?

661
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,720
Yes.

662
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,560
They carry the current.

663
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,420
The seats upon which the asses of the doomed sat.

664
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,240
Yeah, they did.

665
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,840
They had something to chew over and mull over at times of inactivity.

666
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,980
Friends, don't worry, we won't put cyanide in the Kool-Aid here until we can beat their

667
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,400
record.

668
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,620
Unnecessary.

669
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Of 999 victims.

670
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,780
Yeah.

671
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:19,060
So until we can get a thousand people all going, knocking back that Kool-Aid at 7 AM

672
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,520
and going, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

673
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah.

674
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,220
We're still searching for that magic bullet discovered by Edward G. Robinson or by Dr.

675
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,100
Paul Ehrlich in his fight against syphilis, but we are convinced there is another magic

676
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,780
bullet which will undo the effects of what we are pleased to call pinkness.

677
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,140
And this bullet is a chemical trigger.

678
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,500
I can tell you that.

679
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,460
I can tell you that right now.

680
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,080
It creates a tropism.

681
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,160
Once one starts on that path, one cannot go back.

682
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,400
It's as though there were barbs like an Indian war arrow that only allowed to go forward

683
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,320
and not back.

684
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:14,260
But there's no point even in mentioning this because you will all know viscerally what I

685
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,900
am now describing in a cold intellectual fashion.

686
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,320
It is kind of cold.

687
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Yep.

688
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,880
Yeah.

689
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,140
Can you believe this is July?

690
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,160
But you never know.

691
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,860
It's chill and risky.

692
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,460
Tomorrow it could be 100 degrees and sweltering.

693
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,260
Weird weather.

694
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:33,880
Perfect.

695
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,820
Weird weather.

696
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,300
Did you say you wanted some whiskey?

697
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,360
Here you go.

698
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,720
Let's talk real quick to Bob.

699
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,900
The chicken and the egg came at the same time.

700
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,240
All right.

701
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,320
So Bob's going to break the tie.

702
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,720
Hang on one second here.

703
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,640
Bob?

704
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,360
Bob?

705
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Bob?

706
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,620
Hello?

707
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,020
You're breaking a tie.

708
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,880
So it's very exciting.

709
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,480
The egg is broken.

710
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


711
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


712
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


713
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


714
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


715
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


716
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


717
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:51,480


718
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
Do you have any guesses of which came first?

719
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,960
Well, you know, I have my theories, but you tell me.

720
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
It was the egg.

721
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,820
The egg came first.

722
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,180
The egg came first.

723
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,840
We have solved the problem.

724
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,480
Wow.

725
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,400
One of the great mysteries of life.

726
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,580
And the chicken came second.

727
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,020
I am special to brother chicken.

728
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,720
Yes, you are.

729
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,460
Yes, you are, Bob.

730
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,860
And I will keep that forever.

731
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,260
Thank you.

732
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,660
Thank you, Bob.

733
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,760
Thanks for calling, Bob.

734
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,000
Bye.

735
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,000


736
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,400
Bye.

737
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,820
Well, that solves that problem.

738
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,420
How about that?

739
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,880
That's done.

740
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,540
How many years has man wondered and pondered?

741
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:18,760
Now we know.

742
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,360
And it took Bob to solve it.

743
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,520
Yeah.

744
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,860
And at 5 o'clock, the Quijibo snooty beer and wife swapping party, which will be followed

745
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:36,460
by the un-costumed ball at 7.30, and then at 8.15, all the rowdy, countrified types

746
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,240
will enjoy the John Deere tractor beam pull.

747
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,600
Yee-haw!

748
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,240
That's at 8.15.

749
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,000
John Deere tractor beam.

750
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,080
Bye, Cracky.

751
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,640
That's going to be a beach party, by the way, and this is perfect weather for

752
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:48,780
bikinis and beach bars and stuff.

753
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,640
For subgenius beach party.

754
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:50,960
Yes.

755
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,020
Get the bikinis and obnoxious beach music going.

756
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,660
Subgenius beach party?

757
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah.

758
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,500
Right.

759
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,820
Yeah.

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,320
Subgenius beach party.

761
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,760
Yes.

762
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:07,080
As we stand on the shore of the world's ocean, the ocean of destruction, we can throw up

763
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:14,360
our hands in despair and gyrate mechanically to the subgenius beach party, the thrilling

764
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,540
sounds of Dick Dale and other surf masters.

765
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:18,620
I love that.

766
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,360
I'm beat.

767
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,460
Let's go, monsters.

768
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
I've seen this before.

769
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,340
It's really you, sidemen it.

770
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,340


771
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,340


772
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,360
I've got my psychos for your stเพ.

773
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,860
You know, in孙 Trần Sơn's

774
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:44,860


775
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,280
All right.

776
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,640
Thank you.

777
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,000
Thank you.

778
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,680
Thank you.

779
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,640
Thank you.

780
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,080
Thank you.

781
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,560
Thank you.

782
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,620
Thank you.

783
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:37,780
Thank you.

784
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:37,940
Thank you.

785
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,000
Thank you.

786
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000


787
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000


788
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000


789
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000


790
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000


791
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:45,260
John Deere tractor beam live at 12X day available from MySpace.com.

792
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,260


793
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,300
MySpace.com slash John Deere tractor beam.

794
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,120
And they only put two E's in John Deere.

795
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:58,820
And you might also want to check out TheAminoAcids.com where you can see their new horror movie, Honest.

796
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,360
The collages we heard interspersed with the blabber were by Norrell Preff,

797
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,120
except for one by Reverend Susie DeFluzzi from her subgenius show on WREK Atlanta.

798
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,600
That's WREK.org if you ever want to hear her show, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

799
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,320
And we heard a clip from the movie Wise Blood.

800
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,520
Now, although you may have missed X Day Friend, there are other devivals coming up,

801
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,920
such as Dragon Con in Atlanta on September 6th weekend and Portland, Oregon devival in October.

802
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,180
And if you want to know more, you can see subgenius.com events.

803
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,120
Or to see pictures of any of this, you can look at subgenius.com.

804
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,220
And see even Fat Man D.

805
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,460
Who you will hear singing at X Day presently.

806
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,520
But first, something gay from Fernanda Namby, Lee Murr.

807
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,780
Yeah.

808
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,940
Well, I'm gay.

809
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm afraid you and I will need personal boys.

810
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,760
Yeah, all right.

811
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,240
I hope he has his nose.

812
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
I'm happy to see it.

813
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,880
In just a moment, we will learn what adventures befall Tarzan.

814
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,520
Great.

815
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,580
Oh.

816
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,220
Oh.

817
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,240
Huh?

818
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,100
Mm-hmm.

819
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,200
Now get going.

820
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,860
Tarzan.

821
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,640
Tarzan wound through a tangled bamboo forest.

822
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Tarzan kicked it savagely and fled.

823
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,160
Tarzan thundered away.

824
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,380
Well?

825
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060
You're like a stupid baby ape.

826
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,080
A what?

827
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,020
A stupid baby ape.

828
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:02,860
Hey.

829
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,680
Hey.

830
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,440
Hey.

831
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,140
Hey, you.

832
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:05,920
Hey.

833
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,680
Hey, pals.

834
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,420
For the last time, I'm gay.

835
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,200
I see.

836
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,380
Hey.

837
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,700
He's enough.

838
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,800
Still.

839
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,720
Wow.

840
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,840

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:41,900
ільки.

842
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,120
Why Nomary?

843
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,340
Gandhi lives and Gandhi breathes, but only if you so believe.

844
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:58,220
You act as if you were a saint, well Gandhi is a neutral saint.

845
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:05,620
Gandhi is alive and well, he's living in a big hotel.

846
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:11,260
God èlake socock, Alive or dead get Michael

847
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,520

851
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,440
God lives when you're not so.

852
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,200
Put down your arms and heed the call.

853
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
Because of the dust, the desert sounds.

854
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,540
The day of karma is at hand.

855
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,380
God is just like a king.

856
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,880
And everybody does their thing.

857
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:11,740
So how can you just hang around while High tranquil gondi is in town?

858
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,020
ей

859
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,540
Though

860
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:46,180
Go and shake to the Gandhi Shake Oil- pizzy frown

861
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:55,720
Oh, everybody, from here to Canada and beyond, we are all doing the Gandhi Shake.

862
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,960
I want you should meet my husband, ladies and gentlemen.

863
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,940
The one and only Tommy Amoeba, the lowest form of life.

864
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,880
He wrote this tune.

865
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,680
They are lovely amoebas, aren't they?

866
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,240
Give it up for our wild, limp, ladies and gentlemen.

867
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,220
Isn't she beautiful?

868
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,680
Shake, shake, shake.

869
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,000
Shake, shake, shake.

870
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,540
Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen.

871
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,320
I have washed in the blood of the Bob.

872
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,060
I have bathed in the blood of the Bob.

873
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,420
I have drunk from the blood of the Bob.

874
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,700
And in that time since then and now,

875
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,440
I have realized that if you can't sing a bluegrass song about Gandhi at X Day,

876
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,620
then I don't know where you can.

877
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,080
Nowhere, baby.

878
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,660
Maybe Fat Man D is right,

879
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,460
and you can hear more of her rightness and wrongness at FatManD.com,

880
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,640
spelled P-H-A-T-M-A-N-D-E-E.

881
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,280
Yes, Friday is going to be an event-filled day.

882
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:50,580
After the 9 o'clock Fat Man D explosion at 9.30,

883
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,980
Dr. Legume's Weird Ritual Party will commence.

884
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,080
And while this is all going on,

885
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:56,800
parties.

886
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,120
We will erupt forth at various camps.

887
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,940
Wrenched open and jammed in.

888
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,220
Erupt.

889
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,980
And joy will be unconfined.

890
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,140
With a Latin root there.

891
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,800
Unbridled.

892
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,720
Dr. Howard, no?

893
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,460
Erupt.

894
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:13,880
Erupt.

895
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,500
Rupture.

896
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,540
Are they word history etymology similar?

897
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,320
Actually, they come from the same root.

898
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,280
The same root, and that root is rape.

899
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,580
Rapio.

900
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,420
Disease.

901
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,220
To ravish.

902
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,720
To rape, actually.

903
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,980
But that is not...

904
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,940
Is being enwrapped.

905
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,320
Yeah.

906
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,960
Enwrapped?

907
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,400
Yes.

908
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,480
The rape tour.

909
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,780
Nobody said it wasn't going to hurt.

910
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,180
You see, all these ecstatic images that people are shown

911
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,840
are just sort of anesthesia for what they actually expect.

912
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,060
Don't they focus on the rapist?

913
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,780
You ever notice that the sound you make is...

914
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,040
Nobody cares.

915
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,060
...when you're...

916
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,700
When you're a female and you're hurt,

917
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,000
you ever notice that the moans and groans you make from being hurt

918
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,620
sound a lot like when you're having sex?

919
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh, many have noticed this.

920
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,500
I've noticed it in them.

921
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,560
Now, there is a contingency plan,

922
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,300
even if this fabled rupture does not occur.

923
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,900
If we are not caught up in the clouds,

924
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,040
in the embrace of the sex goddesses,

925
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,400
there is a consolation,

926
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,060
and that consolation,

927
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,360
will be Reverend V. and Reverend N.E.'s pancake feast.

928
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,000
Yes.

929
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,060
Not scheduled, because, of course,

930
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,660
all times after the predicted rupture are unknown.

931
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,420
But if time does reestablish itself,

932
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,700
the coveted Bobby Awards will be given out.

933
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,900
Oh, yes, the Bobbies will be fighting tooth and nail

934
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,080
for these proud decorations.

935
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,120
Oh, the Bobby Awards are incredible.

936
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,060
It's a big thing.

937
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,060


938
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,080
And, of course, you need to stay back from the seething,

939
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,860
writhing mob of Bobby's,

940
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,520
because your personal injury could result.

941
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,120
Yes, sir, I'm heaven.

942
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,160
Are you going to heaven?

943
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,340
Yes, sir, I'm heaven.

944
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,400
Are you going to heaven?

945
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,980
Yes, sir.

946
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,460
Yes, sir.

947
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,900
Man, I can't even count.

948
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,020
Yeah.

949
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,940
Sexual desire.

950
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,020
Yeah.

951
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,560
Yes.

952
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,080
Oh, okay, okay.

953
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:22,760
Yes, sir.

954
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,140
I'm trying to put my finger on it.

955
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,040
What are we looking at?

956
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,100
Well, oh, my goodness.

957
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:26,520
Hey.

958
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:26,640
Hey.

959
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,060
Okay.

960
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,720
Okay.

961
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,100
Okay.

962
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,660
Give up.

963
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,420
We love the darkness.

964
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,400
We don't know God.

965
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,060
Give up drives me crazy.

966
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,800
This doesn't do anything.

967
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,300
How about this one?

968
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,160
I had a man that I was friends with.

969
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,460
I could kiss my friends.

970
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:40,960
Absolutely.

971
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,800
Religion is number two.

972
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,120
Oh, oh, oh, dumb.

973
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,700
Give up.

974
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:46,980
Give up.

975
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,820
Get away.

976
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,160
Get away.

977
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,640
Feel good.

978
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,080
Feel good.

979
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,240
Cool.

980
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,800
Is your church going purr, purr, purr, purr, purr, purr?

981
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,720
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe.

982
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,140
Heaven.

983
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,640
I actually went out and had sex with guys.

984
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:56,280
Mm-hmm.

985
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,300
I don't know how to do that.

986
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,900
I'm going to lust and do things.

987
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,100
I'll spew out of my mouth.

988
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,500
So no, no.

989
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,360
I committed adultery and committed murder and lied and stole.

990
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,420
How about this one?

991
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:05,860
Really.

992
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:06,980
Pant, pant.

993
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:07,660
Pant, pant.

994
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,220
To win.

995
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,920
They call to win.

996
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,800
They call to win.

997
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,480
They call to win.

998
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,000
They call to win.

999
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,560
They call to win.

1000
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,100
They call to win.

1001
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:12,520
They call to win.

1002
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,060
They call to win.

1003
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,640
They call to win.

1004
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:13,840
They call to win.

1005
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,040
They call to win.

1006
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,120
They call to win.

1007
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,660
Following directly after that comes the historic Bull Dada auction.

1008
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,940
And prepare to reach into that deepest, most sensitive part of yourself,

1009
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,380
your wallet.

1010
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,140
To prepare for this important part of X Day 12.

1011
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,580
That's the most important organ in your body.

1012
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,220
Yes.

1013
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:35,960
Your wallet.

1014
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:36,560
Yes.

1015
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,740
We don't refer to the sole wallet, but to your regulation wallet,

1016
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,640
which contains your worthless, valueless pieces of conspiracy paper,

1017
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,100
so-called money.

1018
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,000
How we laugh at money.

1019
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:50,860
Ha, ha!

1020
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,240
We laugh at money.

1021
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,900
The idea of monetary value, of false value,

1022
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,500
which is the idea of money.

1023
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:56,500


1024
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Which only exists because everyone concurs in it.

1025
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,840
How worthless it is.

1026
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,140
Yes, we snap our fingers and...

1027
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,620
Now everybody's starting to lose faith in it.

1028
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,180
Yes.

1029
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:14,760
The only way to regain faith in it is to give it up to a certified subgenius minister or

1030
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,320
practitioner.

1031
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,920
And when you see it applied toward a worthy goal, then it does have worth and your faith

1032
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,500
in the American dollar is worth.

1033
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
It's regenerated.

1034
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:27,660
Right.

1035
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,660
When you see Princess Wee and I spending that dollar you gave us on Moldovan wine, you know

1036
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,600
that it's well spent.

1037
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,780
It's spent a lot more wisely than you spent it, now wasn't it?

1038
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:44,100
And money donated to my private foundation will purchase a new generation of plastic

1039
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,840
dinosaurs.

1040
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:52,600
And my pledge is that none will be spent on medical matters, rent, or groceries.

1041
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,500
I will not be a doctor.

1042
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:56,500


1043
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:56,500


1044
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:06,160
I wishmas, I wishmas, I wishmas, and a wishmas, wee wishmas, wee wishmas, and a wishmas, wee

1045
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,200
wishmas, wee wishmas.

1046
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:14,320
I wish this X Day thing would hurry up and happen.

1047
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,860
Thanks to Leigh Murr for that collage and to Norell for the one a little earlier and especially

1048
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:26,480
to Dr. Howell of AskDrHowell.com for lending us his brand new bottle of wine.

1049
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,480


1050
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,480


1051
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,900
Thanks to the band Free Cake for the show.

1052
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,020
Which is the band heard in the background playing live at X Day.

1053
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,160
That's Free Cake.

1054
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:42,060
But now, now that I, your host, Reverend Ivan Stang, have finished up in this chem toilet

1055
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:47,140
I'm recording from, I must return in time to that stage one month ago.

1056
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,420
I see Reverend Stang is joining us and...

1057
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,300
I just figured out why they take the Jenkin signs down.

1058
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,040
Oh no.

1059
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,120
It's not Jenkin, they pour disinfectant in there.

1060
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,560
That horrible bubble gum smelling chemical stuff wafts up to replace the honest Jenkin

1061
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,640
that you might be with.

1062
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,300
Aren't you hiding all of us of our Jenkin?

1063
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:15,160
I stuck my head down in there to get a good hit, you know, planning to see my ancestors

1064
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,000
and so forth.

1065
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:22,660
But no, if you get a, if you huff the disinfectant you see your descendants and that's depressing,

1066
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,760
believe me.

1067
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,980
So, uh...

1068
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:26,460
I'm a little bit of a...

1069
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,900
Oh, you're a little bit of a...

1070
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,700
Would you like to smell that?

1071
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,040
It's sad, yeah, it's like you'd have to create your own Jenkin chamber because they've wrecked

1072
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:32,540
all of these.

1073
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,460
4.55pm, Ben and I went down the hall to the neighborhood bar.

1074
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,800
8pm.

1075
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,560
6.48pm.

1076
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,080
7-7-7.

1077
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,060
7-7-7.

1078
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,160
That's 7-7-7.

1079
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,560
7-7-7.

1080
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,140
7.

1081
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:56,440
7.

1082
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1083
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1084
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1085
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1086
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1087
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1088
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1089
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1090
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:56,440


1091
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,200
2.00pm.

1092
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,460
9.15pm.

1093
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,280
Ben and I drove directly to the bar on North Ferris Avenue, the 1322 Club.

1094
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,820
10.45pm.

1095
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,840
Ben and I drove to the 1322 Club on North Ferris where we located the neighborhood bar.

1096
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:15,940
11.20pm.

1097
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,700
We drove to the neighborhood bar on North Ferris Avenue.

1098
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,500
Yeah?

1099
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,100
Yeah.

1100
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,440
Bye.

1101
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,040
Uh, so we're here at X Day 12.

1102
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,440
We're here at the X Day 12.

1103
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,440


1104
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:32,260
We're wrapping up a long laundry list of last minute details before we get ready to troop

1105
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:38,020
hand in hand aboard the gleaming lowered ramps of the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.

1106
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:41,440
And that will occur at X Day 12.

1107
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:47,400
It's not for nothing that the hand has gone completely around the great dial and will

1108
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:55,500
strike the stroke of subgenius midnight at 7.05am on July 5th, so-called 2009.

1109
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,420
9.15pm.

1110
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,780
And I know it's taken me a long time to put my affairs in order.

1111
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,700
A long time of filing, erasing, deleting, all of that.

1112
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,060
But I think I am at least prepared for the first phase.

1113
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:21,600
And it would be a good idea for each and every one of you to get your houses in order.

1114
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,120
For ye never know when the master cometh.

1115
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,300
And then there's a huge mess to clean up.

1116
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:33,300
Uh, you can vouch that just before we left for X Day, Princess, we and I had our wills

1117
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,060
signed.

1118
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:34,860
That's right.

1119
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,540
These guys were seated at the table in the dining room going over their wills.

1120
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,600
Hey, what's with, what's this 7.05 stuff?

1121
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,400
Uh, the thing is-

1122
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,940
7.05?

1123
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,860
I thought they were supposed to come at 7.

1124
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:54,440
Uh, I have the original scriptures, the original doctrines said 7.05, but, uh, I, if they come

1125
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,480
five minutes early, uh, who knows, uh, um, 7.05 might just be, you know, uh, like-

1126
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,020
We don't know what year this is.

1127
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,860
We don't know what planet this is.

1128
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,560
In the San Francisco Bay Area, many of us take the B-A-R-T train or BART, and the BART

1129
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,800
signs always tell you when the train's coming.

1130
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,100
Well, when they tell you there's two more minutes, it's actually already there, and

1131
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,000
you can see the lights in the tunnel as it rushes towards you.

1132
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,200
And it's the same with these saucers.

1133
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,420
Uh, 7.05.

1134
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,440
7.05 is, and 7.05 are to all practical purposes interchangeable.

1135
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:30,780
I see.

1136
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:37,760
Uh, unlike the Christians and their Namby Pamby rapture, we are not instantly transected

1137
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,960
aboard those saucers.

1138
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,840
There's a certain amount of joyous hustle and bustle, like a cruise ship leaving port.

1139
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,360
There's the confetti, the bilious belching and swilling of champagne, the, uh, tears,

1140
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,280
the blowing of nose in scented, uh, handkerchiefs.

1141
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,640
And then, uh, finally the ascent.

1142
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:03,200
Uh, and now I think Modemak is going out to spread his message of subgenius joy and cheer.

1143
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,320
We're so fortunate to have you, Dr. Held, because you understand all of these things

1144
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,560
about the, the numbers and everything, the, the numbers of minutes.

1145
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,400
Well, I seem to understand them instinctively.

1146
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,480
I have a picture of it in my mind.

1147
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:23,080
I couldn't tell you exactly how I got there, but I'm confident that this is the way it

1148
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:23,600
will be.

1149
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:31,040
And you can have the confidence of Dr. Held if you have the confidence in Bob.

1150
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,720
For Bob is a holy man and he has a church, a church of the subgenius, my friend, and

1151
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:44,140
a website where you can learn all about that church and its awful people at subgenius.com.

1152
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,420
By the way, subgenius does not have an O in it.

1153
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,380
Or you may submit.

1154
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,260
Yes, you may submit your own subgenial workbook.

1155
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:54,260


1156
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:54,260


1157
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,460
And you can send it to us at P.O.

1158
00:58:55,460 --> 00:59:05,380
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 if you dare, because we don't know what's going

1159
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,520
to happen or even what did happen.

1160
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,600
And then there's the horrible theory that the sub gene that everything went wrong in

1161
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,780
the original 1998.

1162
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:21,720
And we're stuck in a loop where for all eternity, it's seven o'clock in the morning and nothing

1163
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,380
has happened.

1164
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,580
Forever.

1165
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,040
And ever and ever.
