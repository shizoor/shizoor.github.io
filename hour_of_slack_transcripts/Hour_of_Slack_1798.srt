1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,640
It was in the year of 1982 that spacemen first discovered the great galactic barrier.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,780
In the past ten years, rocket travel to the moon and the mirror planets had become commonplace.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,100
And yet, the explorers refused to admit defeat.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,420
It was on June the 2nd, 1987, that the rocket Starcloud made ready for takeoff.

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,200
Now hear this! Now hear this!

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,440
The Self Genius! Our own self!

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,920
Don't bother me for a while, I'm busy!

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,860
Stupid idiot.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,420
We'll have to reintegrate the whole works!

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,300
Prepare to blast off.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,460
Four, three, zero.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,660
Fire up number one cyclotron.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,380
Number one ready.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
Fire up number two.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,300
Number two ready.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,840
I think that's rubbish.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,200
What do you think?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh, I think it's terrible.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
At least it won't be boring.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,940
God, this is weird.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,860
We'll do it anyway.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,000
Friends, welcome to the Starwood 39.5 Subgenius Devival.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,340
But before we get started,

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:35,300
I hope that we can all kind of bow our heads and have a respectful, sober moment of sacred noise!

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,380
Yes, friends, thanks for coming.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:51,620
Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity, said someone named Simone Wheel.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,280
You're very generous to pay attention.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,220
I'm just assuming that you are.

29
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,600
Probably half of you smoking reefers and stuff.

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,480
I can't do this from my giant pulpit,

31
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,660
because we left that in storage at Wisteria,

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,380
with that shipping container that we share with our sister cult, ACE.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,480
So it's just my desk.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,860
But I've got the same video projection in the background.

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,400
We're in deepest rural north central California.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm in central Texas on a goat ranch just outside of a really small, weird, Twin Peaks-like town called Glen Rose.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
But I've been at Starwood.

38
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,120
I've actually been attending, like I do in regular Starwoods, Lurking.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,140
In that my wife has had it on right behind me on the other side of the room.

40
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,820
Princess Wee has been hosting things at Starwoods and going to workshops and stuff.

41
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,760
So I've heard a whole bunch of those, a whole lot of it.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,800
It's been kind of fun.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,420
It's strangely realistic, isn't it?

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,960
We had that experience at the Virtual X Day.

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,560
It's like the standing around in the middle of the road talking part of the festival,

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
which is really, I think, everybody's favorite part.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,080
Sitting around the campfires and talking.

48
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,860
I mean, the music shows and presentations are fun,

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,060
but really, I think what everybody's really paying for is to see their friends.

50
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,420
And you can do that without the sweating and the ticks.

51
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,700
The Matrix isn't that bad, I guess.

52
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,220
You can still have that lobster dinner in the Matrix.

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,540
And it's great to be at the almost 40th Starwood,

54
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,220
the weirdest Starwood because of the lack of sweating and mud.

55
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,720
Maybe some of you guys have mud.

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,660
We have the heat.

57
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,040
All I've got to do is open the window.

58
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,000
It'll be 103 degrees.

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,580
It'll be just like the real Starwood.

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,700
It's also, by the way, friends,

61
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,380
this is the 40th anniversary of the Church of the Subgenius beginning outreach,

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,340
the first public reveal of Church of the Subgenius.

63
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,340
We printed the first pamphlet in January of 1980.

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,660
So it's 40 years for Starwood, 40 years for Church of the Subgenius,

65
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,420
and I believe 40 years for Burning Man,

66
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,400
which also started at the same time as a weird little party.

67
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,080
God, when I was 10 years old,

68
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,460
I couldn't believe how long it took to get to be 10 years old.

69
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,420
And now I can't believe how quickly I reached 66.

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,700
In fact, it seems a little faster than the first 10 years.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,080
And we're still doing X-Day.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,660
This year we had to rupture in place, friends.

73
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,340
Our original plan was to have it on a cruise ship,

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,180
but we couldn't book one in time.

75
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,220
It would have been packed.

76
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,700
It would have been perfect.

77
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,400
The cruise ship X-Day.

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
What a concept.

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,540
But instead we provided a fully expense-paid trip to X-Day

80
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,240
right in your own home.

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,280
We let a thousand little X-Days bloom.

82
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,620
Because we know that if we,

83
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,700
we who joined the Church formally with that little $35 stipend,

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,800
that therefore the men from Planet X

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,660
have our addresses.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,640
I certainly have everybody's address.

87
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,000
So despite the COVID and everything,

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,760
we laughed till our lungs bled anyway.

89
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,940
Isn't that charming?

90
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,560
We even managed to have a big burning bob.

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,100
At X-Day's usually we don't have a giant bonfire like Starwood.

92
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,940
In fact, we don't really know the secret of fire.

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,620
We are reliant on the pagans.

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,500
We don't have the tools to start those.

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,140
But this time we had a full life-size,

96
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,700
very realistic Dobbs dummy nailed to a huge wooden icon

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,480
surrounded by little funny signs that were put together by Hypercube.

98
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,120
And explosions.

99
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,180
Man, when he set that thing on fire,

100
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
there were explosions and huge flames.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,660
And it wasn't until I saw his home movies the next day

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,440
that I realized it was a miniature set.

103
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,940
It was a skillfully done miniature

104
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,440
using forced perspective to make it...

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,600
It fooled me.

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,520
Of course, I'm, you know, we didn't call it Church of the Genius.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,120
Anyway, friends, Bob preaches Slack

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,340
and he leads by example,

109
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,040
which is why he's not here

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,660
and I'm the one who has to work.

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,080
But besides preaching Slack, he also provided warnings.

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,460
He's been warning us.

113
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,940
That all this was going to happen since 1953.

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,000
In fact, his most succinct and true prophecy was,

115
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,840
it's going to be a bummer, man.

116
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,720
Bob said in 1953,

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,440
it's going to be a bummer, man.

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,240
Can anyone argue with that?

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,100
I mean, aside from the fact that everybody says,

120
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,100
dude, I mean, bro, bro, whatever nowadays,

121
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,540
instead of man.

122
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,580
And in the interim,

123
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,460
every year we thought it couldn't get any worse.

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,220
You know, Nixon.

125
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,260
Oh, God.

126
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,400
Couldn't get any worse than this.

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
Reagan. The Reagan years.

128
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,120
Most corrupt administration.

129
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,120
Almost everybody he hired went to jail.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,100
Oh, God. Couldn't get any worse than this.

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,280
Then Emperor Bush the first.

132
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,360
Then the other Bush.

133
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,820
And some people would have to gripe about poor old Carter,

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,620
poor old Clinton and Obama.

135
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,320
Poor sad things.

136
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,180
But couldn't possibly get any.

137
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,380
And now in 2019, a whole lot of us,

138
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,200
I heard this all the time last year.

139
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,560
Oh, man, this has been a horrible year.

140
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,480
It's because a lot of our friends died.

141
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,180
Had tragedies.

142
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,740
And we're going, 2020 is going to be so much better.

143
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,420
Oh, it's going to be great.

144
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,340
Can't possibly get any worse.

145
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,020
Can't possibly get any worse than this.

146
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,980
Now we're at the point where we can almost honestly say,

147
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,820
oh, it can't get any worse than this.

148
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm afraid old Bob's got a few things up his sleeve yet to come, friends.

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
You better be ready.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,380
Just as the birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the Cretaceous extinction event,

151
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,020
it kind of figures that the survivors of our current extinction event,

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,320
the ones that will evolve into the next tool you use,

153
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,280
and screw up the world again,

154
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,100
would be buzzards.

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,540
The carrion eaters.

156
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,460
Vultures.

157
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,420
That's the next civilization.

158
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,960
The last humans, of course, will be morticians and grave diggers.

159
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
But the buzzards will still be around after them.

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,080
So, as Bob said for the first time last week,

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,400
it sucks to be born every minute.

162
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,260
As Bizarro Bob said,

163
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,020
all subgeniuses everywhere always get everything they want.

164
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,020
But that was Bizarro Bob.

165
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,560
Bizarro Bob hates slack.

166
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,140
So, yeah, the world's in horrible shape,

167
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,720
and everybody's scared as hell,

168
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,260
and it's in times like these that the Church of the Subgenius makes really pretty good money.

169
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,600
When we announced that our t-shirts could be used like that,

170
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,620
all of a sudden we ran out of t-shirts.

171
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,480
And then the t-shirt guy, Reverend Thaddeus,

172
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,360
started making bandanas.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,880
He was able to make bandanas like that one.

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,900
And, oh, God, we just suddenly were rolling in it.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,100
Isn't that ironic, you know?

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,780
They're flying off the shelves,

177
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,100
and we're saving like five to eight souls a day buying memberships.

178
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,580
But, as Bob also said,

179
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,980
in the pre-Scriptures,

180
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,920
there will be a long and hard time of false slack for the masses.

181
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,560
Now, I got to thinking about Bob's prophecies,

182
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,560
and it's been a long time since I looked at the Dateline for Dominance

183
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
in the Book of the Subgenius.

184
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,800
And this morning I got it out,

185
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,540
because I used to think, well, these weren't very accurate.

186
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,120
It seemed we didn't have the years right,

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,420
and a lot of the things that we predicted

188
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
didn't happen that we know of.

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,340
But, I was shocked to see just how accurate they are for this year.

190
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,300
These were all written down in 1981,

191
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,380
okay, or 82,

192
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,060
when the first edition of the Book of the Subgenius came out.

193
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,600
These are all predictions from that time.

194
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,520
Creationism and school prayer upheld in major court decision

195
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,260
as legitimate science.

196
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,660
That seemed like science fiction back then, didn't it?

197
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,260
Highest unemployment rate in U.S. history under Prez clone.

198
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,400
False slack.

199
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,040
That's just the very beginning.

200
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,200
It gets sweatier here.

201
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,980
President Watt commits racial slurs

202
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,000
against Jews, blacks, other mutants.

203
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
Impeached.

204
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,420
President Watt.

205
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,760
Only the name was wrong.

206
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,460
What the fuck happened there?

207
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,220
Econocataclysm worsens.

208
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,720
This one's a little late.

209
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,220
Black rogue subgenius runs for president.

210
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,360
Embarrasses conspiracy.

211
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,740
I guess that one happened a while back.

212
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,320
Full frontal drugs and nudity

213
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,440
featured in top detective TV shows.

214
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,020
That's been going on for years now.

215
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,740
But it all seemed impossible.

216
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,200
In the 80s.

217
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,980
Reagan Prez clone reelected.

218
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,720
Ends all aid to poor.

219
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,720
Mines harbors of non-American countries.

220
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,180
A pink black woman almost becomes vice president

221
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,020
but is discredited when it's revealed

222
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,020
that she posed nude for Penthouse.

223
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,900
Severe toxic waste crisis in U.S.

224
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,040
adds to decimation of citizen trust in government.

225
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,240
Prez clone uses pop fantasy movie catchphrases

226
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,620
to describe insane space defense program.

227
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,120
We were ahead of our time, baby.

228
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,260
Well, Bob was.

229
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,500
America suffers massive economic collect.

230
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,700
Collapse.

231
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,480
Although it is called a drug porn crackdown.

232
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,520
Prez clone conditions public

233
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,160
with all American He-Man characters in media.

234
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,560
Then bombs Mid-East City

235
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,740
and thus squelches terrifying reports

236
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,940
on acid rain growing ozone layer hole.

237
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,440
Well, this is actually kind of,

238
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,380
some of this is old news.

239
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,900
It's all illustrated, you see.

240
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,260
Gotta keep it moving or the bobs will eat it.

241
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Civilization literally falling apart.

242
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,020
That was predicted for 1988.

243
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,720
A third sex is added to the human race.

244
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,820
Boy, I guess we had no idea

245
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,700
how many more there were than three.

246
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,420
American voters deliberately install

247
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,740
all powerful dictator as last hope for restoring order.

248
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,940
Plague created by recombinant DNA research

249
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,380
decimates 10% of world population.

250
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,240
Civilized people losing faith in modern medicine.

251
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,800
Traveling medicine shows hawking wonder drugs.

252
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,460
Miracle cures.

253
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,380
Psychic healing replaced scientific medicine.

254
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Synthetic food wars.

255
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,000
We didn't even know the term GMO back then.

256
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,740
Much less Wonder Burger or whatever it is.

257
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,280
The American dictator is now identified

258
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,640
by the church as the anti-bob.

259
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,820
Bulletproof robots run most convenience stores.

260
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,020
Average human lifespan is now figured at 40 years.

261
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,340
If you average in the,

262
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,460
or winning COVID rates,

263
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,940
that may be true,

264
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,440
20% of US population now considered clinically insane.

265
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,140
Actually, it's more like 36%.

266
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,960
Ozone layer depleted.

267
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,800
Earth unshielded from harmful radiation.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,900
Greenhouse effect begins to accelerate.

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,160
Average world temperature up 15 degrees.

270
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,800
Life on Earth stands a very good chance of being wiped out.

271
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,040
And that's just without X day.

272
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,880
Return of the seven-day work week and 14-hour work day.

273
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,240
Also known as work at home.

274
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,260
What we now call lunatic fringe kooks

275
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,980
account for 43% of the US population.

276
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,240
Oh, okay, that caught up.

277
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,580
The fifth civil war,

278
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
abnormals versus normals.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,620
Glaciers start melting.

280
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,780
Drought, mutation, environmental problems,

281
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,820
and pestilence.

282
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,400
Worse than already critical world famine.

283
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,420
Anti-Bob now runs global congress,

284
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,280
lording it over all aspects of ruined planet.

285
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,000
Terrorist tourism fad for the rich.

286
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,980
School teachers now regularly tortured in school by students.

287
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,520
Plague of mutant insects.

288
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,040
Murder wasps, anyone?

289
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
So,

290
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,180
oh, drug abuse religions cropping up.

291
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,640
So there you go, friends.

292
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,360
It's all here in the book of the subgenius.

293
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,220
On sale at our swag table over there.

294
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,620
Just go see Princess Weir, Steve Siddick,

295
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,900
oh wait, no, subgenius.com.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
Our swag table.

297
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,080
It's air conditioned.

298
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,840
All right.

299
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,900
Now, now I'll tell the story.

300
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,840
Of how I infiltrated the profile movement.

301
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,900
And I'm kind of surprised they haven't copped that name yet.

302
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,480
I made that up.

303
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,520
I was thinking.

304
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,380
Well, it came in the course of this report actually.

305
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,880
To infiltrate profile.

306
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,920
All I had to do.

307
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,840
Was moved to the small rural Texas town.

308
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,620
And get on the local Facebook pages.

309
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,880
Which I really like.

310
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,620
I really used to like.

311
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,120
At first, I mean, a couple of years ago.

312
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,220
The Facebook page for Glen Rose, Texas was mostly.

313
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,560
Here's my dog.

314
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,380
He's lost.

315
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,560
If anybody sees him, can you return him?

316
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,620
Or pictures of dogs saying, hey, we found this dog on our property.

317
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,020
Whose dog is this?

318
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
It always had a happy ending.

319
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,940
The dog always got found.

320
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,140
I helped find a dog.

321
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,500
And menus of the little restaurants and things around here.

322
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,280
It was about the best place to get.

323
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,460
What was that explosion?

324
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,500
You couldn't.

325
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,560
They wouldn't tell you on the news or the radio.

326
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,620
You'd ask on Facebook.

327
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, it's just that over there.

328
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,980
The dirt factory there.

329
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,660
They had a little accident.

330
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,300
It's okay.

331
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,980
This is a very, very, very conservative.

332
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,180
Pretty small town.

333
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,800
It is actually a tourist destination.

334
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,540
But otherwise, it's pretty out of the way.

335
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,100
Now.

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,460
My Facebook friends are mostly.

337
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,780
I don't want to use that word again.

338
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,240
Well, liberals.

339
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,200
Or, you know, whatever.

340
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,480
Not exactly pro-fa.

341
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,240
Or anti-fa either, necessarily.

342
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,020
Well, actually, that's just philosophy, right?

343
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,680
It's not really.

344
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,020
Where's the anti-fa P.O. box?

345
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,820
Who's the Bob of anti-fa?

346
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,480
They don't even have a Facebook.

347
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:57,740
They have Face.

348
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,340
Like Anonymous does.

349
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,920
You know, at least Anonymous has Face.

350
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,920
We have a Face.

351
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,580
You know, it's a Face-based religion.

352
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,960
But then there's the local Facebook page.

353
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,660
And that's where you get a window into the more provincial side.

354
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,400
You see, I'm trying to be polite.

355
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,420
I could say redneck.

356
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,840
But my neck's about half red.

357
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,540
And people think of that as an insulting term.

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,220
And maybe some rednecks feel it is.

359
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,760
But I hear them say it all the time.

360
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,820
But I'm trying to avoid certain terms.

361
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,600
Bunch of fucking pigs out there.

362
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,100
Normals.

363
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Barbies and Kens.

364
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,480
Cage dwellers.

365
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,220
I can use those words.

366
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,400
They're Dobbs approved.

367
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:56,520
Anyway, a 15-year-old girl announced on the local Facebook page that she was going to host a BLM.

368
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,360
In this tiny little town.

369
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,720
The locals instantly went rabid.

370
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,200
Foaming at the mouth.

371
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,080
Jumping up and down on Facebook.

372
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,960
This is the friendliest place.

373
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,940
You drive through town.

374
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,120
Stop at a convenience store.

375
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,500
A city person would be suspicious.

376
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,420
Because everybody's so friendly.

377
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,140
And they'd be friendly, you know, if you're black, whatever, Asian.

378
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,640
As long as you're not wearing a hope and change button.

379
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,500
And even then, the worst thing that happened was they might grunt a little bit.

380
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,540
But they'd still help you change a tire.

381
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,840
These same people, when they heard there was going to be a BLM thing here, their first thing was, what's the point?

382
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
There's no black people here.

383
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,420
Actually, there's probably about five families.

384
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,500
But they literally threatened to show up with weapons and bikers.

385
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,920
You know, I'm going to call my biker friends.

386
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,660
We're going to have all our weapons down here.

387
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,480
We're going to stop the paid anti-fag.

388
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,380
We're going to stop the anti-fag hordes.

389
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,640
They're going to bus in from Dallas with bricks and fire bombs.

390
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,660
Because the anti-fag pays people to come through the small towns and destroy our good old American pie culture.

391
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:21,300
They really believe this because they see those badly photoshopped fake ads that they send to each other.

392
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,300
With the help, no doubt, of the Russians and Chinese.

393
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,660
And I've seen those badly photoshopped.

394
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,900
You know, $200 a day to come throw bricks in a small town.

395
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,820
You know, call this number, anti-fag.

396
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:46,880
Another one that was really popular that I saw on our local Facebook page was anti-fag to invade Sturgis Bike Rally.

397
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,340
They believed this!

398
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,280
Oh, and they got so, oh, you know, righteous individuals.

399
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,020
Righteous indignation, let me say that, take two.

400
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,480
Righteous indignation is the marijuana of 2020.

401
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,540
Butt hurt is a powerful drug.

402
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,500
I think Nikki Death Chick said that.

403
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,520
Ironic considering.

404
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:22,140
And the other thing is, the locals honestly were going, what, what, what?

405
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,680
There's no Democrats in Glen Rose.

406
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
That's not allowed.

407
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,020
There's actually at least 200.

408
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,340
And I've met some of them.

409
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,540
Quite a few of them.

410
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,460
Well, I went to that BLM rally.

411
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,420
Yeah, they, anyway, it scared the 15-year-old girl into calling it off.

412
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,340
There were so many bullies on Facebook doing, you know, so you don't think cop lives matter?

413
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,340
You don't think white lives matter?

414
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,720
Why do you bring hate of your own kind to this nice little town?

415
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,480
We'll show you hate.

416
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,240
You know, and so the girl's parents dropped the whole thing, called it off.

417
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,840
The Greta Thunberg of Glen Rose, I called her.

418
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
I was, really admired that kid.

419
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,720
We ended up getting to meet her, too, because somebody else decided to do the BLM thing anyway.

420
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,120
They got a permit for a Saturday in the town.

421
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,560
And I was like, well, I'm going to go to the town square.

422
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,820
And you can envision a really traditional old town square, sort of like the one in Back to the Future, but smaller.

423
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:39,760
Oh, the pro-thaw people were so certain that every storefront window was going to be shattered,

424
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,900
and the tourists would never come back here again to see the Creationist Museum.

425
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,920
And everybody was going to get COVID because of the Dallas people that were being bussed in.

426
00:23:52,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Even though COVID is a hoax, it's just a media hoax to, you know, make the president look dumb.

427
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:11,960
Oh, and what upset them almost the most was, because of COVID, the public restrooms were going to be locked.

428
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,460
Oh, my God, you'd think they couldn't get a haircut.

429
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,060
As if anybody ever used the public restroom in the town square.

430
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,180
The real harbinger of a Democratic coup.

431
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,840
Locking the public restrooms.

432
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:42,180
And, oh, and the bullies and vigilantes announced that they were going to have a prayer meeting for policemen the morning before this rally.

433
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,900
And I went down there to see that prayer meeting, and there wasn't anybody there!

434
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,000
It was, it was, they didn't even bother, you know.

435
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,960
So.

436
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,500
There was going to be a meeting in Glen Rose.

437
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,100
Now, there's been violence in small towns, particularly I'm thinking of that little town in Ohio,

438
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,060
where people with guns showed up and actually attacked teenagers and little old ladies while the cops stood by.

439
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,580
And so I thought, well, just because of those Facebook bullies, I want to go to this BLM thing.

440
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,920
Plus.

441
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,920
I miss Cleveland.

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,220
Most of the people I dealt with on a daily basis were black, and their lives mattered to me.

443
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:37,800
And for that matter, if anybody benefited from, indirectly, but I definitely benefited from slavery.

444
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,800
More so than a lot of people.

445
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,640
I had an uncle who was a senator of South Carolina.

446
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,120
Great, great, great uncle.

447
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,900
Who's not a very great man.

448
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,780
But a great, great uncle.

449
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,740
He was a senator of South Carolina named Cotton Ed Smith.

450
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,300
It might have helped my dad get into Harvard.

451
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,440
So anyway, you know, I'm, yeah, I was going to, I'm sincere about that, actually.

452
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,560
Although, of course, I came up with funny placards I could take.

453
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,420
No human lives matter.

454
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,300
Slack lives matter.

455
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,880
Or I was going to get put on makeup to look like I'd been beaten.

456
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Or I was going to get beaten to a pulp and have a sign that said, Black and Blue Lives Matter.

457
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,480
All of which I decided were in bad taste.

458
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,500
And the latter one, Black and Blue Lives Matter, probably both the liberals and the conservatives would gang up on me.

459
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,300
They'd find one reason they could come together.

460
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,600
And beat up the smarty pants.

461
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,320
At least we got one thing in common.

462
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
So I went to the rally.

463
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,480
Princess Wee went with me.

464
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,800
It was anticlimactic.

465
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,320
Really.

466
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:56,940
It was 75 masked youths and very attractive ladies.

467
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,360
And lots of old people.

468
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,340
Including more attractive ladies.

469
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,520
And I get the impression sometimes that maybe Democrats have a better diet.

470
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,020
Although, to tell the truth, at this particular Black Lives Matter meeting,

471
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,380
I would venture to estimate that at least half of them were Republicans.

472
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:16,920
And Christians.

473
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,320
But real Christians.

474
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,040
Know what I'm saying?

475
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,800
So, yeah, it's all these old folks and youths holding signs.

476
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:37,660
And, of course, across the street from the square, there were small groups of unmasked, occasionally hooting and snickering good old boys.

477
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,200
Holding Trump-Pence signs.

478
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,840
The most disruptive thing that happened was some guy in a big, loud pickup truck.

479
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,140
Festooned with Trump-Pence banners.

480
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
Drove around the town square three times.

481
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,540
Honking.

482
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,620
But there were sheriff's deputies there.

483
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,400
And nothing happened.

484
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,760
Nothing really terrible happened.

485
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,240
The busload of professional anti-file looters must have had a flat.

486
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,380
Or maybe they surrendered.

487
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,920
Chickened out and ran away because all those conservatives promising that they were going to be there with Second Amendment presence.

488
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,340
That's what they call it.

489
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,700
Second Amendment presence.

490
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,240
For the safety of this God-fearing town.

491
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,940
To protect it from the teenagers and boomers.

492
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,220
Boomers?

493
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,760
Yeah.

494
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:35,520
Teenagers and boomers talking on a very small PA about nature and sustainability and justice and all that stuff.

495
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,180
And, in fact, there was a lot of talk about Jesus.

496
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,140
And there were very, very touching things.

497
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,900
A lady who was a Holocaust survivor that works at the White House.

498
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,260
The wildlife preserve nearby spoke.

499
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,860
I got teared up several times.

500
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,520
They had to import a black speaker from Arlington.

501
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:06,100
But another black guy showed up who didn't know that this rally was happening.

502
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,320
He works at the supermarket.

503
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,040
And I'd seen him, you know, nodded to him several times.

504
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,660
Joked around with him a little bit.

505
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,260
He was just driving home through town.

506
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,900
And he saw all these white people standing in a town square holding Black Lives Matter signs.

507
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,300
And he grabbed the mic.

508
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,420
He walked up and started talking.

509
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,500
He didn't grab the mic.

510
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,020
He started just talking to everybody.

511
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,940
He didn't realize that he had accidentally started during the eight and a half minute silence.

512
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,360
But that was okay with me because I really wasn't looking forward to that anyway.

513
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,460
I get stiff.

514
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
But he was there.

515
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,120
He was just flabbergasted.

516
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,220
And gave a kind of an interesting speech.

517
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:54,540
And afterwards the profile people got on Facebook and lied and lied.

518
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,360
Said, oh, there's only a dozen people there.

519
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,460
And none of them wore masks.

520
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,000
Just...

521
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,240
The truth never really fits their childish agendas.

522
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,960
Because the complex is not really as simple as they are.

523
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,560
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,880
The complex is complex.

525
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,380
And some of us like it that way.

526
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,880
Now the other war that's going on in this town...

527
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:37,860
Well, the profile people sounded on Facebook, sounded really disappointed that the promised civil war never happened.

528
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,120
And they never got to use their Second Amendment presence.

529
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,300
They tell each other that no Democrat has a gun.

530
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Or knows how to run a motorboat.

531
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,660
Yeah.

532
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,560
But it was weird.

533
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,400
You know, instead for just one evening, the town square was kind of like at Christmas.

534
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,600
It exuded an atmosphere of love.

535
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,540
As long as you didn't go across the street.

536
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,900
But right there in the town square, it was just like...

537
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,280
It was like Christmas.

538
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,040
It was really...

539
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,860
Sweet.

540
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,640
I say that at risk of being corny, but there you go.

541
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,060
Now we've also got in this town, people are really opposed to wearing masks.

542
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,980
They're finally starting to believe maybe the COVID's real.

543
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,820
Although they keep having secondhand reports of empty hospitals.

544
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,040
It's like...

545
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240
Oh, I keep...

546
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,980
The media...

547
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,780
The media keeps saying Texas hospitals, they don't even have an emergency room.

548
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,020
I drive by the hospital and there wasn't even a car in the parking lot.

549
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,520
You know, it's just anecdotal crap that they teach each other.

550
00:31:46,720 --> 00:32:04,520
And, you know, the masks, they honestly believe that the masks are just a tool to soften us up and get us obeying the deep state world government child molesting rulers.

551
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,020
So that when Bill Gates starts selling his vaccine, we'll all fall for it.

552
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,880
And be turned into autistic slaves, you know, or something.

553
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,700
And, yeah, the mask is the mark of the beast.

554
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,880
Mask of the beast.

555
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,880
Frankly, friends, I think those folks got the mark of the beast on them when they joined Facebook.

556
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,680
And, uh...

557
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm gonna read from a science fiction book that's...

558
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,020
I hope is, in fact, science fiction.

559
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,560
It's, uh...

560
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,600
Fall...

561
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,120
Fall by Neal Stephenson.

562
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,700
The great Neal Stephenson.

563
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,220
I'm so jealous of him, I want to cut his fingers off so he can't write anymore.

564
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,520
Because he's so good.

565
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,300
Anyway...

566
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,180
This...

567
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,140
Part of this book takes place in...

568
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,780
A really divided America.

569
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,220
It's divided into...

570
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,320
Blue states, which are really just big cities.

571
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,900
And Ameristan.

572
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,340
Ameristan starts about when you get to the first Walmart.

573
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
In your town.

574
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
We don't even have a Walmart here.

575
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,200
And, um...

576
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm gonna read a few little excerpts from this because it gets into something about...

577
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,760
Where the internet might be going.

578
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,040
That is quite scary.

579
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:43,920
Um...

580
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,080
So, these characters...

581
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,760
They're talking about...

582
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,480
What happens when the rural people...

583
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,080
Have to get sick.

584
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,860
Or, you know, they have to go to a big town like Iowa City.

585
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,020
Where the big hospital is.

586
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,220
Like another country to them.

587
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,600
But they have to go there when they get sick.

588
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,740
Like to get a melanoma.

589
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:07,740


590
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,980
When they get a melanoma whacked off or whatever.

591
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,400
They can't afford blue state hotel rooms or food.

592
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,060
So they have to camp out on the periphery.

593
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,180
And cook over propane burners under tarps.

594
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,640
Uh...

595
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,280
And somebody else says something about dentistry.

596
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,900
Our friend Ted here has normal people teeth.

597
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,060
Because he's old.

598
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,200
And grew up before this part of the world got Facebooked.

599
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,620
After that, the people with education...

600
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,420
Fled to places like Ames, Des Moines...

601
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,300
And Iowa City.

602
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,820
Which includes dentists.

603
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:44,000
A few mainline churches used to run charity dental clinics.

604
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,040
Where you could get a bad tooth pulled.

605
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,160
Or whatever.

606
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,320
But those are being chased away by these people.

607
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,120
Indicating...

608
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,660
The giant cross outside town.

609
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,920
With people crucified on it.

610
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,180
Do they ever cross the river?

611
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,960
When they get desperate...

612
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,900
Or some meme convinces them it's a good idea.

613
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,680
They follow these weird edit streams.

614
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,140
No one knows where they come from.

615
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,840
I looked at one of them once.

616
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,400
I thought it would be conspiracy theory stuff.

617
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,620
But it wasn't even coherent enough to be called that.

618
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,900
Yeah, the whole point of a conspiracy theory...

619
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,820
Is that it offers a kind of false coherence.

620
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,480
But what I saw didn't even rise to that standard.

621
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,740
Didn't even know about it.

622
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,040
It was just plain weird.

623
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,600
Algorithmically generated...

624
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,160
Mishmash images, sounds...

625
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,820
No sense to it at all.

626
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,380
Just whatever worked.

627
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,760
In the sense of getting the viewer to watch a little more.

628
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,620
They use eye tracking.

629
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,880
So you don't even have to click.

630
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,580
But every so often, whoever's behind it...

631
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,200
Whoever generates the stream.

632
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,760
Assuming it's a human anywhere in that loop.

633
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
Will put it into the minds of these people.

634
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,000
And then bad things can happen.

635
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,400
And...

636
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
They try to cross a river.

637
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,180
Or cross a bridge.

638
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,360
But it's been all shot up.

639
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,300
The infrastructure is damaged real bad.

640
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,520
Their fathers believed the people in the cities...

641
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,840
Actually gave a shit enough about them...

642
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,660
To want to come and take their guns and other property.

643
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,360
So they put money they didn't really have...

644
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,900
Into stockpiling trillions of rounds.

645
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,480
And hunkered down waiting for the elites...

646
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,080
To come confiscate their stuff.

647
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,080
There's no use for any of it.

648
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,540
So they come here sometimes and vote with bullets.

649
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,180
Just shooting at bridges.

650
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,220
And then here's the really scary part.

651
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,260
About the nonsense internet...

652
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,940
That these rural people have lost their minds to.

653
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,960
The guy says...

654
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,260
Bronze age shepherds may have been one step above cavemen...

655
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,300
But at least they were reality based.

656
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
Very much so.

657
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,020
And that goes on being more or less true for quite a while.

658
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,220
Now theater and later movies...

659
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,460
Eventually got us into the realm of shared hallucinations.

660
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,560
But those are neatly boxed in space and time.

661
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,580
And there's a ceremony to them.

662
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,260
He's basically saying...

663
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,120
Since...

664
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,700
It's only since wireless networks...

665
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,220
Got fast enough to stream pictures to portable devices...

666
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,220
That everything changed.

667
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,280
And enabled each individual to live 24-7...

668
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,160
In their own personalized hallucination stream.

669
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,600
And if you're still tied to reality...

670
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,440
By family or some kind of regularizing influence in your life...

671
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,520
Like having a job...

672
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,980
Then you've got a fighting chance.

673
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,580
But these people...

674
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,500
Each person out there is getting their own personalized stream...

675
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,120
Of algorithmically generated alternate reality...

676
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,800
That is locked in a feedback loop with their pulse.

677
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,920
Blink right and so on.

678
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,780
You're not going to get very far...

679
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,340
Trying to get one of these people...

680
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,100
To tear his attention away from that...

681
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,880
So you can relate a story about some guy...

682
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,460
2000 years ago...

683
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,580
Feeding a large number of people...

684
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,180
With a few loaves and fishes.

685
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,900
And...

686
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,860
And...

687
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,540
Yeah...

688
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,240
It's Fall by Neal Stephenson.

689
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,480
I'm watching that happen.

690
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,360
On my local small town Facebook page.

691
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,500
So...

692
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,220
Where's my...

693
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,360
What time is it?

694
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,640
Oh my gosh!

695
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm going to wrap this stuff up.

696
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,860
It's not just right-wingers, of course.

697
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,260
I get lots of letters from...

698
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,000
Wokies.

699
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,600
That consider me to be a sexist, fascist right-winger.

700
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,220
Because I didn't hate that one guy they hate...

701
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,140
As much as I was supposed to hate him.

702
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
So they hate me even more.

703
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:57,900
Um...

704
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,440
If...

705
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,500
Pink Facebook subgeniuses...

706
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
Who can't even speak...

707
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,480
Spell Bob right!

708
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,800
And...

709
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,660
Of course they're shift key challenged.

710
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,480
So the quote marks are really onerous for them.

711
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,080
But...

712
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,960
Subginos we call them.

713
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,500
Subgenius in name only.

714
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,420
We thought the internet...

715
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,940
The world brain would make everyone...

716
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,800
It would be like free education for everybody.

717
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
And it is for some of us.

718
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,300
But...

719
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,380
It also just makes dumb people dumber.

720
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,220
It...

721
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,940
It's confirmation bias.

722
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,020
Um...

723
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,160
Anyway, this is where I would normally...

724
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,300
Mock the funny names of Starwood workshops.

725
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,200
That could be taken two different ways.

726
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,440
But there weren't any.

727
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,660
They were all pretty straight forward.

728
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,500
And...

729
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,440
Um...

730
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
I had...

731
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,980
More wonderful quotes that I could read.

732
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,420
There's...

733
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm sure a lot of Starwood people have read them.

734
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,520
I've read Good Omens.

735
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,980
By...

736
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,220
It's not worth...

737
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,080
Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman.

738
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,040
Wrote this book Good Omens.

739
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,740
Has this wonderful bit about witches.

740
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,200
That's hilarious.

741
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,820
Uh...

742
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,520
But...

743
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,200
Um...

744
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,000
Heh...

745
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,360
And a wonderful thing about aliens.

746
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,920
In fact I will...

747
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,040
I've got to do a little bit...

748
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,400
This is...

749
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
This is how the...

750
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,340
The aliens see us.

751
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,120
This guy actually gets...

752
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,300
Pulled over by...

753
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,740
A flying saucer.

754
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,920
An alien cop gets out.

755
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,260
With like cool hand Luke shades on.

756
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,660
And says...

757
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,600
Is this your planet?

758
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,000
Is it?

759
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,680
I've got to do this in kind of...

760
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,660
British accent.

761
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,660
Well yes I suppose it is.

762
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,320
Had it long have we?

763
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,300
Oh...

764
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,080
Not personally.

765
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,380
I mean as a species.

766
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,260
About half a million years I think.

767
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,540
Uh huh.

768
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,320
Been letting the old acid rain build up a bit have we?

769
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:00,840
We so.

770
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,660
Been letting ourselves go a bit with the old hydrocarbons perhaps?

771
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm sorry.

772
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,820
Could you tell me your planet's albedo sir?

773
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,120
Uh...

774
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,540
No...

775
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,060
I'm sorry to have to tell you sir.

776
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,960
That your polar ice caps are below regulation size for a planet of this category.

777
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,140
Oh dear.

778
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,200
We'll overlook it on this occasion sir.

779
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,240
Oh...

780
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
I'll see to it.

781
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,960
I mean...

782
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,800
I say I.

783
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,060
I think Antarctica belongs to everyone or something like that.

784
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,820
The aliens show up.

785
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,660
Shook it's head vaguely.

786
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,840
Turned around and waddled back to the saucer.

787
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,440
Thank you.

788
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,680
The small alien walked past the car.

789
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,540
CO2 level up .5% it rasped.

790
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,340
Giving him a meaningful look.

791
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,900
You do know that you could find yourself charged with being a dominant species while under

792
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,080
the influence of impulse driven capitalism don't you?

793
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,840
Then they fly away.

794
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:08,480
way. And I had an even better thing, but it's too long, from this book, Eyelash, by Reverend

795
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,680
Nikolai Kingsley, which isn't published yet because we're going to publish it. It's a

796
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:22,180
science fiction book and it's wonderful. And we're very, very small fish in a really big,

797
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:28,720
nasty pond. The descriptions of it are great, but we'll just have to wait for the next Starwood.

798
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:41,820
And I was ready to do a mass marriage. I guess I still can. That's sort of traditional. I can't

799
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,340
actually see all the couples, but we're all going to be married after this. I'll shorten it down

800
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,800
to...

801
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,040
And this is...

802
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
And this is...

803
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,560
This is just a 24-hour, so it's only going to last until this time tomorrow.

804
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,960
Do you, in cert name here, take this, whatever it is, in cert name here, to be your lawful

805
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,340
wedded whatever, in short duration, subgenius matrimony, to have and to hold, in fact to

806
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,960
do just about damn near anything you each year it agrees to do, for richer or poorer,

807
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,780
in sickness and kinkiness, for the next 24 hours, for whatever sick and twisted, but

808
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,040
no less blessed reasons, for the next...

809
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,860
Say I do!

810
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,320
I do!

811
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,380
Oh, look at that.

812
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:21,540
They did.

813
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,320
I could hear some of them.

814
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,440
I do!

815
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,900
And then you get out the ring or the temple of Devoe if you don't have a ring.

816
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,320
Mm-hmm.

817
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,780
And do that.

818
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,280
And you must now all kiss each other.

819
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:34,740
I do.

820
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,000
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

821
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,440
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.

822
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,960
And if you don't, you make a mockery of the sacred tradition of marriage.

823
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,780
There.

824
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,900
That's done.

825
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,920
Oh, two bits of news.

826
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,840
On my...

827
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,680
YouTube page, friends, I finally learned how to do playlists.

828
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,500
And I made a Starwood playlist.

829
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,380
Including the 1990 Starwood.

830
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,240
It's really short.

831
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,140
But I surreptitiously took some videos there.

832
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,240
And there's nothing...

833
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,280
Nobody's going to get in trouble.

834
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,440
Nobody looks anything like they did then.

835
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,580
You won't hardly recognize anybody.

836
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,000
So...

837
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,820
So true.

838
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:21,500
Yeah.

839
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,700
And there's...

840
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,060
I've actually filmed...

841
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,300
For a while, I was the Jane Goodall of the pagans.

842
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,280
I was about the only one allowed to shoot.

843
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,680
Because I knew I wasn't going to blow anybody's cover.

844
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,440
And I didn't.

845
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,860
I have lots of footage and you can't see it.

846
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,620
But someday, when everybody's dead, it'll be interesting.

847
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:43,920
So...

848
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,620
And that shouldn't be long, according to the news.

849
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,100
Anyway, so we can do a quick Q&A now.

850
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:51,540
For...

851
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,000
How long do we have, Princess?

852
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,520
We've...

853
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,860
Ten minutes or so?

854
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,420
This will be the first time that I can actually hear the questions.

855
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,780
Without people translating.

856
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,780
Reverend Stein, how would you like to do that?

857
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,980
Do you want all the microphones turned on at once?

858
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,020
Or do you just want...

859
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,400
No, we should do them one at a time.

860
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,540
One at a time?

861
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,080
Yeah, let people unmute themselves.

862
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,700
Yeah, but yeah.

863
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,560
That would be...

864
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,960
Maybe that would be a good idea.

865
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,300
Is that...

866
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,940
Let people unmute themselves or raise a hand or something.

867
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,340
Their raise your hand button or some such.

868
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,620
Oh, the other news I was going to say.

869
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,020
Okay, my YouTube.

870
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,200
Just go to subgenius.com.

871
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,020
It's easy to find.

872
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,000
And you'll have to scroll for my Starwood playlist.

873
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,360
But just under the playlist, there's a Starwood one.

874
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,980
There's Subgenius one and KittyCats one.

875
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,520
Most people like the Cats one best.

876
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,020
Oh, here's a question.

877
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,480
From McCartney and Jennifer.

878
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,220
Paul McCartney, I thought you were dead.

879
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,660
Second Amendment presence.

880
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,180
Does that mean they're bringing guns for Antifa?

881
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:08,840
Yes.

882
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,520
Second Amendment presence means guns.

883
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,040
And it's kind of a pointless threat.

884
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,100
In rural farm country, everybody's packing.

885
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,160
And they always have been.

886
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,460
It was always legal.

887
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,700
They recently...

888
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,960
Texas legalized open carry.

889
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:35,920
But only the most insecure numbskulls walk around with a six-gun showing.

890
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,160
It's just stupid.

891
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,220
On account of...

892
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,900
Everybody's got either a rifle on the back of their pickup.

893
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:49,280
My mom and my sister always had a handgun under the seat.

894
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,280
For shooting snipers.

895
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,400
And that's what it takes, if nothing else.

896
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,720
But, I mean, seriously.

897
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,680
So that's not surprising, but yeah, that's a code.

898
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,680
Second Amendment presence, that's code for...

899
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,260
We're gonna be there with our guns.

900
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,320
And scare you libtards.

901
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,340
Oops, I said it.

902
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,960
That was the word I wasn't going to use.

903
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,960
No, I really shouldn't.

904
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,960
I, that's...

905
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,920
But it's kind of...

906
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,060
I'm appropriating it from them.

907
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,380
You know, that's...

908
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,740
I've been called that name indirectly.

909
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,280
Some of these names have been called names...

910
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:28,020
many times it was kind of like you know I just appropriated it but then I kind

911
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:34,560

okay

919
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,620
my better half is on the other side of the room actually I could turn this

920
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:25,580
background off it's not showing Bob anymore I could show our I could show us

921
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:34,180

922
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:40,200
horse barn there's the cult compound yeah there's the weird-looking rocks

923
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,180
that's actually wow that's actually in town that's not on our pride so is that

924
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:45,840
ruin there

925
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:53,040
then after that start showing Stanked Ranch at the old buzzards roost and and

926
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,580
the goat pasture and the Frankenstein's hay barn it's a room that's our house

927
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:10,320
every what do you recommend is the best way to storm the gates so what's the

928
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,540
best way to storm the gates we may have to all pile on Washington DC in Mississippi City and políticas Washington DC and Etbles Jordan above Mississippi City so our

929
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,340
take down the wall.

930
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,520
You don't have to storm the gates.

931
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,480
You can come to see our Destructionist

932
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,500
Evidence Museum

933
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,060
that I'm forming.

934
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,480
In fact, it showed

935
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,440
one of our devil skeletons in the

936
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,140
background on that slideshow there.

937
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,400
We have

938
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,660
fossils. There's a lot

939
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:39,340
of fossils here. It's

940
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,980
dinosaur track country.

941
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,160
We actually have dinosaur tracks.

942
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,020
We also have very

943
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,020
rare ghost dinosaur

944
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,020
tracks, the tracks of ghost

945
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,980
dinosaurs. We found the skeleton

946
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:53,040
of two cave subgeniuses.

947
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,860
We call those Adam and Eve,

948
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,940
although it's really Adam and Steve.

949
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,620
We have an alien, a crashed

950
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,420
gray alien that must have

951
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,900
died in the Cretaceous

952
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,080
period. All of these things are about 100,000

953
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,320
years old. Here's a dinosaur.

954
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,520
There's a dinosaur valley

955
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,820
state park is nearby.

956
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,400
There really is a creationist

957
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,000
museum. It is hilarious.

958
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,300
I was afraid to go to the creationist

959
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,200
museum for so long like a vampire

960
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,900
in church.

961
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,180
An atheist friend of ours

962
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,960
convinced me to go.

963
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,380
It was well

964
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,560
worth the $14.

965
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,280
I still just chuckle

966
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,920
thinking about those fake

967
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,380
mantras. Who are

968
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,360
you voting for?

969
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,720
That's a personal question.

970
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,440
Yvonne wants to know.

971
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,580
Well, I mean, my friend

972
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,080
Vermin Supreme is listening.

973
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,020
So, you know, I mean, just

974
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:53,840
what am I going to say? I can't say.

975
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,000
I can't say

976
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,240
where is my

977
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,440
Vermin Supreme pen?

978
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,940
That's right. You can't show anything

979
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,080
off here. However,

980
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,980
if I decide that I'm

981
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,860
throwing away a vote, I might change

982
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,060
my mind. I was

983
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,200
the one guy

984
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,980
that thought George W. Bush couldn't

985
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,580
possibly get reelected.

986
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,300
So I voted third party.

987
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,400
So it was my fault.

988
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,820
Because he won by one vote.

989
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,100
Don't waste it, man.

990
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,480
2015.

991
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,520
I stood at Starwood

992
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,040
and told y'all

993
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,320
don't be sure

994
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,240
that

995
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,880
what's-her-name is going to win.

996
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:39,240
I've

997
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,780
been monitoring the right wing.

998
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,540
It's an unhealthy,

999
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,300
unethical, unethical, unethical

1000
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,860
hobby. I've been monitoring it my

1001
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,340
whole life. I kind of grew up

1002
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,960
kind of in it.

1003
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:50,820
And

1004
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,320
I had a sinking

1005
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,580
feeling that we'd get a big surprise

1006
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,520
in the election.

1007
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,620
2016.

1008
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,040
Told you.

1009
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,100
Tried to warn you.

1010
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,880
There are people out there that

1011
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,680
never voted in their lives

1012
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,080
that voted in that election.

1013
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,960
Most of them don't know how to read. Didn't know how to read.

1014
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,760
Didn't know what voting was. But they got

1015
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,760
each other all worked up.

1016
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,880
Yes, they did. The Chinese

1017
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,580
and Russian stuff about the criminal Clintons

1018
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,420
didn't help either.

1019
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,680
They probably all are criminals,

1020
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,000
but they're not guilty of what they say

1021
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,760
they're guilty of. They can get them from

1022
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,240
stuff they are guilty of. Gah!

1023
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,800
Exactly.

1024
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,860
Yeah, those conspiracy theories

1025
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,000
are pretty brutal. Who are you voting for?

1026
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,960
Bob! Don't blame

1027
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,220
me! I voted for Bob!

1028
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,940
Actually, you can buy a button from our

1029
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,820
Cafe Press store.

1030
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:49,960
It's the

1031
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,100
Don't blame me, I voted for Bob

1032
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,820
button. The problem is

1033
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,100
if you did vote for Bob last time,

1034
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,080
I'm sorry. I blame you.

1035
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,140
I wouldn't do a thing like that.

1036
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,900
We've got Furman Supreme!

1037
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,100
He's much more

1038
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,020
visible than Bob. I was hoping

1039
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:08,240
that

1040
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,940
I was glad that we did

1041
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,440
that we didn't need Furman's help

1042
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,780
at crowd control when we had the

1043
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,620
small town BLM

1044
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:18,980
rally.

1045
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,700
All the pictures in the background, by the way,

1046
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,480
are dream scoped

1047
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,540
pictures of the ranch

1048
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,200
and the family. There's our devil skeleton.

1049
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,560
That one's more

1050
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,520
recent. That's a fairly recent devil skeleton.

1051
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,680
It's not fossilized.

1052
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,680
That's a fossil.

1053
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,160
So, friends,

1054
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,820
is it, or am I

1055
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,320
supposed to go for until 515?

1056
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,800
Yeah, until 515. Eric Schneider

1057
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,780
would like to know, what is the proper way

1058
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,900
to sacrifice our children by sending them

1059
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,560
to school in the fall as mandated?

1060
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,780
What is the best way to

1061
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,280
sacrifice our children?

1062
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,840
What should they wear?

1063
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,820
By sending them to school in the fall

1064
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,420
as mandated?

1065
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,380
Well, I'm glad I don't have to

1066
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,560
worry about that personally,

1067
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,440
but I certainly do indirectly

1068
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,800
because I've got three

1069
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,360
grandsons in Dallas,

1070
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,660
which right now is a hot,

1071
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,840
you know, it's a real hot spot.

1072
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,840
And my daughter

1073
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,980
announced on Facebook that the kids,

1074
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,460
her kids, will

1075
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,460
not be going back to school.

1076
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,680
They're sad because

1077
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,480
they love school, but

1078
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,680
she's not going to do that.

1079
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,760
I'm sure there's lots of...

1080
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,880
God, that's

1081
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,720
a tough decision, man. That's a really

1082
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,300
hard thing.

1083
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,280
Hi, y'all.

1084
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,880
Can I put this on

1085
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,680
a gallery view?

1086
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,360
Oh my God, I can see everybody now!

1087
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,860
Whoa, it's just like

1088
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,660
being at Starwood!

1089
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,280
Yay!

1090
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,760
Huh! That's

1091
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,120
wonderful!

1092
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,300
I see Tommy Amaba.

1093
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,740
It was actually over, it's supposed to be over at

1094
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,840
5, but Mandy wants to know that.

1095
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,200
Mandy wants to know, are the subgeniuses

1096
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,900
organizing the

1097
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,580
Amish like the

1098
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,700
Republicans did?

1099
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,660
Well, you know, that's actually not a bad idea

1100
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,140
because if you think about it,

1101
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,120
if there was,

1102
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,680
or I should say when

1103
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,580
there's some horrible, gigantic

1104
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,880
disaster, and all the

1105
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,740
electronics are

1106
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,840
fried, a solar flare

1107
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,300
could do that, actually.

1108
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,960
There won't

1109
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,800
be anybody left after 25 years

1110
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,620
except for Amish and

1111
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,680
bikers. And

1112
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,620
25 years after that, there won't be any,

1113
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,220
everybody in America will be

1114
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,960
biker Amish.

1115
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,580
So there you go. We probably

1116
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,420
should recruit more Amish.

1117
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,940
We did, I

1118
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,760
didn't know one, there is one

1119
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,900
Amish subgenius, he's also a stand-up

1120
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,840
comic. He's called the Amish,

1121
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,860
the Amish comic.

1122
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,960
Uh, he's

1123
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,800
really, strangely enough, he's really

1124
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,080
funny.

1125
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:08,820
That's right.

1126
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,940
We don't have Amish around here, we have Mennonites.

1127
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,840
My shed was built

1128
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,680
by Mennonites.

1129
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,920
Sturdy, sturdy work.

1130
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,940
Fine work. And they get the best

1131
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,080
amphetamines I hear.

1132
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,040
So, uh,

1133
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,460
yeah,

1134
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,460
here we are in the Matrix.

1135
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,880
It's not so bad.

1136
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,880
Like I say, the main thing,

1137
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,600
my favorite thing

1138
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,620
about Starwood is standing around chatting,

1139
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,900
you know, to see people you don't

1140
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,700
see very often.

1141
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,800
You never, you don't get to

1142
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,060
know them well enough to dislike

1143
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,760
them at all.

1144
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,820
Jeff McBride's show is starting now, so people are

1145
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,660
starting to take out their speakers.

1146
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,900
Is he doing magic?

1147
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,980
Or just talking about it?

1148
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,540
He has both.

1149
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,920
Oh, okay.

1150
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,080
I drove him to Starwood

1151
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,800
uh,

1152
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,980
I guess the last time he was there.

1153
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,780
All the way, for some

1154
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,840
reason he got flown into Cleveland or something

1155
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,640
like that. He had to drive a long trip.

1156
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,380
So we got to chat a whole lot.

1157
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,400
And for about an hour,

1158
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,780
he sat and did

1159
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,360
card things with his hands.

1160
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,100
He said every day, no matter where he is,

1161
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,700
for a certain amount of time, he just does

1162
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,640
this thing with his hands and a bunch of cards.

1163
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,860
It's just a blur. You know, I could

1164
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,780
barely see what was going on.

1165
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,580
Maybe we were having a conversation the whole time.

1166
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,220
Yeah,

1167
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,600
you have to keep the muscle memory working,

1168
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,840
and uh, yeah, you keep

1169
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,920
your hands deck style.

1170
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,900
It's pretty impressive to watch

1171
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,100
a magician do that.

1172
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,260
Oh, you have to stay in practice?

1173
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:44,820
Yeah.

1174
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,160
That's why I'm having so much trouble

1175
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,660
masturbating now, I guess.

1176
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,980
I'm not getting enough hours in.

1177
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,060
But, yeah.

1178
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,340
If I did that for an hour every day,

1179
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,900
I'd be as good as Magnus at playing cards.

1180
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,380
Dang. There you go.

1181
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,020
Thank you

1182
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,740
very much for your wisdom.

1183
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,820
Oh,

1184
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,460
and how do I end these things? Oh, yeah.

1185
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,740
Repent! Quit your job!

1186
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,460
Slack off! Price Bob!

1187
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,020
Question authority! Or else!

1188
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,680
And,

1189
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,980
if they cannot see the humor

1190
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,920
of it, let them mount up

1191
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,680
upon themselves.

1192
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,220
Yay!

1193
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,880
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay,

1194
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,940
yay, yay, yay, yay,

1195
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,320
yay, yay, yay, yay,

1196
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,540
So, y'all go see Magnus.

1197
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,540
Thank you very much for coming and

1198
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,040
attending and being remarkably

1199
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,440
quiet the whole time.

1200
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,920
That's really funny now.

1201
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,940
You can have that when the mics are turned off.

1202
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,340
Now I'm going to go do the other stuff

1203
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,440
that you do at Starwood

1204
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,680
when you're not

1205
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,960
working, when you don't have to do

1206
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,380
a show in front of people.

1207
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,400
When you're not on camera?

1208
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,960
Yeah. Yeah, when you're not on camera.

1209
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:56,920
And you know what that is?

1210
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,860
Walk the dogs.

1211
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,120
Praise, praise Bob.

1212
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,660
Dogs need walks.

1213
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,460
Tell Magnus hello for me.

1214
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,700
Ah-oo-ga!

1215
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,780
Ah-oo-ga!

1216
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,860
Mandy is licking you.
