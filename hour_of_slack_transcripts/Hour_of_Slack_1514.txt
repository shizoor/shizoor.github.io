WCSB Cleveland
You know
You know
You know I'm so thankful
Tonight that I don't have
A lot of money, I don't have a lot
Of friends, but I have
A whole lot of diagrams
Of how to position
Bob or Steve
Somebody's
Got a conspiracy
Going on
And you will say
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
We don't have a lot of money
We don't have a lot of people
And we got a lot of power
Of the wicked Bob
And the spiritual darkness
We ask Bob
To come
And to reveal the conspiracy
In the skies above you
And open up
Every deceitful work
Of conspiracy
You know, the things
That it's done, the symbols
And the emblems of Bob
Now, a lot of people loved the hour of slug.
Actually, they're in bodies with two legs.
They have two eyes.
They have two ears.
And their mouth is filled with Bob's spirit, see?
There's no prob with Bob.
I don't know who he's with or what the deal is.
But I know that if I stay close to Bob, I'll be safe in those Gleaguers in Arkansas.
I know those creatures can't get a hold of me if I just hang around the foundation and do what they say.
And, you know, clean up after them a little bit.
I don't mind doing that kind of work if it's for a good cause.
I know that Bob.
I know that Bob.

I know that Bob is a good cause.
Bob took me inside his heart.
And I accepted him into my life.
And I'm here to testify, friends, what that man has done for me, if you can really call him a man.
Many people say he's almost like a god.
I don't think so.
Of course, I don't know, Bob.
But I do.
I do know Bob in certain ways.
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.
Yes, Bob, he filled me with the sort of the spirit I never knew I had.
And I knew it wasn't coming from him.
It was coming from inside me.
Bob was giving it to me.
He was laying hands on me from afar.
He might have been up in that great big jet plane.
Or he might have been down on the ground.
Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.
But all I know is it was Bob.
It was Bob.
Bob.
Yeah, he's smiling.
You never see Bob frown.
You know that behind that amazing smile, there lies a mind like a steel trap.
I'm sure he makes mistakes.
Like what he did with those young women that time.
So I think the newspapers exaggerated that.
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.
In our lives.
In 1981.
And in 1984.
Hi, little brother.
And in 1991.
And in 1995.
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.
If they really even come from a planet at all.
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.
Lighting our lives with the technology.
And the spirituality.
And the mentality of planet X.
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.
And see that there's a place for us in the world.
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob.
Or the left hand of Bob.
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.
And it's Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Yeah, I can hear him.
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.
Saying, come to me, Tommy.
Come to me and lay down your material things.
Because you know they are going to mean much to you.
After that.
That divine year.
And after I lay my hand on you.
And lead you up the steps of that magnificent craft.
And we'll board it and go to the stars.
That's right, Tommy.
We'll go to the stars.
You and me.
That's what Bob said.
Bob said that.
And I said, I'm going to take you to the stars.

I got to say.
I'm having a better time here than I think I've ever had at any devotional.
Woo!
Woo!
Yeah.
Thanks so much to everybody who's brought us out here.
This is great.
For people who wanted to bring us out.
We love playing for Stang.
Everybody here is laid back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't say anything.
Oh, no.
This is a much cooler crowd.
This is a much cooler crowd.






You've been with it a long time.

Firstly, we couldn't fire him

The show was ended
The show was ended







He has lost his job
And now
the end is near
we sit and face
the final curtain
Bob Dobbs
will kick their rears
their pink bright butts
will soon be hurting
we lived
a life that's full
we didn't go
the pink boy job way
but more
much more than this
we did it
Bob's way
regrets
we had a few
but then again
too few to mention
will cleave
their world
into
and blast off to
the
X dimension
Bob's pipe
is stiff and hard
and it will smite
them here on
X day
he'll
Pong for us
he'll do it
They're little world
He'll do it
Bob's way
Yes there were
times
You often knew
The pink boys
beat us
black and blue
But through it all
We didn't stop
The pink boy job
We didn't stop

We didn't stop
We took the pills and smoked the frog
We faced the calm and we moved on
And did it Bob's way
Oh, sure, at times we cry
But they'll be the ones we'll be abusing
Until the last pink boy has died
I'm sure we'll find it quite amusing
To think we'll do all that
From Bangor, Maine
Down to the North

Down to Zimbabwe
Oh, no
Oh, no, not us
We'll do it Bob's way
For what is a sub?
What has he got?
If not some slap
Then he has not
To say the thing
He truly feels
And not the words
Of those who kneel
The record shows
We dealt the blows
And did it Bob's way
Thank you, brothers and sisters
For coming to the end of the world
And beyond
George, let us begin
From the inspiring

Follows the recent
or kill me.
This is N-C-N.
Nationalcynical.com
Ah, yes dear friends.
And, uh, we have tried
unsuccessfully to get
lonesome cowboy Dave
on the air.
All the buttons are pushed,
everything is up,
and we cannot hear
the lonesome cowboy.
Some terrible thing
has happened.
I can't understand,
and I shan't try
any longer.
Because obviously
the conspiracy that they
were talking about
is after us.
In fact, I can hear him
creeping and sneaking
and coming, coming.
Was that them?
Outside the station window?
Was that them outside the door?
Was that?
Well, it wasn't
lonesome cowboy Dave,
our special guest.
Who knows, maybe it'll work
if we try again later.
All right.
That last song
was the great Reverend
Phineas Narco singing Bob's



Way.
You can get a lot more
of his work, which is not
all subgeniously, but all good,
at nationalcynical.com.
Now let's go back in time
to the beginning of the show,
which almost always starts
with titles by Fernanda Nande,
Lee Murr.
And then there was a kind
of a touching, slightly off-key
song, which we call Bob Cleave.
That was me at age...
I don't know.



27 or 28.
Hellswammy Satellite Weavers
was playing violin on that,
and I believe Sterno was on guitar,
and it was recorded in a warehouse.
I remember that.
Radiate Some Slack,
the bluegrass song,
was by the Mutant Mountain Boys,
recorded live at X Day
two years ago, I think.
The British fellow singing
Too Much Is Always Better
But Not Enough, that was Max Slack.
The Crazy.
The Crazy.
That was the...
G-O-P song,
with very bizarre instrumentality.
Accent on the mentality.
Was by the Psycho Skeletons.
There was a little mashup by Lee Murr.
Oh, and the song Too Pink,
a rather elaborate song
with a lot of mixing,
that was Monkey Hive.
Reverend Fister Gag Hole,
the late Reverend Fister Gag Hole,
and the current Reverend Frodus Suds Peshaw.
The techno music was by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
And luckily, I have something important to read tonight.
It is, in fact, a prayer for urinating by.
And it's actually the two guys involved with this little dialogue
are a couple of gentlemen who have been lucky enough to survive kidney stones.
And since this novel, Confusion, by Neal Stephenson, takes place around 1693,
they were really lucky to survive kidney stones
because that often killed people in those days
and it makes people today feel like they're dying.
Oh, what did Dave say?
Well, he'll try again in five minutes and see if we can get through.
Okay. Well, if I see that light blink, then we can try.
But if I don't, I can't.
Anyway, here it is.
These two old Englishmen, and I'm not going to try to do their accents,
are outdoors getting ready to urinate.
And suddenly the older one goes,
Right. Now, on your knees, Mr. Waterhouse.
I beg your pardon.
Never fear. I will be joining you in moments.
My knees, being older, work slower.
Okay. Now, let us pray.
You always say a prayer after you urinate?
Only after a really first-rate one.
Or when communing with a fellow sufferer, as now.
Lord of the universe, you're a humble servant.
As you may have thought, we ask that old Samuel Pepys and Daniel Waterhouse pray
that you shall bless and keep the soul of the late bishop of Chester John Wilkins,
who, wanting no further purification in the kidney of the world,
went to your keeping 20 years since.
And we give praise and thanks to you for having given us the rational faculties
by which the procedure of lithotomy was invented, enabling us,
who are further from perfection,
to endure longer in this world, urinating freely as the occasion warrants.
Let our urine streams gleaming and scintillating in the sun's radiance
as they pursue their parabolic trajectories earthward
be as an outward and visible sign of your grace,
even as the knobby stones hidden in our coat pockets remind us
that we are all earth and that we are sinners.
Do you have anything to add, Mr. Waterhouse?
Only amen. Amen.
Damn me, I'm late for my next conspiracy.
Godspeed, Daniel.
And friends, as Hobbes said in Leviathan,
for the understanding is by the flame of the passions,
never enlightened but dazzled.
So, friends, here we sit.
Broken-hearted.
Expecting Dave, but instead we got carted.
That's for the monster hunters out there.
You know, it's interesting, my music stopped playing.
Oh, it's not on continuous, you see.
Play mode has to say can't, not sing.
But I can put on something else here, I think.
I guess, I guess we'll...
Just have to give up on our lonesome co-host.
In one more minute he shall call and we can try again
and see if we can gather his call and put it over the airwaves.
Well, one minute.
Also, we're doing this in a scientifical manor.
Or manor. Manure, I mean.
I'm sorry.
Manour, yes.
Reading those Englishmen in English makes me want to be all full of English.
You know, yeah.
But you know, friends, these pinks nowadays,
the mediocrity mentality, dull and sluggish,
about everything else is endlessly creative
when it comes to finding new ways to consume, to digest,
to transform whole continents into toxic Earthman excreta.
When we look at all that the Bob-danged Nagians
and the human income poops have built
and see incredible levels of...
what might once have passed for talent
instead dedicated to building an ever-growing alibi for pinkness,
just to keep themselves from becoming suicidally depressed,
they have to keep themselves in constant, unceasing denial.
They have to believe themselves incredibly smart and lucky
and see us as just the opposite.
What to them is natural, like working for a living,
is to us completely ass-sucking.
It's hard for us to imagine being so rigidly locked into such fossilized,
monotonous behavior patterns,
and it's natural that we speculate.
Oh, the normals can't really be that bad.
Nobody could be.
It's got to be us that's crazy.
But that's giving the pink way too much credit.
And possibly, possibly, lonesome cowboy Dave.
Yes, I hope you can hear me,
because I heard the spirits were avenging you tonight.
Oh, yeah, this time we can.
Praise Dobbs!
I don't know what the problem was,
but it'll be fixed for the next DJ down the line, I suppose.
Don't you think?
Well, in your youth, you were a master carpenter,
an ex-barker, and an exponent of...
You were good with all kinds of studio equipment.
I mean...
Oh, yeah?
Well, I thought you...
You can do stuff like that.
No, I can't.
No, actually, no, it's not my studio.
I'm only in here once a week.
You know, if one tiny atom is changed,
that creates a whole new universe,
and everybody goes crazy!
If one impish child were to vomit on the console,
that would be the end of programming for three weeks,
and no one would care.
He's not petting.
I'm, uh...
We're waiting for that.
We're waiting for that child any minute now.
Oh, wait, no, he did...
Oh, no, we're not.
Dave did call in.
Okay, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
Recording?
Everything's going fine.
No trouble.
We got our Dave on.
Were you referring to the next compatriot
as a self-born child of light,
as he's going around in many of these alternative cults,
which have sprung up across, uh, North America?
No, no, no.
I don't know.





I don't care.
Alternative cults?
Those are other cults.
You mean those little, those little cults,
like, uh, um...
The Muslimics, the Christians, the, the, the...
Uh, Hindus and so forth.
The wall of tooth retardants.
Yeah, those are...
The sharks.
Those are small cults compared to the all-encompassing
Church of the Subgenius,
which no one knows they've joined yet.
Outside of maybe...
Has bigger bosoms, too.
Sorry.
Actually, about 50,000 people have joined
the Church of the Subgenius, very, very roughly.
Well, that's like a small nation,
like the Grand Duchy of...
What's the name that Peter Sellers was in
when they declared war on the world, or...
The Mouse That Roared.
The Mouse That Roared.
Yeah, we're the mouse that, that, uh, roared
when its tail was stuck in the trap
and the cat heard it and came.
But, uh...
Well, yeah, Church of the Subgenius,
if you think about it, it's a lot bigger than
say, Heaven's Gate,
and has more functioning testicles.
Well, that's what I was thinking.
I know of at least one.
Yeah.
And, uh, there was, uh...
What was that other cool cult?
Oh, the People's Temple.
Now, they had like 900 people,
but they all died.
No, that was the Tito Temple.
The Tito Temple didn't stand for anything
that they stand for.
And besides, you're dealing with a bunch of
renegade youth who are like impassioned,
impassioned with us.
You know, their minds are twisted,
really, really twisted really bad
because they're overmediated.
And they lust for things like this.
And you play, you, you pot,
well, you, um, you opened a new can of tuna fish.
Well, passion, passion, uh, dazzles
enlightenment and understanding.
You see, that's the...
And also, they can't read, uh...
Well, not only can they not read cursive,
now they can't read anything that's got
uppercase letters in it.
Have you noticed that?
It's, it's a violent dichotomy.
I mean, uh, they try to...
I've seen these kids write, try to write
cursive and stuff, and they use, like,
their hands like if you were, uh, you know,
an ice pick on tearing down an ice block
or something like that.
It's like, no, no, no, and then you have
to smack their hand with a ruler.
And then the next thing you know,
your bosom is cold like a cancer fish.
The queen-aged werewolf.
You're just making all this stuff up.
Kids don't even know what cursive is.
They're not taught that.
They don't know what it is.
They look at it and they...
I mean, what they go, and I quote,
what language is this?
The document they're examining is called
the Declaration of Independence.
What I would like to know is,
how are those young people supposed to sign
contracts when they grow up?
They don't do it at all.
That's what lawyers are for.
With passwords.
Huh?
Well, yeah.
Well, no, that's what passwords are for.
They'll sign documents with a,
an encrypted form they've been given
and stuff, and that will, it's the same way,
it's the basis for when you sign online.
Oh, that's the way, they'll have babies
in the future, encrypted little packets
of sperm delivered through email
through the...
mmm, egg sac.
Or nanotubes, or nanotubes,
which are more popular in Europe right now.
And then you have to unstuff the baby,
or unzip the baby.
The baby is not so much born as unzipped,
decant, decompressed after transmission
of the codes.
Yeah, it's like Schrodinger's baby.
You know, you never can tell until you open up
the baby's crib and start to...
to wonder what...
Is it a boy or a girl?
Is it a human or a subgenius?
Yeah, my concern exactly is they're kind of
a hard species to define.
And you just don't expect just an ordinary bald head
and a little tweeny ween or a little tweeny
to determine anything.
And some of them don't have any kind of business
like heads with one of those huge machines
you were talking about inserting in the back
of your skull. I forgot.
Well, the children...
Bob predicted, and well, it's not a prediction
when it comes from Bob, it's gonna happen.
The children of the future, if the subgenius church
does not triumph, if the conspiracy wins,
the children of the future will be born...
They'll have giant heads and long...
six long fingers, but they will have no genitals.
Whereas if the church of the subgenius wins,
one million years from now, the kids of the future
will be nothing but...
Christ Bob.
Thank you, Reverend Ivan Strang,
for that enlightening comment.
The human body, let's recap, the human body
becomes nothing more than a giant genital organ.
That's under Bob.
It may cause Bob to sleep uncomfortably at times,
being under him, and he's like the princess and the pea.
Here we are back to peas again.
Hi, Reverend Peas, by the way.
It's Peas.
Peas all the way down.
I hope, yeah, we were, it was, have it,
we did a urination prayer earlier today,
if you missed it, because you were on the phone.
Oh, man, I hate, and then I have to go right afterwards,
which I was kind of hoping for.
All he was saying is give peas a chance.
Right, but not to call in.
No, we don't want him to call in.
That's the last thing we want peas to do is call in.
Okay.
I'm so mean.
What army of garden monkeys destroyed your communication systems?
Well, I was gonna ask,
I was gonna expect kind of like a Jetsons versus,
that's the new dichotomy, by the way,
Jetsons versus Flintstones.
That's new?
I mean, no, it's old,
but you hear all these media people like so glibly saying this old thing
that makes you want to kill them.
No, not, that's, I can't say that word.
Makes you want to throttle them with a gigantic rubber chicken.
Okay? Okay.
What, the old people? Because they don't, what? No.
No, no, no, no.
I got lost there, Dave, lost.
No, I think you got lost there in 1937 under the Fuhrer there for a moment.
I'm not talking about elderly people.
I'm talking about psychotic, what do they call them?
The big smokers, the people, you know, the capitalist imperialists.
No, what's the other word?
Fat cats?
Golfers.
Golfers?
Golfers.
The ones who can't really play golf?
The ones who can't really spend all their time playing golf?
Dave's digging himself a deeper and deeper hole.
I know, I feel that way.
Once he's started, he has to continue,
but those golfers are going to come after him.
It's already gone out over the air, Dave.
There's going to be golfers looking to launch your head, buddy.
I'm already in Timber's fear of anarcho-patriotic news.
I wouldn't worry about it, Dave.
I'm looking at a headline on Yahoo News on the little computer screen in front of me
that's just random headline.
Is Jeb Bush already the next Mitt Romney?
What kind of a question is that?
That's a loaded question, I would say.
Locked and loaded.
Very astute.
You understand rhetoric, compadre.
Just like saying, is Hillary Clinton already the next Bill Clinton?
It's beyond posing the question that doesn't exist at all.
It's way beyond it.
Right.
Yeah, I don't think that that's fair to either Bush or Romney.
But on the other hand, I don't really care.
And they probably deserve whatever they get.
In fact, everybody deserves whatever they get by definition.
That's what God said.
God said it.
I smoked it.
That settles it.
Wait a minute.
That's not...
Wait a minute.
That's the reggae version.
I can hear you.
Mr. Stank.
Is it all right to call you Mr. Stank?


Mr. Stank?
I mean, may I?
That's Reverend Stank.
Mr. Reverend Stank.
Well, the first thing I wanted to ask you is relative to curse avoiding, I think children
who do not know how to sign their names, as their nostrils in the same direction as
the...
What are they called then?
In the Big River.
Well, there is evidence that children, especially those born in the late 1940s and early 1950s,
were exposed to toxic chemicals that make them talk the way you do, Dave.
You just did.
I think.
They just blow off nuclear plants every five...
Like they blow up a nuclear device in your backyard and stuff, and you don't know how
And you'd be told that if you were to go under a desk and look upward at the many radio personalities that are making millions of dollars per week, I don't know what the content is.
But just recently, I was listening to one of these people on the radio who said to you that you were an inspiration in his career.
And he also got the negative land guys on there and stuff.
Well, the other day, you get off this Clyde Lewis thing.
I don't care what Clyde Lewis says about you, me or indifferent.
Well, no, it's just a big thing that he was purporting that aliens were coming to get us and take some to some of us be taken away successfully.
He said, where will you be on X-Day?
And I thought you might want to know that.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But everybody does that, Dave.
They do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you'd listen to something else besides Clyde Lewis, you'd hear that Rush Limbaugh is asking people about, are you ready for X-Day?
And, you know, I mean, Jon Stewart talks about X-Day constantly.
What?
I was talking.
I didn't hear you talk.
No, I'm just saying.
Do you mean?
It's just a happy phrase that you borrowed?
No, they're all ripping off the Church of the Subgenius.
That's what we're here for.
Oh, OK.
OK, OK.
For rich idiots to copy our concepts and turn them into.
God only knows what.
I don't even.
I've lost interest.
I'd rather be playing Minecraft.
You can promise you.
I understand you very well now what you are saying.
You are sick of being.
The entire thing you make you want to evacuate your self.
What I want to know is what is it that you think that someone can eat or take that will make them talk like Dave?
I don't understand this.
Can you explain?
It was the nucleus testing in the 40s and 50s.
The spread nucleus radiation all over and affected the nucleus in ourselves and made Dave talk the way he does.
and it makes us listen to it the way we do.
Oh, thank you very much.
It's poisoning, basically.
Thank you.
It's a type of brain, soul, body poisoning.
But it makes us immune to further poisoning.
Strength through disfigurement, Brother Cleve called it.
And, you know, so that's why the more vile chemicals you pour into yourself on purpose,
the less the ones that you intake accidentally will hurt you.
So it's like vaccines, you know.
Sure, they cause autism, but at least you won't get a cold.
It's beautiful.
That's the beauty part.
That's what they used to say in sales, and Bob said it many, many times.
That's the beauty part.
But that must be what all the young people are disfiguring themselves for,
is for strength, then, to pierce and to tattoo.
It's just for strength, right?
No.
That's so...
So they can get laid.
Oh.
Same reason I had long hair when I was a kid.
Oh, I see.
You know, same reason you wore mini skirts.
But you didn't have to.
Us boys had to do ridiculous things, like have long hair, or shave our hair off,
or poke rings in our faces to show how whatever we are.
Hell, I know what it's to show.
You go to the mall and spend $500 to prove, to become so outlandish looking,
that it proves to everyone that...
You don't care what you look like.
That's how cool you are.
In my tribe, we used to have to have our ears, our earlobes bald.
And that is painful.
Like, if you're like a nine-year-old child and stuff,
hey, you want to grow up and be a man, don't you?
Just give me that earlobe, buddy.
Just hand it right over here.
And then they put their fat little hands underneath your earlobe
and take one of them long sticks.
It'll be like, you know, some Indian tribe in South America
that you never really heard of.
But, you know, it's like baking soda.
You know, people have talked about it.
You don't know if it really exists.
Hey, I read once an anthropologist's description of kissing a Yubangi
or one of those types of people in Africa
that enlarge their lips using discs.
They, you know, ever-increasing discs.
They have the giant plate lips that kind of look almost duck-like.
Looks crazy to us.
But in that culture, it's a mark of beauty.
Anyway, this anthropologist was saying goodbye to her African friends in this tribe.
And her buddy had taken, didn't have the lip discs on.
So the lips were hanging down.
And she said it felt like pressing her own lips
against sort of a warm bowl of mush.
Whereas now, if you had your lip discs in,
they'd kind of be clackety-clack-clack.
And would seem...
If you had your lip discs in,
if you had your neck rings on,
if you had your Prince Albert ladder running up all the way, yeah.
Pope Sternodocs, why did that man bifurcate his penis like that?
Because he's a dumb idiot, that's why.
That's a quote, only I cleaned it up a little bit.
It was slightly altered.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
For broadcast purposes.
I can't wait to get slightly altered myself.
Oh, pardon me?
What was that again, Dave?
No, I was just saying...
No, no, you.
You first.
No, you.
I insist.
No, you.
Indubitably.
Inevitably.
Go.
Oh, no, you first.
My bifurcation of the penis.
It's really, really, really weird to see.
I'm sorry.
I'm done.
Do some people...
Pay extra for that.
At the mall.
You can probably get that done at the mall to prove you're cool.
I don't even have one, and that sounds so painful just to think of.
No, no, no.
A thousand times no.
There's already a bunch of bifurcation going on, but let's not go into that right now.
Right.
Because we had previously talked about self-immolation, and you, Princess Weave, were the victim who
brought it up yourself.
You introduced it into the conversation.
Yeah, way to go, man.
Smooth move, ex-lax.
Okay, I'm bummed.
I'm bummed.
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.
That's...
I'm totes bummed.
I'm totes bummed.
You harshed my mellow.
You marshed my hello.
Oh, gosh, my jello.
Huh?
No, I'm sorry.
I've got Hal's disease.
I'm sorry.
No, I...
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, my friend.
I didn't mean to steal your thunder or any other body parts that you're hiding recently.
Have you heard about...
Who are these people who tried to destroy your communication system, and why?
The conspiracy, because they're normal.
And they...
It's just...
They don't mean to be that way.
Malicious?
No.
They're not malicious.
They just...
They don't...
It's the conspiracy that...
They just don't know any better.
That doesn't know itself.
Right.
It's a conspiracy that doesn't know it's a conspiracy.
Jeez.
You know, we've been there.
We've done that.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, sure.
Or maybe it's just a...
It could possibly...
Now, could a subgenius screw up?
Oh, I don't know.
If a...
Actually, Dave, if a subgenius is true to Bob, the closer he is to Bob, the closer he is to Bob.
The harder it is for him to do anything but screw up, and yet, that is just what gets him ahead of the pink boy, the normal, the normally worm, the human, you know, the mediocrity, the Barbies, the Kins, the...
Hmm.
You know, the red...
The red tards, the...
Yes.
The yo-yos, the...
From what I understand...
If I run out of slurs...
The blibniacs.
Yeah, the blibniacs.
The Bob Dang's nabians.
Right.
Well, that's such name-calling.
You've just disproven your own entire theory by the lack of your rhetoric on the tail end of the project.
You were supposed to say something about how those things don't really matter because you build a strong argument, and then you said,
it's like them, and it's like this other, and you just totally threw me off there.
Well, Dave, you know, as it says here, sometimes our less confident fellow subgeni feel vexed.
Are you assuming that likes me, they're not some kind of imp resolutionist and false progressivesautisticon at all?






Sometimes I know that people at the bottom are, like, unfaithful and, frankly, guilty because they have the fairness to wonder if maybe the Pinks aren't right.
And we're just reminding you, friends, they aren't.
There are simply more of them.
It's best to look at them as an unfortunate fact of life, a force of nature like drought.
You have to deal with it, a time- chann curios, in際 shore exercise or other school prebund 순n�로ff-,
Well, I'm whĩc it.
What?
Discordian philosophy?
Discordant.
Discordant, yes.
Well, maybe.
Hail Eric.
Yeah.
I won't.
Exeter, the Elephant Man, yes.
Elephant Man from Planet Mutata.
No way.
And you know these people, right?
I mean, that's what you're trying to do.
No, I just saw movies about it.
I don't know these kind of people.
I just watch TV like everybody else.
That could be, because contrary to what, where would you be on Exeter?
I'm like, these many people are quoting you.
I'll probably...
I'll probably be in the bathroom on X-Day while they're all quoting me.
But I'll be where I'm happy.
I'm going to be in extra meditation.
I'll be at one with the Bob inside me,
and I'll be letting Bob and his little brown brothers out with expedience, I hope.
Without a struggle, we would hope.
One would hope.
What a strange delusion.
I mean, you are fabricating.
You've lost your mind.
If you think the most important thing in the world is to extra meditate on Bob,
well, extra...
It's not the most important thing in the world.
It's the only thing in the world.
It's all you can do once Bob gets his hooks in your head
and your other hidden organs that you were talking about.
Well, of course, because that's where they're supposed to be.
You're not supposed to see them until after X-Day.
You don't even really get to...
That's another hyperbole that's been tomatoed around like a sturgeon or something.
Like an old stick in the mud.
Go ahead and say it.
Yep, old Stang is just an old stick in the mud.
I'm not kidding, though.
I really would rather be playing Minecraft.
I installed Minecraft thanks to Taphouse.
Thanks, Taphouse.
They gave me a free copy.
Please, Taphouse.
And I started up Minecraft, and I started building a new planet called Glandland.
Glandistan.
And so far, we're working on a replica of Pappy's house,
only it's like triple size.
And it has a swimming pool.
We have a clifftop airy that you can stay in, Dave.
If you end up homeless, you can stay in our Minecraft castle.
And Reverend Stang built a stairway to heaven.
Yeah, yeah.
I actually built...
That took hours, because it's really like a quarter of a mile long.
Oh, I know.
It's hot.
I know.
Quarter of a mile high, and it's got little torches all along the way, so at night it's lit up.
But it does look like it goes all the way to heaven.
It goes up to the clouds anyway.
A little bit of a tiki motif going along with the old man's house.
Yeah.
And some other really cool things and stuff.
Yeah, yeah.
And you're going to turn into a bed and breakfast, and you're going to retire and write a novel
about having to deal with all these crazy people for 30 years.
Actually, it's more a Nordic style than tiki.
It's more the Nordic style of structure.
Lots of wood and stone and angular things going on.
Well, yeah, because that's not all you have in Minecraft is wood.
But then that's all you have in real life.
You know, rock and stick.
Except that's not true.
You see, back in the day, Chaz and Legume would say,
everything's rock or stick.
Think about it.
Well, I did think about it, and there are other things made of beasts.
There's rock, stick, and then there's bone and skin.
Like, in front of me at this radio station, there's a couple of books in front of me.
Well, they're made of stick, mostly.
The ink is made from some form of mineral or rock.
The mix board is almost solid rock-derived or non-living things.
You know, petroleum products and stuff.
Petrochemicals, yes.
But then Princess Wee's jacket looks like it might be made of the skin of some beast.
Indeed it is.
Yes, it is.
Oh, yes.
Is it really a beast?
You're wearing a beast?
You're going to go to vegan hell, Princess Wee.
It's fine with me.
Coat is warm.
I'm wearing it.
So anyway, you know, it's rock, stick, and bone.
Or flesh, meat, whatever.
Friends, you've been listening to the Subgenius Hour of Slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
For more information, you can write to or look at or something, subgenius.com.
Or just type subgenius.
Subgenius in a computer, and you'll see.
And then you'll be sorry.
But.
Definitely.
Now, this is where we fade out and end the show for other radio stations.
But for the internet listeners, this is where we leave the show going
until Dr. Sinister gets here, which lately couldn't mean any old time.
He just pulled in.
Oh, did he?
Princess Wee's looking at the interocitor there.
I'm monitoring the interocitor.
Exeter's interocitor.
Exeter.
And so we had a bit.
So internet listeners and Dave, we have an extra five minutes on the show.
Yo!
So what do we do with this valuable air time?
We've wasted the last hour.
Good truth.
You mean on WCSB 89.3 in Cleveland?
That's right.
Here at WCSB Cleveland, we have done what we had to do.
Yeesh.
Although.
Although.
The best of our seeds, our alacrity, our little.
We gave our best.
We did everything we could.
And now it's too late.
Oh, man.
Man, the show is just starting to get good.
And then the next host walks in and ruins everything.
God!
I thought you were referring to like your bowel movements in the middle of the night
and stuff that you couldn't control.
You were talking about rabbits or something else.
No, Dave.
We have to go now.
This.
This is the end.
And I'm going to do the fade out like I do.
It's happening, Dave.
Dave can't even talk, so they can hear you fade out.
We're losing you.
Okay, now I'm going to talk and fade out.
Oh, wait, that wasn't him.
Now he's out.
That was something else.
And now the music goes away and I go away.
Here's kind of, look at this picture here of Zealandia.
Ah, there it is, a nice map.
Yeah, there's the whole Zealandia continent.
And Campbell Plateau, still a sub-aqueous,
but extending a long way to the south.
The Chatham Rise to the east.
To the north, the Challenger Plateau,
named after Professor George Edward Challenger.
And the South Sea Rays, is that what it says?
The lettering is kind of small.
My eyes aren't very good.
It's a movie that Professor Challenger was in.
Well, The Lost World.
But there was more that he did than just discover a prehistoric plateau
where dinosaurs still lived.
He also discovered that the Earth itself was one living organism.
And he...
He did that by irritating it with a probe, an underground probe.
And what else did he do?
He discovered the Earth.
Do you like to irritate the Earth, Dr. Howell?
No, I don't.
I'm, since I'm essentially like a microbe or a free surface.
Challenger, that's just the way he was.
He tickled it and created huge earthquakes and things.
But, but, uh, and what else did he do?
He's tickling it right now.
With my little finger.
Another story about Challenger that was written by A. Conan Doyle
was the disintegration machine.
Where not Challenger, but another mad scientist
demonstrated his machine that would disintegrate anything.
And, uh, he also was a nasty character.
So Challenger got him to, tricked him into standing in front of it
and, and pretext of how to operate it,
he turned it on and disintegrated the guy.
So his horrible machine would never, uh, be able to operate.

And, uh, bother humanity.
And then he put on his hat and left.
Ah, that's, uh, what about if we had Professor Challenger
and Professor Quartermain together in the same story?
That was done in that, uh, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
Starfleet to scout ship.
Please give your position.
Over.
I am in orbit around the third planet of star known as Sun.
Over.
May this be Earth.
Over.
Positive.
It is known to have some form...
of intelligent species...
B.O.B.
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.
And not just this show, but subgenius.com
and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,
you should go to subgenius.com front page
or especially the radio page
or the catalog store pages
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference,
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that...
...
Blowjobs could go the way of Stevejobs if you don't pay Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders to
Subgenius Foundation
P.O. Box 181 417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
