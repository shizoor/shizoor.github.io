1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,360
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,740
The self-genius, power of swag.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,220
Now I know all about everything.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:11,720
What?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:26,040
And before we do anything else, a brand new song by Reverend Fat Man D called Fourth Reich.

7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,360
Fourth Reich.

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,160
Could a fourth Reich be arising?

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,840
Because the terrorists are here.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,020
A fourth Reich arising.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,800
They've been living here for years.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,300
They're the ones who all be lying.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,020
From their tongues to our ears.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,900
Though they don't build a kingdom based on ignorance and fear.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,900
They raise up all the masses who refuse to try to think.

16
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,680
Pass around the poison, people line up and they drink.

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
They're the men in the mirror.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
And they're shouting at themselves.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Screaming at the murder they've been stacking on the shelves.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
Selling hate for Christmas.

21
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,160
Burning crosses across the land.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,700
I promise you I know the gods.

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,800
This is not their plan.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,740
Big man yelling,

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,280
Screaming loud.

26
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,760
Put on that yellow star.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,620
He will shoot you if he sees you.

28
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,920
He won't let you get far.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Uuuuuh.

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,600
Uuuuuh.

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,980
Uuuuuh.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,220
Uuuuuh.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,420
Uuuuuh.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,900
The yellow star of yesterday is Trump's bolding crescent of today.

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,840
Branding all the Muslims, the Mexicans, that's not the way.

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,660
Forget them.

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,540
Who were here first and we're all refugees.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,200
But didn't even your Jesus say love thy neighbors the way to be?

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:40,980
Yeah.

40
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,180
Today is my day?

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,320
Day of the faith for paragliding.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,560
There'll be rreu car Imperial Corps aircraft at Ehles University,

43
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,660
Uuh...

44
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:23,780
Uuu

45
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,460
Uuuuuh.

46
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,660
Uuuuuh.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,640
Not like a dangerous diner.

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,640


49
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,640


50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,640


51
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,860
Seems to me that Jesus might be sad at what we do

52
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,040
But don't ask me, I'm just another short fat tattooed Jew

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,740
I know that keep them out, lock them up and give me my gun

54
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,020
It's a call to war and a call to hate and a prayer to the long one

55
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,860
Cause I feel that forthright rising, rising faster than we can see

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,860
All the hatred, all the lies, nowhere left to be

57
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,820
Could a forthright be arising? Can I let it come to near?

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,880
We cannot let them build a kingdom based on lies and build on fear

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,780
Must not let them build up all the hate

60
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,560
And be so happy

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
Ah yes, yes, yes.

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,180
That was Forth Reich by Reverend Fat Man D.

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,900
Ah yes, dear friends.

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,020
Did you know that this is our 1600th episode?

65
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,620
That's right, Hour of Slack number 1600.

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,120
And you better not let your kids watch this one

67
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
because part of it takes place during the day.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:56,840


69
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:56,840


70
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,280
We're in the Bobtism at the 19X Day Drill in the pond at Wisteria.

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,240
And the Bobtism is clothing optional.

72
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,260
And Reverend Eggplant opted out of clothing.

73
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,400
So yeah, turn off the picture or watch it later on YouTube

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,140
on the channel called RevStang.

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,440
And we'll go to that X Day show soon.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,600
But first I'm going to read a little more from our out-of-print book

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,840
The Subgenius Song.

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,960
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

79
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,520
The Bobliographon.

80
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,400
And there's a little piece here by Nenslow.

81
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,240
It's obvious, of course, that the world in general is an idiot's delight.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,320
A contrived mediocrity designed to keep morons occupied.

83
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,740
Just look at the notorious conspiracy media.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Not the decoy reputable.

85
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,300
That's just a distraction.

86
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,560
Window dressing to make things look good.

87
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,280
I mean the stuff people really read and really believe

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,780
whether they admit it or not.

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,340
Look at the tabloids.

90
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,180
The true crime magazines.

91
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,980
The TV murder shows.

92
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,440
Two-inch thick metallic embossed covered hack sci-fi novels and romances.

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,560
Lame movie thrillers.

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,940
Manufactured music personalities.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,500
It's bread and circuses.

96
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,440
With politicians as the clowns.

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,820
Except the more fun you want to have, the more you have to pay.

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,780
Don't act like you haven't thought about how bad that stuff sucks.

99
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,280
You talk about it all the time.

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,140
The question is what are you gonna do about it?

101
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,000
They, the conspiracy, wants you to buy all their crap.

102
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,700
Work hard all day at a mindless slave task to pay for more machines to play their indoctrination programs on.

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,480
To fill your home with pseudo collectibles and a limited number of computers.

104
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,260
number of addition of a damn zillion.

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,760
You know all that.

106
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
We've told you and told you all that,

107
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,380
and you don't believe it,

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,060
but if you don't believe it by now,

109
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,380
if you don't believe it by now,

110
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,820
there's no hope for you at all.

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,400
And you might as well climb back over the fence

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,580
and roll in the mud with the rest of the slavish porkers, right?

113
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,520
So says Nenslow.

114
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,080
But these kids these days,

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,760
with their cheap-ass gee-gaw and crusted broomsticks,

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,860
all these youth-rads and gimme-bobs

117
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,720
whine and yowl about how their new conspiracy

118
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,540
has worse jackboots than the old one did.

119
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,860
But the only thing that's really changed

120
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,680
are the haircuts.

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
Oh, the governments change eventually,

122
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,580
but each time you just get more government

123
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,680
and more haircuts.

124
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,740
Reading history can lead to a deep sense

125
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,060
of what's going on in the world.

126
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,860
Pessimism.

127
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,280
Subgenius has updated and modernized

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,000
a famous poem written about Nazi Germany

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,980
by Martin Nehmoeller,

130
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,600
a German Protestant pastor.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Here's our version.

132
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,420
They came for the computer hackers,

133
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,860
and I didn't object for I wasn't a computer hacker.

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
They came for the pornography,

135
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,480
and I didn't object because I wasn't a pornographer.

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,880
But then they came for the mutes.

137
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
If you believe the conspiracy theorists,

138
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,140
the smartest thing any of us can do right now

139
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,440
would be to study survivalist manuals,

140
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,540
flee this mass media hallucination,

141
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,380
buy cheap land in the Yukon,

142
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,740
and hide in a dome with a stockpile of canned food,

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,820
a Dobbs head, and a frot pipe,

144
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,000
and practice your aim.

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,380
Otherwise, learn to give the best oral sex in town

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,740
from inside a barrel.

147
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,960
But we don't trust the conspiracy theorists

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,660
any more than we trust the conspiracy.

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,460
Most of them are conspiracy conspiracy theorists anyway.

150
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,860
We trust only subgenius revealed truth,

151
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,440
and that says,

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,440
that the entire conspiracy, us included,

153
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,320
is but a parasitic fungus on the skin of the overmind,

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,040
that the human race is a virus,

155
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,300
an infestation like fleas,

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,320
and that the host will soon be dipped.

157
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,140
Any political argument is thus rendered tragically moot.

158
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
Knowing this, the subgenius adheres to patriarchal,

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,300
psychotic, anarcho-materialism,

160
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,000
which, by definition, each person defines differently.

161
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,800
In patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism,

162
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,340
state sovereignty isn't nearly enough.

163
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,160
That would be a good start.

164
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,600
The Soviet Union broke up? Good!

165
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,840
Then by gobs it's time for the USA to break up

166
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,360
into the disunited states,

167
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,900
and then to break up a lot more.

168
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,540
Household sovereignty is what we're talking about.

169
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,420
If you study chimpanzees,

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,280
or kindergarten children for a week,

171
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,580
politics will suddenly make sense.

172
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,560
You mustn't let petty primate politics

173
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,100
bring you down to their level, my friend.

174
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,480
Rise above it, in flight, blow yourself up,

175
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,720
and float placidly high above the middle of the road,

176
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,260
once you can survey how silly they all look.

177
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,420
Scurrying down below,

178
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:53,620
below.

179
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Ah, yes.

180
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,340
And friends, that was a short reading there

181
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,820
from the subgenius pacyclopedia of slack,

182
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
the Bobliographon.

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,280
New revelations from J.R. Bob Dobbs,

184
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,800
published in 2006,

185
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,960
and two publishers in a row went out of business

186
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
shortly after that.

187
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:14,740
Hmm.

188
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,800
We'll re-release it ourselves

189
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,040
as an e-book or something soon.

190
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,300
And now,

191
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
back to the subject.

192
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,300
Back to July 2016,

193
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,080
and a live show at the 19X Day Drill

194
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,780
with Dr. Hal, yours truly,

195
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,320
and for the first time ever,

196
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,900
Reverend Pease.

197
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,240
.

198
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,400
.

199
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,620
Recording, recording, everything going, going.

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,400
Fine, we don't know, but it's going.

201
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:46,860
.

202
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:46,880
.

203
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,740
.

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,020
.

205
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,660
.

206
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:51,660


207
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,720
.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,420
.

209
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,740
Ah, yes, dear friends,

210
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,540
and so we begin again another hour of slack,

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,720
recorded here at the beautiful Wisteria Campground and Events Center

212
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,540
in near Pomeroy, Ohio.

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,620
Oh, and I should start up the slideshow.

214
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,920
Dr. Howell, take it away.

215
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,620
Many are the multifold and wondrous stories of X-Day.

216
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,900
Just brushing the edge of the country of legend,

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,740
and sometimes crossing entirely over into that unknown realm.

218
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,580
The abode of spirits.

219
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,940
The stories tell us of the ancient guardian of the pond.

220
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,740
Once, only a 200-pound snapping turtle,

221
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:09,200
old Siqua, found favor in the eyes of the great spirit,

222
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,080
Wakong Tonka.

223
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,040
And according to...

224
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:23,160
The ancient story was granted the boon of indefinite, even eternal existence.

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,140
Though even the almighty spirit may not know its duration.

226
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,380
And so, only putting the tip of his enormous algae-encrusted bill

227
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,760
out of the water in the stillness of the night,

228
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
he takes in the vital atmosphere,

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,400
which even Siqua must absorb.

230
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,700
He waits eternally for the unwary at the bottom of the ancient shaft.

231
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,680
And we will be visiting the edge of that ancient shaft at three o'clock.

232
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,460
That's right.

233
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,440
The schedule...

234
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,580
The schedule, which no one ever looks at,

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
is, uh, wrong.

236
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,340
It is one hour early.

237
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,580
The schedule is too eager for that event to take place.

238
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,800
But it will take place, as sure as there's a heaven behind the sun,

239
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,880
on three o'clock.

240
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:40,880
And only the doctrinally impure subgenius in the pond need worry about being taken by old Siqua

241
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,420
as the required...

242
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,540
...sacrifice.

243
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,200
He's...

244
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,380
He only takes one.

245
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,500
One by weight, which he might make up from several,

246
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,380
if there actually could be such a thing as several doctrinally impure subgeniuses

247
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,040
jonesing for pink enticements,

248
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,860
while they pretend to be on the slackful path,

249
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,760
and on our great and sacred mission to create universes,

250
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,400
and on our great and sacred mission to create universes,

251
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,200
of slack.

252
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,420
Ah, yes.

253
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,960
A universe of slack sounds pretty good to me.

254
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm getting a little bit toasted.

255
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,340
This is day four, or so,

256
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,260
and I've been trying to get a nice night of sleep every night,

257
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,540
but of course it doesn't happen.

258
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:42,400
And I'm getting into that state of mind where you put something important in your mind,

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,720
down and instantly lose it. You put it down in the wrong place or the right

260
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,920
place it doesn't matter. Oh here's something I was looking for oh no that's

261
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,500
not it. We had a newspaper from commemorating the derecho, the terrible

262
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,440
terrible weather that struck us that first X day and then the second X day at Wisteria.

263
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,960
Exception of nature occurred. But on the other hand although there were

264
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,240
incredible malignant weather formations and phenomena very few of them actually

265
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,880
struck X day even when the irate gods hurled thunderbolts they landed

266
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,100
harmlessly outside Caffeinas and raced down the hill toward the grindhouse.

267
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,300
And we got a great recording of it. Cut to lightning strike recording now.

268
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,860
Yeah we put all these effects in in post.

269
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,780
Well that's right.

270
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,560
Boom on the saucers.

271
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,220
Holy head shit.

272
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,860
Don't worry folks lightning never strikes in the same place twice.

273
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,180
I saw that that lightning bolt hit.

274
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,480
Yeah I did too.

275
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,720
I heard it that settles it.

276
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,220
Bob paid for it.

277
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,060
Sinners in the hands of an angry God.

278
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,260
And so there was perturbation in heaven and earth.

279
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,760
You should have seen them people perturbating. They're crazy perturbating all over the place.

280
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:19,300
They almost were so perturbated that their souls spurted from their bodies leaving them soulless beings.

281
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,360
And many have taken voluminous pains to determine the state of the soul upon disunion.

282
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,340
Here comes one of those souls now. It's an ugly one.

283
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:31,900
Get away.

284
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,220
A scary one. Oh gross.

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,240
Get it off me.

286
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,320
One of them bit me the other day.

287
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,220
One of them got me right in the face. Right in the side.

288
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,740
Yeah hell's got you. Hell's got you.

289
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,880
He's got a soul bite on his chin there.

290
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,960
Still tingles and is unpleasant like many other things.

291
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:54,940
But you know it is unto us the subgeniuses who are attempting to guide the others.

292
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:02,520
Not out of vain gloriousness but because someone must take up these disdained things.

293
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,100
It is up to us to suffer the ravages of show host syndrome.

294
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Where in order to give you the right to live.

295
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,880
Where in order to give slack to others we receive so much less of it ourselves.

296
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,120
Is that a complaint of wine?

297
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,180
Wine is a mockery.

298
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,320
A fine wine.

299
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,720
A fine old wine.

300
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,500
Strong drink is raging.

301
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes the wine of the sacrament.

302
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,320
So uh you know.

303
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,960
Oh here's my list of camping things to bring.

304
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,880
Oh no I forgot all of it.

305
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,280
Good thing I'm not camping.

306
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,480
Camp stove.

307
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,680
Camp tarpaulin.

308
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,500
Camp toilet.

309
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,040
Camp movies.

310
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,980
Susan Sontag snark list.

311
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,140
Pith helmet.

312
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
Gum boots.

313
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,820
And many packages of Wrigley's Spearmint Gum.

314
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,080
And of course television.

315
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,120
Because you know when you go camping you want to watch TV.

316
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:05,580
We have tried to offer good and bad film at this festival.

317
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,700
But the only people who ever show up to watch it.

318
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,860
Are the projectionists.

319
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,780
So we may or may not blow that off.

320
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,300
But yes it's Saturday.

321
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,100
Saturday at X Day.

322
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,620
And a lot more people came in last night.

323
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,820
And will probably roll in today.

324
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,860
Yes.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,580
Well Reverend Stang it's up to you now to describe what's going to happen in the next few hours.

326
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,420
The tumultuous events of this X Day 19.

327
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,120
Starting with the Bob-tism at 3 o'clock.

328
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:49,940
But then we all troop those who Sequa has left back from the Bob-tismal pond.

329
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,000
And then.

330
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,200
Well I imagine that there are some people who actually obeyed the schedule.

331
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:58,960
One or two.

332
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,460
And they're down there baptizing each other right now.

333
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,460
Well.

334
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,100
I see some new subgeniuses have just come in.

335
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,880
And may they have joy of it.

336
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
And then there's the no-comment.

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,060
The costume ball.

338
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,120
Isn't that right?

339
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,700
Right.

340
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,000
After the Bob-tism.

341
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,600
The costume-less, theme-less ball.

342
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Yes.

343
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,480
And then.

344
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,920
I've got my costume.

345
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,180
Such as it is.

346
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,480
And then.

347
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,980
What happens then is what?

348
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,360
The more of this and then the Bull-Dotta auction or something?

349
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,720
Oh yeah.

350
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:28,920
Yeah.

351
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,380
Actually during the party.

352
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,100
Or a little ways into the party.

353
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
We should start doing the Bull-Dotta auction.

354
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,220
Yes.

355
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,640
As it trails off.

356
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,320
Because there's a lot of the moneyed subgeniuses are going to be leaving tomorrow.

357
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,020
Oh we can't allow that.

358
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,560
That would be a violation of the cosmic contract.

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,580
And somebody somewhere would have to pay it.

360
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,600
It might be me except I'm momentarily embarrassed because my creditors are pressing me.

361
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,960
And so we will have to tithe from the faithful once again.

362
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:04,700
To screw out every drop of life blood from the financial circulatory system.

363
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Of the joyous subgeniuses.

364
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:15,320
Who are going to give up all of that subservience to the invisible and non-existent monetary

365
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:23,460
god when they step aboard the pleasure saucers of the Exist Space Goddesses.

366
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,620
The monetary god, it may be invisible but he's got a big hand.

367
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,080
A great big invisible hand.

368
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,400
That can just yank you up all of a sudden.

369
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,440
Such as with car repairs.

370
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,920
It is an occult force that is not to be trifled with lightly.

371
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,140
But like all of those things it is unreal from our perspective.

372
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,160
And only granted reality by us that it may continue moment to moment.

373
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,080
The poet John Milton realized this.

374
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
And often spoke of it disparagingly.

375
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,860
Being somewhat ashamed of being in a family of usurers.

376
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,400
Since usury is forbidden according to some biblical texts.

377
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,760
Bob is the zombie who eats your skin and the weasel who rips your flesh, friends.

378
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,360
But what have you done for Bob lately, huh?

379
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,960
Come on.

380
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,380
I bet he hadn't seen you with a collection plate or a spray paint.

381
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,160
Can in your hand lately, I bet you.

382
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
When you see some...

383
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,440
You bet you posted on Facebook.

384
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,980
When was the last time you climbed up a building and spray painted Bob's head in some dangerous place?

385
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,740
Or even less effort than that.

386
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:51,340
What is the last time you saw some doofus shambling along who might be relieved of his existential agony

387
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:58,660
if you only whispered a word of Bob's gospel to him and yet you held back?

388
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,140
When was the last time you made a crop circle that looked like Bob?

389
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,920
Bob and Doug did.

390
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:12,580
Actually Bob and Doug were the guys who instigated that while drinking instigator beer.

391
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,760
And there was Bob and Dave who did Mr. Show.

392
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,720
And all kinds of Bobs working constantly toward the same gradually clearing goal.

393
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,240
Too many Bobs, too many Dougs.

394
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,140
We had to number them.

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,600
Yeah.

396
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:37,160
Now remember, the Bobtism will cover you until the saucers come this year.

397
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:48,120
If by any chance there was a delay owing to cosmic rays or eruptions of nuclear or matter, antimatter force in the universe,

398
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:56,920
then the following year a repeat of the Bobtism process would be necessary and vital.

399
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:08,860
We are, as Bob's ministers, equipped to Bobtize all and sundry who venture into the historic Wisteria pond.

400
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,960
Now friends, we begin about the Bobtism.

401
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,200
With an all new script this time, I'm sure.

402
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,200
Reverend Goldilocks, first time today, first Bobtism.

403
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,020
Do you reject the conspiracy?

404
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,120
And all of its trappings from your life and accept Bob into your heart and mind?

405
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,500
I wholeheartedly do.

406
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,080
That's beautiful! Down you go!

407
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:36,960
Huh!

408
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,020
Except you're gonna push her apart.

409
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
Praise Bob!

410
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,420
I lost a cleanse!

411
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,840
You see how easy it is, ladies and gentlemen.

412
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,360
Let's keep them coming.

413
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:56,000
Reverend Daniel has yet to choose his church name because it's a decision that sometimes takes years.

414
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,260
It is a biblical and prophetic name.

415
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,340
And in the lion's den?

416
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:11,720
Do you reject the lion's den, the conspiracy, and accept Bob and all his flying saucers and whatever bizarre things he decides to do to you during the course of this weekend?

417
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,240
Into your heart and mind say yes!

418
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,200
Oh, I do, yes!

419
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,840
Oh, God! Down you go!

420
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,240
A fake plan in an unusual way.

421
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,500
We usually have them go...

422
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,280
Let's go, Reverend Daniel.

423
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,780
Um...

424
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,220
And don't worry about the brain-eating amoebas this time.

425
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,780
They won't if you just stop mentioning them all the time.

426
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,280
No one likes those amoebas.

427
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,440
You know, they can only live in warm water, don't you know?

428
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,320
Oh, yes, I know. They can only live in warm water...

429
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,240
The water in the pond is cold, except at the surface.

430
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,660
So be careful when accidentally ingesting a few drops at the surface.

431
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,260
But who wants to get that stuff in your mouth?

432
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,280
Well, ingesting a brain-eating amoeba won't do anything. Then you're eating the amoeba's brain.

433
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,560
They get in through your nose.

434
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Well, then, of course, you want to protect those apertures.

435
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,960
But the pond is cold for a reason, and it contains filtered water.

436
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,380
So let's not scare the already easily scared subgenius.

437
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,520
Wait a minute. You've been talking about old Sequa, the giant prehistoric snapping turtle,

438
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,020
at the bottom of the pond that kills subgeniuses.

439
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,120
And I'm not supposed to mention the tiny brain-eating amoebas?

440
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,980
It doesn't kill true subgeniuses, only lapsed subgeniuses, only the doctrinally impure.

441
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,380
And then only when it's in the mood, being a reptile.

442
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,600
So I was merely trying to speak respectfully.

443
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,100
Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, Dr. Howell,

444
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,380
for speaking respectfully of the things that want to kill us.

445
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,480
I suppose you don't start talking respectful about pigs now. They want to kill.

446
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,600
Everything else in the universe.

447
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,340
Actually, they probably don't even notice us.

448
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,000
Well, they can kill you without noticing you, or without knowing that they want to kill you.

449
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,040
Remember, the conspiracy is not a conscious conspiracy.

450
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,820
Reverend Lobster, do you, in the name of Bob,

451
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,200
in the name of Connie, in the name of Godzilla and other great monsters,

452
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,540
accept Bob in your heart and reject the conspiracy from your nether regions?

453
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,780
Yes, I do!

454
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,280
Hey, Bob!

455
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,860
I almost impaled him on that spike there.

456
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,940
That would have been good.

457
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,940
Reverend Lobster, rise. A crawdad for Bob.

458
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,460
Well, I haven't met you yet.

459
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,760
I'm Reverend Flamegrape from Knoxville.

460
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,500
Oh, right! It's another show.

461
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,800
This guy does another, or did another subgenius show.

462
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,820
Well, I will do it in the middle of the night. I'll tell you about it.

463
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,560
Right, right, right.

464
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,180
Many of us do it in the middle of the night.

465
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,860
You play the Hour of Slack on the radio in Knoxville.

466
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,580
Yeah, one year. One year in Knoxville.

467
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,300
I also do it in the middle of the night.

468
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:02,780
Praise Bob!

469
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:09,340
Well, we know you're clean in the eyes of Bob, but this formality will make you cleaner.

470
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,540
Do you, Reverend Flamegrape, accept Bob into your life, reject the conspiracy, and...

471
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
And always brush with him.

472
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,640
Yeah, always brush your brush at night.

473
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,380
It's important.

474
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,880
Yes, I do. I do.

475
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,940
Down he goes!

476
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,640
Down under.

477
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,680
Praise Bob.

478
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,480
All right, Reverend Anna Mall is next.

479
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,120
Overlord.

480
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,580
So I only get the sprinklings.

481
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,180
Oh, you're just going to get the sprinkling, huh?

482
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,980
Just the sprinklings, because it'll mess up my delightful hair.

483
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,620
No, you can't.

484
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,620
Your hair is delightful.

485
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,100
Reverend Anna Mall!

486
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's call on the Catoochie!

487
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,800
All right, in the middle of the night.

488
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,620
In the name of Bob!

489
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,560
In the name of Connie Dobbs!

490
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,300
In the name of Reverend Anna Mall!

491
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,640
I cast out the demons of the conspiracy!

492
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,900
I cast out Neegie and all the bad things that ever happened to you!

493
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
I'm sprinkling this whole water around on you.

494
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,280
Can you just sprinkle some water?

495
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,640
It's cold, isn't it?

496
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,920
No, continue to sprinkle.

497
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,000
This is good to keep flies away, too.

498
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,860
You flick water at them and they don't like it.

499
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,040
This is the cold love of Bob.

500
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,840
Ah, believe it!

501
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I believe it!

502
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,780
I'm convinced!

503
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,700
I'm not convinced!

504
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,180
I believe you were so cold.

505
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,660
If you can't whoop it, go down.

506
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,820
We could afford a bigger conspiracy up here.

507
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,060
Reverend Pease, did you want to come up?

508
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,780
Reverend Angry Larry, do you want to arm wrestle Reverend Pease?

509
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:36,740
We have an extra microphone and even extra headphones here for those with an extra head.

510
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,300
X-Day made so much money last year, we got a new set of headphones.

511
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,700
Why are we rolling in it, so to speak?

512
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,260
I thought I smelled something.

513
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,240
Certainly not me.

514
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,040
I have them on me.

515
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,460
And so...

516
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,340
Yeah, those things go on your ears, Reverend Pease.

517
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,580
It was given unto Reverend Pease.

518
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,200
And look at his mic stand.

519
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,920
It's a cigar box.

520
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,380
Is his mic standing?

521
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,580
No doubt it's the excitement of this occasion.

522
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,900
Well, it's the near proximity to you, Dr. Howe, that's got me a little bit of a jitter.

523
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,500
Everyone was astounded by Reverend Pease's vigorous stage work last night.

524
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,480
I was surprised.

525
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,180
I didn't know that he was a professional stripper.

526
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:33,140
Well, you thought it was online, but no, that's just one fragment of the effusion of his personality.

527
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:41,720
Now, this tangle of wires, could it be possibly ameliorated or is something going to become unattached at a crucial moment?

528
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,480
No, that's part of our slack.

529
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,800
That may not have been properly explained in the contract.

530
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,460
Boy, it's like the so-called radio station I'm at where if you move your mic, you're going to get a signal.

531
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:58,500
If you move your foot an inch, you disconnect the whole thing because there's a huge tangle of loosely attached wires at your feet.

532
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:58,960
Yes.

533
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,640
Didn't you recently have to throw off that yoke and repair the consoles yourself during a recent episode?

534
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,600
Oh, we bring in jump doggies to do that.

535
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,720
You'll need to put your head closer to that mic. You could hold it.

536
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,060
Minions. Mermadons.

537
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,860
But try not to finger it too much because you'll see it.

538
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,140
Because you'll hear those finger palpations and they'll become part of it.

539
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,440
But you'll see it. You can hear them.

540
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,920
But it helps. See how close my lips are to the microphone?

541
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,840
I had a mic stand but we used it at the main stage.

542
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,500
I keep running back and forth to get things like adapters.

543
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,440
Ours have sponge-based spit guards but yours do not.

544
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:46,400
So don't be surprised if a little actinic spark shoots from the mic to the wet surface of your mouth.

545
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,120
Am I fingering it right now?

546
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,580
Oh, that's good. That's good. That's real good.

547
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,420
No, you're not fingering. You're coming in deeper.

548
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,220
Clear as a bell.

549
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,380
I prefer to think with this fingering.

550
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,620
More tickles.

551
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,240
Yes, Mr. America and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.

552
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,520
This is the first Bobcast to incorporate the voice of Reverend Pease.

553
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,600
I guess that's true, isn't it?

554
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:16,920
Well, actually they do a podcast that has a very tinny, thin sound.

555
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,740
I'm proud to say we have over four listeners.

556
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,560
So we've really doubled our listener viewing.

557
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,000
Well, now I didn't say podcast, did I?

558
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,220
You did not, sir. You absolutely did not.

559
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,100
Because this distinction is becoming blurry like everything else.

560
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,060
Now there's podcast radio, so-called.

561
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,880
Has nothing to do with radio.

562
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,280
And podcast TV.

563
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,540
In San Francisco there's a big podcast TV station.

564
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,380
And I've even been on it several times.

565
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,320
And you go there and it's bustling.

566
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,800
And it's full of energetic young people.

567
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,880
And they have a coffee house and a cafe and equipment and all sorts of stuff.

568
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,920
And how do they possibly pay the rent in San Francisco?

569
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,380
Who pays for all this stuff?

570
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,640
This torrent of technological change?

571
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,920
Doesn't the state of California give you a podcast when you renew your driver's license?

572
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,120
They're so hip.

573
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,000
They're so advanced out there.

574
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,980
They teach kindergarten kids how to do a podcast in California.

575
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,200
That's why Philo's leaving.

576
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,820
Every voice must be heard.

577
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,100
Tune every heart and every voice.

578
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,820
Well, when everybody has a show, nobody has a show.

579
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
That's when not having a show will be hip.

580
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,320
Like, hey, I'm not doing my show again this Sunday.

581
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,840
Did you get a sub? A rerun?

582
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
A special second name?

583
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,740
A substitute?

584
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,840
A substitute.

585
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,380
Somebody to get in there and pitch it for you?

586
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,240
Not do the show.

587
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,620
Just not do the show.

588
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:11,520
Well, I always like to get something in there live because the fans and or detractors say that it's not as much fun when there's a rerun.

589
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,280
So on mine, I've got puzzling evidence.

590
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Wreaking havoc.

591
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:29,060
Yeah, I've got X Day 7 is tricking the listeners at WCSB Cleveland into thinking they're hearing X Day live.

592
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,580
Some rather well-edited live.

593
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,980
It's so much fun to trick the little tiny listeners.

594
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:45,100
Well, you know, speaking of podcast TV, several subgeniuses, in other words, Dr. Leguim, wanted to preach.

595
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,620
Leguim has a sermon and he wants to preach via FaceTime or something.

596
00:34:49,620 --> 00:35:01,440
And all I need is someone who knows how to put your phone on or possibly this laptop onto the screen or at least the sound.

597
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,940
On the other hand, he probably should just send me a file.

598
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,940
Those sound like K-Rob's time-saving shortcuts to technology.

599
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,140
He's always doing things like that.

600
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,180
We can't get the studio phone to work and he just grabs the phone and puts it by a microphone and it somehow works.

601
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:18,620
Sure.

602
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,160
Instead of using the controls.

603
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,420
You know, when the slideshow stops, audience members should run up here and wave their hands back and forth or touch the space bar.

604
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,340
Yes, that would imply that they are actually watching the pictures.

605
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:40,680
You'll have to let security let some of them off because they've been pushing the crowds back and as we know, it's been excessive this year.

606
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,540
Well, it's best that none of them be harmed through their understandable impetuosity.

607
00:35:48,860 --> 00:36:03,960
And after we return and after there's the no costume ball and so forth, we're going to have the Bulldada auction and some of the treasures of time will be made available to deserving subgeniuses.

608
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:10,240
And who knows, if the bidding is low, you can walk away with an incredible prize.

609
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:17,500
That is if certain of the auctioneers don't do that first, which is their time-honored privilege.

610
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,720
These are treasures.

611
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,700
These are treasures that have not been seen in the light of man's eyes for thousands of years.

612
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,140
Like that.

613
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,740
Available to you today only.

614
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,800
Like that carven mechanical fornication fetish object which Stang's scooped up.

615
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,500
But there are other things that will get through the net and may be available.

616
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,040
Ah.

617
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,100
It's interesting.

618
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,700
This solar-powered monkey seems to be picking up energy even in the shadows.

619
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:48,700


620
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
I wonder why.

621
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,700
I have a little dancing skeleton like that.

622
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,020
Princess Wee and I have a skeleton that dances on our window sill.

623
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,500
I've seen it.

624
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,480
I've seen it.

625
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,840
I've seen it dancing.

626
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,520
It dances a lot harder on snowy days.

627
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,500
There's so much light bouncing around.

628
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,680
Get light coming from the bottom as well as the top.

629
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,360
But I wonder what there is to power this fellow here in the shade.

630
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,880
If only that worked for me.

631
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,420
I could really use solar power.

632
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,560
You think so.

633
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,680
But then you'd have to slather on the...

634
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:18,680


635
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:26,060
I think you could slather on solar power block every day and wait for it to be absorbed

636
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,020
by your skin before you could do anything.

637
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,920
That gives me an idea for on X Day, July 5th, 1998, which is this Tuesday.

638
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,040
This time for sure.

639
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,320
I'm going to give myself a photosynthesis ability so I can feed off of sunlight.

640
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,820
Like algae.

641
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,180
I feel like every year goes by and you grab another monument and another ability and it's

642
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,620
really nice.

643
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:48,780
It's a lot of fun.

644
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,780


645
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:48,780


646
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,440
And I can't believe it's not a lot left for the rest of us.

647
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,640
Then get on the stick, man.

648
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,420
Make your list.

649
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,100
I'm left with one of the tortoises and a fire ring.

650
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,220
Well, you know, you should have started earlier.

651
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm a fate judge.

652
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,200
You got to get your dibs in.

653
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,500
The problem is, of course, I bragged about all the things I'm going to grab like the

654
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,840
Grand Canyon and so forth.

655
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:15,280
And of course the other subgeniuses are going to try to beat me to it.

656
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,200
Or there'll be battles.

657
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,380
battles, gunfights in outer space over the earth, over who gets the Rijksmuseum from

658
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,820
Amsterdam. And of course, they'll all get destroyed as the subgeniuses fight over them.

659
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,080
I think I'm going to go for more obscure things. The Creationist Museum in Kentucky,

660
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,280
I'm going to have that just for laughs. They're almost done with that Ark thing. I'm going

661
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,420
to take all the regular animals out and fill it all up with lizards. I think I'll be content

662
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,460
with that. Maybe the Roadside America thing over there in Pennsylvania. I like that.

663
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,580
What's that? What have they got over there?

664
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,700
It's a guy who spent like 60 years making this model railroad train in this

665
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:01,720
Oh, I've, yes, yes. And it plays the Star Spangled Banner and they turn the switch

666
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,680
and the stars come out and the toodles and jugs around.

667
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,880
It doesn't sound very impressive through my description, but if you see this,

668
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,240
it's such a labor of love and there's such intricate detail in it.

669
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,380
Yeah.

670
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,400
If you're interested, go to the website.

671
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,400


672
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,080
If you like miniatures, it's really something to see.

673
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,400
Oh, I love electric trains and Puzzling Evidence and I often go to the giant electric train

674
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,460
expo just for fun. Well, for more than fun. There are a few other reasons.

675
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:25,720
Research.

676
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:31,540
One reason is that they have everything there. And I mean everything in miniature, including

677
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:38,440
the little obscene miniatures of tiny people defecating in outhouses or people having sex

678
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,400
or nude women sunbathing or whatever. And Puzzling Evidence buys them.

679
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,160
And Puzzling Evidence buys the tiny people in outhouses and gives them to Philo, who loves them and cultivates them.

680
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,400
And usually the model train expo is right next to the gun expo. And you couldn't believe the difference.

681
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,840
It's more extreme than night and day. One of them is all about trains and fun.

682
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:10,900
And the other one is the bitter guy in a wheelchair who tries to sell you a rusty bayonet and sign you up for the tea party.

683
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,280
I just thought of another.

684
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,020
I have dibs on the Salton Sea. Well, actually just Bombay Beach and Salton City. You can have the lake.

685
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,040
I got Ball's Pyramid Island.

686
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,900
Knott's Berry Farm used to have a collection of miniatures in this whole little warehouse.

687
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,280
I don't know if they have it anymore, but I'm going to take dibs on that too.

688
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,620
It was like a city block full of dollhouses and Bibles written on the head of a pen and all that stuff.

689
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,780
You could fit the whole thing in your pocket.

690
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,220
There must be lots of tiny people who all these tiny Bibles.

691
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:53,400
In San Francisco, don't fail to visit the Musee Mechanique where there are all sorts of miniature things.

692
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,960
You put a coin in and they spring to life.

693
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,220
Oh, that's what Pam does to me.

694
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,600
Miniature combines the International Harvester and the Grim Reaper.

695
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,100
Oh, yes, friends. So many things.

696
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,940
Make your list of what the good things that Earth has.

697
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,960
There's a lot to offer. There are a lot of good things.

698
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,900
Most of them are not made by people, but there are some made by people that are pretty good.

699
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,360
And if you don't start making your list now, as Ivan Stanks told you,

700
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,040
it's going to be your own fault when you're stuck with a brown paper bag and an Albertsons from Santa Monica.

701
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,160
Yes, there are all the gems and jewels hidden in the depths of the sea.

702
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,020
The treasures of ancient Atlantis.

703
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,740
Pudding, strawberries, sunrises.

704
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:50,020
And, at one time, I thought it would be best just to go to the Grand Canyon right before July 5th.

705
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,080
And that way, when Stank picked it up, I would be in it, stowed away on the ship.

706
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
But it seemed a complicated plan.

707
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,540
Down at the bottom by Brighty of the Grand Canyon and all of those other critters.

708
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,240
After that, I'd be the ghost in the machine.

709
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,760
Things would go wrong and he'd be like, what's going on?

710
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,600
I'd run off to the engine room and hide.

711
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,380
More new ones have arrived.

712
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,260
Yes, as we sit here.

713
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,360
Saturday at X Day, the big day.

714
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,280
The big top has opened.

715
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,520
That is Racine Miller.

716
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,420
Lord, how they roll in.

717
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,300
That's Mother Miller.

718
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
I got a phone call from her, a message from her.

719
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,840
One of my favorite subgeniuses.

720
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,160
And in addition to the swag available today,

721
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,340
there will be swag newly refreshed available tomorrow.

722
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,880
Due to the number of people here,

723
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,820
we had to have helicopters bring in a fresh bottle of swag.

724
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,100
I'm sorry, bucket.

725
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,680
It is like a large flat package.

726
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,620
I got stuck on the piece.

727
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,840
Well, I'm ready for bed again.

728
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,480
I have yet to go to sleep.

729
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,440
You're kidding.

730
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,560
No, I am not.

731
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,540
I'm definitely not.

732
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,400
Whoa.

733
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:04,840
The excitement of being at X Day has filled me with such energy and joy.

734
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,960
It's percolated through your veins.

735
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,860
Some leaked out, but I had a towel and was able to mop up.

736
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,800
So save that towel.

737
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,700
You'll need it later.

738
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,580
I've been sleeping, but not quite enough.

739
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,380
And my short term memory is just zapped.

740
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,020
What?

741
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,780
Yeah.

742
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,380
So whatever.

743
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,440
What I've said, whatever that was.

744
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,520
So I'm not going to trust you with any of the important stuff because you're going to lose it just like I would.

745
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,940
Well, you know, I'm hoping at some point in time,

746
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,840
I will just fall into a deep sleep.

747
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:41,840


748
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,340
You can get 10 or 15 minutes, but you can never trust it.

749
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,000
Well, it's going to be a late night tonight, but we probably won't be doing too much of the show stuff today.

750
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,760
In fact, we should probably knock it off pretty soon.

751
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,380
Is there an Ask Dr. Howell today?

752
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,320
There has to be an Ask Dr. Howell.

753
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,420
We packed everything into Saturday.

754
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,220
I said Saturday or Sunday, didn't I?

755
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,260
Sunday.

756
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,780
Sunday.

757
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,020
Sunday should be enough.

758
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,680
Today is Saturday.

759
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:07,540
Right.

760
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,400
Yeah.

761
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,840
I don't know if you saw this while I was sleeping.

762
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:19,320
There's a wonderful cartoon in the Vision Quest, but it describes your own condition.

763
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,160
Oh, no, I hadn't seen that.

764
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,480
This guy's really good.

765
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:34,720
These free comic books, by the way, are thanks to Reverend Onan Canovike, who sent us a giant stack of these comic newspapers.

766
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,380
From the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

767
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,680
How do I sleep at night?

768
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,320
I don't.

769
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,280
My brain races at night while I'm lying there.

770
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,860
Well, like this morning.

771
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,360
With the flop and the pills on the bedside table.

772
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,060
Yeah.

773
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,520
And the little iPod or something.

774
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:07,740
I woke up at 8 in the morning to void my water, and then instead of going back to sleep, I kept reminding myself over and over again for the next three hours,

775
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,900
bring your swimming trunks and remember to bring that costume.

776
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,260
Because today is Saturday.

777
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,900
We've got to do those things.

778
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:28,340
And I just laid there reminding myself to bring those things over and over and over again until I finally just went, well, let's jump up and have a circus at X Day.

779
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,900
Run down the hill.

780
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,380
Turn on the swag machine.

781
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,320
I was somewhat concerned as I was surveying the grounds this morning.

782
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,560
I went down to Old Sequa's Pond.

783
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,900
Did it seem tranquil?

784
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,880
It seemed beautifully tranquil.

785
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,100
It seemed tranquil from the distance I could see it from, but it was all locked up tight.

786
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,500
Chains and dogs.

787
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,200
Oh, no.

788
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,380
They haven't opened it up.

789
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,300
Three-headed monster dog might have been in the woods.

790
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,660
I don't know.

791
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,440
I didn't see him, actually.

792
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,360
Better find out if they have opened it.

793
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,020
Remember, each X Day we've had to try to force them to open the pond.

794
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,680
Well, how is it closed?

795
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,200
They chain it up.

796
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,060
There is a small gate with a padlocked lock.

797
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,740
But can't we go over it or around it?

798
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,700
You definitely could if some was to violate the law.

799
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,860
I climb over it.

800
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,000
But it should be open.

801
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,340
We should have them open it.

802
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,420
It should be free.

803
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,920
Well, keep talking and I'll message Kenny.

804
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:28,680
Yes, they may have forgotten that our ancient customs require us to use the pond for this purpose.

805
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,080
Little known fact.

806
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,260
Each X Day, one person goes missing to Old Sequa.

807
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,040
Well, that person is hardly to be counted or considered

808
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,680
since that person, by nature, was perforce doctrinally impure and not a true subgenius.

809
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:52,600
Just an extra flab or chicken fat that could be cut from the corpus of the church.

810
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,580
It's a natural purging that needed to take place for the better body.

811
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,580
It takes place because it must.

812
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,140
Wise words.

813
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,880
Slack can make the difference.

814
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,320
And that's why he's a doctor.

815
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,640
Well, I've now texted ahead about burning the Bob effigy and opening the pond.

816
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,040
But I'm used to crawling over barbed wire fences.

817
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,740
Well, we're going to have to do that.

818
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:26,140
But then we're going to have to get a whole bunch of uneasy subs to do it also.

819
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,980
I have no doubt of my ability to do it.

820
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,060
Nobody's going to shoot us.

821
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,900
Rob and Renee and I climbed over it last year.

822
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,300
Right.

823
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,440
That's what I was thinking.

824
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,480
But that shouldn't be an additional barrier.

825
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:49,160
In our way, it's just not pleasant when we don't attempt to get rid of those minor impediments.

826
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,600
Because there are major ones.

827
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,460
I've got some bolt cutters.

828
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,620
We'll just force our way in there.

829
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:02,280
Wouldn't your wisteria friends look askance at the damage to their physical plant?

830
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,780
A few large subgeniuses could probably just push that.

831
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,760
Well, they could roll over it.

832
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,940
The reality is the gate could easily be circumnavigated by just walking off the trail for five feet.

833
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,400
We're lawbreakers, man.

834
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,460
We could do some brush popping.

835
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,960
We're scofflaws.

836
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,700
We sneer and laugh at society's regulations and rules.

837
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,120
The traffic signals are just mere suggestions.

838
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:24,660
We snap our fingers.

839
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,060
Here.

840
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,220
Here.

841
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,160
Here.

842
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,640
Oh, yes.

843
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,260
Music to break into restricted areas by.

844
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,260
Nina Rocha.

845
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,060
Look at that.

846
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:47,760
The wisteria staff, ever on the alert to keep subgeniuses out of danger, has locked the pond.

847
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,620
I guess they don't want to get sued if old Sequa kills somebody.

848
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,540
Or mangles and takes a foot.

849
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,900
Something like that.

850
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:04,840
So we're crawling over a busted part of the fence in order to get to the sacred pond.

851
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:05,820
Uh-oh.

852
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,960
Let's see what kind of things are living in here now.

853
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:09,760
I asked for it.

854
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,080
Oh, you're fucking dead.

855
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,560
The sign says bottom drops off.

856
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,820
I had that problem myself.

857
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,200
No lifeguard on duty.

858
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,880
Let us all be our own lifeguard.

859
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,880
There was a dead body last time we came down here.

860
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,520
Well, it wasn't a body.

861
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,460
It was an empty set of clothing with blood all over.

862
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,920
And that little teddy bear all torn up.

863
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,140
A fortunate monster episode that we had.

864
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,720
We reveal ourselves here.

865
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,320
Oh, Lord, I threw it ourselves.

866
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,380
I took off your mask.

867
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,400
Oh, that's right.

868
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,900
I reveal myself unto my God.

869
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,200
Unto my God.

870
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,040
God.

871
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,880
Let the blessed signs of the radiation be seen.

872
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,980
Woo!

873
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,360
Come on, Brett.

874
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,060
You wanted to do this.

875
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,880
Huh?

876
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:00,360
Pop.

877
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,480
Oh!

878
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,220
Woo!

879
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,580
Who is next?

880
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,340
Anybody else up for sprinkling the dunking?

881
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,420
Reverend Lucy Van Pelt, aptly named in this particular case because of the pelt.

882
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,400
It's artificial pelt that it's adding.

883
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,320
Well, it'll come off.

884
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,100
You're covered with sins, Reverend Lucy Van Pelt.

885
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,220
I can see them.

886
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,640
They're not even invisible.

887
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,380
They're just sticking right out.

888
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,640
Let's wash them off.

889
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,220
Praise God.

890
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,520
Woo!

891
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,960
And here she comes, rising up.

892
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,700
Right up out there.

893
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,220
Out of the water.

894
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,980
Newly washed underbob.

895
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,140
You'd hardly believe it from the condition you get in after a...

896
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:42,600
Hi.

897
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,060
Reverend Catfeather.

898
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,220
Ah, the lovely Catfeather is here.

899
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:46,400
Screw-all-all.

900
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,220
She's done this before.

901
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,220
She knows the drill.

902
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,240
She knows the drill, but still, we must drill it into her head that the conspiracy must never...

903
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,380
Don't let the conspiracy fool you into thinking it has more slack.

904
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:05,360
Only you have the true slack, and you will find it at the bottom of that pond where there's bubbles.

905
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:05,740
I'm ready.

906
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,900
Show me.

907
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:07,340
Ready.

908
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,000
Down you go.

909
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,680
Ah, there you go.

910
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,060
Reverend Eggplant.

911
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,800
Our faithful Reverend Eggplant.

912
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:19,360
Reverend Eggplant has been so tainted by having to work for the conspiracy, especially the

913
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:25,600
medical conspiracy, that he has to get his sins washed away every year with extra little

914
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,680
doses in between.

915
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,620
Reverend Eggplant, I hope it takes this time.

916
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,120
Do you reject the conspiracy?

917
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,120
And all its worth.

918
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,560
And all its worth.

919
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,360
I'm going to get a little fiber in my body.

920
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:35,780
Yeah!

921
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,240
That's a lot of fibers.

922
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,280
Down you go, Reverend Eggplant.

923
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:39,920
Woo!

924
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:39,940


925
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,240
Ah!

926
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,760
Hooray!

927
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,320
We can symbolically wash all the frog watchers.

928
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,480
Sure, I'll flick some water on them.

929
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,740
I'm about to get out.

930
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,480
You just go like this.

931
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:51,880
Stang.

932
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,980
Look at all this conspiracy.

933
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,880
You can see it.

934
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,320
It's all been washed off, and it's all like...

935
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,160
It's all over me.

936
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,020
It's all cloudy.

937
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,500
It's like pond scum.

938
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,020
Yeah.

939
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,080
That's exactly what it is.

940
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,540
It's scummier now that the sins have been washed away.

941
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:04,540


942
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,440
It's all washed off these filthy subgeniuses.

943
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,000
Stang!

944
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:07,660
No!

945
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,260
If you're going to baptize yourself, give me your shirt first.

946
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,120
No, no, no.

947
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,660
I'm not going to do that.

948
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,160
People from space just got here.

949
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,960
We just watched a car drive in, and people didn't know it was space.

950
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,700
People from space have just arrived.

951
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,240
It's happening.

952
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,160
It's for real this time.

953
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,280
As foretold.

954
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:27,940
These are outliers.

955
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,340
It's in the literature.

956
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
There are outliers.

957
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,660
There are premature arrivers.

958
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,520
Ladies and gentlemen, the scout ships have arrived.

959
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,520


960
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,520


961
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,520


962
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:42,240
Yes, they are harassing motorists in southern states, and they are also here.

963
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,260
Well, these aren't the exes.

964
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:48,460
This would be some other kind of lesser aliens who just want in on a good deal.

965
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:48,700
Trying to hit your eye.

966
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,720
Trying to hit your eye.

967
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,160
They're going, oh, the rupture's happening on Earth.

968
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,780
We better get there quick.

969
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,120
We'll blend in with the natives.

970
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,340
If we can make the gate by seven, we'll get there two hours early.

971
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,440
We'll disguise ourselves as humans.

972
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,280
They won't notice these spacesuits.

973
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,360
They're subgeniuses.

974
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,200
See, I never bought that, that the aliens would disguise themselves as humans.

975
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:11,460
They'll think it's a funny costume.

976
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,020
I find my human body very uncomfortable from time to time, and I can't imagine somebody

977
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,720
choosing to do that to themselves.

978
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,520
I think you need to keep your never form.

979
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,180
It depends on how much zeal you have.

980
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:25,160
Oh, excellent.

981
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,180
The zeal moment.

982
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:33,420
Yes, if you're willing to go the extra distance, you might say you have our zeal of a person.

983
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


984
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


985
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


986
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


987
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


988
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,420


989
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,680
Accept our effort.

990
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:33,680


991
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,040
Linus sent out a charms on songs in his world.

992
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,200
Our story is never being shy, but be patient and grace frequently for sales.

993
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,600
It is go easy on us.

00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,120


996
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,120


997
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:51,280
Their lies will become authors, copywriters, and잊-liberators.

998
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:51,860
And whatever works works with liberty.

999
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,600
This is my response.

1000
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:53,600

recording oh i see i see instead of having the album cover for an hour you know you got all this

1013
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:47,440
these things it's not hard to do if it is hard to get around to that's the there's lots of things

1014
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:54,920
that are easy to do but getting to them getting started that's that's the tricky part yeah usually

1015
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,040
once you get started then get into it

1016
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,120

1020
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,900
puzzling evidence suggesting is how to make money as an artist you make the art you insure

somebody else makes the art you come to their house uh tell the postal authorities that it

00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,740
that grow in a chain.

1041
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,340
I think.

1042
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,760
Am I strange?

1043
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,480
You can't tell the difference?

1044
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,960
Okay, microbiologists.

1045
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,440
So they're alive, yeah.

1046
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,620
That's my theory.

1047
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:41,620
Honestly, I don't think they would grab a hold of us though so wholeheartedly if they

1048
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,020
were a little bit sick.

1049
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,180
I just think it's an oil that cleans your hairs.

1050
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,860
You can't question what Scrum really is.

1051
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:48,460
No, no, look.

1052
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,820
You don't read the label on the box.

1053
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,220
Right.

1054
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,820
Because you just take it and you enjoy it.

1055
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,220
Right.

1056
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,360
You know.

1057
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,200
Don't think about it too much.

1058
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:56,040
Ignore the preservatives.

1059
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,920
The MSC, all that extra Scrum.

1060
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,820
The red number what?

1061
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:02,800
Scrum.

1062
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,180
You know, a few years ago what was called Crump, it used to be called Crunt.

1063
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,300
There was a time Scrum was called Crunt.

1064
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,040
Long time ago.

1065
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,780
Well, you know, maybe we can go back to classic Crunt.

1066
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,600
It was used the same way.

1067
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,340
You're so old school, Reverend.

1068
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,120
Maybe we can go back to classic Crunt for those that missed the flavor.

1069
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,020
It didn't really taste very good.

1070
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:26,020


1071
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,120
It was very much an acquired taste.

1072
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,020
Well, you know, but you get hooked on it and then it's just delightful.

1073
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,540
Right.

1074
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,740
Once you get used to it, the first few bites are hard.

1075
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,120
You know.

1076
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,960
The first trip is always a fun one.

1077
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,480
People don't do Crunt because it tastes good.

1078
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,380
I'm pretty sure.

1079
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,920
Yeah, I don't think it has much to do with the taste.

1080
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,140
Yeah.

1081
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:48,140
Plus, I mean, I want Ellie Sheedy on a Scrum commercial near an after school special.

1082
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,040
That would be great.

1083
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,080
That was his first time though.

1084
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,720
Where is she now?

1085
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,760
Where is she?

1086
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,020
She's not on a Scrum commercial doing her thing.

1087
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,020


1088
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,020


1089
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,020


1090
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,020


1091
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,140
She's doing her job.

1092
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,560
I'll tell you that right now.

1093
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,140
Where are my glasses?

1094
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,320
Come on, Ellie Sheedy.

1095
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,580
Where are my glasses?

1096
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,020
Get with him.

1097
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,660
I think that's them.

1098
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,320
You can swim in this?

1099
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:06,840
It's nice.

1100
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,220
It's nice swimming in all of this.

1101
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,020
It's not that bad.

1102
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,740
I mean, it's foul.

1103
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,200
You can swim in anything if you have enough of it.

1104
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,440
I mean, it's foul.

1105
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,920
My dog.

1106
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,460
Oh, yeah.

1107
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,640
Old Sequa tried to get me.

1108
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,760
I don't know where that came from.

1109
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:18,940
Oh, shit.

1110
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,100
Oh, goodness.

1111
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:19,900
Look at that.

1112
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,300
It looks like one of my Loppin's scars.

1113
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,100
Wait.

1114
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,600
Which one is it?

1115
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:22,860
Old Sequa.

1116
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,620
That was Old Sequa Claw.

1117
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:25,980
That was Old Sequa Claw.

1118
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,740
That means I was, that was a warning to me.

1119
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,640
That is my soda, but I didn't.

1120
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,240
I can do that.
