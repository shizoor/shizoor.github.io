1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Thank you for joining us tonight. Now, I just heard in the report that

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,360
The subgenius power of swatting!

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,420
That is correct.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,920
To engage in this attack?

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,020
That's correct.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,700
Jeez.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,920
Why, what, why, what, why?

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,120
It's the anointing that will break the yoke of Satan's bondage.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,420
And I want you to know that I had just been experiencing an attack on all sides.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,560
It seemed like on every front where we tried to advance,

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,040
the devil would just unleash literally hordes of demonic forces to stop us.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,200
And after a few weeks of this, I just began to feel a deep hurting in my belly,

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
way deep down in my spirit.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,720
And some people say, Brother Popov, what, you mean you experience pain too?

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,880
Yes, I do. I hurt just like you do.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,140
I feel the pain of a satanic attack.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,220
Just like you do.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,680
And that's why I'm concerned about you.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,220
That's why I feel for you.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,060
I feel in the spirit your pain and your suffering and the sickness that Satan throws at you

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,760
to try to overcome you.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,960
But bless God, Satan is a defeated foe.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,780
But while I felt this pain, it seemed almost as if a spontaneous thing happened.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,340
As I finally, I, no longer, but I really didn't even know how to pray

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,420
because I didn't know exactly what the devil, what was coming at me.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,400
Satan was bombarded.

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,780
He was firing me from so many sides.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,300
Actually, I felt kind of numb.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,540
Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,820
Hello, Bob.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,880
This is Jesus.

32
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,760
Give me Elvis.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,320
All mine.

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,740
Hello, Jesus.

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,620
This is Bob.

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,840
I'll connect you all in time.

37
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,840
Hello, Bob.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,980
This is Elvis.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,900
Tell that Jesus

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,320
to stop.

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,980
Stop his crying.

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,800
Hold on, boys.

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,720
Now, this is Bob.

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,660
I think you'll hear each other fine.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,440
Okay.

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,900
Now, hello, Jesus.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,840
This is Elvis.

48
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,020
I wish to talk to you so long.

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,980
Hello, Elvis.

50
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,040
This is Jesus.

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,240
It's great to hear you.

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,020
It's a song.

53
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,800
Oh, listen, boys.

54
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,980
I won't fool you.

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,280
Yeah.

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,760
The meter's running

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,620
on this call.

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,060
Wait now, Bob.

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,240
You shouldn't charge me

60
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,060
because I am

61
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
more than all.

62
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,200
Hey, now, Jesus.

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,240
Since I'm Elvis,

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,360
I'll put this call

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,220
on my bill.

66
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,060
Sorry, Elvis.

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,140
Your card's expired,

68
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,060
which makes me

69
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,280
feel quite ill.

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
Oh,

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,580
Bob.

72
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,640
You tell me

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,620
what you hope

74
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,200
for your time.

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
Sorry, Jesus.

76
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,280
I guess no one.

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,140
So I'll disco

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,100
next to the line.

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,360
Hey, man, it's best

80
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,360


81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,360

13 spirit

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,980
people

125
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,660
Build a fire and dare stand near it

126
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,480
In the distance, thunder hear it

127
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,360
While we're waiting on a 13th spirit

128
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,940
This is the tale of the boy with the bucket

129
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,660
Bringing fuel to the fire

130
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,500
I hear the fox preaching to the chickens

131
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,060
A lion, lion to the choir

132
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,020
We're waiting on a 13th spirit

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,860
We're in a fog, I wish the wind would clear it

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,920
I want to welcome you, return not fairy

135
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,600
But we're waiting on a 13th spirit

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
A 13th spirit

137
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,040
A 13th spirit

138
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,960
I am James, the long lost brother

139
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
Left flat footed on the temple floor

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,580
It's so easy to make the big promise

141
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,160
When you're not around to tell the poor

142
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,240
We're waiting on a 13th spirit

143
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,920
Build a fire and come stand near it

144
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,400
I want to hear the truth, I do revere it

145
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,800
While we're waiting on a 13th spirit

146
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,900
к Pour it on up to three

147
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,840
Let it fly hard like the sound of the baby

148
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:38,960
AC residus

149
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,640
Just sky in down

150
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,740
A city on did I

151
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,800
A city on did I

152
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,040
Just sky in down

153
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,000
A city on did I

154
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,080
América

155
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,120
A city on did I

156
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,220
Just sky in down

157
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,840
A city on did I

158
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,840
There's just too much to remember

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,680
I can't keep my story straight

160
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll be going down to Egypt

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,640
Or lover in the desert

162
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,220
Waiting on the 13th spirit

163
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,700
Waiting on the 13th spirit

164
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,100
Waiting on the 13th spirit

165
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,480
Just waiting on the 13th spirit

166
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,120
Waiting on the 13th spirit

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,980
Everything you know is wrong

168
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,240
Every note of every song

169
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,520
Every truth you've ever known

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,860
Are lies

171
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
Everything you know is wrong

172
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,080


173
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,740
People know what they believe

174
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,400
But nothing's really up their sleeve

175
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,040
They try to hide their victims

176
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,900
They try

177
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,340
JFK and grassy nose

178
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,760
Dinosaurs and holes on holes

179
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,080
Desert storms and somebody's brain

180
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,200
Brains on drugs

181
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,420
Everything you know is wrong

182
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Smash a little egg with a frying pan

183
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Fry it up

184
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,840
Cook it up

185
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,860
Serve it on a sandwich

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,840
Thank you.

200
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,520
Thank you.

201
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,920
Yes, dear friends.

202
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,020
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

203
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,680
This episode of our Slack is going to be a lot like the last two because we're,

204
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,240
this month we've been using a lot of the same source material.

205
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,180
Let's see.

206
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,880
What we just heard was a really ancient recording, probably 1980.

207
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,080
That was Glass Madness, one of the many cassette tapes that he mailed to us.

208
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,660
And I guess I overdubbed.

209
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,640
Before that, the kind of Zappa sounding thing called Everything You Know Is Wrong.

210
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,820
That was Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos.

211
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:08,900
The guitar player was our old friend from the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

212
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,420
And the, yeah, that was from the 80s too.

213
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,660
I think that stuff was done originally on cassette.

214
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,460
I used to play Dr. Bizarro and the Disgustos on cassette back in the day.

215
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,400
And he's just, after 35 years or so, put it on CD.

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,900
And they sound really good.

217
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,120
There's probably more of that coming up in our second hour.

218
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,620
Because we're going to have a second hour tonight.

219
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,300
How about that?

220
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,660
At least here we will.

221
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,160
Maybe not where you are.

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,940
Oh, The 13th Spirit was the Rainmakers from the album Monster Movie.

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,660
It's a great movie.

224
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


225
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


226
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


227
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


228
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


229
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


230
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


231
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


232
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,660


233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,900
Kind of a spooky song.

234
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,380
Calling Bob, Elvis, and Jesus.

235
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,980
That was our good old buddy, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

236
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,860
One of many songs he did, Bob's songs.

237
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,540
I've been unearthing stuff from the original Bob's Songs 3 album.

238
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,420
That was assembled in 1981, I think.

239
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,840
And Lee Murr did our titles.

240
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
And friends, now I'm going to play another one off Bob's Songs 3.

241
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,660
Midnight Rainbows.

242
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,120
Rambler by D.K. Jones.

243
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,980
You midnight ramblers.

244
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,680
When I say midnight ramblers, I don't mean just black knights.

245
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,260
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

246
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,720
I'm midnight ramblers.

247
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,240
I am.

248
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,060
All midnight ramblers' faces are not black.

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,220
So what's our harm?

250
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,100
It's as black as midnight.

251
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,060
I'm talking to you.

252
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,480
Hold up, men.

253
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,760
And women.

254
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,380
You bank robbers.

255
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,660
You bank robbers.

256
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,620
You say so.

257
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,420
Uh-huh.

258
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,440
Sure.

259
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,860
Yeah.

260
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,180
And you bank robbers.

261
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,540
Right.

262
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,700
And kidnap.

263
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,340
Yeah.

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,840
You old bloody men.

265
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,480
All right.

266
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm talking to you.

267
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,260
Yeah.

268
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,800
And we got some people in the church.

269
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,620
Yes, sir.

270
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,400
Stay down just as late as a midnight rambler.

271
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,700
All right.

272
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,820
I don't know what time Brother D.C. got in last night.

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Yeah, Brother.

274
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,120
We about to have dinner tonight.

275
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,120


276
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,120


277
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,740
I'm gonna take everybody out of their head, if you don't mind.

278
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,660
Mm-Hmm.

279
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah.

280
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,200
We're gonna raise them up here tonight

281
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,380
for at restaurants in all l penetrations.

282
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,820
Mm-Hmm.

283
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,100
Okay, it's a little secret, we can hear back fortune.

284
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,200
rebirth of this little pig.

285
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,920
Yeah.

286
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,960
Yeah.

287
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,860
Hey, I wanna...

288
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,660
Mm-hmm.

289
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,240
It's a little blue screen

290
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,800
A little guy who sure gets tough, you know

291
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,520
When it's dark, shit ain't green

292
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,940
I was watching Dick Mad Dog Girl

293
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,800
Sorry, sorry, I forgot to call

294
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,340
When I'm watching the TV, yeah, you know

295
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,900
I don't care at all

296
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,380
I'm watching the TV

297
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,340
And it makes a fool out of me

298
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,760
Watching the TV

299
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,660
And I don't have to worry about me

300
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,120
When I'm watching the TV

301
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,100
Turning on as soon as I get home, you know

302
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,900
I grab myself a beer

303
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,400
The signal's always right on now, you know

304
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,860
I put your picture up in clear

305
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,540
I was watching Dick Mad Dog Girl

306
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,360
Sorry, sorry, I forgot to call

307
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,880
When I'm watching the TV, yeah, you know

308
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,520
I don't care at all

309
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,920
I'm watching the TV

310
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,880
And it makes a fool out of me

311
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,280
Watching the TV

312
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,040
Yeah

313
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,220
And I don't have to worry about me

314
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,780
When I'm watching the TV

315
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,020
Yeah

316
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,440
It's a little blue screen

317
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,320
A little guy who sure gets tough, you know

318
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,280
I'm watching the TV

319
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,340
And it makes a fool out of me

320
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
Watching the TV

321
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,680
And I don't have to worry about me

322
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,100
When I'm watching the TV

323
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:46,920
Yeah

324
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,100
And I don't have to worry about me

325
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,060
Watching the TV

326
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,980
Gonna get on a cable, on a cable

327
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,900
Ten channels up, get it over left

328
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,140
A dollar a day in a house

329
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,480
Well, look at the gentleman, please suggest

330
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,620
Hello, Larry, I'm watching chips here

331
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,200
It's all in our family, yeah

332
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,940
Sorry, honey, I can't call out, you know

333
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,340
I gotta watch the Dick movie

334
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,020
It's on the TV

335
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,980
And it makes a fool out of me

336
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,380
Watching the TV

337
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,780
Yeah

338
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah

339
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,100
It's a little blue screen

340
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,100


341
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,100


342
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,740
And I don't have to worry about me when I'm watching the TV

343
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,300
And it makes a fool out of me watching the TV

344
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,600
And I don't have to worry about me when I'm watching the TV

345
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,200
Watching the TV

346
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,800
Watching the TV

347
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
Watching the TV

348
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,340
Watching the TV

349
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,740
What am I gonna do when the X is gone?

350
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,120
I don't mind if all my things are melted at the same time

351
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,020
As long as I get to witness it

352
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,460
Yeah

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,720
Well I'll just be getting on

354
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,480
I'll just be getting on

355
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,080
Gotta finish another project

356
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,040
I got so much to do

357
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,800
And I'm hardly getting paid enough

358
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm busy

359
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,340
To get by

360
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,100
How come I'm not making lots of money?

361
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,840
Not money for money

362
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
But money for time

363
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,060
To get some art projects done

364
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,020
Maybe make up some more songs

365
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,040
Cause right now

366
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,280
I'm making up this song

367
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm losing money

368
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,260
Cause I should be working on an art project

369
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,760
If I can still and make some

370
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,700
Real kind of rent-paying coins

371
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,340
Or food-buying dollars

372
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
And I need some food to buy them all

373
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


374
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


375
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


376
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


377
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


378
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


379
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


380
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


381
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


382
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:09,340


383
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:24,220
Food buying dollars, just a few food buying dollars. I need to buy a few more art tools. I need to buy some more materials. I need some time to do some sketches. I gotta work out some concepts that might make me a famous guy someday.

384
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:42,340
Well, if I really worked out, maybe I could be able to pay my bills and be a pretty happy guy. Still go on vacation once in a while.

385
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:54,140
Get the supplies I need to do my art projects, to get things done that I visualize. I think about so much that I think would be neat.

386
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:15,920
I want to do some art projects that take so much money. They take so much time. It takes time to buy money. And I ain't got neither. I ain't got neither. I ain't got neither.

387
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,240
But I got both.

388
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,920
I got Bob.

389
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
I got Bob.

390
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,220
I got Bob.

391
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,100
I got Bob.

392
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,940
This crazy man, he makes a lot of promises to me.

393
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,660
I got Bob.

394
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,040
I got Bob.

395
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,020
This guy with a pipe in his face and little half-tone dots all over his face.

396
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,760
He got...

397
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:14,300
He got them Bob Dobbs looking, Bob Dobbs face, and Bob Dobbs hair, and Bob Dobbs eyes, and Bob Dobbs nose, Bob Dobbs lips, Bob Dobbs chin, Bob Dobbs cheek.

403
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,220
Plenty of meat, plenty of cake, man saved some for me.

404
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,380
Plenty of folks needing a break, man saved one for me.

405
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,200
There was a time that I believed this was a good country.

406
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,740
For taking a risk, making a mark.

407
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,200
For taking a risk, making a mark.

408
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
Taking a shot at a dream.

409
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
But I think that those days are over.

410
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,160
Opportunities are few.

411
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,820
Rich get richer, poor get poorer.

412
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,220
New world order's coming true.

413
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,620
Plenty of cheeses, plenty of guns, man saved some.

414
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh no, this is what we need, saving from, man saved me.

415
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,640
Shaking the nuts out of the trees, strange foot indeed.

416
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,180
Stirring the fear, doubting the guns.

417
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,960
Turning your gun on me.

418
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,360
You don't serve no God of forgiveness.

419
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,820
You don't serve no loving God.

420
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,900
If we could get him in a courtroom, we would sue his ass for fraud.

421
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Apocalypse a bit heavy handed.

422
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,760
Eternity a long, long time.

423
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,740
If there's a hell, I think they'll demand an encore from you.

424
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,700
One more time!

425
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,260
Plenty of attempts, plenty of tries, plenty of chance to choose.

426
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,140
Plenty of truths.

427
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,620
Trumping the lines.

428
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,200
I'll save one for you.

429
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,460
The frown of the boss, the back of the line.

430
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,120
All things must reverse.

431
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,240
Take it to court.

432
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,140
Telling the judge, I'll see you in the hearse.

433
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,840
Universe is arcing to justice.

434
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,120
It's a long and blinding curve.

435
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,160
Suddenly it's there in front of us.

436
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,020
Who's your master?

437
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,160
Who do you serve?

438
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,780
There's plenty of love, spread it around.

439
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,300
You saved some for me.

440
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,600
There's plenty of love.

441
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,820
Man saved some for me.

442
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,040
Plenty of love.

443
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,880
Oh, saved some for me.

444
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,720
There's plenty of love.

445
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,940
The Rainmakers.

446
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,280
Save some for me.

447
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
Also from that album Monster Movie.

448
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,860
Before that, a little bit of Glass Madness.

449
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:05,320
Watching the TV was the Pink Boys, probably recorded in 1979 or 80.

450
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:13,760
The Pink Boys singer and songwriter was Dr. X, the late Dr. X, my old high school best buddy.

451
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:21,140
He and Dr. Philo Drummond and I were the original three wise guys that, uh,

452
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,960
initially got Bob's project going there.

453
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,460
And of course the midnight rambler at the beginning of that mess was D.K. Jones.

454
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:39,000
Uh, as it says here though in our last, uh, well, the third testament, the Bobliographon,

455
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,240
One handy thing about God is that you can blame everything on him, even Bob.

456
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,680
No matter how badly you screw up, you can always say,

457
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,660
God isn't finished with me yet.

458
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:58,900
Well, sir ma'am, J.R. Bob Dobbs hasn't even started in on you yet.

459
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,500
As the great Ninslow said, any idiot can fail.

460
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:14,200
The idiot who can stub his toe or step on that nail or wreck his car and not start thinking the world is conspiring against him

461
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
is the idiot who succeeds.

462
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,660
Every time I see some moron on TV telling me how his ranch is going to be,

463
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,260
I say, I'm going to take him and his car into a concrete bridge abutment.

464
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,340
But he didn't die because the Lord was looking out after him.

465
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,060
I say, you idiot, it was the Lord that drove you into the abutment in the first place.

466
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:41,960
The only safety is in killing that vicious deity and every other deity that comes along to ruin your life.

467
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,200
Says Ninslow.

468
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,660
And what I say is, the problem is that religionists are always trying to tell God how to run his business.

469
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,300
How to run his life along with their own and yours.

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,500
Ever had one of those people threaten to pray for you?

471
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:04,120
They're so busy blabbering at God, as if he hadn't heard it all ten billion times before,

472
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,820
that even if he were inclined to respond, he wouldn't be able to get the word in edgewise.

473
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,040
The popular mainstream God is so weak and pathetic

474
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,480
that illiterate human po-buckers the world over

475
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,380
feel compelled to do his dirty work for him.

476
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,320
Evidently, he can't do much himself.

477
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,840
Were we to concern ourselves with an omnipotent universe maker,

478
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,060
we'd probably give it credit for being able to take care of itself.

479
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:42,580
But few of the faithful think nearly so highly of old everything man.

480
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,840
Again, as Ninslow said,

481
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,660
my life at worst is better than God's life at the peak of it.

482
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm not sure I'd be so happy if I didn't have to go through all this worship that we all give to him,

483
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,160
that's supposed to do him so much good.

484
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,680
Did you ever wonder what it is that he gets out of that?

485
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,140
How does God benefit from people worshipping him?

486
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,300
What happens if we don't?

487
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,780
Does he get sickly?

488
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,500
Is he like Tinkerbell when she doesn't get enough claps?

489
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,040
She actually does die and the play ends right there?

490
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,780
I don't know, maybe if everybody stopped worshipping God, maybe he'd just die.

491
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:27,560
And that was Orton Ninslow in a talk tape to the Subgenius Foundation in the year of 1992.

492
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,640
Princess We is here.

493
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,520
I was reading from our out of print book, The Bobliographon.

494
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
That's always good for something.

495
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,760
We're going to try to get this right.

496
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,760


497
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,760


498
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,100
We're going to try to get it back into print.

499
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,400
I could put it out there illegally, because it was produced as a PDF.

500
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,380
But technically it's actually still owned by an out of business publisher.

501
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,160
And we still don't have Neighbor World, the novel by Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

502
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,000
completely online and ready to sell yet, because two shows ago,

503
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,760
if you recall, you called me,

504
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,040
the five-dress

505
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,900
case would even be able to be in that shop later.

506
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,360
No, his answers are only easily twenty- assume it's not an out of special collection.

507
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,120
It is an out of piles.

508
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,740
kaduria will give you a copy,

509
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,920
but I can understand him a little.

510
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,900
Maybe what you can do now,

511
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:47,760
or maybe you haven't melted as much as he's put out there,

512
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,640
it. But I think we'll go back to the music for right now. In this case, that will be

513
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,140
Exposed Foreheads, a song called Right Sized.

514
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,140
Right Sized

515
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,400
Right Sized

516
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Right Sized

517
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,020

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:54,960

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:54,960

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,020

Right Sized

548

Right Sized

553
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,440
full implications.

554
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,720
And the understanding that once you...

555
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,360
Dave is neither

556
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,100
a joker nor an ace,

557
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,340
but a deuce. So his super

558
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,440
power, well, his power

559
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,540
is he can make himself

560
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,700
smell like any kind of cookie.

561
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,940
Oh.

562
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,100
Unusual,

563
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,780
not very...

564
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,380
Especially useful power.

565
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,280
It means paleophysicists

566
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,980
will culminate

567
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,200
in monstrously biting you in the

568
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,900
forehead and eating you like a cookie.

569
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,100
Well, a lot of us subgeniuses have

570
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,220
a super power,

571
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,240
but it's not really that

572
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,160
super. Like, mine

573
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,080
is I can type faster than

574
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,380
anybody else with only one finger.

575
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,900
And...

576
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,040
Or two fingers if I'm cheating.

577
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,020
My daughter could

578
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,040
receive

579
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,640
and send faxes

580
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,600
with her voice.

581
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,100
Yeah, with her voice. She could send them with her voice.

582
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,540
She couldn't, obviously,

583
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,000
she couldn't print out a fax, but she could

584
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,560
listen to it real closely and say,

585
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,600
it's an advertisement for

586
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,780
cruise ships

587
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,820
for your employees.

588
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,840
You know, you could ignore that.

589
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
And then she'd

590
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,980
get back on him and insult him. She'd be going

591
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,400
like that.

592
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,900
They'd get this crudely

593
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,120
spelled out,

594
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:30,980
assault.

595
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,760
She couldn't or she didn't. She just didn't

596
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,980
want to because she was so angry.

597
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,060
She could and she did.

598
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,680
I'd be careful. She might be listening

599
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,620
right now, although it's very unlikely.

600
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,940
She's always

601
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,700
said that the hour of slack instantly

602
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,760
gives her a headache.

603
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,880
Ever since she was a little kid.

604
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,640
I understand, yeah.

605
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
She first was on this show

606
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,760
at the age of three or

607
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,160
four.

608
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,600
Yeah, the frozen

609
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,960
smile syndrome. What do you think

610
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,860
of the old man show?

611
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,940
What do you think of what the old, and then

612
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,160
you get the frozen smile.

613
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,980
What the hell does it

614
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,000
mean? It doesn't give me that bad of a

615
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,760
headache, Dad. You hate it.

616
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,860
I can listen

617
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,120
for five minutes. No, I didn't

618
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,560
expect my kids to

619
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,040
understand or be

620
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,060
interested in my job any more

621
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,000
than I was in my dad's job.

622
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,640
He was a lawyer.

623
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
What a brilliant officer.

624
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,720
I didn't know what the hell

625
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,460
a lawyer did.

626
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,760
He never explained it to

627
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,640
us. All I knew is that there was

628
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
some kind of monster that he fought

629
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,660
called Teamsters, and

630
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,720
they often won.

631
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,740
Well, that's

632
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,700
kind of silly, really,

633
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,340
because why

634
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,580
would an individual lawyer fight

635
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,320
Teamsters? Because he was

636
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,620
the representation for the

637
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,060
trucking companies and

638
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,260
bottling companies all over this

639
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,960
great nation.

640
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,120
That's just like

641
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,320
what's the name of that

642
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,020
man from the 1970s,

643
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,820
Gell Parts and the Bravehearts and the

644
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,960
Stewhearts? They're all

645
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,780
in it together, especially the

646
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,940
company of devils, of sly

647
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,780
foxes and other outwooded

648
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,000
personnel that live not

649
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,120
even close by. Are you talking about

650
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
lawyers again? Yeah,

651
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,480
of course. You know, squareheads, golfers,

652
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,660
you know what they call them.

653
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,320
I suppose your pappy never played golf,

654
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,560
or did it play him?

655
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,160
More like it played him.

656
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,120
He had, I vaguely remember,

657
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
a set of golf clubs, but he

658
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,220
was

659
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,020
not really

660
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,060
that kind of a sports

661
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,980
fellow.

662
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,080
Yeah, and he used to like to dress like a woman

663
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,760
sometimes, once in a while, right?

664
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,280
In a very small community. That's not funny.

665
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,500
He liked to

666
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,880
dress like a cowboy, too.

667
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,280
Did you see that picture? He must have

668
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
seen that picture. What picture?

669
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,580
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

670
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,980
The picture we don't want to see ever again.

671
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:11,800
Actually,

672
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,960
remember he was in some little

673
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,140
play in the

674
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,720
Lions Club, and he played

675
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,260
a large

676
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,420
woman.

677
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,020
He wore high heels and stockings

678
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,500
and a dress and a wig.

679
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah, we saw that picture.

680
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,560
It was not PC

681
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,280
either.

682
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,440
No.

683
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,840
But who is?

684
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,680
Who is PC?

685
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,180
I mean, everybody

686
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,660
has somebody else's idea of not

687
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,000
PC.

688
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,860
For instance, it's not PC for me

689
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,900
to say, oh, you mean fake news

690
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,820
like the Bible? For some reason,

691
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,640
that's not PC enough

692
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,040
for some people. Go figure.

693
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,500
You played Lenny

694
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,000
Bruce Wonderbrow

695
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,300
earlier.

696
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Earlier, didn't you?

697
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,700
No, I'm going to play that

698
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,720
in our second hour that no one

699
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,360
else can hear tonight.

700
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,760
You're warming up like your testicles are on

701
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,140
fire or something, you know?

702
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,560
Oh, thanks for telling me.

703
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,820
Oh, my God, Dave, you are such a good friend.

704
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,900
That is a good friend.

705
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,120
That was a quick call.

706
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,880
Man, I had to pat him out fast.

707
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,220
Thanks, Dave.

708
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,620
That was important.

709
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,160
Smoking, but not

710
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,500
for the right reason.

711
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,780
Well,

712
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:27,940
I'm not going to do that.

713
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,540
Well, you know, it's a token argument

714
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,040
for a token planet.

715
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,280
It's not a real substantial

716
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,580
place that anybody would want to spend longer

717
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,420
than three or four thousand aeons.

718
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,040
Where are you talking about?

719
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,740
A planet, this

720
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,280
begotten, this shot, and

721
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,420
you know, all this other stuff.

722
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,080
This planet?

723
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,400
This planet.

724
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,960
Would you and your like

725
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,880
and your ilk plan

726
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,700
on evacuating on certain days?

727
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,100
It never, ever happens.

728
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,280
I know how to make that happen.

729
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh, yeah.

730
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,300
Yeah, yeah, I do.

731
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:00,680


732
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,860
I've been reading a sci-fi novel that

733
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,580
they have a pretty plausible way of kind of destroying the Earth

734
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,220
and causing everyone to have to.

735
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,640
Well, anyone who can leave has to leave.

736
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,560
Of course, only about with the combined efforts of all nations,

737
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,620
they're only able to get about 2000 people living in outer space

738
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,020
when the Earth is destroyed.

739
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,260
And of those 2000 people,

740
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,880
a year later, there are only seven left

741
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,620
and they're all women.

742
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,160
Now, hasn't this already been turned into a movie?

743
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,060
No, it's a well, no.

744
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,400
Nobody should be.

745
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,220
There's something like it.

746
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,460
It's a novel called Seven Eves,

747
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,380
or one word, Seven Eves

748
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,680
by Neal Stephenson.

749
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,180
That bastard.

750
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm so jealous of him.

751
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,840
I'm going to cut his fingers off so he can't write with a goose quill pen anymore.

752
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:57,940
That's why we can't get a terrible game over.

753
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:57,940


754
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:57,940


755
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,660
He's too good.

756
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,200
I've read all of his novels three times each.

757
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
That's how much I hate him.

758
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,020
And most of his novels are over a thousand pages long.

759
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,540
Oh, my goodness.

760
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,940
Oh, that's amazing.

761
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:12,320
Yeah.

762
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,680
But anyway, here's the important thing.

763
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,660
What I was going to get to was here's how you destroy the Earth.

764
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,140
It's easy.

765
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,740
You just blow up the moon first.

766
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:21,860
Lesson one.

767
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:26,060
Now, we don't have anything that we can blow up the moon with yet.

768
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,260
But.

769
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,920
We're going to have to.

770
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,240
I heard you.

771
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,040
A projectile thrown fast enough.

772
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,200
Yeah, baseball.

773
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:39,700
A heavy enough thing thrown fast enough from somewhere hitting the moon just the right way

774
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:47,720
could cause it to explode into maybe a dozen pieces.

775
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,040
But the thing is, then those pieces start banging into each other.

776
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,940
And eventually they turn into space boulders and gravel.

777
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,100
That eventually starts finding its way to Earth.

778
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:07,420
And we get the most wonderful shooting stars and meteors in the sky for 25 years.

779
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,940
And they heat up the atmosphere so much that it boils everything on the surface, including

780
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,960
almost all the water off.

781
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,840
It's like Baron Von Munchausen when you see the moon is crying and something comes out

782
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,420
of its eye.

783
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,640
Well.

784
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,740
Like a big droplet of snow.

785
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,920
If you could hit it with a big enough rocket right in the eye, it would blow up.

786
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:26,920


787
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,760
And maybe you could break it into chunks that would then eventually they'd form a beautiful

788
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,980
ring around the planet like Saturn has.

789
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,200
But first, the refuse would burn off the atmosphere.

790
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,360
Yeah.

791
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,880
So, yeah.

792
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,720
The Earth's atmosphere.

793
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:46,100
Again, if you could get 2000 people into habitats in space, all attached to the International

794
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,640
Space Station somehow.

795
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,680
By within a year or two, just by sheer human nature.

796
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,160
There'd only be seven of them.

797
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,880
There'd be 16 of them left and then there'd be one more big fight and there'd be only

798
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,940
seven people left.

799
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,920
Do you understand, though, that you're basically talking Dr. Strangelove talk right there?

800
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,700
You want to evacuate the planet like only 2000 people, which is some prescribed number.

801
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,400
That's about how many people we're all evolved from.

802
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,200
Of the rock.

803
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,960
Oh, yeah.

804
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,840
So we're taking one variety of every genetic sampling or something.

805
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,880
Here's what's worse.

806
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,880
They lose their samplings.

807
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,060
They're sampling sample genetics.

808
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,140


809
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,400
It's all gone.

810
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,400


811
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,960
The genetics of all the rest of the world are destroyed.

812
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:37,200
And luckily, one of the surviving Eve's is a geneticist and is able to, by parthenogenesis,

813
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,720
is able to get all of the other Eve's pregnant.

814
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:50,180
But she's also able to doctor the genes a bit so that they the the new seven human races

815
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,600
can be tailored to be somewhat like their original Eve.

816
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,860
Oh, good, good.

817
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,080
You get these tough-

818
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,360
The mitochondrial mama.

819
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,780
You get these military type ones.

820
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:09,980
One of them is unfortunately descended from the president of the United States who snuck

821
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:17,800
into the space habitat, and she is as bad as Trump and Hitler all put together.

822
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,380
She's the reason why it gets whittled down from 2,007 people.

823
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:28,080
And so her descendants are all smooth-talking, tricky liars.

824
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,020
The descendants of the science person are more science-ly and so forth.

825
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,780
They even end up-

826
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,560
Well, they're all like a damned alcoholic, Stan.

827
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:44,780
Well, the crazy old Eve, or the youngest one actually, decides that she doesn't want

828
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,000
her genes tailored at all.

829
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:51,780
In fact, she wants her worst traits, like bipolar condition.

830
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,360
Yeah.

831
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,200
To be accentuated in her children.

832
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,900
So she was actually conditional to be a polar bear until her last excrement, whenever

833
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:05,600
Tuesday that was, that they were trying to impromptu the-

834
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Well, you end up with an interesting variation on the human race, rices, where it's no longer

835
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,820
rices divided by anything like skin color or looks, although they still look different

836
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,840
from each other, but in new ways.

837
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,240
The main thing is their personalities.

838
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,720
Each race has a completely different overall personality and culture.

839
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,000
And that's what we have to look forward to if we can just destroy the moon, Dave.

840
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,440
Well, I can hardly wait.

841
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,380
I think we need to start like- Jerry Lewis had a great telephone idea of, you know, let's

842
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,280
destroy the moon now and save all the handicapped-

843
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,340
He hasn't listened to the last 10 shows.

844
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,680
Who?

845
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,720
What do you think the beacon is all about?

846
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,280
Legumes, beacon products.

847
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:52,360


848
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,620
Oh, yeah.

849
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,720
And the

850
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,080
The moon was replaced by a gigantic spherical mothership.

851
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,120
It's just still not talking.

852
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,140
It looks about like a- Well, I see.

853
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,340
the man.

854
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,840
Let's hope that when it does start talking

855
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,040
it says the right thing.

856
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,760
He probably thinks

857
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,260
World War II actually happened.

858
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,820
He probably thinks there was a real

859
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,100
World War II, yeah. It was a hoax,

860
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,040
dude. It was a hoax

861
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,020
just so they could take your planet away.

862
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,080
It was just to make you paranoid

863
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,980
so they could switch planets with Mars.

864
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,780
I just, the other day

865
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,120
while I was masturbating softly to myself

866
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,680
and arguing with the policeman

867
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,800
and stuff like that, I started thinking

868
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,800
how many times I've been led down the

869
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,520
primrose path, and thinking,

870
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,580
thinking, thinking, and

871
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,840
thematically disagreeing with the same

872
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,660
old participle every single time.

873
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,940
It just comes back

874
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,980
to you like it's a thematic argument

875
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,000
about, you know, what we were

876
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,620
talking about before I started talking.

877
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,940
I think that's what's on everybody's

878
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,940
minds today. Yes, I think

879
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,760
so too. Yes, yes.

880
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,840
Rolling around in their heads like

881
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,820
old ball bearings in a coffee

882
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,540
can. Yeah,

883
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,260
that's annoying and rattling.

884
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,780
Metaphorically speaking, I've ever heard in a long

885
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,460
time, buddy.

886
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,660
Meatballs in a sidekick.

887
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,800
What is it again? Meatballs in a

888
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,400
sidekick?

889
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,740
Yeah, something like that. I've

890
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,380
already forgotten. A suitcase.

891
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,700
Meatballs in a suitcase, and that's

892
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,800
why I forgot all about it. Metallic meatballs

893
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,620
in a suitcase. Metallic

894
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,460
meatballs. These metallic meatballs.

895
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,140
Metallic meatballs.

896
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,780
Meatballs.

897
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,940
Well, at least we're not all a bunch of

898
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,320
gorillas living in the belt

899
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,360
of the savannah somewhere like, although

900
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,280
many of the people... What do you mean

901
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,060
we're not?

902
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,840
It's just a metal and

903
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,220
concrete savannah. We're

904
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,280
still the gorillas. Actually, we're

905
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,480
a lot worse than gorillas.

906
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,580
Gorillas are peaceful

907
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,500
vegetable chomping

908
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,480
hermits. Yeah.

909
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,560
We're more like chimpanzees shrieking

910
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,560
white Muppet arm

911
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,460
waving, shrieking, big

912
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,720
tooth, biting,

913
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,500
face eating.

914
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,120
Violence soaked.

915
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,880
Yeah, violence soaked

916
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,360
fiends. Yeah, then think about

917
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,480
Bonobos, so sexed up they can hardly

918
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,560
do anything all day except for going around

919
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,100
servicing each other's needs.

920
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,440
Well, you know, their rep is

921
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,560
a little bit exaggerated. They've been

922
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,280
known to bite a face off themselves.

923
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,240
They're not as inclined

924
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,240
to do it as a regular chimp.

925
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,560
But they'll still

926
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,000
they'll still...

927
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,620
Okay, look, if you're an animal and you

928
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,660
could pull a human's arms off,

929
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,560
why wouldn't you?

930
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,900
Yeah, that's...

931
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,860
You're right. Well, especially if the human

932
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,380
is annoying. Right.

933
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,580
Like keeping you in a prison.

934
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:09,780
Right.

935
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,740
Or trying to give you a zigzag stripe or

936
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,760
keep you from getting a massage if you're

937
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,140
in line, you know.

938
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,580
Hey, if those Planet of the Apes movies

939
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,460
ever come true, we're history.

940
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:20,980
We're history, baby.

941
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,640
Why?

942
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,540
Because they'll...

943
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,120
The monkey flu

944
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,500
will kill us if the chimpanzee

945
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,680
arrows and slingshots

946
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,020
don't. Right.

947
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,440
Is that what happened? I missed the premise of the movie

948
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,500
of the third, fourth, and fifth

949
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:38,780
one.

950
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,220
Well, you know, they remade

951
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,360
all five of them.

952
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,560
I gotta admit, the makeup is a lot

953
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,940
better.

954
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,780
A lot better.

955
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,540
Yeah. I saw one little clip,

956
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,460
I think, and I did

957
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,660
marvel at that, that they look so

958
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,200
advanced now.

959
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,840
Especially for, you know,

960
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,820
giving the dog a pair of pig ears

961
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,800
to wear and then making fun like it's a birthday

962
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,840
cake or something on somebody's hat,

963
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,720
you know. Well, you know how they do

964
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,840
those special effects is they have this helmet

965
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,720
that a very imaginative artist

966
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
wears, and he concentrates on

967
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,860
the scene

968
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,880
hard enough it'll come to

969
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,140
life on a

970
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,460
screen. It's like a mind

971
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,660
reading visualization

972
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,340
computer. It costs

973
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,100
a hundred million dollars

974
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,360
a second, though.

975
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,200
But that's how they do it. That's why those movies are so

976
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,700
expensive. Yeah.

977
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,400
That is a pretty, you know, it's a big deep pocket

978
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,500
book. You can only afford to have that done.

979
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,200
Yeah.

980
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,320
Think how many bad takes they have, too.

981
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,980
You know, the guy imagines

982
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,320
he gets a little distracted and suddenly

983
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,320
what's supposed to look like a scary

984
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,740
ugly monster has

985
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,580
lovely, great big breasts

986
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,700
jiggling around, you know, so it's

987
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,840
okay, take three.

988
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,760
Try to concentrate,

989
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,340
Fred.

990
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,380
And they've got you in the

991
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,180
M.I.R. box and they're saying

992
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,120
if you make one little move,

993
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,300
it will show and we'll have to kill you all

994
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:06,840
over again.

995
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,700
You don't want to get spasmodic

996
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,440
or disagreeable when anybody's

997
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,320
doing stuff like that because, oh,

998
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,420
it's my lunch hour right now, and I

999
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,380
want to go home crying in

1000
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,440
a cup, of course.

1001
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,940
Where's your cup, Dave?

1002
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,580
It's right in front of me,

1003
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,380
lad. I need it

1004
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,520
at all times now. Not like

1005
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,300
in the days past when I could conceal

1006
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,480
myself. How often do you

1007
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,020
have to empty the cup of tears

1008
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,680
you hold under your face?

1009
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,380
Oh, I would say the average human

1010
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,700
being despised

1011
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,440
as a despicable type

1012
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,460
of animal. No, no, no. I was going to ask

1013
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:44,900
you how

1014
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,400
long does it take for the

1015
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,060
cup of tears under your chin?

1016
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,980
to fill up?

1017
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,220
Usually two to four

1018
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,160
months. Oh, you're

1019
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,140
not crying at all, man. I thought you were going to say

1020
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,240
five or ten minutes.

1021
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,960
No, it's just if ever it's very quickly

1022
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,080
you can say. He has a great life.

1023
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,060
He only has to empty

1024
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,020
his tear. You only have

1025
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,700
to empty your cup of tears

1026
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,800
once every three or four months?

1027
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,780
Well, if you are very, very

1028
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,960
argumentative, that's a very long time

1029
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,500
to have many tears in there.

1030
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,500
That means it's

1031
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,480
decomposing well.

1032
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,460
It's not anything like the Spanish food

1033
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,320
I'm going to quit feeling sorry for Dave.

1034
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,180
My cup of tears

1035
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,100
fills up in about a day and a half.

1036
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,420
Well, I wouldn't

1037
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,220
go that far because I don't know

1038
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,380
what that means. Well, you may not

1039
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,580
stub your toe as often as I do,

1040
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,960
but every time I do, I cry.

1041
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,400
Not because it hurts that much, because I was

1042
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,260
stupid enough to stub my toe.

1043
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,340
And he's mad at himself

1044
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,900
for stubbing his toe.

1045
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,360
I'm so mad at myself.

1046
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,340
I'm going to hold my breath until I turn blue.

1047
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,380
That'll show me.

1048
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,560
Oh, man.

1049
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,240
I commiserate with you just like

1050
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,920
a small package woman.

1051
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,180
I can see it coming down the freeway

1052
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,500
right in the middle of the road.

1053
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,520
Paying no attention to anybody else

1054
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,280
who's driving except for

1055
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,620
Belinda or whatever her name is.

1056
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,760
Oh, man.

1057
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,060
Are you playing the Russian music

1058
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,640
or is it playing you?

1059
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,320
I'm not playing any Russian

1060
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,580
music. I'm playing

1061
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,240
music by

1062
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,680
Cyber Chump.

1063
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,060
The construction of things is the

1064
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,020
side we're listening to.

1065
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,980
It sounds all gentle and magical.

1066
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,240
Yeah, it's not distracting is the main

1067
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,140
point. I could put on, I could

1068
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,900
always put on something

1069
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,040
else. It's very

1070
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,700
futuristic without sounding

1071
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,040
complacently futuristic as if we had

1072
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,940
the same, you know, we all had

1073
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,940
the same appendices or

1074
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,060
variations. Dave,

1075
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,900
on this show,

1076
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,080
everybody hears a different

1077
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,120
piece of music.

1078
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,040
I mean, I put on this

1079
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,500
sort of all-purpose background

1080
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,100
tone and the individual

1081
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,480
listener may hear it as synthesizer

1082
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,100
music or banjo music

1083
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,280
or as tubas,

1084
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,120
you know, it depends on what you're oriented

1085
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,220
towards. Their own personal filter.

1086
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,100
Yeah, your own personal filter.

1087
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,280
That is a beautiful, thank you

1088
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,760
for letting us get out of that

1089
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,240
excretory valve. It just,

1090
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,060
it doesn't know how to play the sawbones or

1091
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,080
the trombone or anything like that

1092
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,000
anymore. Just because.

1093
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,060
And we stand by them because

1094
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,420
we could, we salute their services

1095
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,220
even if it's only

1096
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,000
like maybe four or five of them.

1097
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm not

1098
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,040
a sawbones, but I play one

1099
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,700
on TV and in a band.

1100
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,020
My dog is my sawbones.

1101
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,100
I think the dog and the docs

1102
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,740
are in league with each other because

1103
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,220
the doctors told me I had to walk two

1104
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,820
miles every day or I'd die.

1105
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,320
And I went, yeah, sure.

1106
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,640
I wasn't going to. But now

1107
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,820
the dog basically sits next to my

1108
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,700
desk and barks in my face

1109
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,520
and puts his nose under

1110
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,540
my elbow where

1111
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,000
it's near my keyboard

1112
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,900
to make me take him

1113
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,580
for two mile

1114
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,960
long walks every day.

1115
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,040
So it's like I just can't escape.

1116
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,340
I can't escape

1117
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,840
this planet. And by the

1118
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,020
way,

1119
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,700
as a result of this, I

1120
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,640
weighed myself the other day. I only weigh

1121
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,180
150 ounces now.

1122
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,280
Yes, he's just disappearing

1123
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,060
into thin air.

1124
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,080
He took his toenails off.

1125
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,900
I mean, he gave us his toenail

1126
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,840
clippings and put them in a little valve

1127
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,740
as they used to do in the

1128
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:37,860
ancient imperial days.

1129
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,120
He put them toenails

1130
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,740
in there and he weighed them up

1131
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,760
and it came to exactly

1132
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,140
150 OZs

1133
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,440
or grams.

1134
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,120
Whatever you said.

1135
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,900
No, his whole body weighed 150.

1136
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,020
No, no, no.

1137
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,020
That's his toenails again. His body had

1138
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,040
no witness weight because it was all full of

1139
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,680
sweat and beaver.

1140
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,240
I used to look like Raymond Burr

1141
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,040
as Ironsides, but now I

1142
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,880
look like Sheriff Rick

1143
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,480
Grimes on Walking Dead.

1144
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,980
Well, at least you didn't have

1145
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,840
the same sexual appetites as William

1146
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
Burr and Francisco Hernandez

1147
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,160
and Franco. He was a bad one.

1148
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,420
Did you ever read about him?

1149
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,800
Francisco Franco? No.

1150
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,480
The general who took over

1151
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,020
Spain? Yeah, no, no.

1152
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,040
I didn't, I don't, but that's not my favorite

1153
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,980
kind of pornography.

1154
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,320
Old

1155
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,760
fascist porn? No.

1156
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,580
I'm not into old fascist porn.

1157
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,220
Oh, man, you can't.

1158
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,780
I'll leave that to the Trump

1159
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,920
voters. I'll leave all

1160
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,920
the old fascist, wrinkly

1161
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,740
old fat fascist man porn

1162
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,040
to the Trumpies, Trumpanzas

1163
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,080
as they call it.

1164
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,200
Everything old is new.

1165
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,460
You can't blame them.

1166
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,280
No kidding. The dumb people won.

1167
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,380
I'll be that blunt.

1168
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,460
Yes, I will, because the show's

1169
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,260
almost over. I have to get off the air.

1170
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,060
The dumb people won.

1171
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,480
Well, but just for a minute.

1172
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,720
But like a puppet

1173
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,560
or maybe a clavichord

1174
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,960
or one of those ancient...

1175
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,860
Pay attention, Dave.

1176
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,640
Pay attention, Dave.

1177
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,300
First, we're going to...

1178
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,060
This is a part that...

1179
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,160
Only you're going to hear.

1180
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,720
I feel...

1181
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,680
It's a...

1182
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,320
There, that part's done.

1183
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,920
And now we do the end of the show.

1184
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,120
Friends, you've been listening to Hour of Slack

1185
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,220
number 1,639.

1186
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,960
Goodness gracious.

1187
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,520
In the middle of September of the year,

1188
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,180
the conspiracy likes to call

1189
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,220
2017...

1190
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:44,920
Meh.

1191
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,440
Meh.

1192
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,280
We know it's not that.

1193
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,400
We're not sure what it is.

1194
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,360
We'll find out this May 7th.

1195
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,660
Or July 5th.

1196
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,640
Or July 5th.

1197
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,440
And Dave, I suggest

1198
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,380
that you call in

1199
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,360
on the next show

1200
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,640
in about 15 or 20 minutes.

1201
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,440
Okay.

1202
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,340
Okay.

1203
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,920
Call in on the next show in about 15...

1204
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,840
Because this show's over.

1205
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,340
That's it, man.

1206
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,920
That's it.

1207
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:15,940
That's it.

1208
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,500
That's it.

1209
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:16,760
That's it.

1210
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:16,920
That's it.

1211
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,080
That's it.

1212
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,380
That's it.

1213
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,380


1214
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:17,380


1215
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,620
That's it.

1216
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,620


1217
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,620


1218
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,620


1219
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,620


1220
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,720
That's it.

1221
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:21,700
That's it.

1222
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,900
Here, dear.

1223
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,380
Take your medicine.

1224
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:27,780
Come on.

1225
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,360
Let me have some more pills

1226
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,200
before you go.

1227
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:32,920
There you are.

1228
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,240
Now take care of yourself.

1229
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,800
Yeah, take care of yourself.
