1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
A one, two, three, fire!

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,320
Leave it to the subgenius.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,720
Power of sweat.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,260
Whoa, isn't that something?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,220
What do you mean?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,640
If anyone gets any answers, it'll be the psychiatrist.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,400
Oh, that's terrible.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes, yes, and no.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,260
Huh? Are you trying to give me the double talk?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,320
Yes, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,660
The subgenius agenda.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,580
Through the leadership of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,760
his vision of a 22nd century America

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,220
where subgeniosity is the subgenius lifestyle,

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,240
Dobbs has repeatedly addressed subgeniuses,

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,280
saying, I have a vision and you are part of it.

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,280
Topic.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,720
Welcome.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,220
Come on.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,800
Mind research.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,780
Research.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,240
That's why.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,920
You call fooling around with superstitions

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,100
and voodoo rights research?

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,580
Yeah.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,980
Well, it's...

27
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,660
It's a cult.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,300
We have to do this.

29
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,780
The work I'm doing is very important.

30
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,360
Look, they're over the bridge now.

31
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,480
They're on the other side of the...

32
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:05,880
It's okay.

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,740
Oh, darn.

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Well, that wouldn't be avoided.

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,940
It's just wiggled around.

36
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,280
That'll work.

38
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,580
That'll work.

39
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,620
We'll just use that scene then.

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,300
You just need to alarm them.

41
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,380
Tie him down securely.

42
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,220
Doctor!

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,280
Here, see?

44
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,700
Your friend.

45
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,260
Quickly.

46
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,660
Oh, oh.

47
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,260
I guess even the doctor begins to lose faith

48
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,940
when he's caught up with him.

49
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,900
I think he's leaning on his computer.

50
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean, his keyboard.

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,520
All right.

52
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,340
Forever?

53
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:30,840


54
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,540
I'd like to try it.

55
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
That's a heck of a long time.

56
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:33,940
You know, Doc,

57
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,840
I made an amazing scientific discovery

58
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,040
in this laboratory of yours.

59
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,420
Looks like he's coming around.

60
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,940
Okay, all right.

61
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,340
It's Ivan Stang.

62
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,400
We're resuscitating Ivan Stang now.

63
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,080
It's my dad.

64
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,580
I'm stabbing...

65
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,620
I just stabbed a scalpel into his heart.

66
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,340
That's just a stupid superstition.

67
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,180
No, no, no.

68
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:52,880
You're a real guy.

69
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,240
Come on.

70
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:53,740
Yes, you are right.

71
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,300
Come on, come on, come on, Ivan.

72
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,060
You can do it.

73
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,360
Come on, come on, come on.

74
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
There's a queen of you.

75
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh, she's outside trying to get in the studio.

76
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,160
Come on, Ivan.

77
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,740
Come on.

78
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,660
We're attaching the...

79
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:04,980
Okay.

80
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,560
There we go.

81
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,000
You know,

82
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,440
it's not nearly enough for you to believe in Bob.

83
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
You must suck his entrails with your psychic firmament.

84
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,980
You must live in Bob's own depleted spaces.

85
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,480
It is only musky-roomly.

86
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,040
Oh.

87
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,540
God, it's musky in his humily.

88
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,040
His little humily door where he keeps his humily worms.

89
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,320
His little humworms and men pets.

90
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,220
Oh, look at that.

91
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,800
Men things.

92
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,940
I wouldn't want that on my leg.

93
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm excited.

94
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,380
Horrible.

95
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,920
Not in the middle of some...

96
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
Ugly men things.

97
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Soon enough, you'll be searching for dobs on the scaly roof of your mouth.

98
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,940
Soon enough.

99
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,420
There.

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,460
You hear me?

101
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,900
Oh, none.

102
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,380
The male will change from a greasy green to a bright, beneficent blue.

103
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,800
Blue.

104
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,740
We're worried about the subconscious messages that they're sending.

105
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,060
Me too.

106
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,700
Yeah, we worry.

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,620
You mean the subliminal radio signals that are in everything?

108
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,820
Even your back teeth fillings?

109
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,080
Are they?

110
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,800
Those are the ones you should really worry about.

111
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,580
The ones they broadcast right into your teeth.

112
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,740
Because you can hear those at night when you're asleep.

113
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,000
And your ears, you know, you got your ear canal right there next to your back teeth.

114
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,760
It's sort of whispering up that ear canal all the time and you don't even know it.

115
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
So how do you know that there are subliminal messages happening?

116
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,160
Well, the government, the new government channels, and I switch channels and then I just get stuff.

117
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,380
You get stuff on the channels?

118
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
They're editing this out right now.

119
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,180
Yeah, there's some kind of editing going on.

120
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,840
I think you need to turn up your phone or something.

121
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,340
But it's funny because a lot of people are different.

122
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,820
I think that...

123
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,860
Now, do you have that antenna hooked up right now?

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
Well, yeah, I have.

125
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,480
I have the...

126
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,220
I got some stereo wires and I drug them all across my floor.

127
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,260
Back and forth?

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:06,780
Yeah.

129
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
I hope with this show turned up very loudly.

130
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:18,080
So did it generate a static charge negative ion field on the surface of the floor about three inches above the floor?

131
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,300
That you were only able to detect with the use of your vacuum cleaner?

132
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,540
Yeah.

133
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
You know, maybe not like...

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,140
You're confusing.

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, I think you should be confused to a certain extent because your receptivity will increase that way and therefore make the antenna more powerful.

136
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,180
Yeah.

137
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm unacceptable.

138
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,960
This was confirmed this morning in conversations I had with leaders of Russia and Japan.

139
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,440
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called PR News a threat to the entire world.

140
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,600
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.

141
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,400
PR's reports remain on a downward...

142
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,600
On Wall Street 881118, this is PR News.

143
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
PR's reports remain on a downward spiral with a drop of PR News in Washington.

144
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,020
Reminds me of a...

145
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,180
Really?

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,920
Flying along here with us now.

147
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,200
Early in the morning.

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,100
On a happy...

149
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,140
Happy.

150
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:13,980
It's a cloud.

151
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Sort of.

152
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,780
A new political wind.

153
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,840
I'm all there.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,060
I'm all for it.

155
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,120
Yeah, we're all over it.

156
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,580
I'm up.

157
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,840
Lockstep.

158
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm right with you.

159
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,440
Yeah.

160
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,300
The Homeland Security people will.

161
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,440
We buy in the morning.

162
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,320
And they'll check out your house and your life and...

163
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,660
Can you...

164
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
Do not want to check out my house.

165
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,520
FM radio waves to me?

166
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,000
They have to check out everything.

167
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,620
Yeah, we use all radio waves.

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,580
But can you explain how they work?

169
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,560
How radio waves work?

170
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,040
Yes.

171
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,020
We have the overman here tonight.

172
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,140
Tough question.

173
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,800
Yeah.

174
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,260
Philo Drummond.

175
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,520
Philo Drummond.

176
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,440
Philo Drummond.

177
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,580
Philo Drummond.

178
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:56,700
Philo Drummond.

179
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,120
After being in the...

180
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,760
You can hear the conference in the background.

181
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,160
What do you think?

182
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
You know, is that...

183
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,280
We'll explain that.

184
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,920
How does radio work?

185
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,940
Dr. Drummond, we have a young lady who wanted to know about how radio waves work.

186
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,340
So do you have, like...

187
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,020
Or do we have...

188
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,940
You've got headphones on?

189
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,860
Yeah, you can know.

190
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Radio waves.

191
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
I do have headphones on.

192
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,040
Radio waves.

193
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay.

194
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, radio waves.

195
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:15,980
Well, they...

196
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,660
Because they're like...

197
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,160
I am the show.

198
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
They're these little things.

199
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,640
They sort of float out there.

200
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,400
They've got, like, little tentacles on them that kind of hang in space but have their own

201
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,180
modified...

202
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,960
cilia that are constantly flowing in the breeze and as the breeze passes by the cilia sort of

203
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:42,460
undulate and drive the organism the sound wave on its journey to your ears does that help

204
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,440
and this music always plays when radio waves are you know even if you're listening to a discussion

205
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,160
show about atomic waste this music would be playing in the background you just can't hear it

206
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,280
but music like this is always controlling your emotional reaction that's true music like this

207
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,960
is hanging around along with the radio waves or music like this radio waves have an affinity for

208
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,820
music like this they just kind of hang together in a symbiotic relationship there were a few

209
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:21,060
producers who were involved with the kind of underworld but then if you do it you if you accept

210
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,040
the money from them you must be ready for the country

211
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,140
you must be ready for the country you must be ready for the country you must be ready for the country

212
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,580
Well, you accept it for what it is.

213
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,200
It could be money, it could be guns, or it could be butter,

214
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,220
depending on your state and the state that you're in.

215
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,620
You know, I want to get back to some of the magic about Pangea and Lemuria and Guandana.

216
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, yeah, back in the old days, when we were just hanging out.

217
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,600
The old ways, because I've seen video from that time.

218
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,320
Yeah, we were like just a pack of amoebas, you know, like running wild.

219
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,900
Hanging around, it's like, let's extend our protoplasm over into that area for a while.

220
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,200
You know, the next thing we know, they were just like, I had a twin there, looked just like me.

221
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,360
And, you know, what's going on here?

222
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,460
So we started hanging around together for a while.

223
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,180
Next thing we knew, we were like a symbiotic organism of individual cells

224
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,820
that was all together with their own collective purpose,

225
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,920
slathering and slithering until one day we had a flitch out.

226
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,760
And we were like, we're going to have a flitch out.

227
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,600
And we stuck that flitch out.

228
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,020
We started manipulating our environment.

229
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,820
We decided, you know, maybe we should think about crawling out into that other atmosphere.

230
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,220
You know, we should leave this sweaty, liquid environment and move beyond it and move over

231
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,480
into that dry area.

232
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,180
Of course, we need some legs.

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,560
We need to modify our head.

234
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
No, it does look like a ghost town.

235
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,780
So we did, and there we are.

236
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,780
And so that's how it happened.

237
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,140
Okay, any more questions?

238
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


239
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


240
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


241
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


242
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


243
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,140


244
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm going to help you with any other questions.

245
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,300
Ladies and gentlemen, station KOQW would like to present now a serious documentary program,

246
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,860
an investigation of serious topics of our time as they relate to the industry.

247
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,800
Would you get that up, please?

248
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,020
Thank you very much.

249
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
I got it.

250
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,260
Shh.

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,680
Now everybody is public service.

252
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Let me get in here.

253
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,700
Let me get in here.

254
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,760
Do I sit right here?

255
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,620
Yes, sit.

256
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:21,880
Okay.

257
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,220
Now the microphones will be coming on in just a moment.

258
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay.

259
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,740
Am I supposed to read this?

260
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,840
I don't need a rubber gun.

261
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,220
Your cue is coming up.

262
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:30,760
Shubbing up, please.

263
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,200
Watch the music.

264
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,640
Quiet, please.

265
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,340
Here it goes.

266
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,520
Just a moment now.

267
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,740
All right, fade music and, uh, lights on.

268
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
Love that tune.

269
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,560
Shh.

270
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,200
When we speak of G-men, all of us gets a picture immediately of a band of little-known,

271
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:50,240
courageous men risking their lives to defend the Tri-City area from the soft underbelly

272
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,860
of criminal spy saboteurs.

273
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:51,860


274
00:09:51,880 --> 00:10:17,840
Well- statues, eh?

275
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,640
Well,

276
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:21,860
let that do it for today.

277
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,780
Sorry.

278
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:30,860
Federal Bureau of Droids to investigate us about little known facts concerning his work.

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
Yes, Mr. Announcer.

280
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,640
Everyone is hearing about espionage agents and saboteurs so much now, it's hard to think.

281
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,640
There's more.

282
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:51,100
It's hard to think that just a few years ago, no one even knew that saboteurs had agents.

283
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,620
Yes.

284
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,620
To start off with, Mr. Blank, shouldn't I have your name here?

285
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,480
Blunk.

286
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,160
Blunk.

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:10,200
What are some of the violations handled by the Squad, which are not as well known as the White Trash Traffic Act and the National Migratory Sponge Theft Act?

288
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:18,460
Well, for example, you, Mr. Announcer, are presently, right now, in violation of the concealed radio statute.

289
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,120
No.

290
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,100
Yes.

291
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,080
But...

292
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:31,200
By not broadcasting the call letters of this radio station every ten minutes, you could be jeopardizing the security of this area and my family and friends within its perimeters.

293
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, gosh, Mr. Blank.

294
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,840
This is exciting and serious as if it were real.

295
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,860
Oh, yes, yes.

296
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,020
Of course, this is real.

297
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,740
And you'll be convicted and sent to radio prison after the show is over.

298
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,400
No doubt, Mr. Blank.

299
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,380
Many of...

300
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,860
Oh, no doubt, Mr. Blank.

301
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,240
I think many of our listeners, who have traveled around extensively...

302
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,460
And other small towns in Arizona...

303
00:11:52,460 --> 00:12:04,540
Will remember that Radio Prism is located in this particular section of extremely rugged and unusual beauty because of the pointed desert nearby and the many very colored canyons.

304
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,720
Yes, that's where the colored people are kept.

305
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:19,900
Mr. Blank, although we think of women as the Gentile sex, I recall that in the past you G-string G-men have been dealt from the bottom of the deck of sex with some who were not...

306
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,240
Not Gent-Gentle in any sense of the term.

307
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,160
That makes sense to me, Mr. Announcer.

308
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:36,580
Yes, a special agent was once assigned the task of taking 15% of a mannish, big-boned woman of 150 pounds who was charged with shooting a frog.

309
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,800
Bang, bang!

310
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,860
That must have been terrible, Mr. Blank.

311
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,140
Yes, Mr. Announcer.

312
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,140
You know, taking a picture of a Frenchman can have some pretty serious consequences nowadays.

313
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,480
I get the connection.

314
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,220
You bet.

315
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,880
Mr. Blank.

316
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:49,880


317
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:49,880


318
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:49,880


319
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,240
Mr. Blank.

320
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,720
No, no, I don't.

321
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,240
It's against the law, too.

322
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,720
Accompanied only by three dozen officers, he started down the path to the shack.

323
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,360
But this path was by no means easy.

324
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,500
No, it was guarded by two mean gridley bears.

325
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,660
Gridley bears who lunged, lunged horribly right toward them.

326
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,400
The party walked around them.

327
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,040
Then walked around them again.

328
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,720
Was she finally taken into custody?

329
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,460
Well, yes.

330
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,960
The officers entered the one-room shack.

331
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,180
Even then, it took two days to reach the other side.

332
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,400
Yes, the one-room shack was also a zeppelin holder.

333
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,180
Or hanger, so-called, because you could either hang the zeppelin up when you weren't using it, or you could hold on to it.

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,400
No.

335
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,620
Now, the special agent, he talked to the woman, stroking her gently,

336
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,020
describing the pleasure of a 75-mile ride.

337
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,220
A ride in a fast car.

338
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,660
Well, she went willingly, and later confidentially advised her agent

339
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,380
that she liked the jail very much since she was steam-heated and had to be around a lot of water.

340
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,820
You must be thinking of Comley Lucy Baumler,

341
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,160
the 39-inch secretary to Kurt Klaus Pfeffer, the Nazi spy.

342
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,940
I don't think I'll ever be able to stop thinking about her.

343
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,980
Well, Mr. Blank, Blank, I want to thank you for being here.

344
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,140
Yes, good morning.

345
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,900
You have given us...

346
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,800
All a new slant on the topic of Oriental girls in crime.

347
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,980
And it has been most interesting.

348
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,000
With you G-men on the job, we must sure feel that Nazi communes will surely be unsuccessful in their attempts,

349
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,360
however vague, to injure our area.

350
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,480
What's happening?

351
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,860
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

352
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,660
We'll be back once again next week with the Pet Me Eye Story,

353
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,900
brought to you for public service time every week at this hour.

354
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,420
We'll take it again.

355
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
We'll take it again.

356
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,460
No, we'll take it again.

357
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,140
It's all right.

358
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,980
We can take it again.

359
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,020
We can take it again.

360
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Why don't we go to Top 40 now?

361
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,060
The gun scares the children.

362
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,140
Top 40.

363
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,080
Top 40.

364
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,040
Top 40.

365
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,840
Top 40.

366
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,320
A reverend staying here in the alleged year of 2021.

367
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,020
That was the Firesign Theater,

368
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,840
a recording from when even I was a baby tweenager

369
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,920
from their ancient radio show off the new old album collection,

370
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,460
called Dope Humor of the Seventies.

371
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,060
Findable at FiresignTheater.com.

372
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,160
We're doing a thing tonight that's half puzzling evidence

373
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,220
and half rare Firesign Theater

374
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,220
and half ESO Swamp Radio with Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and me

375
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,540
and half Philodrummon following an alien around out in the desert planet somewhere.

376
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,320
The Murr did titles and news

377
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,240
and the background music here is by CyberChump.

378
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,540
And now,

379
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,480
in the future,

380
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,600
back to 2001 for the puzzling evidence show on KPFA Berkeley

381
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,360
with special regular guest stars Dr. Philodrummon,

382
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,260
Dr. Howell,

383
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,520
and hapless callers number 67 and 879.

384
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,640
So what if the South had won the Civil War?

385
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,880
What would have happened then?

386
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,260
Huh?

387
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:08,800
Huh?

388
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,440
What if the Spanish had won the Spanish-American War?

389
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
Well, if the South had won the Civil War,

390
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,520
we probably wouldn't have won the Civil War.

391
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:17,520


392
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:17,520


393
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,220
We probably wouldn't have won the Civil War.

394
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,580
What if the Germans had won World War VI?

395
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Then we'd have to frat.

396
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,980
I think it's time to frat.

397
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,800
Okay.

398
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,320
I'm sure glad that happened.

399
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,340
Okay.

400
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,840
I want to be glad.

401
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,780
The thing is, the Civil War never ended.

402
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,600
It's still going on.

403
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,400
The South win.

404
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,740
It never started.

405
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,620
It started all right.

406
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,820
No, no, no.

407
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,480
It was the uncivil war that started.

408
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,080
There's nothing civil about that war.

409
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,660
Well, you got it.

410
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,180
That was a damnable war.

411
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Romantic.

412
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,760
Yeah, but what would James Joyce have said about it?

413
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,420
What would Aunt Bertha have said about it?

414
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,960
What would...

415
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,220
Yeah, what would Aunt Bertha have said?

416
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,220
Jesus did not always stay a baby,

417
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,920
although I think he must have been the most adorable baby you ever saw.

418
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,100
Aw, Aunt Bertha.

419
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,400
Still, he must have been a baby,

420
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,300
and he grew,

421
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,660
just as you boys and girls have grown.

422
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,260
Oh, boy.

423
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,800
Hey, let go of me.

424
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,840
Oh, let me.

425
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,340
Let go.

426
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,380
It's wonderful to know that Jesus

427
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,620
was once a child like me

428
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,300
and lived on earth and worked and played

429
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,440
in his home in Galilee.

430
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,180
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus,

431
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,500
wonderful, wonderful Jesus,

432
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,480
who was once a child like me.

433
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,120
Wonderful, wonderful Jesus,

434
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,440
like him I want to be.

435
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Before his parents could hardly believe it,

436
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,160
Jesus was 12 years old.

437
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,100
He was a fine lad.

438
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,600
And Luke tells us in chapter 2, verses 41 through 52,

439
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,320
a beautiful story about Jesus,

440
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,380
when he was 12 years old.

441
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,840
Yeah.

442
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,440
Was Jesus, or was Dean Moriarty Jesus?

443
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,260
God is in every sparrow plummeting to the ground.

444
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, well put.

445
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,060
Well put.

446
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,720
Or is that old?

447
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm sorry.

448
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,320
I didn't hear that one before.

449
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,720
Is that old or something?

450
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
It's a cross-reference with something.

451
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,220
It's James Joyce or somebody that's supposed to be.

452
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:38,380
His son, God Junior.

453
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,540
God Junior said that.

454
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,120
Oh, God Junior.

455
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
Oh, God Junior said that?

456
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,220
God sees every sparrow that falls.

457
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,300
Oh, see, Taz, I was just going to ask you about that.

458
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,180
You know, on the Easter theme.

459
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
I am kind of a nuts.

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
The thematic Easter theme.

461
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,500
Do you believe in the classical that God and Jesus is the same guy?

462
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:01,980
Or do you believe that God is, Jesus is God's kid, and therefore, but then see, it wouldn't.

463
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,240
I don't believe in any separation between God and any atom in the universe.

464
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh, yeah.

465
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,540
And so therefore, it's a moot point.

466
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Why are you asking me?

467
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,240
I might as well be a secular humanist, rationalist subgenius for all the difference it would make.

468
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm actually a totally mystical, cosmic-minded philosopher.

469
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,480
I think evil came in.

470
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,640
But it happens to take the form of atheism.

471
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,020
I think the evil started when they let him stink in the tomb too long.

472
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,180
Yeah, well, evil started.

473
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,340
No, I think evil started when, because we're, you know, the remnants of a burned out star.

474
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,540
Ruminants.

475
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,560
Ruminants.

476
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,940
When an older star blew up.

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,260
We're ruminants like the carpet part.

478
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,920
Yeah, an older star blew up, made our solar system.

479
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,200
The shadow.

480
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,600
We came out of that.

481
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,360
Maybe in that explosion, something went wrong.

482
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,220
I think evil came in.

483
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,680
Evil was in about the same time as time.

484
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,160
Any explosion, something goes wrong, doesn't it?

485
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,200
As soon as something started to happen, some things were good and some of the things were evil.

486
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:54,500
Right.

487
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,180
There's your yin and yang and your potatoes right in your thumb.

488
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,040
You know, when you said it was, is that where evil started with the, any explosion, something can go wrong.

489
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,940
So perhaps if it was like Jolly and like you guys were claiming that you could hit the wall with your sperm a couple hours ago.

490
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,560
Remember when you were bragging about that?

491
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:10,840
Yeah.

492
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
God probably thought he could shoot his seeds across the entire planet.

493
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,200


494
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,120
You know, it's a big place.

495
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,960
Well, that's called the Milky Way.

496
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,040
Well, the fact that it created this beautiful world that we live in is the good part.

497
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,980
And the fact that it created this hideous world that we live in is the evil part.

498
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,280
It's a shiny, beautiful Milky Way world.

499
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,760
Hello, friends.

500
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,160
Yes, I'm Bernard Flapdoodle, founder and president of the Funny Name Club of America.

501
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
That's right, the Funny Name Club.

502
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,800
You see, many Americans don't realize the plight of that crippled member of society,

503
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,180
the fella or gal with the name Flapdoodle.

504
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,920
And that's where we come in, in the Funny Name Club of America.

505
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,200
At our weekly meetings, held weekly in many friendly communities,

506
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,380
a member of this underprivileged, yet usually highly paid minority,

507
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,360
has a chance to mingle with others who share his infirmity

508
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,240
and to gain a sense of pride and brotherhood for the achievements of his kind.

509
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,040
Most Americans don't realize that it was our own Robert Louis Dildo

510
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,780
who invented the retrievable garage door.

511
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,760
That Mrs. Louise Yakamoto, the well-known war heroine,

512
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:27,080
purchased 45 gas bags which still float above selected American cities,

513
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,120
each proudly bearing a funny name.

514
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,700
And while most wouldn't know the well-known Donald Duck,

515
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,540
what of the pain to his family and friends?

516
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,720
Yes, we all owe quite a debt to these brave Americans

517
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,760
of humorous descent.

518
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,140
Will any of us soon forget Adolph Schicklgruber?

519
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,520
We can't afford not to.

520
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,500
Yes, soon is quick enough for us, so send your support to a chapter near you.

521
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,080
Don't forget about the little ones at Christmas either.

522
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes, here's our poster girl, little Tricky Schlemiel of Metro Glen, North Carolina,

523
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,140
to remind you that Americans with funny names are just people too.

524
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,920
Thank you.

525
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,180
I'm glad that we have warning messages on everything now.

526
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,740
Yeah.

527
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,500
There's product lia- there is no product liability anymore.

528
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,580
I mean, people can't be- it's a good thing we stamp it on everything now

529
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,420
because, you know, for a while there, lawyers were just getting rich

530
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:26,320
from people that, you know, they'd walk up, they'd hit themselves in the head with a hammer

531
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,940
because they didn't- couldn't aim it, and then they would sue the hammer company and win, you know?

532
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,980
And it's like, so now they put a- they put a label on a hammer that says,

533
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,860
do not hit yourself in the head with this.

534
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,260
And think you can get some money.

535
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,720
Yeah.

536
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,920
It all depends who wins the argument.

537
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,340
Oh, it definitely, certainly.

538
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,940
No, people that lose arguments generally don't win.

539
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,760
Generally.

540
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,620
And so, what happens?

541
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,160
If you find- if you find something offensive on a major label-

542
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,260
Unless, of course, the object was to lose.

543
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,560
Unless it doesn't have a label.

544
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,880
Yeah.

545
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,420
Maybe?

546
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,700
Yeah, if it doesn't have, like, a parental advisory label and you find something offensive on it, like,

547
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,240
and then you let a kid listen to it, can you then sue the major label?

548
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,960
A good lawyer can win the argument.

549
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,680
Probably could.

550
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,900
But, you know, it all depends how good the listener is.

551
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,240
I think if a kid listens to a record that's got the parental warning on it,

552
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,020
and then he still goes out and kills, they can sue the parents for not heeding the warning.

553
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I'd sue negatively.

554
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,060
Yeah, that's what I would do.

555
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,920
You can always sue the parents for not being good parents, no matter what.

556
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,740
They're sort of like the last resort.

557
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,340
I mean, even if you were suing a major company,

558
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,220
Last resort.

559
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,140
and they weren't getting what you wanted, you could always sue the president of the company's parents for raising him wrong.

560
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,820
And then you could shake them down for a few bucks, you know.

561
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,420
Where do rules come from, mother?

562
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,880
Where do we get them?

563
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,680
Rules are very, very old, Bobby.

564
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,100
They're like stories and poems.

565
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,920
Men learned them before they had learned to write.

566
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,000
But how did the first rules get made?

567
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,960
You remember, Bobby,

568
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,720
that we read from the Bible a big poem about how Grid planned the world?

569
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah, he planned land and water and light and darkness and grass and animals and power lines.

570
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,240
I remember.

571
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,800
God planned the world so that we could depend upon it.

572
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,460
God made the world so that the sun and the seeds and all the power lines would obey his rules.

573
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Did the sun and the seeds and the power lines really obey rules?

574
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,100
Yes, dear.

575
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,580
That's how farmers and scientists and policemen can know when to plant their crops

576
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
and when to expect them to blow up.

577
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,560
Did God make rules for people too, mother?

578
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,660
God did make rules for people, son,

579
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,720
but there's a great difference about the rules for people.

580
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,320
For instance, you blow pot.

581
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,500
Daddy and I get stinko.

582
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,560
The sun and the seeds do not choose.

583
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,020
They just obey their rules without knowing that they are obeying their rules.

584
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,800
And that's the way you should obey your rules, Bobby, or I'll belt you.

585
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,700
Can we do the stations of the cross now?

586
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,080
Okay, ready?

587
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,940
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hip.

588
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,780
Gotta get in line if you're gonna do them.

589
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,820
And remember, every time you genuflect, you wanna flip off a little prayer this way or that way.

590
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,580
Okay?

591
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,920
This way.

592
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,760
Let's pray this way.

593
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,900
Let's pray that way.

594
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,000
Get down on your knees and bend over.

595
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,520
Jesus has his face wiped by the women.

596
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,920
Jesus has his nose flexed by the man next door.

597
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,580
Is that what Jesus was doing under them when...

598
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,880
Jesus flares his nostrils.

599
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,020
Jesus cries out in pain,

600
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,920
Why don't you leave me alone?

601
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,080
Come on, Chaz, we only got seven more to go, or twelve, or whatever.

602
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm sorry.

603
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,060
Jesus pulls his hat down tight over his eyes.

604
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,900
Jesus forgives the Sagittarians for plummeting his eyes.

605
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,560
Jesus falls for the nineteenth time.

606
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,780
Ow!

607
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,620
That's blasphemous, you guys.

608
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,900
Jesus takes the thorn of crowns and uses it as a fetish device on Mary Magdalene.

609
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,900
I am so glad I wasn't raised religious.

610
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,000
Jesus prepares the onion dip before...

611
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,380
Hey, baby.

612
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,160
You know, I didn't get into that.

613
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,620
I took some serious S&M ass-whippin' from them nuns.

614
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,980
I can say anything I want.

615
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,040
Yeah, you know, it's funny, though.

616
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,260
Chaz went to serious, serious schoolage.

617
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,400
People are always saying, Reverend Stang, what religion burned your brain?

618
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,000
You must really hate some religion.

619
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,760
Was the nuns wrapping your hands with those rulers, or what?

620
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,740
It's like, no, my family didn't really particularly go to church or anything.

621
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,740
You were a rationalist family.

622
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,620
Sort of, yeah.

623
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,980
Actually, my dad is like a lay preacher.

624
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,320
He knows more about the Bible than most preachers do.

625
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,560
So those guys just have to lay down all the time?

626
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,520
For that matter, I know more about the Bible than most Christians do.

627
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:19,340
But I never did know much about those rituals of the Catholics or the Presbyterians.

628
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,600
Actually, the Presbyterians are kind of lively.

629
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Do they have rituals?

630
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,760
What are their rituals?

631
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,660
The tonguers are my favorite, of course.

632
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,040
The whaters?

633
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,320
The tonguers.

634
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
Those are the ones that speak in tongues.

635
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, the tonguers.

636
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,880
There are many different types of tonguers.

637
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,580
That's what the other Christian nuts who aren't quite as crazy as the tonguers call the tonguers.

638
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,140
Those are the folks who put the pits in the cream cheese?

639
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,160
I had a guy tell me about the tonguers.

640
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,620
He's going, they're just crazy.

641
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,020
They just suddenly start talking these nonsense.

642
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,140
They're going to go to hell.

643
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,980
You know, they're going to have to answer to God for that.

644
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,160
And then he told me about Jamaicans.

645
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,220
He goes, I was going to Jamaica.

646
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
You know what those men do?

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,780
They put cow dung in their hair.

648
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,300
They put cow dung in their hair.

649
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,860
And they said to me, they're going to have to answer to God.

650
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm going to ask God for that.

651
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,900
I just see these Jamaican guys standing in front of God.

652
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,900
Don't you think that's kind of strange?

653
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,380
Explaining the cow dung in their hair.

654
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,240
And God goes, cool.

655
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,980
Yeah, I think God would love a rastaman.

656
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,820
And then God would go, you know what?

657
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,020
I already knew that because I'm you and that cow dung.

658
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,140
I thought John was a rastaman.

659
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,260
And they'll go, man, that's what I was hoping.

660
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,140
I was hoping that there was an answer, that it was true and good and right.

661
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,780
And you are me and you are the cow dung.

662
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,580
And we're all one.

663
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,020
We're all together.

664
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,860
Praise God.

665
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,860
I think I'd like to live in a world where that cow dung can not only talk and not only

666
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,500
make the stations of the cross, but can also dance like Carl Sbargo.

667
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,500
You remember that guy?

668
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,840
I think he had a, what are you guys on?

669
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,700
What are we not on?

670
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
What is it on?

671
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,740
It's a plane that we can all achieve by simply colding our concentration at our navels.

672
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,200
Simply think of the spot one inch from the end of the tip of your nose.

673
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,280
Now place that spot at the end of the tip of your nose down at the tip of your navel.

674
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,800
Hold your concentration at the end of the tip of your nose and to your navel for approximately

675
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,300
five minutes while not looking at your watch.

676
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,780
Making sure to count slowly, breathing through your ears.

677
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,920
One.

678
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,660
Breathe out through your eyes.

679
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,880
In through your ears.

680
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,680
Two.

681
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,720
Three.

682
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:30,720


683
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:30,720


684
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,960
And breath out through your eyes.

685
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,340
Now everything you've heard you will smell and you will see everything you've heard after

686
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,020
you smell it.

687
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,740
Now when the navel is calmed, think of the navel as the entire center of the universe.

688
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:58,080
I would like to transplant a few, a few wonderful people.

689
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
I'd be all for them tunners.

690
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,700
I've met here on the Moon I just saw the last couple years.

691
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:00,700

yeah well why can't you just walk out and get some web van had a problem they had

707
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,740
they had no margins in that business you know it's like so the words went all the way to the

708
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,420
edge of the page the words went to the edge of the page there weren't any red lines no

709
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:53,880
blue

710
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,920
red lines no

711
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,560
where to draw

712
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,720
no place to draw

713
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,600
make little notes

714
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,540
so they said okay let's let's put all this stuff in a warehouse we'll deliver it to people

715
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,980
and then we'll charge them more but people won't pay more the people will not enough

716
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:15,260
of them will pay more yeah that's the problem well i would be great having that right now

717
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:22,500
when web van was working it was great having them bring food to your house now you know

718
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,120
i always thought there would be two sets of eggs and one of them was a little bit too much

719
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,160
well they were a little bit too big for me so i was just trying to get them in the house

720
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,160


721
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,100
and then i had to come up with two signs if we were really in the future there would

722
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:32,580
be two signs of it you would have flying cars and you would have food replicators where

723
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,960
you could just push a button and the appropriate food would just be replicated not really replicated

724
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,320
it would be like transported from some place where the perfect food was grown none of which

725
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,660
was tainted by any horrible substances or illegal insecticides and things and then we

726
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,100
would be able to eat wonderful food for free and then we would be able to eat wonderful

727
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,100


728
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:00,200
food and then we would get into our flying cars and fly to our jobs where we would only

729
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,220
have to work one minute a week and at that time we would just push a giant bunch we would

730
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,840
come to work at lunch hour we would push the big button and then we would go home we

731
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,160
would do that once a week and they'd pay us a million dollars a minute to do that it's

732
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,420
like a warner brothers cartoon

733
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,940
bibi hi i'm the everly brothers and in our business we hear a lot of talk about drugs

734
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,200
The heavy message now is that speed kills.

735
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,860
It refers to a group of dugs called antipetamins, including Ops, Pep Pills, Math Dex, even Venies.

736
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,020
You've seen what speed drugs can do. They're dangerous, much too dangerous to fool around with.

737
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,720
To find out more about drugs, go to National Institute of Medical Health or the Adventist Box,

738
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,840
or to Washington, D.C. Don't get the bug, you're being a dupac!

739
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,840
Drop it or I'll break your arm!

740
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,220
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.

741
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,140
And there... Oh, look! There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.

742
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,280
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.

743
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,420
Ridiculous. She was terrified and now she doesn't answer the door, but her car is sitting in the garage.

744
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,780
She was out or in bed with the flu.

745
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,360
Or maybe she was abducted by aliens, for all we know.

746
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,060
The alien pees in the bushes.

747
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,760
He staggers.

748
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,340
His behavior is erotic and erratic.

749
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,340
He can't focus.

750
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,060
He doesn't have any колонок.

751
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:11,260
She justרїс

752
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:21,680
OH, YOU CAN SEE HIM!

753
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,280
at his head like it's in pain. We're lucky to have the benefit of this long-range zoom.

754
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,380
We can zoom in on the hideous, hideous, foul demon that he is, like some movie, horrible,

755
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:43,020
horrible movie creature. There he is, just sort of walking. Yeah, I think they walk,

756
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:50,340
and then they creep, creepily creeping away.

757
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:59,360
What? An ID? Who is that? He wants my ID! Somebody came in the room here and asked for my ID.

758
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:11,720
Peter Paul Bergman, ER, EOR, EOR now. Come on, come on, Mr. X. Come on, Citizen X. You want me to

759
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,240
say the letters of this station? Yeah, you know what they are. All of my literary life,

760
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,520
if I might have just a moment to speak.

761
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,220
Citizen X.

762
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,900
This is the city. Wait, what? No, I'm sorry. Well, don't talk over my intro music. I'm sorry.

763
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,580
Well, the show's gone for this week. Okay, everybody go home. All the criminals will get

764
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,660
loose this week, Ted. Why don't you go back to that used car?

765
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,200
Car lot in San Francisco, you bum. Giant snake. I'll hire, I'll hire Harry, what's that guy? I can't

766
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,640
remember. Harry Cobra. Yeah. Harry Von Zell. I had some great camera angles planned for this week's

767
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,400
show, too. You did? We were going to shoot up through a glass table. Yeah? Yeah, we were going

768
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,160
to do a couple of shots shooting directly down through a rotating fan. No, no. Yeah, it was

769
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,180
going to be another great issue of Dragnet, and you messed it all up. Oh, you weren't going to

770
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,540
have a shot of him sitting in a white shirt in a slightly overstuffed chair in a hunting lodge

771
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,520
waiting for the lemon duck.

772
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,460
I remember that. I can't forget it. Dragnet finally no longer scared me when they were sitting

773
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,180
there. When do you think the duck's going to be ready? I don't know. When do you think the duck's

774
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:39,400
going to be shot? I don't know. What are we going to do sitting here in a hunting lodge? Two cops,

775
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,580
what are we going to do? No, they were in Ed's apartment or whoever his partner is, Harry.

776
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,660
That's right, Harry. When do you think, when's the duck ready, Harry? Well, I don't know. Joe.

777
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,320
Yeah. Joe Friday? Yeah, Joe Friday.

778
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,940
I don't know, Joe. Well, I don't know. My wife, my wife gave me this recipe over here. Let me take

779
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,540
a look. Oh, you better take a look now. They, they do it like. Hey, Joe. You better take a look now.

780
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah. Hey, Joe. Yeah, Harry. I took a look at the recipe. Yeah, so you took a look at the recipe.

781
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,060
You know what it says, Joe? Well, no. What does it say, Harry? It says we got to wait another hour.

782
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:29,360
But with the power of negative art, we can capture this alien in his negative and yet

783
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:39,480
natural habitat. See, it dines off the bushes over there. Keeps yanking at his head like he's in pain.

784
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:50,940
He's suffering. He's crying. His head is shrinking. He's in pain. He can't stand living another second.

785
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,380
He must.

786
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,440
Kill himself to relieve himself of such horrible, horrible pain and agony.

787
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,180
People thought negative art was just a trend.

788
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,280
But then it braced back with all the vengeance of shadow mastery.

789
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,800
I thought I would be able to find my way home.

790
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,840
But now it seems I'm just wandering.

791
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,660
Is that a real you or is that like a space suit?

792
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,400
And you're inside someplace, maybe just your brain, a little jar or something like that.

793
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,960
Here it is straight. One of the scientists in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.

794
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,500
Don't look at me like that. These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is,

795
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,340
it's a prehistoric thing. And if you laugh, I'll bring you. It's romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.

796
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,800
A monster. How can she love a monster?

797
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,440
Let's get that through your head. You dried up monster.

798
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,620
We've been hearing the sexual stuff for years. You know, the five day orgasm.

799
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,540
It all happens without physical.

800
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,580
Contact. It's only the beginning.

801
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,880
Why should this reality be public domain?

802
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,920
What's so great about it? Maybe, maybe they gave you some drugs.

803
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,380
Maybe none of this is real at all.

804
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,280
He's going into shock.

805
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,840
Yeah, I don't think about it.

806
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,300
I'll show.

807
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,380
Maybe this is not giving me a little bit more.

808
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,540
You lower down those plastic curtains.

809
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,780
You can't tell what we are.

810
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,160
What is it?

811
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,000
Lower ourselves into the caller's brain.

812
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Okay, speak now or forever hold the little pieces that are left.

813
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,660
Oh, your shattered heart.

814
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,560
My pain.

815
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,640
On the surface in casual conversation.

816
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,320
Yes, that is all.

817
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,720
Great.

818
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,240
Nice.

819
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,200
People just seem like normal.

820
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,620
Got to trade me the rest of it.

821
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,460
He just said, Anna, they made us.

822
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,040
Dangerous.

823
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,080
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple of minutes.

824
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,720
Absolutely.

825
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,640
We've done it before.

826
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm giving you great.

827
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,440
Thanks for the input.

828
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,620
Yeah, we have to put it in somewhere.

829
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, I'll be here.

830
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,380
The doctors taught me a lot about dealing with.

831
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,640
Tension.

832
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,360
Yeah, here we go.

833
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,120
No, not tens.

834
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,440
Are you?

835
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,880
Much better.

836
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,360
Now I can see that you really are a clever.

837
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,280
Well, be sure and be with us again next week when we'll be back with Book Corner once again.

838
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,540
Boy, that just went so fast.

839
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,860
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,220
Hey, oh, no, wait a minute, fellas.

841
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,120
Jocko the clocko says it's only.

842
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,380
45 minutes into the show.

843
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,000
We must have been in a time warp again.

844
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,060
Yeah, I guess so.

845
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,660
Gee, Rocket Rabbit, what are we going to do?

846
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,600
I just looked here at the script and it said that acceleration equals 16 GT squared.

847
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,420
And I just thought.

848
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,620
What does that mean?

849
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,460
Well, I don't know.

850
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,740
I just thought that ever since.

851
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,400
Ever since I was in high school, I was always told that you can accelerate faster, you know, or you can go farther.

852
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,060
How about some?

853
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,640
I got some some whiteys.

854
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,680
Give me those whiteys and I'll tell you about old law.

855
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,480
OK.

856
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,600
You want some blackies?

857
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,600
I got a couple of blackies.

858
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,120
Give me a couple of those black.

859
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,180
Would take you down a little bit.

860
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,340
Yeah.

861
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,420
How about some yellows?

862
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,260
Just a couple of yellows.

863
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,700
Yellows.

864
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,320
OK, here we go.

865
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,340
A bunch of Chicano.

866
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,420
OK, man.

867
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:57,980
All right.

868
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,820
Have some brownies.

869
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,620
I have some brownies, too.

870
00:41:59,720 --> 00:41:59,780
What?

871
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,500
I always.

872
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,920
Uh, I, uh, I, uh, that's good.

873
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,280
Good drugs.

874
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,140
OK, now with us today is an expert on drug abuse.

875
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,060
Peter Keshner.

876
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,400
Peter.

877
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,220
Peter has been an expert on drug abuse for many years.

878
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,560
He was with the Drug Abuse Council in Cincinnati.

879
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,160
He's taken more drugs than any police officer you think in the world.

880
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,540
Mr. Keshner, can you tell us about.

881
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, my golly.

882
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,240
This is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

883
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,920
Do you always wear that hat, Mr. Keshner?

884
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,040
That's, I think you'd call that far out, right?

885
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,320
OK, now as a police officer.

886
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,060
Oh, no!

887
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,780
Well, OK, in your police work, Mr. Keshner.

888
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,660
Well, as a narcotics control officer.

889
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,980
I'm a so big girl, I don't want to.

890
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,560
I'm a.

891
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,920
I think we better take a break for the news.

892
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,800
OK, let's take a break for the news.

893
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm expected to run out of money today as part of a stopgap

894
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,120
measure.

895
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:11,380
You could start to feel the, um, you could hear like, like a wooden beam just, um, trying

896
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,560
to avoid a void.

897
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,020
A quarter of a percent.

898
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,860
Thirty percent.

899
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,100
Hundred and forty percent.

900
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,540
Two hundred percent.

901
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Seventy thousand percent.

902
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,360
A million and a half percent.

903
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,820
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees have died of cholera.

904
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,460
The UN says this is the mass of PR news in Washington.

905
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:39,440
And there he goes, doomed to an existence of pain and sorrow and suffering.

906
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,920
One in which those are just regular feelings.

907
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,960
One that the common alien has to experience.

908
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,100
And he sees it.

909
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,100


910
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,860
And he sees them as fun.

911
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:56,240
In fact, if he were to experience fun, it would seem like pain to him.

912
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:06,180
And there he is with his hideous, hideous, foul, fetid, smelly face and foul body fungus

913
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:16,300
and hideous excretions and ejecta, vomitoid, rhum spascacantashahai.

914
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,080
And he falls backwards into the void.

915
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,080


916
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,080


917
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,080


918
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:29,720
The mists of hideosity and ludicrosity from which he, the spawn of evil pain and suffering,

919
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:40,440
damnation and horror, comes forth in never before revealed, springtacular, negatvergochart,

920
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,660
negative art.

921
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,540
Yes, negative art.

922
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,280
It's a new art form sweeping the nation.

923
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,380
Only two people have mastered it so far.

924
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,080
Huzzling every single one of us.

925
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,080


926
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,080


927
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,080


928
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,080


929
00:44:51,080 --> 00:45:02,300
And there, the hideous alien is trying to shield himself from our nonstop, relentless

930
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,060
camera.

931
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,320
Our camera cannot stop shooting and killing the alien.

932
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,720
That's what makes him hurt.

933
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:15,700
See him grabbing his ears in pain, suffering, suffering and crying, crying.

934
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,700
Oh, we've lost contact with the alien.

935
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,760
Lost contact.

936
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:21,960
Just a second.

937
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,060
Ad-lib, improvised lines, generally used to fill in a gap or at the end of exit speeches

938
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,140
to carry the actor completely off stage.

939
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,940
Hello, Clayton Rumjey!

940
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,640
Clayton Rumjey!

941
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,460
Clayton Rumjey!

942
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,020
Here it is!

943
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,700
Cheers, here it is.

944
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,100
That's it, here guys.

945
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,440
Just settle down, guys.

946
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,120
I got this new telephone.

947
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,080
I'd like to try it out here, if you don't mind.

948
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:40,340
Sure.

949
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,120
Just plug it in the wall.

950
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,740
Thank you very much.

951
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,120
Ad-lib, improvised lines, generally used to fill in a gap or at the end of exit speeches

952
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,000
to carry the actor completely off stage.

953
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,940
Oh, I'm sorry.

954
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,160
I'm sorry.

955
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,740
I'm sorry.

956
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:49,740


957
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:50,840
I'm sorry.

958
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:50,840


959
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,260
I can't hear you saying you're so off stage.

960
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:52,700
All right.

961
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,400
Is Dick there?

962
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,280
Sure, I can wait.

963
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,300
Do you have anything?

964
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:57,820
Hello?

965
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:58,760
Hello, Dick.

966
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,740
Yeah, listen, I'm back.

967
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,400
It's Clayton.

968
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,300
Thank you.

969
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:06,380
And I got some very good news for you, Dickie.

970
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,320
Yeah, I was able to go through with the initial planning.

971
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,060
They're all behind us.

972
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,220
They don't have anything down there.

973
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,100
No, no.

974
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,280
We'll probably be able to set them up with all sorts of, you know, signs and things.

975
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,720
Would you like that?

976
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,740
Yeah.

977
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


978
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


979
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


980
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


981
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


982
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


983
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:19,740


984
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,960
You know, we don't have to go through with the initial planning.

985
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,320
We'll probably get them up with the initial planning.

986
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:22,400
Yeah.

987
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:22,480
We'll probably get them up with the initial planning.

988
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:22,500
All right.

989
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:22,820
Thank you.

990
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,820
And, listen, the only trouble is in the copyrights.

991
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,240
Liggett & Myers has a copyright to the one we were trying to get.

992
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,540
The others I think we can get ahold of without any trouble.

993
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,500
And we'll be able to spring it on the unsuspecting public as soon as we can brainwash them into

994
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,880
believing it won't hurt them.

995
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,740
Now, I know that there's a lot of hard work in this.

996
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,740
Uh-huh.

997
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,280
And, you know, Earl has been working...

998
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,300
He's been on the golf course.

999
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,320
Is he?

1000
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,680
He hit who in the back of the head?

1001
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,680
With a golf ball?

1002
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,620
Dickie, Trish is on the cocaine.

1003
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,760
What are we going to do?

1004
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,520
Fantastic.

1005
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:09,120
Listen, also, there's some stuff that I think we should look into because somebody put some

1006
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,780
of it in an olive that I had in a martini recently.

1007
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:17,360
And it had an interesting effect which I think could push the American public right into

1008
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,440
the 70s.

1009
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:18,720
Uh-huh.

1010
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,680
So we ought to look into bottling it.

1011
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,200
Yeah.

1012
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:21,740
Right.

1013
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,440
Yeah.

1014
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:26,060
It's the stuff that your daughter took the night of the big ball.

1015
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,480
Remember?

1016
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,900
She danced circles around everybody.

1017
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,400
Son of a gun.

1018
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,140
We didn't think she'd ever drop.

1019
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,320
But she did.

1020
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,880
Okay, Dickie, look.

1021
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,820
I got to get off now because the phone is running out.

1022
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,040
And I'll talk to you next week.

1023
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm going to go down there again and see if I can't put something together.

1024
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,280
This is Clayton Rumcake over and out.

1025
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,720
Well, it's nice to see you.

1026
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:48,720


1027
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:48,720


1028
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,160
See you next time.

1029
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,940
Bye.

1030
00:47:50,940 --> 00:48:00,760
The creature will emerge from the horror and the suffering that he viruses.

1031
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:10,440
And this Barbara world in which the suffering souls of an agony feed off of the horror and

1032
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,160
the pain in every living creature around, it's so bad.

1033
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,920
People hated.

1034
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,720
They thought about making it happen.

1035
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1036
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:18,720


1037
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,120
I was making a law against this world, but I didn't know how to get to it.

1038
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:29,380
And now here you are, through the scientific advancement of negative heart.

1039
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,420
You can now see this hideous creature. Oh my god, he's coming closer.

1040
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,540
Oh, oh, oh no!

1041
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,620
I'll change the story in a bunch of hurry if you don't mind.

1042
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,140
Star Day. One million forgotten BC.

1043
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,700
Monsters.

1044
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,960
Captain's Lord. Monsters have taken over the interface once again.

1045
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,760
And I and Mr. Spook are helpless to do anything about it.

1046
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,540
Visitors are requested not to throw coffee into the basin.

1047
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:04,000
Irritating, Captain. The sensors have eliminated all the blue passages from my sex novel.

1048
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,880
Still poking that big nose of yours into things that don't concern you?

1049
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
You play Lieutenant Uhuru.

1050
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,500
I fail to see what the size of my nose has to do with the problem that we are facing.

1051
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:15,680
What are you doing?

1052
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,840
You can be like the queen on Sex Planet.

1053
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,060
What is it about my nose that makes you constantly comment on its prodigious size?

1054
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:26,280
I forget. You know, I never did watch Star Trek, so I don't know all the different characters.

1055
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,100
What is it about my nose that constantly brings great attention to the Earth?

1056
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,540
Blast you, Spook. You know that your nose is in front to all decent Earth men?

1057
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,720
Weird. I'm picking up late.

1058
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,520
That's what you keep telling me.

1059
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,420
Are you out of your Vulcan mind, Spook?

1060
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,440
Oh, I get it.

1061
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,900
He doesn't have a mind, right? Is that the joke?

1062
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,440
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

1063
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:57,080
When the baby is done drinking, it must be unscrewed and laid in a cool place under a tap if the baby does not die of the stroke it should be.

1064
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,720
Boiled.

1065
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,640
You know, I'm sorry. I think I just sat on the racist peanut butter cups.

1066
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,100
You did that on purpose. I saw you.

1067
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,340
Just so I could have them all.

1068
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,300
I think you filled the racist peanut butter cups.

1069
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,080
Oh, he figured out my fault.

1070
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,000
All right, all right. Yeah, you know, like...

1071
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,020
To boldly split infinitives where no one has done that before.

1072
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,060
Wow.

1073
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,280
To see what's on the bottom.

1074
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,360
The final frontier.

1075
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,340
And then a bunch of old, frappy stars pretending to go like this.

1076
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,300
These are the voyages of the starship KPFA.

1077
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,160
Its continuing mission. To boldly explore.

1078
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,660
To smash up the entire...

1079
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,700
Break everything.

1080
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,820
The bottom is erupting.

1081
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,780
The entire studio.

1082
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,340
That's the monster that comes out and attacks the whole ship.

1083
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,740
Oh, some monster did that.

1084
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,980
Every week. Every week.

1085
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,340
What kind of ship is that?

1086
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,980
Every week there's a Kirk out.

1087
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,640
It's a beautiful ship.

1088
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,160
The ship pitches and rolls. Everyone falls out of his seat.

1089
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,080
Here's a harder one.

1090
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,980
Puzzling evidence from KPFA Berkeley.

1091
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:08,980
Before that, lots of rare fire sign theater and ESO Swamp Radio merged with Hour of Slack from WCSB Cleveland year 2001.

1092
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,680
But now, some historical news.

1093
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:17,060
Historical material and a short clip from Sandy Boone's award-winning feature-length documentary film,

1094
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,600
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1095
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,580
On the origins of the Book of the Subgenius.

1096
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,840
Voices heard include Dr. Philo Drummond,

1097
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,620
Hel Swamy Satellite Weavers, also known as John Hagenbrenner,

1098
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:35,060
Dr. Hal Robbins, Penn Jillette, Nick Oberman, Paul Mavridis.

1099
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:41,660
This movie is streaming nationally on numerous outlets, all listed at dobbstown.org.

1100
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:50,320
My sister-in-law, she had moved to New York and was in the publishing business.

1101
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,420
She went to a picnic with a bunch of other people in the publishing business,

1102
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,040
and a young man named Tim McGinnis, who was a brand new editor at McGraw-Hill,

1103
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,420
found this smudged pamphlet on the floor of her car.

1104
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,660
He goes, where'd this come from?

1105
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,360
She goes, that was my crazy brother-in-law.

1106
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,920
He and his buddy did this.

1107
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,200
He goes, I want to get in touch with him and tell him to get an agent.

1108
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,700
Next thing we knew, Simon & Schuster, McGraw-Hill, and Macmillan

1109
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,940
were all bidding on the Book of the Subgenius,

1110
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,660
which caused the asking price to go up to $20,000.

1111
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:34,600
That was enough to pay Paul Mavridis and John Hagenbrenner to do professional design on it.

1112
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,540
Doug brought in hand-scrawled manuscripts,

1113
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,020
and, uh, uh,

1114
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,900
you know,

1115
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,700
packets of clip art and stuff that he wanted included.

1116
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:47,320
So, you know, I'd take a chapter and I'd, I'd paste it up.

1117
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,420
I'd generate some original material.

1118
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,960
John's style was perfect because it kind of matched the clip art.

1119
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,580
When McGraw-Hill first released it,

1120
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,340
some places we could find it in the religion section,

1121
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,160
and I thought that was a huge win.

1122
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,580
We got a contract for a book,

1123
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,940
we got it in the stores,

1124
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,820
and it's in the religion section instead of the comedy section.

1125
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,760
It's not next to Doonesbury, it's next to the Bible and stuff.

1126
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,660
People go,

1127
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,920
man, I barely made it through high school,

1128
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,780
but I stumbled upon your book,

1129
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,320
and I realized I'm not the only one.

1130
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,860
I got that book,

1131
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,400
I read it beginning to end,

1132
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,660
I absorbed that book,

1133
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,200
I adored that book,

1134
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,340
I loved that book.

1135
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,420
They kept me with,

1136
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,980
I get this, I get this, I get this,

1137
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,460
I understand it, this is directly from my heart.

1138
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,620
What the fuck are they talking about?

1139
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,480
I have no idea what this is.

1140
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,300
This is the word of Almighty Bob!

1141
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,940
It's the roadmap!

1142
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,340
There is no other book like this book!

1143
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,220
There is no other word like this word!

1144
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,340
It was these older, wiser miscreants

1145
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,600
letting us know that indeed,

1146
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,880
all of these human-made organizational systems

1147
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,740
are as flawed as you suspect,

1148
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,640
because they're made by us.

1149
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,600
I was thinking it would be fun to have the

1150
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,340
Celebrity Square thing,

1151
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,260
the subject be esoteric subgenius concepts,

1152
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,880
so like the story of Bob being shot

1153
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,100
could be part of that.

1154
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,920
Well, so many things could be.

1155
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,760
That's a great idea, because it's

1156
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,380
mining the ancient depths of subgenius,

1157
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,360
some of the origination myths,

1158
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,400
rather than these newer church things.

1159
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,220
But they would be brought out in a playful,

1160
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,500
fundamental way.

1161
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,640
And we could really dig,

1162
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,440
as I do sometimes when I find these books,

1163
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,820
and listen to some of the old jokes

1164
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,020
of the old church,

1165
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,940
and I think they're just fun to dig up again.

1166
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,140
That was P. Bicker Flemouth

1167
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,480
and the Cajun Country Band.

1168
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,700
And I just want to throw in some of the old jokes

1169
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,460
so people know there was a little old church,

1170
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,720
and these little guys limped around

1171
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,020
the little campfire at night,

1172
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:59,880
and did their religious thing,

1173
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,360
and said, as people always do universally,

1174
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,440
it was better back then,

1175
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,240
because you know folks, it was better back then.

1176
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,980
Sure it was.

1177
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
No matter who you were, or where you were in history,

1178
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,700
it was always better back then.

1179
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,020
Because there was more youth,

1180
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,080
and less withering from time,

1181
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,060
being blasted by grief and ill usage.

1182
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,960
So now let the myrmidons of chicken

1183
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,460
infuse energy into the show,

1184
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,460
while we, the elder archons,

1185
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,340
simply lap up the cream provided on the occasion

1186
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:38,000
by the cremettes and other performing groups.

1187
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,440
They are also referred to as

1188
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,040
Naked Fire Goddesses by Chicken.

1189
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,380
I don't know what the deal is there.

1190
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:45,880
Who cares?

1191
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:48,580
He's claiming that that...

1192
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,100
They'll just fit in just fine

1193
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,860
to the subgenius mythology

1194
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:55,980
of saucers and pleasure guides and...

1195
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,980
All that stuff.

1196
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,820
All that stuff that they pay ten bucks to come see.

1197
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,160
That's right.

1198
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,540
Dinosaurs of slack.

1199
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,800
All your favorites doing all the same things

1200
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,920
over and over again.

1201
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,180
That's thirteen bucks.

1202
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,460
That's Jesus at subgenius.com.

1203
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,240
If you want to know about salvation

1204
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,720
or your two hundred and seventy-five dollars,

1205
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,620
it's Jesus at subgenius.com.

1206
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,640
Yeah, it's not Chaz.

1207
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,400
It's ESO Radio.

1208
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,640
Thou shalt not scratch his grab-your-shoes-from-swing.

1209
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,780
Thou shalt not skid in his fury of the world.

1210
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,760
It's you, it's you and me, you and Zoro, Bob, Don.

1211
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,640
In between you and Bob.

1212
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,460
You don't need the intermediary of a preacher.

1213
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1214
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,420
You don't need a preacher.

1215
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,660
You just need Bob.

1216
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,520
You don't need Reverend Stack.

1217
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,520
You don't need Ken Schilling.

1218
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,740
You don't need the bank.

1219
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,560
You don't need the ambulance.

1220
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,720
You don't need the antidote.

1221
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,740
You only need one thing, that's Bob.

1222
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,460
And a little frop, probably.

1223
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,720
And, uh...

1224
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,220
When God come back on...

1225
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,640
On a happy Easter's day,

1226
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,580
and it carries a lace around the flowers,

1227
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,320
and everybody pukes on his head...

1228
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,620
He's still talking over there.

1229
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,800
Ivan Stan can talk forever.

1230
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,180
Yeah, he's speechifying and preachifying,

1231
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,680
bringing the word to the bed-night at Ethan's.

1232
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,420
I want you to check a box next to each one of these

1233
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,240
that's a true statement.

1234
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,220
Let's go get fresh eggs, ham and bacon.

1235
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,960
A true statement.

1236
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,460
I salivate at the sight of mittens, true or false.

1237
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,040
Garlic and, uh...

1238
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,380
My father was a good woman, true or false.

1239
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,060
A little salsa in there.

1240
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,500
My mother dresses me funny, true or false.

1241
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,360
I believe in an afterbirth, true or false.

1242
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,120
This is a subgenius quiz.

1243
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,440
I often lie to make myself obnoxious, true or false.

1244
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,660
I prefer spiders to lima beans.

1245
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:02,840
Spiders?

1246
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,880
Digitally?

1247
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,200
Think you're most older when you're a kid?

1248
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:06,620
I'm pretty dead, John.

1249
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,580
Often I think I am a special agent.

1250
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,040
I can talk forever, but shan't.

1251
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,940
And all there is left for you to know is at subgenius.com

1252
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,000
and much of it's right there on the home page.

1253
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,460
And now, a word from our sponsor.

1254
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,960
The preceding portion of this program was brought to you by Schleicher beer.

1255
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,560
Remember, Schleicher beer is better than Nordlander.

1256
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,940
Either that or if I really get serious,

1257
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,220
I can put on two hours of people listening to shows.

1258
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,140
Yeah, people listening.

1259
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,700
Just people listening to radio.

1260
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,320
Sure, yeah.

1261
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,000
People.

1262
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,580
Two hours.

1263
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:45,160
People, yeah.

1264
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,420
It's easy for you to say.

1265
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,780
Did they say that?

1266
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,140
Putting people, people listening on.

1267
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,620
Putting people.

1268
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,760
Putting people first.

1269
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,960
If you put people listening on, nobody, I mean, it's going to be kind of boring.

1270
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,340
People are just going to be listening to people listening.

1271
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,680
Well, like Dear Friends.

1272
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,100
And it's sort of like.

1273
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,860
I think, yeah, it was on the Pacific Island.

1274
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,680
Like right now.

1275
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,660
Dear Friends, which is just what we're doing right now.

1276
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:07,940
In the Pacific Ocean.

1277
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,800
And I believe Gary listened to the original.

1278
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:11,400
Fire Science Theater doing just yakking.

1279
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:12,880
About listening.

1280
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,740
Yeah.

1281
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,040
And about listening.

1282
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,100
About all the stuff we do.

1283
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:19,820
It's interesting to think about listening to someone listening.

1284
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,340
It's sort of like thinking about thinking in one way, you know.

1285
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,660
It is.

1286
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,500
In one way, yeah.

1287
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,480
In one way it is.

1288
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,040
In the fact that it's.

1289
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,840
It is in one way.

1290
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,640
In another way, it's absolutely unrelated.

1291
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,860
It's sort of like.

1292
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,660
It's stupid to even think about it.

1293
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,360
And another way.

1294
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:36,520
It's stupid to think about it.

1295
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:36,520


1296
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,380
Well, it's stupid to think about it.

1297
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:38,860
How can you even waste time.

1298
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,220
A lot of stupid.

1299
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,820
Thinking about them being related.

1300
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:41,720
It's stupid.

1301
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,340
Why would you do that with your life?

1302
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:43,640
Stupid.

1303
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,260
Don't be so stupid.

1304
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:45,920
To think they were related.

1305
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,420
That's coming up, isn't it?

1306
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,200
St. Stupids Day.

1307
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,400
Well, not for some time.

1308
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:51,920
Yeah.

1309
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,520
Why that's in April I don't know.

1310
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,720
Hey, Hal, I can dream my dream.

1311
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,980
Hey, everything's coming up.

1312
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,400
Yeah.

1313
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:57,760
Yeah.

1314
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1315
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1316
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1317
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1318
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1319
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1320
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1321
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760


1322
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:57,760
