From PR News in Washington, I'm burying an explosive device.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is moving toward a dictatorship.

NATO says Bob has been charged with three counts of attempted holiday.

Pope Benedict says he will not run for a third term in office.
Benedict has begun a series of individual meetings with Irish bishops to discuss covering up decades of sexual abuse of children.
But he says it's time for him to contribute to society in a different way, such as PR News from Washington.

Hour of Slack.
We may make fun of capitalism and the conservative.
But we do it for capitalistic reasons.
We want to become so rich that we can buy the conspiracy.
Because that is frankly the only way to fight the conspiracy.
With its own weapon.
Money.
Green.
Cabbage and green, baby.
Then you didn't tell him what we believe.
Well, the chances of convincing a hard-headed sheriff seem pretty slim.
Very.
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?
Are you sure we're not allowing our imagination to run?
Can you suggest any other explanation for the events of the past few days?
No.
No.

No.

No.
I don't think you have an explanation for what is happening.

As a substitute.
We must continue to exercise our mutancy.
Remember, one human a day, every day, until X-Day.
Until the aliens decide to come and take us away from here.
Because the UFOs are in the skies and they are watching and I'm psychically connected to them.
And anything happens to me, someone...
Their blood will freeze in my hands!
Kill them, of course. But why stop there?
Why should only Batman and Robin die, while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Yes. If I must suffer, humanity will suffer with me.
I shall repay them for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.
I will blanket the city in endless winter.
First, Gotham.
And then...
The world!
Just what I had in mind.
Everything dead on Earth except us.
A chance for Mother Nature to start again.
Behold the dawn of a new age.
My mutant plants have the strength of the deadliest animals.
Once you have frozen mankind, these babies will overrun the globe.
And we shall...
We shall rule them.
For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Yes.
Adam...
And evil.
Yes.
Why should you care, then?
Because he...
Because he's a human being, that's why, said Susan, surprised at herself.
I don't see why people should be messed around like that, she added lamely. That's all.
Oh, I don't know.
He leaned down again until his skull was on a level with her face.
But most people are rather stupid and waste their lives.
Have you not seen that?
Have you not looked down from the horse at a city and thought how much it resembled an ant heap,
full of blind creatures who think their mundane little world is real?
You see the lighted windows and what you want to think is that there may be many interesting stories behind them,
but what you know is that really there are just dull, dull souls,
mere consumers of food who think their instincts are emotions and their tiny lives of more account than a whisper of wind.
The blue glow was bottomless. It seemed to be sucking her own thoughts out of her mind.
No, whispered Susan, no. I've never thought like that.
Death stood up abruptly and turned away.
You may find that...
I know that it helps, he said.
But it's all just chaos, said Susan. There's no sense to the way people die. There's no justice.
Ah! Are you too scared to change the world?
Death turned. The very sight of his expression made Susan back away.
You say that to me? You stand there in your pretty dress and say that to me?
You, you prattle on about changing the world?
Could you find the courage to accept it? To know what must be done and do it, whatever the cost?
Is there one human anywhere in the world who knows what duty means?
This is what I figure. You take songs coming out of the penitentiary.
Time up a little Beach Boys bow. Oh, for the dodo who don't know. Who knows now? Better now. Better than you thought.
I'm telling you, Jesus.
Go all the way back. Let's take it all the way back. In time, in plan. Another place, wherever he was.
The desert on the sand with the people that gathered around. They bothered to gather around.
He had God-sized love. He took them Romans. He said, give me them reins.
I'll show you how to take them chariots for a gallop of love. Here you go. Get him behind it. Get him behind that love.
See, I'm spiritually allied with a scorpion and a wolf.
You know about the wolf, don't you, baby?
See, spiritualism, that just, woo.
Boo.
See, see, see.
You got the spiritualism. Let it out.
Scares these people, you know, because they got their stereotype little church.
And they got to get the God. Get God. Get in the box.
Get in the box. Get in the building.
I'm just saying. I know, but I'm just saying. I'll be going, but I'm just saying.
I didn't know God had a side.
That's all I'm trying to say.
Did God have a pick and sides?
God, God, God, God, whatever you want to call it.
I don't even think it should have a name. You give God a name and it's gone.
Goes on. Goes on. The end of the ga- If there is an end to the galaxy, then what then?
If there is no end, is God at the end? Does God ever get back?
Does God give back? Does God stay there and not here?
Hey, God. Hey, God. God. You know, they're God.
I tried talking to the dude.
I'll just be here. You know.
I'm still here.
Yeah?
Still here. I'm still here.
Ah, you must be big almighty God. You know, when I got to make an appointment.

The president was speaking to a group of 150 doctors from all 150 states for the first
time in more than a year.
All of the UN's offices have been shut down temporarily as a precaution.
On Wall Street 8595773, the first doses of swine flu are being distributed this week.
The New York Times is reporting that many doctors are being cut off today by people
anxious to get PR news in Washington.
They wouldn't be able to recognize love in the police lineup of love.
That's so uptight and high.
They come every Sunday, one day a week type 2s because they need the whole week to get
up inside them collars.
And we let it up underneath them robes?
Rattled up underneath them rosaries?
What would they think?
What would they think?
You understand what I'm saying?
Love.
They don't even have permission from their God to take a look down at the body of God.
I guess I was skeptical when I first met Dr. Martin.
He said we could build a baby out of DNA and although it was expensive it was legal in
the states where it wasn't banned.
It was Betty who suggested we cut out the parts of me that she can't stand.
So we made an appointment and Betty went alone.
They worked out the details and then called me on the phone to say congratulations dad.
Now things are getting better for Betty and me.
We're making us a baby that's just like me only better.
And Betty says he'll be taller and Betty says he'll be smarter.
And Betty says that our baby will be better than me.
Betty was pretty firm about our baby being human.
I said we should give him wings and a nice prehensile tail.
He could travel at the circus making money making friends with clowns.
Betty said that's stupid and for God's sakes would you turn that TV down?
Now I've seen Betty happy but she's never been like this.
She goes like someone else.
Katie,
she plans toweet Kat and they figure her out on some brand newiseness callignon.

We did it!
We did it!
Where do you want me?
Inside me thunders like a storm
And I hope to
That keep him in his comfortable and warm
I hope the nutritive solution
That they're feeding him
Doesn't make him fat
Betty's been spending lots of time
Out late with Dr. Martin
She says that they're working on the baby
Every night and Dr. Martin
Sends her presents like new underwear
And a bottle of wine
I'll just keep on writing checks
Until the day that baby is mine
He might have my mustache
Or my freckles or my eyes
Betty thinks it's better
To keep it a surprise
I hope I find out soon
Cause things are getting better
For Betty and me
We're making us a baby
That's just like me
Only better
And better

Betty says he'll be taller
And Betty says he'll be smarter
And Betty says that our baby will be better
That baby will be better
That baby will be better

Before that we heard
Not Charlie Manson
That was not actually
Charlie himself
But Jeffrey stable
Davies, the actor who you may remember as Michael Faraday in Lost.
Jeffrey Davies, it turns out, he played Manson in a TV movie, I think called Manson, which
we just saw recently.
But that stuff was from a demo tape that he did for another movie, an indie movie that
never got made.
He became Charlie Manson.
He memorized Manson's speech ways.
What is this?
El Queso All-Stars here in the background.
There's all kinds of stuff in the background.
Just, you know, friends, this may be the worst hour of Slack ever.
It just might be.
We're trying.
We're hoping.
Aside from the Mansonian material there, which was great.
We heard a little clip.
A little clip from the audio book of Soul Music by Terry Pratchett.
A little business of death there.
Some cut-ups by Lee Murr, as always.
You always hear stuff by Fernanda Nende, Lee Murr, chopped up things.
The El Queso All-Stars did not only this background, but also the intro.
This is the hour of Slack.
This is that.
Uh-oh.
I think I hear recordings from Winterstar.
This is the Spice Jam cabin at Winterstar.
Is that the wrong phone buzzing over there?
Why, I think it is.
It's the mystery phone.
I'm not going to mess with it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
We got back from a...
We got back from a...
A devival at Winterstar last week.
You'll be hearing the Winterstar show either before or after this one.
Edited stuff, but...
That doesn't sound like good, clean laughter to me.
The Space Jam cabin had a...
It had witch disco in it, and they had an echo mic on.
So that anybody in the room who made any noise, it all got echoed.
Oh, that's the space noise.
Oh, Dave?
Yeah?
Okay.
So what's the other phone that's ringing?
Oh, it's that thing that's ringing.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I got...
There's like five people trying to call here at once or something.
But it's not a real phone, Stan.
Don't worry.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, what a relief.
And this isn't a real broadcast.
We're not really on the air, right?
At least I hope not.
At least from what I've got to tell the public at large, I hope they don't get to hear it.
Because it could be very, very important.
Really?
No.
Actually, it's a bunch of drivel as usual.
No, it could be.
If you look at it with one jaundiced eye.
Or both of them.
Well, whip it out, Cyclops.
Okay, baby.
Here it comes.
It goes, as it were.
I think, therefore I stink, that the reason why we're embroiled in so many current crises across the universe.
I'm not just talking about here on planet Earth.
It's because the actual...
Excuse me.
The actual psychoseismospasmic urge, the inner urge of the mankind accordion is to spurt out venomous noise and bad stuff.
And therefore, what I'm coming from is that we're all bad at heart.
And born bad, rather than born good and corruptigated.
So I don't know what that has to do with Bob Dobbs, because I just keep on seeing pictures of a pipe going up and down where my mom once was when I came home one night.
And I knew that, you know, Bob was having his way with my mom.
Well, Dave.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.



Certainly, man is evil.
And in the church of the subgenius, we only want to destroy one race.
The human race.
Thank God it's not the Hunan race, or else I wouldn't have any black beans to prize.
But man was born with original slack.
And the conspiracy is what whips and beats it out of you.
You know, I mean, people are born both bad and with original slack.
The conspiracy doesn't beat the badness out, only the slack.
So the badness generally remains.
That is right.
That's the deal.
The balance is forsaken and forswollen.
There's no slack, but there is badness.
And those can coexist together quite harmoniously, given the right circumstances and the right environment which would flourish in.
Well, our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is an example of perfect.
Perfect.
Slack and perfect badness.
But Reverend Stang, you're always saying that all women are bad, and now you say it's man.
All women are bad.
That's true.
We did not mention that.
That's actually the title of a movie.
There's a movie called All Women Are Bad, and it's a bad movie.
All men are also bad, but it doesn't sound as good in a movie title.
How about this friendly misogynist view of my own?
All women are bad except for when they give you food or sex.
Now, that's chauvinistical.
It really is.
What if they give you bad food and bad sex?
Then they're bad at that, too.
Well, at least they're trying.
What if they're good at everything but food and sex?
Well, I don't want to have my socks darned.
I want to have my pickle turned, and I want double ketchup on the side.
Well, darn you.
You'll just have to rent one of those good women.
We'll wait for another incarnation.
I've been like Vishnu, man.
I've been sitting here looking at the lotus tree, you know, hoping for, you know, a thousand years go by.
I'm waiting.
I'm patient.
That's one approach.
The other approach would be to simply grab what you can and screw the other guy.
But what if you're incapable of it?
What if you're not gay?
Why are you going to screw the other guy, you know?
In that way.
In that way.
What if you were like a true bohemian of the old age,
and you thought, you know, I'm going to screw the other guy.
You know, even if such a thing were a bohemian,
it might make you not become, you know, that you wouldn't want to do that and so forth.
Are we...
We're probably treading on thin ice.
I'm not sure of what we're doing, but that may be one of the things we're doing right now.
We're exploring parts of the brain that don't exist.
Come on, man.
Good.
I don't want to...
Please don't ask me to explore any more parts of the body with you, Dave.
I mean, we're working on the hypothalamus right now.
That's fine.
It's a fine organ, isn't it?
You know, let's say, keep your pants in your own pants.
Keep your hand in your own ant farm.
Well, that's something that you don't want the viewers to listen to at all.
If they have any TV mind eye going on right now.
Speaking of listening to ants, and this is true,
I read a science article the other day on the BBC,
which said that...
Scientifically,
individuals are working on a way of miking and recording the sounds of microscopic animals
and microscopic events, tiny things.
In other words, when amoebas are, like, getting it on...
Well, amoebas don't really get it on.
They do it by themselves.
But you'd be able to hear them doing it, and the ants, we'd finally get the answer.
Is it fun or is it bad?
Is it like having an orgasm or having a baby or both?
When you split down the middle.
And cell mitosis.
But seriously, there are...
It's not exactly done with microphones.
It's done with lasers, which can react to tiny little movements.
And they can film the little movements and translate those into something like sound.
It wouldn't be what the animalcules hear.
It would be something we could understand as sound.
Isn't Einstein a great woman?
Just think about it.
Who's the idea?
He said that all such things are all vibrations and all part of the, you know, theory of light, as light is.
Now, some say that Einstein's old lady, his girlfriend and her vibrator,
were the ones who came up with half of that relativity stuff.
You better believe it.
And his relatives.
That is quite a strong possibility.
Because she was good at math, too.
And she could spend a long time at the blackboard doing what she was supposed to.
I bet she could.
I bet her.
I wonder if she could cook well or was sexy, you know, Mrs. Einstein.
Actually, it wasn't Mrs. Einstein.
It was his girlfriend before he got married.
Yes.
Mrs. Einstein kept her mouth shut in her place.
She was a shiksa.
She wasn't Jew.
Come on.
She was his mistress.
The shiksa mistress of him.
And, you know, I think that's where he got some of his good ideas, which is being able to take an enteebled walk.
Well, if she was the Jew...
She was the genius.
...she will urinate on things.
That's it.
If she was the genius, then we could let Einstein into the church of the subgenius.
If he was not really the actual genius, then he qualifies for the church after all.
Yeah, but I think this...
Stephen Hawking still, he's going to have to just...
Sorry, dude.
You're going to have to get some brain damage if you want to join our august assemblage.
Wow.
What a convoluted way of looking at it.
I was thinking that perhaps some great lofts...
Science had been broken, and we were such a sexist, misogynist community as a large,
that we actually allowed Einstein to take credit for his mistress's work.
And you just transpose it all into subgenius stuff.
That made me almost very angry for a brief moment.
Well, but that's what we do, isn't it?
We transpose everything into subgenius stuff.
We take something normal and good and make it subgeniously and bad.
Or vice versa.
We take something normal and bad, like a really awful movie,
and translate it in subgeniously.
You know, like this guy in the background.
Well, that's where our work with the hypothalamus begins and ends.
This is the alpha and the omega of where the organs and the glands do their work
to make the brain do something else it doesn't want to do.
The pineal.
The hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus and the hypochondriac are all related.
And they're related to pineal narco, our frequent contributor.
And pineal narcissism, too, who's another fine woman who lives around here.
Yeah.
We have to keep track of everybody and make sure that they're getting their work on time,
because a lot of the submissions are late lately.
If only they'd be even more submissive.
Oh, speaking of people, of their work, the music in the background,
Yeah.
is by the fine band called Mayan Ruins,
of whom we met one of the members, Christian, at Winterstar.
He handed me this CD, and it's going in the background.
And mayanruins.com, I said,
Oh, well, with a name like that, it sounds like it might be pretty music.
And he said, Well, yeah, it kind of is.
It sounds like...
It's music that would go with walking around in Mayan ruins.
Well, to a wolverine or perhaps some other feral creature like that, this is beautiful music.
Well, it actually is pretty music.
I wonder why he gave it to me.
Well, the objects of our ardor are sometimes strange to behold,
and I'm sure he found you strange to behold.
And he was ardent.
I surprised him so much.
He met me and gave me the CD on Friday night at Winterstar.
And the next evening, he said,
I bet you don't remember me, do you?
I said, Yeah, sure I do.
He gave me that CD.
And he goes, You don't remember my name, though, do you?
And I went, Yeah, Christian.
He went, Oh, my God.
You don't have nearly as much brain damage as I thought, he said.
Or was that another guy whose name I remembered?
They're so shocked.
Oh, but Reverend Stagg...
They're used to pot smokers.
See, they don't know froppers like myself.
They're used to pot smokers.
You can't remember.
I think you should have said,
You're the idiot who was smooching up my papal ring so much.
My hand is still full of slobber and so forth.
Oh, God.
Finally, I'd thought to say that.
Of course, then again, you know,
you could have the old Machiavellian politician's instincts.
You remember everyone's face and name.
You remember little bits of history about them.
So when you go up to them,
you can throw out that big, fat old hand and say,
Vote for me, this encumbering erection.
And give them a slap on the thigh
and a twist on the weasel, just like that.
Well, Reverend Machiavelli was right.
And because of that,
I watched my home movies of each X-Day before X-Day
so that I can walk up and glad hand these yo-yos
and go,
Oh, Reverend Funny Name,
you were here last year, weren't you?
And they go,
Oh, my gosh,
the Reverend Stagg remembered my name.
I'll go buy more stuff at the Swag Shack.
The subgenius Swag Shack.
I've got $5 left.
I wonder what I can get.
Oh, everything's $10.
It starts at $10.
Oh, speaking of X-Day and Brushwood,
where Starwood won't be this year,
we can announce for the first time anywhere
where Starwood will be.
Starwood Festival, the great festival
at which there's always a great subgenius revival
and about 170 others.
Other events, including music,
most of it actually good.
Starwood will be held at Wisteria Campground
in Southern Ohio.
In Pomeroy, Ohio.
Pomeroy, Ohio.
It's actually in the middle of nowhere.
South of Athens.
Athens, Greece.
30 minutes south of Athens.
And yes, July 6th through 12th.
And we can say that because we know that.






We don't make any money.
We help run that festival, but nobody's paid.
Hey, what is this?
Boy, that'll be a tootie-twister.
I can imagine.
I bet.
So we're all going to have to drive
at an extra distance.
Immediately after.
Well, wait a minute.
What are we worried about?
X-Day is the 5th.
If there's going to be a Starwood at all,
it'll be on my escape vessel.
Because the planet Earth will be completely destroyed.
We hope.
We hope.
At least for...
We...
I agree.
I agree.
Well, not completely destroyed,
except for the sections that subgeniuses save for themselves.
Which, unfortunately,
knowing the subgeniuses will mostly be
old used DVDs and tattered comic books.
Only a few of us have enough taste
to save the untattered comic books.
My space vehicle will be merely a cardboard.
A very, very, very large,
double corrugated cardboard.
A cardboard box
filled with many of the amenities
I'm accustomed to here on this planet Earth.
Only with a little bit more vibrance
and emotional hue.
To be fun.
My space vehicle will be on myspace.com.
My space vehicle.
Hey, Dave.
Have you got a Facebook page yet?
Or a MySpace page?
No, but...
I have a saxophone
implanted in the back of my head.
Everybody has to have one.
They don't have a Facebook page,
or they're not a real...
They don't have a proper face.
Or they call it front butt pa...
On alt.slack, I've noticed
the ladies call it front butt book
instead of face book.
Front butt book.
Well, mug puppies is what I call some of them.
But, see...
Squirty little honeys is what I call some of them.
My squirty little honeys.
Squirty little honeys.
I trademarked Joe Offrit.
That man has a bad reputation
for some of the things he's done to...
Never mind.
I won't even get into it.
No, it's not.
My tongue clicking is wearing out on this show.
What is?
My tongue clicking.
The clucking.
Tisking.
Tisking.
Tisking.
Tisking.
She's plucking your tongue?
She's tisking?
I've been tisking.
I'm listening to all this...
That's my trademark.
...terrible, terrible things.
You need not tiske when nigh is nigh.
Things are growing grim in the land of gloom and cry.
Things are on their way down.
But we're hoping soon to be re-re-re-resurrected
and removed from this place.
Just like that.
Hope.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
But would you call this blither or blather that we're...
Nether.
I'd call it slather.
Slather.
The hour of slather.
The hour of slather.
Hey.
Reverend Slather.
Hey, I have some religious music I could play in the background.
Well, I love...
It's Princess Wee and Reverend Fat Man D singing
a...
a...
a Catholic-type song that I originally thought was a...
a...
a...
a Jewish mysticism.
I thought the Jews were conspiring against her.
Now, are you wearing a clothespin on your nose?
Uh, me?
No, that was her.
I thought your voice was a bit high.
You're her now, right?
That's Princess Wee?
Yeah.
That's Princess Wee and Fat Man D.
Can you believe that?
That's in a subgenius devival.
They sang this in a subgenius devival.
A Christian song.
It's delightful.
I...
I don't...
When I first heard it, I thought they were doing Jewish chanting.
I didn't recognize it was Latin, and I'm...
I'm...
You know, I'm kind of...
I wasn't really raised in that...
in the church, exactly.
Or a synagogue, so I didn't know the difference.
I was raised in a laboratory.
Yeah, you were raised in a swamp, for crying out loud.
In a laboratory.
Rather...
In a laboratory in a swamp.
A beautiful laboratory.
Run down on the swamp.
Yes, the same laboratory seen in Attack of the Swamp Creature, in fact.
That's where I grew up.
Well, in a certain way, think of it...
We all grew up there.
You know what I mean?
Listen to this rockin' Nova...
Donna Nova...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nova Pacham, is that what it's called?
Donna Nobis Pacham.
Give us some peace, or give us some...
Dave, get this.
Suddenly, in the middle of this subgenius show,
these two ladies started singing John Lennon's Imagine.
And worse, the whole audience started singing along with them.
And even the worst of all, I got tears in my eyes.
I go...
I'm all worked up.
It was so sweet.
That is...
What the hell is this church coming to?
Slather.
Yeah.
Everyone has become too confident, too overconfident, and too repressed.
You know what I mean?
Of course not.
Because...
I didn't think so.
I just posited those idiotic things as a way of saying that perhaps people are becoming
a little bit more...
Oh, what's the word?
What is the word?
Lonesome?
Cowboy-ish?
No.
Davian?
Oh, so wimpy?
Not wimpy.
Pinky?
Pinkly-winkly?
Normally warmly?
Yeah, maybe a little normally warmly.
A little pink.
Not too pinkly.
Dave, do you ever listen back to the recordings of these shows and go,
Oh, so that's what I was saying?
On occasion, I do.
And other times, I go, I wish I wouldn't have said that.
And I also be like, man, I have to...
I have to think of something else to do.
I suck.
Life sucks.
I'm going to go and...
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
That's all true, Dave.
But yet...
No, no, there are brief times when I go, I am a bloody genius.
I love myself.
But then you listen for another ten seconds.
I know the feeling.
It's a constant battle.
Up and down.
Yes.
A constant battle against fighting.
Like an ancient...
Psycho-emotional game of Pong.
Remember that game?
Of back in the...
Pong.
That's the only video game I ever learned how to play.
I'm still playing that one.
Who is this?
Reverend Circle Maker.
Hi.
I'm...
Oh, this is exciting, too.
Of a different kind.
Yes.
What a multi-talented young lad.
Oh, my God.
Now, that was...
Yes, our friend Reverend Circle Maker did this song, and he also did a lot of the crop circles
that people always assumed must be done by aliens, since Englishmen on speed could never
do such things.
Never.
In the middle of the night, when nobody's looking.
Well, it sounds like a lot of nasal drip going on right there.
Well, we're all getting over that cold, aren't we?
Didn't Snotty visit you as well as Princess Wee and I?
And implanted in my mind.
I'm in the vision of a sphinx.
That's the inscrutable sphinx, which means that I'll never, never untether the liquids
in my nose.
It'll go on forever.
You ought to do what I did, Dave, and have you...
What was the last time you had you a big old onion, garlic, and jalapeno sandwich?
I...
As I said, I'm remiss in eating one every day.
That'll clear those sinuses out, boy.
That's dead.
Raw onion.
I'm not talking no cooked.
I'm not talking no cooked onion or cooked garlic.
I mean a big old slice, like half an inch thick, of raw onion, and none of your little wimply
Vidalia onions.
I don't mean none of this sweetie-peatie stuff.
I mean manly, a manly sandwich of onions and a bunch of jalapenos.
It's unbelievable, Dave, what this man eats in the morning.
And slices of fresh garlic.
And green beans.
And assured salt.
And cherry tomatoes.
And that, your stuff is just too good to be able to.

It's it.
She's just a little, a little bit of��y knife.

Hey, let's see you if you're going to hurt or hurt someone.

Oh, before Washington hits you-
Then you're going to have to be late, your mother vitesse has been
And, Tom, Nikki, for shoe washing your pants, Nikki.
and I'm going to have you and George to work the
I already lost four of my daughters in my conferences.
And the nggak dick should get a place at the internet called
New York, Texas and then New acre'm Connection in Denver.
Oh, I like her.
The sound in the background is Ron Slade blowing into a beer bottle.
Oh, I thought it was a woman and I love her.
And burping.
It is funny.
Yeah, if you're high.
High on life.
This is from the Space Jam cabinet Winter Star again.
And then the...
High on funny sounds and laughter.
Wow.
Debauchery.
It is debauchery.
Those are the sounds of debauchery.
A room full of people laughing.
It must be something.
There's something bad going on in there.
If they're having that much fun.
Actually, there wasn't anything terribly bad going on in there.
Just sound effects.
Big old helium balloons, obviously.
Steve.
This is definitely a helium party where helium and...
You know, in the old days it would have been, but...
Some of us are so old that we don't even need the helium or the laughing gas or anything anymore.
All we have to hear is the echoes of our own laughter.
Especially at high speed.
And repeated.
Oh, there's nothing like that in the world.
I'm not a total.
Now that's true liquid refreshment.
Yeah, that doesn't sound like good, clean laughter, does it?
And what is good, clean?
I can't tell whether it's Princess Wee laughing in this room or on the tape.
It sounds like one very well-documented psychotic episode in an institution somewhere.
Where a doctor's really doing his work pretty damn well.
Yep.
He put the little electronic zyclode on the top of the man's foreskin and one inside of his ear by where the lobe meets the temporal figurine.
And blasted off a few hot...
Shots and checked it out and that's what came out.
Gimme, gimme shock treatment.
Treatment.
I think everybody...
I want shock treatment.
Mandatory shock treatments in our new healthcare plan.
I guess that's what they're saying on the...
I said shock treatment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's different.
Well, you know, I'm not known for getting...
I'm in the shock treatment.
Shock treatment?
Yes.
Shock treatment.
Yes.
Let's just shock your treatment.
Go on, shucks.
Oh, no, I thought that was getting...
Not taking your pills.
Then there's...
That's my secret.
...soap treatment.
I don't take my pills.
...soap treatment.
And how else you don't?
You are pills.
I am pills.
As Dali say.
Yep, right.
No, actually he said, I am drugs.
I am...
I do not take drugs.
I am drugs.
Butterfly.
Everything romping and yawping.
Good old Salvador.
I am.
He was a...
He would have...
He was...
Back...
You know, back before we had that fight
when he used to be on the show.
Those were the days.
I got to admit.
I mean, he was a jerk and a prevert,
but he was really funny on the show.
That was a golden era of hour of slack.
Yeah.
That was...
Hour of slack was really good back...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, but see, that's one reason he quit.
He thought that was not funny
when we pulled his mustard.
Well, he claimed it was abusive,
but his language...
His language...
His language skills, you know,
he sounded so silly in English
that, you know,
he should have known
that that's what he signed on for.
That was what the contract was.
Be yourself,
and we'll be ourselves.
Listen, here they are being themselves.
It's a room full of people now.
Well, they're definitely not human beings.
Is that the space onion again?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

That's the space jam cabinet winter story.
I would say this is far spacier
than any of the other onion jams.
Well, the musicians quit,
but they left their special effects mics on.
There's some of your clicking.
Uh-huh.
That's your...
A friend of mine told me
he went to the beach in Florida,
and he was contemplating
on the nasal parts of Bob Dobbs,
and suddenly on the beach,
he saw thousands and thousands,
literally thousands,
upon thousands of micro crabs
the size of quarters
crawling towards him,
making that same clicking sound.
Cool.
What a nightmare.
What a nightmare vision.
But I guess that's the way it is.
Unless you're into...
Some people are into micro crabs, Dave,
because you caught my attention, finally,
when you said that.
Thank God they're not investigated
in your pubic goatee,
or else soon we'd be arguing
about a different type of crab.
Now, here's some more of that not...
Here's some more of that
not-good-clean laughter.
Now, these people are definitely
anti-cyclonic.
They're spinning the wrong way.
And that guy's evil, I can tell.
Listen to him.
He's giving us
evil subliminal commands.
You don't know how correct you are.
Now, let's talk about
all the kinds of limitless tricks

I don't want to be scammed
by the people who are

public life off of buying
echo cigarettes.
So let's stop doing that,
and try to get the right stuff out.


This is mental illness music in the background.
I made these noises with a program called Net Logo.
These are very...
You try little turtles to run around this cage and bang into musical instruments.
You have a very cinematic feel.
That's why as soon as I hear this stuff, this is yours?
It's completely random, Dave.
I know, but...
I set the parameters, let me put it that way.
But the way you done did it, and even the parameters you have set,
make me want to create some sort of illusion for the listeners.
A radio theater illusion.
Perhaps a...
Someone got out of the basement.
In the garbage dump.
Speaking of which...
There's a fucking window in there.
I read a thing in the garbage dump that said that...
It was a study in Australia.
They claimed that they discovered that long-term use of marijuana increased psychosis and hallucinations.
Well, it's like, duh.
If it doesn't, then you got ripped off.
Right.
But...
Why are you doing it if you don't...
The funny thing was, the study was based on 3,020-year-olds who had been asked.
So their idea of long...
Well, nobody gets to be 3,020-year-olds.
Unless you're Mel Brooks in 1964.
Well, that's the thing.
I mean, it's like, their idea of how long-term of marijuana use can a 20-year-old be guilty of.
Yeah.
Most of them, it's like, the ones that started when they were 14,
there were slightly more hallucinating psychotics among that group,
and there were slightly fewer among the people who'd only been smoking marijuana for a year.
But they were all 20-year-olds, and out of 3,000 people,
that many people would have been hallucinating psychotics anyway!
Right.
Especially 20-year-olds.
And there was no way to...
You couldn't...
Like, how exactly did this correlation work?
Could it be that people who were already psychotic and hallucinating smoked pot
because it made them hallucinate less?
Could that be?
Probably not, but...
3,020-year-old psychotics revealed that the ones of those 3,020-year-old psychotics
who smoked marijuana on a daily or a monthly basis
were still...

Still psychotics.
Isn't that what it says?
For crying out loud, that lady should be beaten and smoked!
You got any more of that landlady?
Which landlady?
Do you know where I can get some landlady?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to cough and roll my eyes back in my head.
Let's see now.
Did you repeat the question?
Do you know where I can get some of that silver landlady?
You're looking for...
An elderly girl with, uh...
Landlady Hayes, man?
Yeah, Landlady Hayes.
You got any of the Landlady Hayes?
How about Gray Landlady?
Landlady, 47 years old, angry at her ex-husband.
Would that, uh...
Uh, man, I got some of this dead landlady.
It's gray.
Only take one, man.
She'll never up your rent.
Just take one, man.
And...
I do, man.
I...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Are we...
Are we...
Are we on the air?
Bingo.
I warned the listeners that this would possibly be the worst hour of Slack ever.
Did you really?
Yeah.
Oh, thank God.
You start prepared for what's coming.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, I set it up perfectly.
Man, we've come home!
We've jumped the shark!
I knew we could make it over that shark.
Excellent.
The shark under the bus.
We threw the shark under the bus and then we jumped it, man.
What a wind-up.
What a pitch.
Now a shark mush everywhere.
You just remember I'm the pitcher, not the catcher, Dave.
Well, right now I can only see sharks driving buses with other elderly sharks in the back of the bus.
There's some angry young sharks at the beginning of the bus who are looking at each other like they want to rip each other off.
And then a transit cop shark walking up and down the aisle.
Making strange noises.
Not strange, necessarily, to a shark or even to...
Oh, never mind.
Transit cop shark.
Coming up next after Lost.
Transit cop shark.
Oh, yeah.
I love that show, man.
That is so over the top.
Oh, my God.
Remember the one time I was thinking with Sharky?
He's back in the office.
And he's flopping around in front of the desk.
And then one Saturday, the guy's a captain.
He's like, you know, hey, man, you know, get back in your cage.
I know I saw it one time.
Princess, if you're going to laugh that loud, lean back from the microphone.
She was laughing at my face, I'm afraid, Dave.
She wasn't laughing.
She was laughing.
I was making a...
She was laughing at my face at what you were saying.
And she was laughing at my face.
That doesn't help our listeners much, though, does it?
No, but it does give an idea of what your face probably is like.
Try to imagine an old yeti or an old were-yeti with kind of pinched up, screwed up face in consternation.
And yet bafflement.
And bafflement.
Yeah, bafflement.
Maybe a Tory MP.
Now, you'll like this.
This background music, Dave.
This is Purple Haze.
It is.
It's showing up here.
On the sheets here.
My daddy can see me now.
Oh, boy.
I can't remember.
It's some Russian or Balkan instrument.
It sounds like bagpipes.
Yes.
It actually sounds like an Ionian bagpipe.
Bagpipe or perhaps it could even be like Sicilian or southern coast of Italy bagpipe.
It's not.
I heard this once in a family thing and I thought, how silly.
Bagpipes are everywhere.
And the percussion is all strapped to one foot.
It's stomping.
Please.
Excuse me.
What is this guy?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I can't remember.
I didn't write down the name of this person.
I found it on YouTube.
You could just do a search on YouTube for Purple Haze and click on the picture that
looks the least likely.
The one that looks the least like Jimi Hendrix.
It was like a...
It looked like an old sheep herder guy sitting by the side of a road or something.
In an old stone shack or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.







Yeah.









And it does not look easy.
There are close-ups on his face and he's dripping with sweat.
This is really a workout.
He may well have been on Purple Haze while doing this.
You don't know the inner politics.
That's true.
I understand over in the former Soviet Union, you can get all kinds of things.
Yes.
You'd be surprised.
As well as vintage Hendrix albums.
Yeah.
Yeah, right. They have to bootleg everything instantly as soon as it comes out.
This probably dates from 1967.
Would you like to drive a car?
Actually, Hendrix probably ripped this guy off.
He was walking through Bulgaria and went, oh my God, listen to that, you guys.
Quick, let's record that.
Let's do that.
What's he saying? Is he saying, excuse me while I kiss this guy?
No, let's change the lyrics.
Let's make it something else.
She kissed the sky. Yeah, that's better.
That's not so, you know.
Unfortunately, I don't know.
I think perhaps you've taken leave of your senses.
I wish I could.
Oh, how I wish I could.
We'll be able to take leave of this radio station soon.
How so?
Just through the flight?
Through the magic of time control.
Time is a place.
Time is a place for some of us.
The past is over on the left and the future is over on the right.
But if you don't get right with Bob, we're going to have to bring you to now.
We'll have to advance you to first.
Last place.
I mean, if you ain't right with Bob, if you ain't doing what Bob said to do,
we're going to have to bring you to now.
That's what Charlie used to say.
Charlie would, when somebody needed to get killed, for instance, he'd go,
we're going to have to bring him to now.
You know what to do.
Well, who's Charlie Mansoon?
Charlie Manson, you know.
Mansoon?
Reverend Manson.
He's been in jail for a long time.
You remember?
He was the guy we first.
He was.
It was like our first mind programming experiment.
Oh, yeah.
And then we taught him how to program people.
And then he went out and he kind of.
Well, he wasn't.
He didn't stay low profile enough like most of us do.
Anyway, Dave, yes, the time of the end of the show is rapidly approaching.
That means I have to say that this music in the background is, I think, by Artemia Salina.
The subs go marching in.
Yeah, I think that's it.
And.
And this has been the hour of slack number one thousand two hundred forty seven live done the last day of February 2010.
And if you need information, that's it.
Information.
You need information from subgenius.com.
If you want to know about more of that, subgenius.com or post office box.
One eight one four one seven.
Leave Lund Heights, Ohio.
Four four one one eight.
Four four one one eight.
And with that, I think we must fade Dave out.
OK, but I want to remind you that that was pretty silly there at the end the way you did that.
You could have you could have been a lot more forceful in making people do what they're supposed to.
I'm not supposed to make people do what they're supposed to.
You're supposed to not supposed to make supposed to.
That's right.
And I'm sick of being exposed to this nonsense.
So I'm going to end it all now.
Oh, and.
Goodbye, fair listeners.
Goodbye, fair show.
And goodbye, fair Dave.
And goodbye, fair share and hopeless, not driveling.
All the rest.
Good.
I'll find that wonderful good evening across the United States to each and every one of you out there.
On the hour of flag.
I thought I told you before you paid me, man, what are you doing?
All right.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
All right.
All this for.
And you were gone.
And I'll come in and.
Up.
inte not go nine, night out and one.

on.
A because.
OK if only.
Cut off all the hair
I don't care
I don't care
Because I got my old world to live through
And I ain't gonna copy you
That was Vic Verga doing the sixth lesson on Praise Ball
You're hurting me
