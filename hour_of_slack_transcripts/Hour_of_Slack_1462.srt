1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,000
Come, they told me, ba-ra-pa-pum-pum

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,320
Our newborn king to see, ba-ra-pa-pum-pum

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,820
Our finest gifts we bring, ba-ra-pa-pum-pum

4
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,120
To lay before the soul genius, our old son

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,900
The hangout for the homosexual

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,420
It's filled with cornhole fun

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,280
We didn't want to play this gig

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,180
But when Jesus told us we had to

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
We couldn't say no to Jesus

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,360
Somebody forgot their Kool-Aid

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,920
We're gonna tune up for you, hope you like it

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,100
Okay, so do you want to hear some Schoenberg or some Neil Diamond?

13
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,480
Okay, I think it's pretty clear

14
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,240
Everybody here would like to hear

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,840
Neil Diamond

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,720
Okay, a Neil Diamond

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,640
One, two, three, four

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Sunshine peeking through my windowpane

19
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,260
Cup of coffee with Olin Soule

20
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,680
Birds are singing

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,400
In the trees again

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,740
Cup of coffee with Olin Soule

23
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,080
Whistling on the street

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,440
It ain't no crime

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,760
Checking my watch

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,340
I gotta be on time

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,580
Grab my Sporco

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,420
Got to look my best

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,500
Cup of coffee with Olin Soule

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm so glad I got my trousers pressed

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,220
Cup of coffee with Olin Soule

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,340
Gotta be there at half past nine, looking for the diner with the neon sign.

33
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,680
Sha-ka-lacka-lacka-boo, Sha-ka-lacka-lacka-boo,

34
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
Sha-ka-lacka-lacka-boo, Sha-ka-lacka-lacka-boo,

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,340
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,280
Olin complains that I'm giving him the works

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,020
when I poke fun at him for always playing hotel clerks.

39
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,320
So what if he's pissed?

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,240
Cause with him it never sticks.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,600
He whomps me upside my head with his prehensile attitude,

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,420
slimy seven foot long dick.

43
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm going to clear up some confusion about the contents of these jars.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,040
All are called food drinks, and they're all mixed with milk.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,540
So you might think they don't make the same kind of milk drink.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,660
But here, we have a real food supplement.

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,140
Instant Oval-Ten.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Our official secret squadron drink.

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,180
There's that waitress we saw yesterday.

50
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,560
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Olin likes it when she looks our way.

52
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,360
Licks his lips and rubs his belly cause she's got a packet of strawberry jelly.

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,120
Sets it on the table and gives him a wink,

55
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,860
and that makes Olin start to think.

56
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,220
She might have some reptile blood cause her tail and her scales have started to bud.

57
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,720
And she's got a lizard tongue with crusted blood cause she eats her young.

58
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,200
Points to the kitchen with a scaly finger where a guy with a rash is making our dinner.

59
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,740
He scratches his balls like a real hash slinger and tosses out an order with his ding dong dinger.

60
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,260
We'll take the

61
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,260


62
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Olin is the king of the game.

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,240


65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,240


66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,240


67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,240


68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,240


69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
I'm a cup of coffee with Olin Soule.

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,740
are the surveillance

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Then right after we took his side

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,200
Come to find out that Obama lied

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,080
Hi-ho, hey, hey

74
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,780
Here comes a man from the NSA

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,020
He wants to know what you got to say

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,660
He wants to know what you's thinking today

77
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,720
Oh, hi, hey, hey

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
Fuck the guy from the NSA

79
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,340
Phone calls, emails, metadata

80
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,840
He don't need a wallet cause they're here in Chata

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,620
Drag your ass to a secret card

82
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,540
And in the prison these days they're doing water sports

83
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,300
Hi-ho, hey, hey

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,040
Here comes a man from the NSA

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
Someday he might send you away

86
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,620
Got some friends at the CIA

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,860
Oh, hi, hey, hey

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,620
Fuck the guy from the NSA

89
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:49,820
He wants to know what you got to say

90
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:49,840


91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,820
Now it doesn't matter now where you've been

92
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,940
He'll even listen to you at the Holiday Inn

93
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,820
Watch the movie, watch the movie

94
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,100
Watch the movie, watch the movie

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,580
You and your next of kin

96
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,440
He make Minnesota like East Berlin

97
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,500
Oh, the NSA man, he is scum

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,340
Hanging from a pole by his fucking thumbs

99
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,520
Wire up his nipples, put a clamp on his scrotum

100
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Like he wanna do to Eddie Snowden

101
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
Hi-ho, hey, hey

102
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,660
Here comes a man from the NSA

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,620
For the man that he took it away

104
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,640
Son of a bitch, we're gonna make him pay

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,800
Oh, hi, hey, hey

106
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,040
Hey, hey, son of a bitch

107
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,060
From the NSA

108
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,300
Hi-ho, hey, hey

109
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,040
Fuck the guy from the NSA

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,560
From PR News in Washington,

111
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm a former Rwandan spy chief making $666 a year.

112
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,600
The Malaysian prime minister says German cardinals are Catholics within the Roman Catholic Church.

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,020
President Obama talked.

114
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,140
If you have to work more, you should forensic bait that tourist for those up-and-up dates.

115
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:54,200
Earlier this week, the president pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to complicity in genocide and crimes against pipes and two flattened buildings.

116
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,300
800,000 people were killed in the explosion.

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,060
PR's report reports that for the first time, France has PR news in Washington.

118
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,080
And dear friends, thank you to Leemur for that.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:19,000
The great Fernand and Andy Leemur, the PR news and our opening titles as usual.

120
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,520
And the songs.

121
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,060
How about that?

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,180
NFI.

123
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,560
USA guy.

124
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:35,280
And the previous, well, what mixed in with a cup of coffee with Ola and Sule are from the new album by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

125
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,460
And friends, it is an incredible album.

126
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,840
Winter Koala Sperm Harvest.

127
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,780
Although that's not the whole title.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,700
It's like Song of the Winter Koala Sperm Harvest or Ode to the or something.

129
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,640
Anyway, it's incredibly good.

130
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:53,740
And.

131
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,980
This show will be largely Rudy Schwartz Project versus Papa Joe Mama.

132
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,020
The great preacher, subgenius preacher, Papa Joe Mama.

133
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,240
We've got two sermons by him coming up and more Rudy Schwartz Project.

134
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,760
Although for the Internet version of this show, I'll have to put the cuss words back in.

135
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Don't you see?

136
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,420
Princess We is here, but the phone lines aren't.

137
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,020
They're still broke.

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:24,320
They're still broken.

139
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,700
And but we've been promised that they'll be fixed on Tuesday.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,900
This is vintage Papa Joe Mama, eh?

141
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,580
Oh, yeah.

142
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:34,900
Yeah.

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,480
This is it.

144
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,180
It's a common.

145
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:44,240
This shows combination of brand new hot off the griddle Rudy Schwartz Project from our dear friend, Reverend Joe Newman.

146
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,600
And.

147
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,460
Yeah.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,520
Oh, and that was Sphinx Drummond that you heard right at the very beginning.

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,340
Yeah.

150
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,100
I think that was recorded at a.

151
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
D Vival in Austin.

152
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,620
When they were playing as Booger 9000.

153
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,240
Anyway, friends.

154
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,240
So that's the show.

155
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,200
Well, you actually have some fake live show that really comes off of Radio Synesthesia later on.

156
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,400
But now from the old subgenius tape album.

157
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,300
And I apologize for the breakups and the sound quality.

158
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,900
Here.

159
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,520
This is the great song, Free Things, by Reverend G.

160
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,120
Don Trueby.

161
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,440
Oh, I love you.

162
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,660
Oh, I love you.

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,140
I love you.

164
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,500
carnivalband.

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,500


166
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,500


167
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,500


168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,560
The stuff that groove always does.

169
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,840
I will not screw you up.

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,120
But there's extreme.

171
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
things I know

172
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,160
to be true

173
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,900
that's

174
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,100
death in Texas

175
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,520
and Bob

176
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:17,660
the sermon tonight

177
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,780
is entitled

178
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,120
Thank God for Satan

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,160
you heard me right

180
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,700
Thank God

181
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,920
for Satan

182
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,420
you see friends

183
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,440
as hard as it is to imagine

184
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,620
a lot of folks out there don't know about Bob

185
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,960
there's so many different

186
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,760
religions there's so many

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,700
different gods and yet there's only

188
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,560
one Satan

189
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,280
oh he has a thousand names

190
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,200
a thousand synonyms

191
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
also pronounced sin-o-names

192
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,180
we've heard them all and yet

193
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,400
they conjure forth only one deity

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
the anti-deity

195
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,520
the anti-Bob

196
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,220
Beelzebub, Mephistopheles

197
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,060
Lucifer, the devil

198
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,240
Old Scratch, the prince of darkness

199
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,440
the king of the conspiracy

200
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
the one and only Satan

201
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,820
simply put friends

202
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,580
no god, least of all Bob

203
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,020
has the name recognition

204
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,840
of Satan

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,740
all the gods of the universe

206
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,820
joined together in one legion of doom

207
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,880
still cannot doom the devil

208
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,100
oh they've tried but they couldn't do it

209
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,840
they've tried again and they've failed again

210
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,560
no matter how many different gods we invent

211
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
no matter how many different deities we discard

212
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Satan never seems to go away

213
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,180
does he now

214
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,460
he's always there ready for a new contender

215
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,200
and yet

216
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,060
it is this very evil

217
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,860
conspiracy king's same

218
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,080
immortal characteristic

219
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,920
that would deal him his death blow

220
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,840
in the end

221
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,680
and simultaneously elevate Bob

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,060
and his disciples skyward

223
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,080
toward the heaven of God

224
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,320
and the heavens

225
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,420
that is why I say to you

226
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,500
thank God for Satan

227
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,640
you see friends

228
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,660
we have to face facts

229
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
there is no practical way for Bob's ministry

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,760
to keep up with the evil deeds of the dark one

231
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,080
all the combined resources of the subgenie

232
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,500
the underground overmen

233
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,020
the fifth column columnists

234
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,380
the national association of traveling salesmen

235
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,780
and even the exes themselves

236
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,060
could not begin to supply the woman power needed to upstate the world

237
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,060


238
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,360
and bench Satan

239
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,180
but lucky for us

240
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,260
it is through Satan's success

241
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,280
that Bob's word receives ...

242
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,040
now play along with me here moment friends

243
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,500
because I know what I'm talking about

244
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,800
imagine if you would

245
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,600
a slack filled planet

246
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,240
a world without evil

247
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
pain nowhere

248
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,360
pleasure everywhere

249
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,240
a world where no one had even heard of the conspiracy

250
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,660
it would be a pretty nice place now wouldn't it

251
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,060
no friends

252
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,440
it would not

253
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,780
it was not

254
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,040
for as it was in the beginning

255
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,680
the beginning, before the conspiracy, before the anti-Bob, before death and taxes, everyone had

256
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,240
slack, but nobody knew how to use it. No one had Bob, and more importantly, nobody wanted him.

257
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,000
It is through our daily suffering that we've come to appreciate Bob and the slack he represents.

258
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,800
Just as cold winter makes us look forward to hot summer, so does the coldness of the conspiracy

259
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,800
make us seek Bob's work. The tighter the conspiracy squeezes its fist, the more subgenies slip right

260
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,760
through his fingers. We should thank the anti-Bob for making Bob's job so easy, so essential, and so

261
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,020
certain. They put Bob in business, and Bob's gonna run them right out of business. The king of salesmen,

262
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,480
the penultimate pitch man, the only con man capable of kicking the conspiracy right in the

263
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:48,780
kitchen.

264
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:56,700
When we see the conspiracy at work, being loyal subgenies and faithful followers of Bob,

265
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:04,400
we should not say woe be to us, but praise be to Bob. The more evil that is enacted,

266
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:12,920
the earlier the end times are. It's biblical prophecy, friends, being fulfilled. July 5th,

267
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,780
1998, friends. It used to be forever and a day away, but as the night is coming,

268
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:26,920
1900s come to a close, the conspiracy has a closeout sale on satism. Why? Because it knows

269
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:34,440
the end is nigh, and through its desperation for more demonic deeds, it necessitates the need for

270
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:42,000
a new era. Thank you, Satan, for getting us geared up to get down. It's the end of the world, and

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,400
we're ready to party. Satan thinks he could depress us with pressure, but instead he delights us with

272
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:56,300
despair, because we know it's the storm before the calm. Thank you, Satan, for the best of times

273
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,240
by giving us the worst of times. The Great Depression, praise Bob. The Great World Wars,

274
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,160
praise Bob. Hitler's Holocaust, praise Bob. Poison gas, praise Bob. Chemical weapons, praise Bob.

275
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,880
A-bombs, H-bombs, neutron bombs, praise Bob. The AIDS epidemic, the holiday of herpes,

276
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,380
the generation of genital warts, praise Bob, praise Bob.

277
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:25,940
Praise Bob, you name it, and it's all happening in the end times, friends. Who would have ever

278
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:33,000
predicted so much hate and so much pain in one century? Why, Bob Dobbs, of course. He predicted

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,300
it, and it has come to pass. Now, don't misunderstand me, friends. I'm not saying thank Bob for the

280
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,280
conspiracy. On the contrary, I'm saying, and this is an important distinction, friends, thank the

281
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,380
conspiracy for Bob, for it is the conspiracy for Bob.

282
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,780
The conspiracy that made conditions right for revolution. The conspiracy built the Big Brother

283
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:01,340
Network to keep tabs on us, but instead picked up Bob's tab for the good old boy network for

284
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:08,920
spreading his word. The subliminal image of Big Brother on every telescreen gave Bob Dobbs' image

285
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,980
instant credit and complete credibility. We should thank the conspiracy for doing such a wonderful

286
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,380
job at making everyone else's jobs possible.

287
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,760
We should thank Bob for the conspiracy for the

288
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:40,140
most terrible, even in the darkest, most remote, and removed continent. They may not have heard of Bob, but they damn sure are familiar with the conspiracy, and they already know who they're voting for, the opposition, because after experiencing the conspiracy firsthand, they want to shake Bob's hand.

289
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,820
We're just giving the devil his due, friends. When we thank the conspiracy for buying in advance,

290
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:59,540
we're all expense paid one-way ticket to Planet X, and that heavenly bliss that we're all gonna enjoy on that journey as we exit with the X's.

291
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:12,820
Them's are good times that the conspiracy have brought us with our own blood. It's a guarded thank you, but it is a thank you nonetheless, for what does not destroy us destroys them.

292
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,260
So go ahead, anti-Bob, be all's a-bomb.

293
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:35,240
Say, Tang, make our millennium. Give us your best big bang, because the harder Satan works, the less we have to. And that, my friends, is what slack is all about. Praise Bob! Amen!

294
00:18:53,260 --> 00:19:00,060
Happy smiling Nipple Boy with his industrial dough machine.

295
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:07,900
Sappy Dappy Nipple Boy never had a mandate to ovulate or lactate.

296
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
Back in the morning, you don't know what that means.

297
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:34,640
Dancing, prancing, nipple boy. Holding up the line at the hardware store. Rubbing shoulders with the hoi polloi. He's never ever shy with a twinkle in his eye. Those nipples are hard to ignore.

298
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:48,700
Maybe his dough machine has seen some better days. Maybe all his kitchen linoleum starts to peel away.

299
00:19:49,920 --> 00:20:00,160
Maybe there's no special someone at the end of the day. Either way it'll be okay.

300
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,460
Cause nipple boy knows how to squeeze his lemons into.

301
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,080
The milky lemonade.

302
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,000
Mmm, what a groovy looking stereo.

303
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,060
That's my Sears 9235. My pride and joy.

304
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,660
Rise up Navarans.

305
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,220
Avenge the death of our king.

306
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:54,520
Smell the blackened sperm of Richard Dreyfuss.

307
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,600
Drink the blackened sperm of Richard Dreyfuss.

308
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,260
Music.

309
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,140
Hey nipple boy, what do you know?

310
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,180
I just got back from the nipple pump store.

311
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,020
Hey nipple boy, are you in the mood?

312
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,880
Show if Ava Goda gets completely nude.

313
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:21,900
Music.

314
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,220


315
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,480
Music.

316
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,240
Music.

317
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,120
Music.

318
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,860
Music.

319
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,360
Music.

320
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,060
Is this a clip? So?

321
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,760
Music.

322
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
Music.

323
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,380
Nipple boy's not playing coy.

324
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,040
Got some tips from a guy named Roy.

325
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,380
Nipple boy, his head is in a roll.

326
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,520
Cause today he met his happy little sappy dappy.

327
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,520
Happy Smiler Nipple Girl.

328
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm being released today.

329
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
Secretary of State John Kerry spoke for six hours.

330
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,600
Afterwards, Kerry told reporters.

331
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,060
Put it that way.

332
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,380
World leaders have been vague about PR News.

333
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,380
They hope to get to the lower level tomorrow.

334
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,600
On Wall Street, 43, 1665, 15, 5.

335
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,000
In New York, officials say all the people reported missing.

336
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,800
Says this is PR News.

337
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,300
And a judge.

338
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,380
Judge.

339
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,180
That van protection predicted rad effect.

340
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,580
To the tripping.

341
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,840
They would have that can you take images.

342
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,140
The Center for Rights said the law was really designed to close the PR News.

343
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,960
However, that can you take.

344
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,460
King ads were going to go to the hospital for Sam.

345
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,900
India has joined the search for the missing peer reports.

346
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,620
The National Archives says the 4,000 pages of reports include drafts of PR News at level two buildings in Washington.

347
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
The completeian van protection search for thevation has opened the door to other wet or puddle residences.

348
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:57,720
Taxi is destroyed in 됭 reck where olmayan決戒.

349
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:57,720


350
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:57,720


351
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:57,800
I'll pick up.

352
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,700
Check out.

353
00:23:59,700 --> 00:23:59,700


354
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,580
So often Luənna and he overload but India say to the fleet to check the

355
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,540
In-ennex could be exchanged between the station workers and business staff.

356
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:03,540


357
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,800
About.

358
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:04,980


359
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:04,980


360
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,420
Telling me what to do.

361
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,200
No, I don't want that federal government coming around here.

362
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,900
And telling me what to do.

363
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:28,800
Last night some helicopters came a-circling round my barn.

364
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,900
Obama sent the IRS to sodomize my horse.

365
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,240
Don't want the government coming around here.

366
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,800
And telling me what to do.

367
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,880
I don't want none of you city folk.

368
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,600
Oh.

369
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,660
Coming around here.

370
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,140
And telling me what to do.

371
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:43,860
I don't want no fancy educated New York liberals coming around here.

372
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,600
And telling me what I can do.

373
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,300
They want to steal my rifles and send them to Al Gore.

374
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,780
So he can kill me.

375
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,060
He'll kill a Christian folk with radioactive spores.

376
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,800
He'll confiscate my pickup, turn my daughters into whores.

377
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,600
But first he'll make us bow to Mecca crawling on a horse.

378
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,780
I don't want the federal government coming around here.

379
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:28,780


380
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:28,780


381
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:28,780


382
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:28,780


383
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:39,280
And telling me what to do.

384
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:46,120
I don't want that federal government coming around here.

385
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
Oh.

386
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,600
Oh.

387
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,040
Oh.

388
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,040


389
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,580


390
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,200
Oh.

391
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:54,720
Oh.

392
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:54,960
Oh.

393
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:54,960


394
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,060
Oh.

395
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,940
Oh.

396
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,260
Oh.

397
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,000
Wow.

398
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,100
Oh, man.

399
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,180
Yeah.

400
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,440
The Rudy Schwartz Project new album, Winter Koala Sperm Harvest, that song was called

401
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,600
Coming Round Here.

402
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,020
Before that, we heard his other song, Happy Smiling Nipple Boy.

403
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,500
Yes, indeed.

404
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,600
And it just occurred to Princess Wee and I while we were listening to that that it was

405
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,880
like our Yahoo News comments put to music.

406
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,360
Yes.

407
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:35,500
It's like the news comments that we copy uncut from after articles and read in stupid voices on the air.

408
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,280
Yes.

409
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,500
Oh.

410
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh.

411
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,340
How patriotic.

412
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:41,920
Okay.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,860
And speaking of patriotic, Father Joseph Mama.

414
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,200
Hello, friends, and welcome.

415
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,940
The sermon tonight is entitled Shine On, Harvest Moon.

416
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,300
Shine On, Harvest Moon.

417
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:12,760
Now, all the pinks in the audience should listen up to this one because it outlines the how and why of Judgment Day and includes important insider information on the invasion.

418
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,180
I'll begin with the basics.

419
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,260
First and foremost, the death day date, July 5th, 1998.

420
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,180
Now, you probably already know.

421
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,500
I knew that.

422
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,420
But did you know the exact time?

423
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,940
8 p.m.

424
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,820
Now, why 8 o'clock?

425
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,400
For that matter, why July 5th?

426
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,500
The answer, dear friends, is obvious.

427
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,880
July 4th is Independence Day for the normals.

428
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,260
Therefore, July 5th is Independence Day from the normals, by the abnormals.

429
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,180
8 p.m. is when the Harvest Moon rises, and 8 also symbolizes what the Xs will do to the normals.

430
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,900
8 them.

431
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,540
8 all of them, by the millions, raw, cooked, or frozen.

432
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,060
Some will be saved for the home planet, others saved for the trip back to the home planet, but all will be destined for digestion, heart, body, and mind.

433
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,320
This, of course, does not apply to church members.

434
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,740
You see, while the normals are food of the gods, the subgenies are the food servers of the gods.

435
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,120
We're the ones who will round up the mediocre masses and herd the humans like sheep.

436
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,720
We'll command a robot-killing core as well, fully automated land shark ships, killdozers, and soylent green grabbers.

437
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,120
They'll cruise the streets, gobbling up every man, woman, and child fully.

438
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,440
We'll have to even think of escape.

439
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,340
But of course, the joy of the hunt is only half of the fun.

440
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,260
The real entertainment starts when the food preparation begins.

441
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,220
Millions will beg for mercy, but only a few sincere ones will receive anything less than slow and agonizing death.

442
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,880
Did you know that a human being can remain alive and pale on a stake for over 24 hours?

443
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:43,980
He can.

444
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,340
King Vlad the Impaler proved it time and time again, and history shall repeat itself, but this time with a vengeance.

445
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,960
You see?

446
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,540
Vlad was operating in the Dark Ages.

447
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,700
Just imagine what miracles of science we'll perform with the superior medicine of the Exes.

448
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:06,540
If we use sterilized stainless steel steaks instead of splittered wood, we could probably keep pinks wiggling on the barbecue spike for weeks on end.

449
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,740
Christians have been telling us for years we had to serve somebody.

450
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,880
Well, now we're ready.

451
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,100
We're ready to serve them.

452
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,620
Rare and well done.

453
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,620
Just think, eating someone raw will take on entirely new connotations.

454
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,940
Now, I know that rotating on a grill over a barbecue is a good thing.

455
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:20,940


456
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,220
A barbecue or an open flame may not be what some pinko people had in mind for their Fourth of July weekend.

457
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,100
But that's only part of the excitement that awaits you in the End Times.

458
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,460
For those of you that feel somehow cheated, your shroud does have an aluminum lining.

459
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:40,040
You will die knowing that you served your creator by fulfilling your man-of-feast destiny.

460
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,780
You see, most religions acknowledge that the purpose of animals on this planet is to feed their masters, man unkind.

461
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,920
Well, religions may seem backwards in most things, but it happens to be right.

462
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:50,920


463
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,000
right on the button on this point. Animals were placed on this earth to feed their masters,

464
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,380
just as man was placed on this earth to feed his masters, the masters of the universe,

465
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,860
the creators of earth and its inhabitants. Yes, they're friends, the excess aliens from

466
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,600
planet 10. The religious fundamentalists were right all along. There is no such thing as

467
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,680
evolution, maybe de-evolution, but certainly not evolution. Man was created, not by chance,

468
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,000
but by a superior guidance from above. You were placed on this planet to swarm and multiply

469
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,680
like microbes in a drop of water, so that eventually you could be harvested and thereby

470
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,700
complete your mission of nutrition. Now, some of you might be saying to yourself, self,

471
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,680
it seems mighty coincidental that the scriptures were so precise in certain respects, and yet

472
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,740
glaringly wrong in others. Well, dear friends, we in the conspiracy business have long observed

473
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,660
there is no such thing as coincidence. It's all part of a matter of fact.

474
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,100
Master Plan! Normals were planted on this planet long ago, with the superior mutants,

475
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:57,360
that's us, put in charge. We were the chosen ones, the keepers of the curse. It was our job

476
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,120
to play the witch doctor and put the fear of God into the superstitious Neanderthals.

477
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,760
We were equipped with the finest mind control methods in the business, Hinduism, Shintoism,

478
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:13,020
Judaism, and more. No man would dare rise against us. They're spiritual leaders,

479
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,000
the subgenius curse casters.

480
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:23,660
But alas, along came the Xylon invaders, not men at all, but evil Axis aliens who reversed the natural order of things.

481
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,480
They installed a conspiracy puppet regime, putting themselves and collaborating normals in charge.

482
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,760
All seemed lost until J.R. Bob Dobbs came to our salvation. Dobbs organized the counter-conspiracy

483
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,100
and re-established contact with the allied aliens of Axis. In a move that stunned the entrepreneurial world,

484
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,540
he resold this pitiful planet right out from underneath the conspiracy.

485
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,760
oh.

486
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,500
Shame on you.

487
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:52,500


488
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,820
some 7

489
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,820


490
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,820


491
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,820


492
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,820


493
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:57,820


494
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,620
up

495
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:00,860
trial

496
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,840
him

497
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,680
all

498
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:05,840
makes

499
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:05,840


500
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:05,840


501
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:05,840


502
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,200
in that

503
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,820
table

504
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,560
attack

505
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,060
the true son of the gods.

506
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,720
With his superior powers,

507
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,020
he performed miracles to impress the natives.

508
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,240
And once he had their attention,

509
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,100
he preached peace and free love

510
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,080
so they would reproduce like rabbits

511
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,600
and make life more bearable

512
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,180
for the supervising subgenies.

513
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,440
Well, leave it to the pinks

514
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,300
to foul up even the most simple concepts

515
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,480
of love and charity.

516
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,480
Even before Jesus could be picked up

517
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,260
by the mothership,

518
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,440
the conspiracy ripped him to shreds.

519
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,140
They didn't know who was behind

520
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,440
this preacher of peace,

521
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,580
but they knew it damn sure wasn't Big Brother.

522
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,480
So they double-crossed Christ

523
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,380
and let him rot on the cross.

524
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,020
Fortunately, he was only recharging.

525
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,940
And on the third day,

526
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,040
he ascended to the heavens.

527
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,560
But the damage had already been done.

528
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,560
Through the years,

529
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
the conspiracy systematically corrupted

530
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,680
virtually every Christian concept

531
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,460
to promote their own agendas

532
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,640
of war, hate, oppression, and intolerance.

533
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,400
But try as they may,

534
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,780
the ignorant fools still can succeed

535
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,880
in dismantling the triggering mechanism

536
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,420
of the Christian world.

537
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,580
The prime ingredient

538
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,160
to the explosive power

539
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,700
behind Christianity,

540
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,280
what we in the church call

541
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,980
the population bomb.

542
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,100
Once the herd reaches

543
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,820
a certain saturation point,

544
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,300
it's harvest time.

545
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,480
And yet, even as the day approaches,

546
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
the pinks do nothing

547
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
but throw fuel on the fire.

548
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,280
They close down family planning clinics

549
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,540
and try to outlaw abortion.

550
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,780
The blithering fools.

551
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,940
They're falling straight into our trap.

552
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,360
In 1998, they should reach

553
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,400
the magic number,

554
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,620
seven billion pinks.

555
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,740
The horn will blow.

556
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,460
The call to arms will sound.

557
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,600
The exes will descend upon the earth

558
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,840
to liberate us from the pinko parasites.

559
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,420
We will know our exes' allies

560
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
by their wings and halos.

561
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,440
But the normals,

562
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,160
they will mistake them as angels.

563
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,580
Most will want to be lifted up to the heavens,

564
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,200
fighting to get ahead in line.

565
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,720
We'll have to track down the clever ones, of course,

566
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,360
but don't worry.

567
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,080
We'll have plenty of backup.

568
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,280
Besides sophisticated killer machines,

569
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,000
we'll also have legions of

570
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,900
dead in our command.

571
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,060
It'll be one big party.

572
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,720
And most of the bozos won't even realize,

573
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
until aboard the butcher ship,

574
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,180
that they've been bamboozled

575
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,220
by their very own Bible.

576
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,200
Such is the brilliance of Bob.

577
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,300
Hearing is the word of our praise, Bob.

578
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,800
Amen.

610
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
Why do you think Kentucky Fried Chicken

611
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,420
and changed their name to KFC.

612
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,680
The signs were a lot cheaper to paint.

613
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,520
You know the real reason, actually, I heard?

614
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,020
Because they wanted to take the word fried out of their name

615
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,700
back when, you know, when, when, you know,

616
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,620
because frying food is not good for you.

617
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,500
Right.

618
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,880
Actually, I heard that they wanted to take chicken out of their name

619
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,280
so nobody could sue them for not actually using chicken anymore.

620
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,820
Urban legend.

621
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,400
Really?

622
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,340
Well, I mean, just ask the PETA people.

623
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,120
They think those are real chickens.

624
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,480
Parts of it, anyways.

625
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,420
You know, if it's got a thigh bone.

626
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,720
They have chicken trees now, don't they,

627
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,140
where it's just a sort of a vegetable-like creature with no head that just...

628
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,240
Yeah, they've gone beyond urban chicken.

629
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,320
A sort of a root chicken and all these chicken breasts and legs and wings.

630
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,200
Meat that grows on trees, actually,

631
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,380
those trees are a very complex symbiotic relationship, actually.

632
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,640
For example, you know, you have to have extra large amounts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria

633
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,060
in the soil there as well, you know,

634
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,980
just to make sure that...

635
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,580
that they can get enough protein from the air.

636
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,840
Well, and they haven't been able to get rid of the skin yet, right?

637
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,880
I mean, they don't have feathers,

638
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,780
but the meaty fruit, as you might call it,

639
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,520
still has this sort of skin.

640
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,780
It's a barky skin.

641
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,160
It's a barky skin that has to be removed.

642
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,980
See, all you've got to do is take a chicken genome

643
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,720
or one of the chicken genomes

644
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,800
and implant it into the tree,

645
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,380
into the primordial cell, the first cell, the original.

646
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,980
They've been doing that for two years now.

647
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,340
Mm-hmm.

648
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,460
That's where most of the chicken in the supermarket comes from,

649
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,180
chicken trees.

650
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,360
Mm-mm-mm.

651
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,060
Somebody else had the idea for cow trees,

652
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,400
but people just couldn't stomach that.

653
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,040
They wouldn't.

654
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,060
Well, you know, that's the kind of tree that, like,

655
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,720
they're saying we should plant more trees to curb the greenhouse effect.

656
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,320
Right.

657
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
A cow tree would do the exact opposite.

658
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,420
Right.

659
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,880
They'd be breaking wind and knocking themselves over simultaneously,

660
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,980
and it wouldn't be good for the lobsters.

661
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:39,980


662
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:39,980


663
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:39,980


664
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,000


665
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,340
It wouldn't be good for the hogging industry or any of us.

666
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
Hello, you're on the air.

667
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,720
Yeah.

668
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,180
What are you guys talking about?

669
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,920
What's it sound like we're talking about?

670
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,140
We're talking about meat trees.

671
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,520
We're talking about genetic engineering, man,

672
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,080
something that's very important to humanity right now.

673
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,120
You should be paying attention.

674
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,300
What do you mean by meat trees?

675
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,420
We're talking about trees that grow flesh on them.

676
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,840
Haven't you heard?

677
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,120
No, I haven't.

678
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,900
Explain.

679
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,280
You never heard of a chicken tree or a beef tree?

680
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,480
The professors sound kind of quiet, actually.

681
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,800
Well, they are.

682
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,840
They're not allowed to beef trees.

683
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,140
Now, what's the status of the pork tree?

684
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,340
Are we still getting...

685
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,580
They won't make trees with mammal flesh because there's a law in the U.S. against it,

686
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:26,560
although I understand that in some foreign countries they're about to legalize it.

687
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,460
Legalize it?

688
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,300
Yeah, legalize beef and mutton trees.

689
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,360
Legalize it?

690
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,460
Apparently it's not that hard to do, but...

691
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,480
It's a bit...

692
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,460
They...

693
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:45,920
A case that the presence of little tiny mouths and eyes and beaks and things here and there

694
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,400
along the branches of the tree freaks people out,

695
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,280
so they don't advertise much that that's the way they do it.

696
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,240
They'll say farm-raised chickens and...

697
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,080
I can't wait until long pig is available.

698
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,700
Well, it already is available for a limited time only at your favorite supermarket,

699
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,420
but it's not real, real long pig.

700
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,980
There were human genomes introduced into the pig so that it has a longish flavor,

701
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,600
but it's not real long pig yet.

702
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,900
Some of those swine are kind of cute.

703
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,040
Well, they have pretty legs.

704
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,180
I don't know how they did it, but they'll have these...

705
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:35,760
They look mostly like pigs, but their hind legs will look like Betty Grable's gams.

706
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,400
And it's...

707
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,120
It's kind of a shock, you know?

708
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,100
It makes you uncomfortable to look at one of those.

709
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,740
Like, I went to the state fair in Texas where they had some of these new crossbreeds

710
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,400
between humans and farm animals, and...

711
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,160
Well, in some parts of Texas, that just happens naturally.

712
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:55,740
Right.

713
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,640
Well, on the other...

714
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,240
That happens in parts of Ohio, too.

715
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:07,520
They look increasingly like pigs, but I'm talking about these genetically engineered pigs,

716
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,160
and...

717
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,060
Those are the only kind I've seen, actually.

718
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,060
Ever.

719
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,420
The pigs that have been...

720
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,100
Have some human...

721
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,060
Because apparently human and beef doesn't...

722
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,980
That combination isn't that tasty, but pork and human are close enough together that...

723
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:31,980
If you get the human and beef combo, I know some Chinese restaurants that can do it pretty well, actually.

724
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,420
Kind of like the whole Four Seasons dish or whatever, you know?

725
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,780
Yeah.

726
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,660
Junior Chef 750.

727
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,060
Junior Chef 750.

728
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,560
I've been there once in a while, too, but yeah.

729
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,420
Sometimes they're long on the long pig, and sometimes they're a little bit short, but yeah.

730
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,440
It's a taste treat for this time of the year.

731
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,480
Yeah, it makes my mouth water.

732
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,780
I haven't enjoyed it in a while, but I remember.

733
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:52,720
Mm-mm.

734
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,220
Good.

735
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,440
Turd duck, man.

736
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,320
I wonder why...

737
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,580
I will not eat any food that starts with the word turd.

738
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,460
If they can take the turd duck in and just rearrange the parts.

739
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,200
I don't know that name, then I might be interested.

740
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,600
Like turd key or something, or...

741
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,640
Man pig turd ducking.

742
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,460
With a big apple in his mouth.

743
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,780
I can't believe that they would release that on Unwitting Society.

744
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,580
Can you...

745
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,580
You know, if we thought about it, even in a satirical way,

746
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,540
somebody in Brunei or Saudi Arabia has tried it.

747
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,100
Some...

748
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,620
Or Japan.

749
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:36,860
Japan.

750
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,640
Some rich dude with the money.

751
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,960
If we think of it, somebody has already tried it.

752
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,320
Well, we should start thinking of things that save our own skins, then.

753
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,560
What about the one...

754
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,360
Well, no, because some other guy will just save his own skin first.

755
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,860
So you gotta...

756
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,020
If you think about it, don't let yourself know you thought about it,

757
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,640
because somebody will steal the idea.

758
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,720
That's...

759
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,400
You gotta keep it secret, even from yourself,

760
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,420
until you're ready to put it right into production.

761
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,520
I was just thinking maybe Ulysses was the...

762
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,760
was the progenitor of the man-pig race,

763
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,060
because wasn't it Circe who was like a pig,

764
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,400
and she was like really hot or something like that?

765
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,000
Did you...

766
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,660
Do you know anything about that, Dr. Sinister?

767
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,940
I know you know a bit of classical literature.

768
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,960
Oh, gosh.

769
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,260
The name sounds familiar, but I can't remember.

770
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,380
Are you talking about the Circe?

771
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:26,700
Circe?

772
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,160
Circe, the circus?

773
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,540
The Circus Soleil.

774
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,940
No, I'm talking about a pig in mythology,

775
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,420
in mythology,

776
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:35,960
who...

777
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,220
You know, the sirens used to...

778
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,480
were singing to him,

779
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,080
but a pig did allure Ulysses to some...

780
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,000
No, he would get lured,

781
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,040
and then they would turn him into pigs.

782
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,780
But he killed the swine.

783
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,860
He did kill the swine,

784
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,940
because he knew it wasn't really a hot babe.

785
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,680
I guess he came to his senses and killed it.

786
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,180
That was after he was done with it.

787
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,700
Yeah.

788
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,020
He was...

789
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,140
Yeah, it was like...

790
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:05,620
Well, how many of us have awakened in that sleazy motel room

791
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,620
and looked over and went,

792
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,180
oh, my God, what was I thinking?

793
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,320
It hasn't happened to me,

794
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,080
but how many of us has it happened to?

795
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,440
Raise your hands.

796
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,040
I don't know.

797
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,260
You're asking...

798
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,180
How many of you wish it would...

799
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,240
at least that much would happen to you?

800
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,260
If only that would happen to me.

801
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,540
I don't care how much regret I have afterwards.

802
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,040
I just want it to happen once.

803
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

804
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

805
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

806
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,740
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

807
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:34,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

808
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:34,240


809
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

810
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,600


811
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,600


812
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,600


813
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

814
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,320
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

815
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,140
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

816
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

817
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

818
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

819
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

820
00:46:59,860 --> 00:46:59,860


821
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

822
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

823
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

824
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,040
Thank you.

825
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,020
Thank you.

826
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,980
Thank you.

827
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,500
Thank you.

828
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:15,300
Thank you.

829
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,940
Thank you.

830
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,980
Thank you.

831
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,340
Thank you.

832
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,580
Thank you.

833
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,040
Thank you.

834
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,940
Thank you.

835
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:35,860
Thank you.

836
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,620
Thank you.

837
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,940
Thank you.

838
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,240
Thank you.

839
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,520
Thank you.

840
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:11,900
I awakened on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous stereo that had played all night long.

841
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,580
A little stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings.

842
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:26,680
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butts, cigarette butts, dope trays, dope trays, needles and albums were strung about with clothes anchored deep on the floor.

843
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:34,320
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on.

844
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,600
I almost turned it off, but something said watch it.

845
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,220
I looked at my life. It means nothing anymore.

846
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,020
Do you hear me? It means nothing anymore.

847
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,420
I sat there transfixed and battling with myself and the devil.

848
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,300
Further to make an altar right there in front of that TV set.

849
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,000
Finally I declared to myself that I couldn't make it on my own.

850
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,300
I had to do it on my own.

851
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,880
I turned to somebody bigger than me.

852
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,720
My previous dope dealer.

853
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,920
Listen to this. Listen to this.

854
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,640
Listen to this.

855
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:21,440
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil and you ought to shout right back at them.

856
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,680
No, I'm not a Christian. I'm not a Christian.

857
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,540
I don't have anything to do with that. I'm not a Christian.

858
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,960
I want to say it so plain that a two-year-old child will understand me.

859
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,960
Be vocal. Be loud.

860
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,500
Be concise and be clear.

861
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,460
I don't care who you are.

862
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,720
You ought to shout right back at them.

863
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,980
It's a cover-up. It's a sham. It's a facade.

864
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,600
There is no God. Man is God.

865
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,940
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.

866
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,300
There is no God. Man is God.

867
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,120
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.

868
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,700
Yes, I know.

869
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,460
No, I'm not a Christian. I'm not a Christian.

870
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,140
No, I don't own it.

871
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,300
Christian. A Christian. A Christian.

872
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,280
Held up to the American public as...

873
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,160
That which is good and noble,

874
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,620
when in reality it is dirty, degrading, filthy, and rotten.

875
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,640
You'd better take a strong look, mister,

876
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,380
at where you're going to church.

877
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:18,340
And would that be the church of the subgenius, my friend?

878
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,940
Would you come into the arms of Bob,

879
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,340
the church of the subgenius,

880
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,160
the antidote to all placebos?

881
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,500
Would you now?

882
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:29,880
No.

883
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,820
That was...

884
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,940
That cut-up music,

885
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,500
was done by Reverend Gore Don Truby,

886
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,120
who used to be in a band called the Dancing Cigarettes.

887
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,660
Exceedingly ancient subgeniuses would remember them

888
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,020
from Hour of Slack in the 80s.

889
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
And the preacher there, of course,

890
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,120
was the great Jimmy Swaggart, Reverend Jimmy Swaggart,

891
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,420
who I considered to be sort of the Mick Jagger of TV evangelists.

892
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,740
I think he was more sincere than most,

893
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,760
and that made him all the more twisted.

894
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,900
And we'll let the psycho skeletons take us out on a date.

895
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,280
That should be relatively un...

896
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,320
Can you imagine going on a date with a skeleton?

897
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:13,940
No.

898
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,060
Like Skeleta, our friend over at Monster High.

899
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,080
But let's not get into that.

900
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,160
Go on, go on, let's do this!

901
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,460
It's a boy and he's a girl

902
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,840
I'm all out ofซ

903
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:43,840


904
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,040
Seriously...

905
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,720
Say it one last time?

906
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,380
Go!

907
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,780
Where are we?

908
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,680
Thank you.

909
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,060
Thank you.

910
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,640
Thank you.

911
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,160
Thank you.

912
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,360
Thank you.

913
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,240
Thank you.

914
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,700
Thank you.

915
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,020
Thank you.

916
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,200
Thank you.
