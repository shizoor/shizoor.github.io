1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm 517% contained.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,900
It is now the largest PR news in recorded history.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,820
President Turkey charges there's a plot to crush this nation's turkeys.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,400
Washington wants turkeys.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,220
The Trump doubled aluminum turkeys and revealed a turkey plot against PR News.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,360
The five nations surrounding the Caspian Sea have reached the world's largest landlocked body of water.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,660
The latest Trump has more.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,320
For over 25 years, the Caspian is the only problem.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,760
No one is providing details, which means PR News in Moscow.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,500
As investigators cause deadly havoc in the state of Washington,

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,880
experts are advising there is worrying potential for PR News in the state of Washington.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,980
Put a smile in your smoking.

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,200
A subgenius.

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,280
I rate a slap.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,240
Smoother.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:56,900
Hi, Bob.

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,740
Cooler.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
Cooler.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,780
Check it out.

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,140
Best for you.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,900
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Well, that's too bad.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:07,920
Kill me.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Oh, you don't care.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,620
Go ahead.

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,700
Kill me.

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,020
And now, you must die.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,560
What the hell do you think you're doing?

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:29,480
It should be painfully obvious by now that the world as we know it won't last too damn much longer.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,220
And what are you doing about it?

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,700
Going to work or school?

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,420
Coming home?

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,140
Goofing around?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,500
What's going to happen to your routine when all the...

35
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,920
comes down on us at once?

36
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,620
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,420
No?

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,480
Good.

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,340
The fact is, it's too late.

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,200
There is one damn thing you as an individual can do about eco-disaster, nuclear death, overpopulation,

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,960
and so forth.

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,540
Things are going to hell on a fast train, and about the only thing you, or anyone else

43
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,600
besides the Rockefellers can do about it is to just sit back and watch the show.

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,420
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take a whole lot longer than

45
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,840
you thought.

46
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,900
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything fall apart on TV may be too much

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,820
for even the stoutest brains to take.

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,320
In fact, I'm not sure I can do that.

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,440
The more alert and intelligent you are, the quicker you'll likely be driven to suicide

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,120
by the sheer hideousness of what you'll be seeing.

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,500
Will you be ready?

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,700
Will you still be sane enough to laugh when that which must come to pass comes to pass?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,480
Will you ever get slack?

54
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,780
We are spreading the word of Bob.

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,560
Bob speaks through many of his called ministers.

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,520
And we compile the words of Bob.

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,440
It is now in one location.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,920
I can't say it's easy to read.

59
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,120
But there is a book of the subgenius available at bookstores that aren't run by the conspiracy.

60
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,480
Well, McGraw-Hill never had it so good.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,160
They didn't know what they were getting into.

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
They did not know what they were getting into.

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,340
We managed to get this thing out into the stores before their lawyers ever saw it, praise

64
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,600
Bob.

65
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,760
And we are, it is moving.

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,060
Bob is moving.

67
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,800
You give money to the church and you get your value's worth.

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,260
They have given the church money for this book and whether they like it or not, the

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,900
church is going to make this book a habit.

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:24,220
And so the church of the subgenius offers hope to a disbelieving world.

71
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,460
There is a lot to laugh about here.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,460
But Reverend Ivan Stang says the subgenius message is not to be taken lightly.

73
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,240
People get very upset about cults in general and for a very good reason.

74
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,020
What they tend to forget is that whoever they are, they are in a cult.

75
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,640
America is a cult.

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,880
Because what is the, if Ronald Reagan tells us to make a lot of nuclear weapons, we are

77
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,580
going to waste without giving us a good place to put it.

78
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,560
How is that any different from Jim Jones talking 900 people into committing suicide?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Either way, the cult zombies do what the leader asks.

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,780
And Bob is here, this is the cult that will literally end all cults.

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,940
We do not believe that the end justifies the means, but we believe that Bob justifies the

82
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,520
means because Bob will prevent the end.

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,100
Or at least make sure it happens properly.

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,100
Ivan Stang and David Meyer predict that 1984 will be a big year for the church of the subgenius.

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,480
They say the cult may look weird and shocking today, but a year from now, when the presidential

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,720
campaign heats up and people see the choices they are truly confronted with, they will

87
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,480
run to Bob with open arms as the only sane alternative.

88
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Upcoming revival meetings will be held in Chicago, Austin, Texas, Baltimore, and Minneapolis.

89
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,960
In New York, I'm Tom Vitale for National Public Radio.

90
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:14,820
Two and two are Bob, four and four are Bob, Satan ate my homework, me he is sexting Jehovah

91
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,320
One.

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,860
Two and two are Bob, four and four are Bob, Satan ate my homework, me he is sexting Jehovah

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,140
One.

94
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,140


95
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,140


96
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,040
Donald Trump, beloved by millions.

97
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:31,300
Too frightened and brainwashed, to see that they're being scammed.

98
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:43,440
I've got a big plan, to make some money, huge big big money oh so big big money.

99
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,460
I got a big plan to make some money

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,540
Just give me a chance, at first it might seem funny

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,480
Got me a plow, all kinds of seeds

102
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,600
I'm leaving now, I got everything I need

103
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,700
I bought some land for a tenth of what it's worth

104
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,800
I understand it's the finest dirt on earth

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,780
It's under ice, but the ice won't last

106
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,860
Go ahead, look twice, you'll see it's melting fast

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,880
And my friends, I'm gonna pump green land

108
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,960
And I'm gonna get rich, gonna work my big plan

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,820
For the big brains, bitch, the presidency levels

110
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,220
But what do they do?

111
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,140
They just keep pumping out that CO2

112
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,860
I bet you like eating, but the Midwest just gets drier

113
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,900
Potatoes take a beating when Idaho's on fire

114
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll be the man when the food supply is slipping

115
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,420
I'll gladly meet demand with a modest price

116
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm not growing big cherries, fresh berries, black, straw, and blue

117
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,020
Green beans, pinto, lime, and soy, and kidney too

118
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,140
I grow cotton, fennel, corn, and lentils, garlic, sage, and parsley

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,160
Green tomatoes, sweet potatoes, unspecified beans, and barley

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
And maybe some buck toy

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,740
I'm gonna pump green land, and I'm gonna get rich

122
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,960
Gonna work my big plan for the big brains, bitch

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,560
The dinosaurs, they say it's cool, but what do they do?

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,380
They just keep pumping out that CO2

125
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm gonna pump green land, gonna make a huge profit, and I'm gonna get rich

126
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,420


127
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,420


128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,800
Found, but I've kept our mansion where I live in style

129
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
But I wanted your help to make my dreams come true

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,660
So keep on pumping out that CO2

131
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,600
I'll buy stock in a company that makes a pill for allergies

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,880
Everyone will choke and sneeze on pollen dripping from the trees

133
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,120
Lads and lasses on their knees, all the masses beg us please

134
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,460
Ours will be their one relief once we have killed off all the bees

135
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,500
Climate change is short to pay for those of us who find a way

136
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,520
I'm brainstorming every day to come out on top, come what may

137
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,380
Yo, I just found out yesterday

138
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,420
I got a new job, I got a new job, I got a new job

139
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,420


140
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,420


141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,680
But the zoning board's okay to build on what will be the bay

142
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,140
A beach resort in Santa Fe

143
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Yes, the first oceanfront casino and hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico

144
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,880
Food, fun, and the chance to win big on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean

145
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,260
Ski resorts up in Alaska will close their lips and then

146
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,000
Your granddaughter won't ask you

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Papa, what's up, baby?

148
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,020
But there's still lots to do each year

149
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,540
From spring ride on through winter

150
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,480
Just need a boat and school of gear to visit Epcot Santa

151
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Still charging $21.95 to get in, though

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,840
Now we all know that you like your air-conditioned

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,700
And that's how you travel, go just by sitting there and wishing

154
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,740
Blind gets ocean, keeps it pumping, let's all use them more

155
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,860
Convenience shows, so just be cool, don't listen to our gore

156
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,620
What does he know anyway, man?

157
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,360
I've got my Greenland and I'm gonna get rich

158
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,580
Gonna work my big plan for the big brain bitch

159
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,220
Back when I went greenhouse, ooh, but what do they do?

160
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,220
Ooh, they just keep pumping out that CO2

161
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah, I'm feeling about Greenland

162
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,440
Gonna make a huge pile

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Let the air in my tires drive a thousand miles

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,660
With the fridge door open, whatever I can do

165
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,460
Just keep on pumping out that CO2

166
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm the важy wizard who's toasting to things

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,360


168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,000
With 20 grand in hand, as you all do

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,820
Your friends get Dirt lil period

170
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,980
Waiting in line to 인 transient

171
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,140
Cos creates me raisin'

172
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,900
Woman says, I think you should move to "'Liberia'

173
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,540
Cause you're both just plug-in

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,920
Love it!

195
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,520
I love it!

196
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,360
Forgive me!

197
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,740
Oh, yeah!

198
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,840
Yes, that tape ends that way, friends.

199
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,880
It ends that way,

200
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,060
and this is the way the world ends,

201
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
with sounding like it's cut off,

202
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,400
like the tape ran out all of a sudden.

203
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,760
Maybe.

204
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,700
Neither bang nor whimper.

205
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,500
Oh, yeah?

206
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,440
Oh, yeah, Dr. Sinister is here.

207
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,540
This is our next-to-last show.

208
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,720
Oh, but I should do credits,

209
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,060
because the cowboy should be calling in soon.

210
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,760
Okay, well, we just heard that...

211
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,120
Maybe I'll be able to understand

212
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,700
what he was saying someday,

213
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,920
but that was Reverend...

214
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,040
Reverend Wat D. Falk.

215
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,480
And that weird-sounding version

216
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,200
of All Along the Watchtower in the background,

217
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,380
I played that a couple of shows ago,

218
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,380
and I forgot to give the credit for that.

219
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,940
That was...

220
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,660
Fid Chooley did that mix

221
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,420
of Hendrix and All Along the Watchtower

222
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,920
and California Dreamin'

223
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,920
by the Mamas and the Papas.

224
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,980
Somehow they, I guess, used all the same chords,

225
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,320
and he adjusted the timing a little bit.

226
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,120
Dun-dun-dun-dun.

227
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,320
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

228
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,660
The instrumental before that,

229
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,220
where Reverend Angry Larry yelled,

230
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,300
Snake Eyes!

231
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,140
That's called Snake Eyes

232
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,560
from the Slot Rods' first album.

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,940
We missed them playing in Salem, Ohio, yesterday.

234
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,840
Oh, my.

235
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,100
We couldn't have gone anyway.

236
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,480
No.

237
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,420
All the collages were by Lee Murr,

238
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,180
except at the very beginning, it was by me.

239
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
The spoken word thing,

240
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,120
with the real heavy,

241
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,060
the heavy music was by John Shirley

242
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,280
from his album

243
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,660
Spaceship Landing in a Cemetery.

244
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,780
And it's called Silicon Embrace,

245
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,520
which was the name of one of his books

246
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,160
about aliens.

247
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
He's a science fiction writer,

248
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,000
among other things.

249
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,360
And that book has subgenius character names

250
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,240
all through it.

251
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,240
Silicon Embrace.

252
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,280
Oh, oh!

253
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,100
The song I'm Gonna Fall,

254
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,160
Farm Greenland,

255
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,440
was by the Liberty Tubes.

256
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,660
That's St. Andrew the Impaled's band.

257
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,200
And I had just thrown it into the folder for this week,

258
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,180
just at random.

259
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
I thought, I remembered it being a good song.

260
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,380
I heard it in the car a couple of months ago.

261
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,820
And all of a sudden, it was topical,

262
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,180
extremely topical,

263
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
about making money off Greenland.

264
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,280
Because,

265
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,020
as the,

266
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,260
planet burns,

267
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,700
Greenland will,

268
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,220
it'll be a lot easier to mine

269
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,100
precious materials out of there.

270
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
And infected mammoths.

271
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:51,800
Let's see.

272
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,340
Reverend Wat D. Falk also did that little piece

273
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,600
near the beginning that

274
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,640
was like a Bobby chant

275
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,800
that turns into a Trump chant.

276
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,560
And there was an ancient NPR report

277
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,240
about the book of the subgenius.

278
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,500
From 1984.

279
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,680
And yet, it sounds just like it was done yesterday.

280
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,360
You know, I have a fond memory of a rant you gave once

281
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,940
at a D-Vival where you talked about taking a news holiday.

282
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
You just did a total news blackout for like six months

283
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,580
or a year or something like that.

284
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,880
And you came back and what did you find?

285
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,820
I don't remember.

286
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,800
They were still talking about the exact same stuff.

287
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:37,660
Oh, well, yeah.

288
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,920
Nothing has changed at all.

289
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,500
You look at a newspaper from the 1920s,

290
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,020
it's mostly the same problems.

291
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,420
Mm-hmm.

292
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,840
Yeah.

293
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,880
Except nowadays the Ku Klux Klan,

294
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,680
you know, they've taken off their hoods now.

295
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,680
Oh, no kidding.

296
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,720
Oh, yeah.

297
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,180
They're proud now.

298
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,020
They're announcing their racism proudly.

299
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,400
And many people do.

300
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,900
Many people say so.

301
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,400
Hmm.

302
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,940
Oh, well.

303
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,040
I learned things about my uncles I never knew

304
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,000
until Trump came along.

305
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,360
Well, you know, at least there's still Vermin Supreme.

306
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,700
Vermin Supreme is...

307
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,560
Actually, he told us at Starwood

308
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,980
that he might get the Libertarian nomination.

309
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:22,940
Mm-hmm.

310
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,800
Not that...

311
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,760
It's like, well, I'll swallow my pride.

312
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,620
Was it Libertarian?

313
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:29,820
Yeah.

314
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,320
Yes.

315
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,060
Libertarians.

316
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,340
I still wouldn't vote for him.

317
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:32,980
Well, he...

318
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,620
Well, I would not recommend anyone...

319
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,620
Waste their vote on a third party ever again...

320
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm not going to.

321
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,620
...until the third parties become competitive.

322
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,000
Because right now it honestly is a throwaway.

323
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,900
On the other hand, if I were to throw away my vote,

324
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,080
Vermin would be the first person I'd throw it at.

325
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,560
Just for fun.

326
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
But I don't vote for fun like so many people do.

327
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,040
And I don't vote to make myself feel better.

328
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,520
I really do vote according to what I think is going to be...

329
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,620
the most logical thing for...

330
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,180
I always say, why settle for the lesser of two evils

331
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,020
when you could have all the evil for a fraction of the price?

332
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,500
Right.

333
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,100
And that's why you should vote for Dr. Sinister.

334
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,120
Oh, okay.

335
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,500
Which party are you going to be on?

336
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,660
The subgenius beach party?

337
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,180
The patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist party, of course.

338
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,040
Oh, of course.

339
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,920
I forgot, almost.

340
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,060
Every yard a kingdom.

341
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,600
Every dog a surf.

342
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,800
And every checkbook a queendom.

343
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
We're Second Amendment absolutists.

344
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,260
I believe that I have the right to my own nuclear weapons.

345
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,460
Sure, hey.

346
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,100
And if my neighbor happens to be enriching uranium in his basement,

347
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,000
I have the right to nuke my next door neighbor.

348
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,580
I'll be fine, I'm sure.

349
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,340
Yeah, sure.

350
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,820
Everything will be just fine.

351
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,180
Everything's going to be just fine.

352
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,060
Poor Dave.

353
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,580
I hope he's not having that...

354
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:05,600
Just ducky.

355
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,440
I hope he's not having that problem.

356
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,300
I hope he's not having that problem with his competence.

357
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,000
I hope he's not having that problem either.

358
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,720
Poor Dave.

359
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,940
He said this is medication he has to take for his old ticker.

360
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,360
I think I see the phone ringing.

361
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,280
Hey, Dave.

362
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,460
Hey, Dave.

363
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,560
Oh, no.

364
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,080
Dave.

365
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,040
Dave, are you there?

366
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,560
Dave?

367
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,480
We were worried about you.

368
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,160
We were just talking about your incompetence problems and stuff.

369
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,200
Which...

370
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,920
Well...

371
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,580
I had yesterday.

372
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:44,960
I think it's from these medications which the Lord of Venus and Jupiter have ordained that I...

373
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,620
Actually, it's not.

374
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,180
It's a plot against scientific America, but I'm not allowed to speak of...

375
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,180
Not allowed to talk about it at this moment in time.

376
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,260
No, no.

377
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,560
Let's just leave that alone.

378
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,620
Oh, by the way, Dave, we have...

379
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:58,820
Oh, yeah.

380
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,980
We have...

381
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,600
Well, for one thing, Dr. Sinister is in the house early.

382
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,960
On account of...

383
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,700
This is our second to the last show.

384
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,320
In WCSB.

385
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,380
In the studio.

386
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,760
That we'll do live from here.

387
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,340
Yeah, that we'll do live from the studio.

388
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,400
You know, I don't...

389
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,980
I rented the U-Haul trailer today.

390
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,300
I reserved it.

391
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,440
So...

392
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:33,040
Well, it's important to have reservations about pretty much everything except for moving to Markler or Jupiter or some of the other planets.

393
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,060
What's your problem with the planets tonight, Dave?

394
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,960
Oh, they're aggravating me because my psychic foam number.

395
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Get it?

396
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,640
My foam number.

397
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,760
You know, the kind of the foamy...

398
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,880
Quantum psychic foam number?

399
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah, exactly.

400
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,620
The tiny micro, micro, micro particles that you rub into your follicles.

401
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Well, yeah, that's what the Avengers used to travel back in time, back and forth in time.

402
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,100
Yeah, but the original Avengers was dying and rigged.

403
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,060
It was looking mighty hot.

404
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,080
And a pair of underpants.

405
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,420
Oh, my God, Dave.

406
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,140
Princess, we and I were watching this popular show called Got.

407
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,960
Oh, yes.

408
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,820
And you get to see Emma Peel all grown up.

409
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,800
Oh, my...

410
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,340
Yeah, we watched a couple episodes and the end credits, it said Diana Rigg.

411
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,920
And I was going, I didn't see Diana Rigg in there.

412
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,320
And I looked up the casting and it was this horrible looking old woman.

413
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,100
It's amazing what time does to people.

414
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,180
Well, she's only...

415
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,520
She's only about 10 years older than me.

416
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,120
She looks beautiful just the way she did.

417
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,080
She's 53 as far as I...

418
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,200
She's just old, that's all.

419
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,920
Indian holes?

420
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,500
Well, maybe if she wore the black leather and some makeup or something.

421
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,900
But in Game of Thrones, she...

422
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,420
Oh, man.

423
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,800
She did...

424
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,660
I didn't recognize her at all.

425
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,660
Well...

426
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,800
You know why you should never buy a mattress from a Lannister?

427
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,200
No, why should you never buy a mattress from a Lannister?

428
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,520
They just put two twins together and call it a king.

429
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,040
I'll get it.

430
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,180
But if you like...

431
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,160
If that king were to the age of 70, he would turn into something like Trump.

432
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,840
We're going to make Westeros great again.

433
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,020
We're going to build the wall.

434
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,520
We're going to make the white walkers pay for it.

435
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,860
We only...

436
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,060
We only managed to...

437
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:23,440
You know, it's fantasy because Trump would never build a wall to keep out anything white.

438
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,340
Oh, you know that.

439
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,280
No kidding.

440
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,260
Yeah, right.

441
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,680
Why don't we get some more white walkers for immigrants?

442
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,520
We could get to...

443
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,660
Now, we'd like to have immigration from the north of the wall.

444
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,820
They're white.

445
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,180
Did you know...

446
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,180


447
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,180


448
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,180


449
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,180


450
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,160
Did you know that Hitler, one of Hitler's favorite campaign slogans in the early days was,

451
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,640
Make Germany great again?

452
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,160
Oh, yeah.

453
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,160
I think I just...

454
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,500
Well, you know, in the Subgenius movie, you see Ronald Reagan saying that phrase.

455
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,240
Ich allein.

456
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,760
Make America great again.

457
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,220
Ich allein.

458
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,000
Trump ripped it off.

459
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,400
They came out with new hats today, by the way, made in China.

460
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,700
Oh, really?

461
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,800
Yes, that say, keep America great.

462
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,580
Do they have little, like, propeller beans on top?

463
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,180
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,400
They...

465
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,900
Keep...

466
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,000
Keep...

467
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
The little propellers on top?

468
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,620
Yes.

469
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,700
They say, keep America great again?

470
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,900
No, they say, keep America great.

471
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,120
Great.

472
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,060
As if somehow it got great in the last three years.

473
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Actually, surveys say that Americans are more dissatisfied and scared about the future than ever before.

474
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,540
And for more...

475
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,240
Actually, there are more of them...

476
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,160
You know...

477
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,200
It's that the...

478
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,980
This time, it's the Democrats...

479
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,040
It's the Democrats that are the angry ones.

480
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,400
Four years ago, it was more angry Republicans, you see.

481
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,580
And watch them snatch defeat from the jaws of victory again.

482
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,180
Vote for Dr. Sinister.

483
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,060
I think, very frankly, I think it's not worth comparing anything in right now,

484
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,580
psycho-politically, because they're both wacko.

485
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,860
I heard somebody attacking Bernie Sanders today on the radio for doing some kind of what appeared to be a public...

486
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,620
Welfare type of thing.

487
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,260
Something good for everybody that would be cheap and paid for by the government.

488
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:22,460
And this same person was saying that utilities like nuclear power plants should be subsidized by the government.

489
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,560
The taxpayers should pay the money because they're not really making any money.

490
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:32,520
And that means we're a good thing because we're not making money so we can charge people more.

491
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,620
You know what I mean?

492
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,880
Everybody knows that the purpose of...

493
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:36,960
You know what I mean?

494
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,460
The purpose of government is to make the rich richer and the powerful more powerful.

495
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,840
It is a plutocracy, my friend.

496
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,900
It is a plutocracy.

497
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,880
That's the only way you can put it.

498
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,340
Run by Molly, Molly, Molly.

499
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,560
It's not to protect the little guy against the big guy.

500
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,040
It's to make sure that the big guy is protected against all those other little guys out there who want a piece of that.

501
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,800
Oh, it's a moot point.

502
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,280
In 20 years, there won't be any oxygen left to speak of.

503
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,940
Everybody will die rich and poor alive.

504
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:04,600
Woohoo!

505
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,340
What do you mean there won't be any oxygen?

506
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,940
You're talking about like the root canals and the very, very special tire burnings and stuff going on in the Amazon jungle area?

507
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:14,460
Mm-hmm.

509
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:23,140
It's a bad, bad time to have the entire jungle that supplies 20% of the oxygen for the planet go away.

510
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,600
What about the Fukushima-inspired...

511
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,400
Fukushima.

512
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,000
And the horse you rode it on.

513
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,860
And the government, or not the government, but the Russian Navy.

514
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,480
The little accident in the Arctic Circle, or whatever they're calling it.

515
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,040
Is that a real event, or did I...

516
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,740
Did I...

517
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,060
Sorry.

518
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,940
I don't think anybody knows for sure what the story is with that.

519
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,300
It might have been some kind of a weapons test that went very wrong.

520
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,700
If it was a weapon, they weren't supposed to be testing.

521
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,320
Supposedly a nuclear-powered rocket.

522
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,440
Oh.

523
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,840
Not a nuclear-powered rocket.

524
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,380
Not just a nuclear missile, but a missile that is powered by a nuclear reactor.

525
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,780
That's a really brilliant idea, you know?

526
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,120
Well, if you do it right.

527
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,280
Put lots more nuclear fuel in the air, I suppose.

528
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,420
My favorite idea is launching a nuclear warhead from a rail gun.

529
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
That way it's not a missile at all.

530
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
People have talked seriously about...

531
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,260
No rockets.

532
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,160
...using giant spaceships that are powered by...

533
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,660
...atom bombs going off in the backside of them

534
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,320
to approach the speed of light or go as fast, as close to them as possible.

535
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,340
Trump asked some of these people at a science conference

536
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:48,400
while he had a little visit there to the Big Eight and stuff like that.

537
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,540
He said, could the weather be influenced?

538
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,580
Could we stop hurricanes by using nuclear weapons?

539
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:02,920
And they thought he was maybe not really worthy of the occupation.

540
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:10,540
I picked up an old F.A.I.T. magazine from 1990

541
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,720
that had a big cover article about Tesla's death ray.

542
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:24,200
And Nikola Tesla had been trying to get backing

543
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:30,320
for these various energy-creating projects of his.

544
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,900
His stuff was all about transshipment.

545
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,020
Transmitting electricity, electric power, through the air, through the ground.

546
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,760
And he kept trying to tell investors and the government

547
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,380
that he had a weapon, that he could make a weapon

548
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,360
that would decimate a vast area anywhere in the world

549
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,300
without any visible delivery system.

550
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,960
It involved using the magnetic fields and resonance of the planet itself.

551
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,260
And...

552
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
Well, planet Earth.

553
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:10,960
He was kind of losing it around the time the Tunguska explosion happened.

554
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,280
But a couple of years later, he claimed he had...

555
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,860
Like the watermelon truck exploding.

556
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,240
There's a slight possibility that Tesla...

557
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,540
Let's see, Perry was trying to reach the North Pole at that time.

558
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,980
And it's possible that Tesla wanted to get attention

559
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,480
by proving he could blow up some uninhabited area.

560
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,900
And Perry had...

561
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,560
He hadn't come real close to the pole yet.

562
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,660
So he thought, well, I'll try my weapon at the North Pole.

563
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,660
But he overshot and it hit Siberia

564
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
and killed thousands of reindeer

565
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:50,540
and reindeer herding people who look kind of like Native Americans.

566
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,700
And that's a theory.

567
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,020
That's a theory, of course.

568
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,940
Native Siberians.

569
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,920
There was no crater from a meteor hitting Tunguska.

570
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:02,800
Tunguska.

571
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,060
The official theory is that it was a chunk of a comet

572
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,940
that exploded in the atmosphere above the area.

573
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,380
Why do these comets always go to Russia?

574
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
Like, I've never heard of a comet landing...

575
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,440
It's a big...

576
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,340
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

577
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Well, they don't land...

578
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,460
If they land in the ocean, which is most of the planet, or was...

579
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,800
Or, no, I guess it'll be again.

580
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,160
Still is.

581
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,520
70%?

582
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,100
Yeah, it'll be 75% pretty soon.

583
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,800
There's something true about...

584
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,660
The flow that cannot sink into the ocean fast enough.

585
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,220
Well...

586
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,140
I chased an asteroid one time.

587
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,760
I saw it coming down.

588
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,780
He's an old asteroid chaser.

589
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,600
And I went down as close...

590
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,480
I tried to get as close as I could to from where I was.

591
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,920
And it was like,

592
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,840
man, this thing is going to come down right on top of my car, you know?

593
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,000
And it didn't.

594
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,720
And it went to my left.

595
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,180
And so I took the first left.

596
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,400
I thought I at least would smell something or see something.

597
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,020
Smell something, say something.

598
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,260
You mean a meteor.

599
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,640
Say something, exactly.

600
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,280
Safety.

601
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,120
A meteor, not a...

602
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,560
Not a...

603
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:07,900
An asteroid.

604
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,100
Just be careful it's not the horse's asteroid.

605
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,000
Right.

606
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,460
Yep.

607
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,680
Dave, he's a chaser.

608
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,480
He's a chaser.

609
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,480
He's an asteroid chaser, all right.

610
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:17,860
I know.

611
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,080
Oh, yeah, I've got something...

612
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I've got something I saved to play on this show so that you could hear it, Dave, and comment on it.

613
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,020
I told you last week in great...

614
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,140
Great...

615
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:38,040
Excitement about this movie that used to be called Scarlet Love.

616
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,800
It was made in Dallas by this guy named Palmer Rocky.

617
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,240
And I saw it at the one theater, the one weekend.

618
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:55,240
It was shown for one week because he booked this theater, paid for it, at big ads in the paper.

619
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,740
And something about the ads made me think, I better not miss this.

620
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,740
It was so bad.

621
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,220
That it made Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick, I think I said last week.

622
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,460
I was thinking it was like Plan 9.

623
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,840
Well, I pursued...

624
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,940
He lived not somewhere in my neighborhood and had a post office box in the same post office as me.

625
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:25,980
And I would see him standing in there reading mail loudly so people walking in could hear him.

626
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,940
And he'd say things like, this one's from Hollywood.

627
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
I'm a filmmaker.

628
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,220
They're going to be...

629
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm sure they want my film.

630
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,280
Scarlet Love, 666.

631
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:43,540
But I tried to get him to talk to me about putting it in the midnight movie circuit.

632
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,200
This was in the late 70s.

633
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,820
There were no...

634
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,620
You couldn't even rent a video.

635
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:56,400
What did you do with the movie so bad that stoners would laugh to the point of heart attacks?

636
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,980
It was so funny.

637
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,660
Inadvertently funny.

638
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,060
He advertised it.

639
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,560
It was a suspense movie the first couple of days.

640
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,060
But then he changed it to entertaining comedy when he saw people laughing hysterically.

641
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,040
Especially the most serious parts.

642
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,360
Springtime for Hitler, yeah.

643
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,800
Something like...

644
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,240
Well, this guy, he worked on it for something like 12 years.

645
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,640
He swore...

646
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,860
The last I heard from him, he told me he had burned all copies of it and no one would ever see it.

647
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,100
I later heard from guys at a lab in L.A. that he didn't burn it.

648
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,360
He was renting this theater in a lab, a projection booth, so he could look at the movie and take notes.

649
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,060
He was still trying to perfect it years later.

650
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,240
Then he died.

651
00:38:49,820 --> 00:39:00,420
After the 13-year Lutensweiner, the Lutelalucha, the Kampf und Kampf, a struggle for 13 years.

652
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,940
And he was...

653
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,520
He was kicked soundly in the Rebound and Gorn area, at least on Tuesday.

654
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,980
Which was when most of that kind of work was done by the Soviet Empire.

655
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:16,420
Well, the movie has been changed.

656
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,520
The title is now Love is Deep Inside.

657
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,120
And I was privileged enough to see a trailer for it.

658
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,900
And it is indeed the same movie that was once called Scarlet Love.

659
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:39,980
The trailer consists of two shots with some words, cutaways to little title cards.

660
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,940
The first shot is Palmer Rocky playing one of the five parts he plays in the movie.

661
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,680
Ranting about the marked underdogs and the conspiracy.

662
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,380
I'm going to play that for you.

663
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,460
It's about two minutes long.

664
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,000
That's the first shot.

665
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,220
It's just one shot.

666
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,540
He's standing in Turtle Creek in Dallas.

667
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,560
He's looking off screen and just hollering.

668
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,720
The second shot is him dancing to his own music.

669
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,160
His own singing.

670
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,300
In a t-shirt and boxers and socks.

671
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:22,400
Trying to seduce a young woman who obviously didn't know what she was getting into.

672
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,460
And it's played for laughs a little bit.

673
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,220
Although he ends up grabbing her and forcing her, kissing her.

674
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,440
Anyway, I'm going to play you.

675
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:38,740
Now, the rant from Love is Deep Inside, originally called Scarlet Love.

676
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,740
Hey, you scarlet guards, I'm talking to you.

677
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,880
I'm not talking to those trees.

678
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,140
I'm talking to you creeps hiding behind them with your walkie-talkies,

679
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,400
listening and spying to everything I do.

680
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,240
I know what class you're in.

681
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,820
The same class of creeps who take away a man's freedom.

682
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,300
Coarse creeps who laugh at tenderness and kindness and good things

683
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,020
like a high school student's ambition, a college student's dedication.

684
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,500
You freaks who abuse people and use them.

685
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,960
Freaks and creeps like phony lawyers, phony psychiatrists, arrogant bankers

686
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,100
and creepy leaders who violate human rights all over the world.

687
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,900
Look, here I am, Bruce, wide open, your target.

688
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,840
I know you're setting me up to take me down and cut me down

689
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,700
just because I can't figure out your plan, your misleading Francis and my girl

690
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,280
and making them think I've got something to do with you.

691
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,280


692
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,320
I know you've got something to do with Jackie's death,

693
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,700
but I haven't got a thing to do with them at all.

694
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,100
And I'm not running away.

695
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,600
I don't care what you do.

696
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,520
I know I'm a marked underdog, but I don't need you

697
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,900
and all the marked underdogs all over the world don't need your kind.

698
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,100
We don't.

699
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,660
Now you think just because you're pushing us and you kill some of us,

700
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,000
the rest of us will just run.

701
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,820
We're going to fight.

702
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,720
We're not going to give up.

703
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,340
You fight and we will fight.

704
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,780
You knock us down, we'll get up.

705
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,180
You knock us down a second time, we'll get up.

706
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
We're not throwing in the towel.

707
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,400
Your leader has a fight on his hands.

708
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,480
Sure, you're having your hour, but we're going to have our day.

709
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,640
And you're not going to stamp out the spirit of truth.

710
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:16,220
How can you escape the day when you will fry in your filthy corruption?

711
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,280
You crawling, creeping hypocrites.

712
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,720
Hypocrites.

713
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,940
That's what I'm calling you.

714
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,940
Crawling, creeping hypocrites.

715
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,240
That's all right, baby.

716
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,600
It's very clear.

717
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,000
That's all right, baby.

718
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,060
Love is here.

719
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,420
That's all right, baby.

720
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,640
Have a fear.

721
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,880
Baby, I'll come over tonight.

722
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm going to feel all right.

723
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,880
I'm not going to dream and cry.

724
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,720
I'm not going to feel all the time.

725
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,520
Everything's going to dry tonight.

726
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,520
That's Palmer Rocky himself singing in the background from his album,

727
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,260
Scarlet.

728
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


729
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:07,620
Love, which you see in his room in the dance scene, this scene.

730
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,280
Yes.

731
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,980
I have that album.

732
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,060
He was handing it out at the theater for free.

733
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,200
And it's one of the few LP records that I kept.

734
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,020
It's in Texas now in storage.

735
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,960
Everything else, all the ordinary records we have are at

736
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,840
Weardsville Records in Detroit.

737
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,360
But yeah, good Palmer Rocky.

738
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,540
What a weird thing.

739
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,120
I used to date his sister, Rosie.

740
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,640
Yeah, it's session musicians that he just hired and said,

741
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,100
give me a beat, you know, give me a beat and a tune and I'll sing to it.

742
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,620
Give me a strong, strong fall for dancing.

743
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:53,860
Yeah.

744
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,160
It's interesting.

745
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,180
He did pay.

746
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,320
I knew a lot of people who worked on the movie on,

747
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,420
on and off, and he always paid him in cash.

748
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,100
So there's that.

749
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Oh, it was very influential on us.

750
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,780
In the end credits, the movie said,

751
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:20,180
produced by Palmer Rocky, Nana and Nunu.

752
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,800
Well, Nana Nunu.

753
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:28,600
When we saw those names, they became gods.

754
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,940
Goddesses in the subgenius pantheon.

755
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:40,160
The Nunu is this elderly woman goddess thing that's intensely sexual, but so old.

756
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,920
And yeah, Nunu and Nana, those were based.

757
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,120
Nunu, Manos, Lomos.

758
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,700
Those are the Italian words for grandma and grandpa.

759
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,140
Nunu.

760
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,240
That's what I figured.

761
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,100
I figured that his, his, his grandma gave him money.

762
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:57,980
Nunu and Nana.

763
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,140
And that's why it's produced.

764
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,240
By Palmer and Nana and Nunu.

765
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,220
You know, that means granny and grandpappy.

766
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,140
Wow.

767
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,900
Now here's some other news for you, Dave, and you'll, you might actually like this.

768
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,540
I discovered, well,

769
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,520
What task was I supposedly just supposed to have completed?

770
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:26,600
I thought I was given a treat, you know, treatise on the filibuster of the extenuating circumstances

771
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,340
surrounding the night of the third.

772
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:28,640
Yeah.

773
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,000
At least we were talking about something that didn't make any sense to anybody.

774
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,780
But didn't you change the subject now and try and make them make less sense?

775
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,360
Oh yeah, I'm changing the subject.

776
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,020
There's this, it's reviews of the Hour of Slack I never saw before.

777
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,980
Apparently on an Apple podcast, you can leave reviews of things.

778
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,140
I, of course, never listened to the show.

779
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,440
Well...

780
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,420
Apple podcast, but

781
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,440
this company called

782
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,080
Chartable, that's chartable.com

783
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,540
trying to sell me something

784
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,720
said, hey, look, if you sign up with us

785
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,760
you can get regular records of your

786
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,220
ratings on the internet.

787
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,440
And

788
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,780
we have

789
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,760
okay, our Slack has an

790
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,100
average rating

791
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,020
of 4.9 out of 5.

792
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,340
It's almost, we write it almost perfect.

793
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,080
And it's generally

794
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,360
about the one thousandth

795
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,960
most popular

796
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,840
podcast.

797
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,940
Considering I believe that.

798
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,580
That's saying something.

799
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,040
But here's some

800
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,420
reviews. The subgenius

801
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,920
hour of Slack has been produced for nearly

802
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,940
35 years, and if you listen back

803
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,960
through the early days up until now,

804
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,200
you'll hear people on the bleeding edge

805
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,080
of the foundations of modern

806
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,200
internet culture.

807
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,280
A weird, eccentric,

808
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
fabulous, funny,

809
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,060
important slice of goodness.

810
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,440
Stay weird, praise Bob.

811
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,220
Let's see.

812
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,180
Candy

813
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,260
fun, happy time hour

814
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,840
shoes.

815
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,360
Still going strong.

816
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,920
Best show ever.

817
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,120
And that's somebody in Great Britain

818
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,280
in 2016.

819
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,560
When it had already

820
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,540
devolved into just us talking.

821
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,360
Mostly.

822
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,680
Seriously, this is

823
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,380
amazing. Somebody in Australia.

824
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,440
Seriously, this is amazing.

825
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,480
Sometimes I crackle like a,

826
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,480
I cackle like a super

827
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,980
villain.

828
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,660
Oh, that's my easy.

829
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,320
And here I'll

830
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,900
leave it at this.

831
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,120
About time I found something

832
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,920
that's actually worth listening to.

833
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,980
Loads of these on

834
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,940
here going back to 2007.

835
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,760
Thanks

836
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,900
podcast for brightening

837
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,900
this dull part of the world, even

838
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,520
if it is just my ears.

839
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,240
And that was in Great Britain.

840
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,180
Also.

841
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,380
Wow.

842
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,100
Reminds you of the day of the pod people or the

843
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,140
day of yours.

844
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,300
That were wrong, though. That goes back to

845
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,520
the shows you can hear actually

846
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,860
go back to 1985.

847
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,440
You can hear all

848
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,160
1,742

849
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,720
of

850
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,480
them on the internet

851
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,440
if you look at subgenius.com.

852
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,620
It's funny, I actually date the foundation of my

853
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,240
own secret society to 1985.

854
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,300
Not kidding.

855
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,340
I was four years old.

856
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,080
It was March 31st, 1985.

857
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,940
Was it the Church of the Marked Underdog?

858
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,580
No.

859
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,500
I was too young to understand

860
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,740
these subtleties of the world, but at

861
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,200
the age of four on March 31st,

862
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,300
1985, I decided I'm

863
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,820
starting my secret society right now.

864
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,340
Wow.

865
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,580
Well, doctors, doctors,

866
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,960
so cautious was secret, right?

867
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,260
You got you got to read my book.

868
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,180
Got it.

869
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,360
I let it out.

870
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,180
I let it out.

871
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,660
Oh, man.

872
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,600
What was I thinking?

873
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,600
Did you read my book?

874
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,460
Now we know.

875
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,760
Now everyone knows.

876
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,080
Did you read my book, Neighbor World?

877
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,380
You know, Dave, I have not had the opportunity.

878
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,860
I have not even seen a copy of your book.

879
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,000
Might I find it in my public library?

880
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,400
The Church of the Subgenius has it.

881
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,040
Amazon has it.

882
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,160
It's got a bunch of good reviews.

883
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,100
I'm kind of like you in a lot of ways.

884
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,360
I'm low tech.

885
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,140
I don't shop online.

886
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,700
Let me guess.

887
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,300
You actually do shop online, don't you?

888
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,660
Like you do business online?

889
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,380
I don't.

890
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,600
I should just bring Dr.

891
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,080
Sinister a copy of Neighbor World.

892
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,540
Yes.

893
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,100
I'm sure you could purchase one directly from Reverend Stang, or he may just give you one.

894
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,180
I would gladly purchase one directly from Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

895
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
And you can't.

896
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,080
Don't do that.

897
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,060
Don't do that.

898
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,960
You'll never get it.

899
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,160
He doesn't have any copies.

900
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,120
One of these days, I'm going to go all the way out to the Ashtabula Oblong Bar.

901
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


902
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


903
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:54,120


904
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,120
I'm going to bring him down here to the studio.

905
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,000
Hey, don't be talking about people's brain parts.

906
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:11,480
That could be like offensively designed in cooperation with a number of actual brain parts.

907
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
Offensively designed?

908
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,500
But you know what else is not too far from the Ashtabula Oblong Bar is Connie.

909
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,340
Or Connie ought to be.

910
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,480
Oh, yeah.

911
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,880
Connie ought to be.

912
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:23,880


913
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,100
I'm going to bring him down here to the studio.

914
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,100


915
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,100


916
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,100


917
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,260
That's Connie ought to be, yes.

918
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,280
That's a funny Northern Ohio joke.

919
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,260
Do you know who's named after Keith Conniett who was genocided by the borderers?

920
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,960
They used to call them the people who lived on the borders of Pennsylvania and Ohio back

921
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,680
in before it was a state in the 1790s.

922
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:43,780
I believe that.

923
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,820
They'd be having fun with Indians one night, and the next night they'd come over, the Indians,

924
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,520
they'd be making them some food and they'd shoot them.

925
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,260
You know what I mean?

926
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, that's no fun.

927
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,580
That's a crazy question.

928
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,080
That's the man.

929
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,200
I'm sorry.

930
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,240
I'm not an Anglo-Saxon for you.

931
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,960
Well, it kind of is true.

932
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,360
You know, they blinded the Britain's male babies back in the early days of Alpha D.

933
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,300
Not so great.

934
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,640
Hmm.

935
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,200
Hmm.

936
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,900
Shameful stain is upon our national conscience and history.

937
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,640
Indeed.

938
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,880
I'm sorry to be so depressing.

939
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:21,680
Well, you know, every time there's a shameful stain, you could at least make a joke about

940
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,100
it, like...

941
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,060
Oh, no.

942
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,000
I know what's coming.

943
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:26,440
Yeah.

944
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:32,260
Like making a joke about if you publicly stain your underwear on the bus, everybody

945
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,580
could hear and see you.

946
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:38,340
You know, my doctor asked for urine, semen, and stool samples.

947
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,340
I said, I'm in a hurry.

948
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,160
Just take my underwear.

949
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,460
That's not funny.

950
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,280
No, it's not.

951
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,340
They're talking to a couple of 60-somethings, Dr. Sunster.

952
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,280
Not funny at all.

953
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,040
Well, what's even less funny is the fact that a 30-something can actually see you.

954
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


955
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


956
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


957
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


958
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


959
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


960
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


961
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


962
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


963
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


964
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


965
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


966
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,040


967
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,960
You know, I don't want to say that, honestly.

968
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,340
Yeah, but can you guys do actual petroglyphs?

969
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:02,240
I do like whole, like, Anasazi runes and stuff like that.

970
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,380
Hey, I've got something that'll make my friends feel really old.

971
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,740
My son turned 40 last week.

972
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,160
Oh, no.

973
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,960
My little boy turned 40.

974
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,160
Little baby boy.

975
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:15,900
Yeah.

976
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:17,740
Yeah.

977
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,040
Not so big of a little small baby anymore right now.

978
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,940
And you can see his mood.

979
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:24,020
I mean, he's got a lot of energy.

980
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


981
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


982
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


983
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


984
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


985
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:24,020


986
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,720
He's got energy to do with his Open Source friends.

987
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,260
The feeling that all of them are gone.

988
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:49,680
Oh, so at the end of the day, those Add Me To Comedy kind of women are the different

989
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,000
things with Adam Ayers.

990
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,240
They just hang around the Anna, uh...

991
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,160
It's interesting he battered me because I brought you to my house with you.

992
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,320
I know.

993
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,800
I want to meet this son of yours one of these days.

994
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,060
He's in Dallas now.

995
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,100
We have a nice guest room down in Glen Rose.

996
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,820
Yes, you'll have to come visit us in Texas.

997
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,140
I have friends in Texas,

998
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,080
and family members of friends there, too,

999
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,520
who might want to go down to visit.

1000
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,300
I don't know, like, it's a huge, huge swath of land there,

1001
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,100
although it's smaller than most Australian states.

1002
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,120
Texas?

1003
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,140
Yes, it is smaller than most Australian states.

1004
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,120
Really? Yes.

1005
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:25,920
Hmm.

1006
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,300
Western Australia, New South Wales.

1007
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,980
The whole continent divided into, like, ten states.

1008
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,040
It's roughly the size of France.

1009
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,320
Yep, and Germany is roughly the size of Montana.

1010
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:41,940
So there you go.

1011
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,680
And it's 1,000 miles away,

1012
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,660
and we have to drive there, dragging a gigantic,

1013
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,900
12-foot-long trailer.

1014
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,220
I'm a braver man than I am.

1015
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,980
I was studying how hints for...

1016
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,280
You have to take your bicycle out there.

1017
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,040
You'd be in some real trouble staying.

1018
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,520
You had to ride a bicycle all the way back to Texas

1019
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,940
in the middle of the fall rains

1020
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,120
for the early winter discovery plant thing.

1021
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,120
Well, all I know is that the time's coming soon.

1022
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,140
Soon, soon, soon.

1023
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,620
This is the next-to-last time that we'll be doing this show

1024
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,780
from WCSB, as far as I know.

1025
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm planning to keep doing the show,

1026
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,140
just like we did the last several winters,

1027
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,420
from my living room.

1028
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,120
But it isn't quite the same, and we don't get to see...

1029
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,460
I'll call in to Dr. Sinister's show.

1030
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,820
It's earlier in the evening in Texas.

1031
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,800
That's right. It starts at 9 o'clock.

1032
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,120
Yeah, but you're next to him.

1033
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,240
Where?

1034
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,420
In the living room there.

1035
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,160
10, 9 Central.

1036
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,740
There are dogs in the background

1037
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,120
and things like that that you can never have here,

1038
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,720
so it's a whole different thing.

1039
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,720
Yeah, and there's dog food, too,

1040
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:01,060
and everybody's being served their own favorite,

1041
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,660
fanciful, new numbers.

1042
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,000
I wanna be turned into dog food when I die.

1043
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,460
I gotta tell a real quick story of something

1044
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,600
that our escape artist dog buddy did yesterday.

1045
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,340
Man.

1046
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,060
We had some carpenters,

1047
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,100
We had some carpenters,

1048
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:18,100


1049
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,320
fixing the windows in my third floor office.

1050
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,240
They had the windows off.

1051
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,460
Suddenly, with them in the room,

1052
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,780
Buddy, the small hound dog,

1053
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,360
leaped out a third-story window

1054
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,620
and landed on the sub,

1055
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:39,740
kind of the second floor porch roof,

1056
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,780
about eight to 10 feet below.

1057
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,100
And it's a slanting, you know, peaked, little porch.

1058
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,300
And it's a slanting, you know, peaked, little porch.

1059
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,900
And he didn't break any bones.

1060
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,800
He had a tiny spot of blood on his chin.

1061
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,440
That's it.

1062
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,780
Well, the smaller an animal is,

1063
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,680
the easier it is to survive a steep fall.

1064
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,080
I was standing at the bottom of the stairs.

1065
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,460
We had been joking.

1066
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,720
Like, if he was a little boy,

1067
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,720
he'd be at the developmental services agency

1068
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,320
with his mom right now.

1069
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,620
And he'd be talking about some things they can do.

1070
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,300
I wasn't there.

1071
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,780
There's no way we can make things better.

1072
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,220
The workers freaked out and started screaming.

1073
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,760
And Princess Wee ran to the second floor

1074
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,060
and opened a window, removed the screen,

1075
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,160
and had to use the Pappy voice to get Buddy to come to her.

1076
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,720
Because he was having such a great time

1077
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,260
running back and forth on this little roof.

1078
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,580
He would dash off to the edge

1079
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,460
and then dash off to the other edge,

1080
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,440
scaring me each time

1081
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,540
until I finally just had to use the Pappy voice.

1082
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,900
That's the only way to get him.

1083
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,420
Can you do the Pappy voice for us now?

1084
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:49,560
That actually works.

1085
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,140
Yeah.

1086
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,640
Can you do the Pappy voice for us now, Princess Wee?

1087
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,280
Yeah, and the Mammy voice, don't forget.

1088
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:54,880
Buddy!

1089
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,000
Do!

1090
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,360
Now!

1091
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,420
That's the Pappy voice.

1092
00:56:59,340 --> 00:56:59,580
Wow.

1093
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,940
It's me.

1094
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,920
You just pegged the auto volume thing.

1095
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,680
That's the Pappy voice.

1096
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,140
Yeah.

1097
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,220
Yeah, I was standing at the bottom of the stairs,

1098
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,560
and I heard three carpenters go,

1099
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,580
Oh, my God!

1100
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,980
Oh, my God!

1101
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,740
Oh, my God!

1102
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,760
And these three grown men are flipping out.

1103
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,020
Well, the thing is, we've been joking that Claudia,

1104
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,980
Claudia had gone up there and kind of looked at it.

1105
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,620
I said, I'm pretty sure she's got enough sense

1106
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,580
not to jump down there.

1107
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,340
She wouldn't jump off that tree she climbed into every,

1108
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,000
those three times.

1109
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,140
Buddy is a nut.

1110
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,940
Circus dog.

1111
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:36,940
Certifiable nut.

1112
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,460
Anyway, this show actually started a couple of minutes early.

1113
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,340
And Dave, we're going to stay here in the studio

1114
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,460
for another hour and be on Dr. Sinister's show.

1115
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,740
Oh, that's right.

1116
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,120
So you should call back.

1117
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,380
Should he call back in?

1118
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:52,860
Absolutely.

1119
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,200
Call back in about seven or eight minutes.

1120
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:57,560
Okay?

1121
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,140
Okay.

1122
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,580
Probably closer to 10 minutes.

1123
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:01,340
Yeah.

1124
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,320
Whatever gives you time to, you know, do your, you know.

1125
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,480
Dave, my math finds a way.

1126
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,440
Your Dave thing.

1127
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,320
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack

1128
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:14,340
from the Church of the Subgenius broadcast.

1129
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,880
Broadcast from EBCC.

1130
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,220
Oh, I have to remove that part or reverse it

1131
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,780
for the other stations.

1132
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,280
There's five other stations that play it.

1133
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:34,300
This is B-C, I'm sorry, this is B-S-C-W, DNA level C.

1134
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there you go.

1135
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,360
That's the station.

1136
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,320
Okay, Dave, we'll talk to you in 10 or so.

1137
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,660
Okay, okay.

1138
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,540
There he goes.

1139
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,760
He's a pretty good boy.

1140
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,340
Good boy.

1141
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,200
Oh, we've been listening to Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1142
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:02,240
which disco, all instrumentals, mostly by the great Chaz Smith

1143
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,420
and Dave and Michelle George, who played violin on that stuff

1144
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,240
and probably Bob Mosick on drums.

1145
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,820
Probably.

1146
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,180
If there are any drums on this.

1147
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,700
So, now, Godzilla!

1148
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,600
Say again, over.

1149
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,120
Run.

1150
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:20,720
Go!

1151
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:25,960
Hit the deck!

1152
00:59:43,180 --> 01:00:13,180


1153
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:43,180


1154
01:00:43,180 --> 01:01:13,180


1155
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,940
Un Sept infraredP

1156
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:31,460
Frame 180.

1157
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,700
We're losing visual, Admiral.

1158
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,320
He's diving.

1159
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,480
Changing course and moving fast.

1160
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,780
I've got him at 33 knots and picking up speed.

1161
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,260
He's going to outrun us, sir.

1162
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,220
From PR News in Washington,

1163
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:00,600
I'm listed as a sexually violent Pennsylvania Cosby.

1164
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,860
Under Pennsylvania law, a sexual violent Cosby

1165
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,940
is someone with a, quote, mental PR news.

1166
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,120
The Trump will provide 12 billion farmers.

1167
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,960
The 12 billion farmers came from a comedian being gunned.

1168
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,240
PR has been tough on President Trump's meeting

1169
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,980
with Russian President Vladimir Korea,

1170
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,880
buying new faggots.

1171
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,060
Defense says it's premature to talk about Russian PR news.

1172
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,520
Department of the Question.

1173
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,940
The Dow is 158-2522.

1174
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:33,820
Newly released internal emails from the administration show.

1175
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,760
This is PR News.

1176
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,620
Worth.

1177
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,720
Los Angeles police confirmed the bullet is charged with PR News in Washington.
