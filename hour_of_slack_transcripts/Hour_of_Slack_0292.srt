1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
And, uh...

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,120
Let's just try this one.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,340
The future is no longer in your imagination.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,580
The airwaves form over a decade.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,020
The power of hot K-N-O-N.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,020
In, in, in, in!

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,040
Up loud!

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,580
Wow-wow-wow!

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,360
The windshield!

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,520
Ah, yes.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,840
Sounds so purty.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,600
Cartridge there from the other show.

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,760
And how come we're not hearing...

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,040
There we go.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,160
Ah, yes, dear friends.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,540
Just settle back.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,120
Everything will be okay.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
A-okay.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,600
In no time.

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,420
Just you wait and see.

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,300
I think it'll be okay.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,800
I had a bad omen a little while ago.

23
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll have to go.

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,080
I'll tell you about that.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
Ha ha ha ha!

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,340
Ha ha ha ha!

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,300
Ah!

28
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:31,960
Ah!

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,140
Ah!

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,660
Yep.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,480
The subgenius is back.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,900
It's the subgenius.

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,020
Ha ha ha ha!

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,020
Ah!

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,380
Ah!

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,700
Ah!

37
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,860
Ha ha ha ha!

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:49,940


39
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,640
Fellas, we need to find out what this, the Black Lodge, has to do with that.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
The subgenius.

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,420
The subgenius.

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,600
Hour of Slack!

43
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,860
You wouldn't believe there's a connection.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,280
Ah!

45
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,900
Windham Earl does, Harry.

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
The subgenius.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,700
The subgenius.

48
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,580
Ah!

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,280


50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:28,860
I have not and will not accept or receive any reimbursement or payment in cash or in kind for any station announcement or programming.

51
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:43,440
I understand that I am allowed to accept up to two concert or performance tickets and one promotional copy of a record, tape or CD, but not all three configurations of the same recording.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:56,040
If it helps me to better prepare and present my program, I understand and agree to abide by that policy, the above policy.

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,860
Thank you.

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,020
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

55
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,460
Yes, dear friend.

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,280
Ah!

57
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,420
And we have a little guest here today, as I speak, with an unknown name.

58
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


59
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


60
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


61
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


62
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


63
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


65
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


66
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:13,420


67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,700
switch tapes around.

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,220
Young Sivit.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,740
Sivit Stang is here.

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,280
Sivit, did you have something to say?

71
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,260
Happy Father's Day to you poor fathers out there.

72
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,520
Oh, what a sweet statement of intent

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,140
and no conflict of interest whatsoever here, dear friends.

74
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,200
Well, tonight in part three of the subgenius show,

75
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,980
radio ministry hour of slack show,

76
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,720
we will present a part three,

77
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,560
the Sterno expeditions of 91,

78
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,140
the Tevonian victories in the Glen of Roses,

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,260
the ball in San Frismo,

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,100
the capture of Stang,

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,640
his escape and syndication at the Battle of Lili Jing,

82
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,780
the College of Euhipus revolt,

83
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,980
and the ancient spirits

84
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,640
of the years,

85
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,600
of the pities,

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
of the spirits sinister and ironic,

87
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,640
the spirit of rumor in battle

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,100
with the recording angels and the rest.

89
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,760
But simply a mental performance.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,440
The show is now recorded in a vast domed shaped room,

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,380
allowing for application of the Horatian formula

92
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,320
et pictura poesis in a spray can motif.

93
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,220
The figures are created in a rocket away

94
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,240
interocitor container MK4 out on the street

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,220
and can be transported anywhere through the air.

96
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,940
Listeners are reminded to wear

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,960
mopper gloves,

98
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,100
and to wear a mask.

99
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,600
The show is broadcast in the number four systems

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
when the show is broadcasting.

101
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,920
Films of safety stand down drills at 0500.

102
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,500
No writing.

103
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,900
It says puzzling evidence.

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,440
Ah yes, dear friends.

105
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,140
The Church of the Subgenius, a parody of weird cults,

106
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,340
has some 3,000 devoted members who have bought

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,320
thousands of pamphlets, stickers, cassettes, and t-shirts,

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,780
all bearing the trademark of Bob's smiling face

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,400
with a pipe stuck in his mouth.

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:31,960
No?

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,040
Good.

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,100
The fact is, it's too late.

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,900
Everybody says I'm paranoid.

115
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,320
They all think I'm crazy.

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,900
They all smile to my face.

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,000
But they'd like to see me die.

118
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,880
And to attain this lack of Bob,

119
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,660
a subgenius must fight a vast and powerful conspiracy,

120
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,080
what Pope Meyer calls the pinks.

121
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,280
Pink is sort of that ruddy glow in the cheeks you see on people

122
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,240
who want to sell you something you don't really need,

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,680
who want to take away that which means the most to you

124
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,760
and give it back to you

125
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,620
for a profit.

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,860
Now, who has come along to save us from this conspiracy?

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,820
This conspiracy that will feed you this trash?

128
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,740
It's Bob.

129
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,520
It's the human condition.

130
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,980
It's things falling apart.

131
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,340
It's fat ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

132
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,800
Because you have the sensitivity to understand,

133
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,740
I offer you more than your wildest dreams.

134
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,700
You'll become the mother of a new race of gods.

135
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,000
You'll inspire the universe.

136
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,120
I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again.

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,220
I can give life or death.

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,300
What else does mankind demand of its gods?

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,860
Mankind has no need for gods.

140
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,160
Hey, what's going on here?

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,440
He has a robot.

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,320
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack,

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:07,740
Bob's

144
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:07,740


145
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:07,740


146
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,460
and a conspiracy of pinks,

147
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,720
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,260
According to church doctrine,

149
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
on July 5th, 1998,

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,020
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

151
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,460
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

152
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,280
Did you hear what he was saying?

153
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,900
What we know, sir,

154
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,460
none but the whole thing is war.

155
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,880
Yeah!

156
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,080
Oh, what you perceive,

157
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,560
oh, oh, oh, oh,

158
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,200
is not a lonely force to use.

159
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh,

160
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,820
And so the Church of the Subgenius offers hope to a disbelieving world.

161
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,080
There is a lot to laugh about here,

162
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,240
but Reverend Ivan Stang says the subgenius message is not to be taken lightly.

163
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,000
There you go.

164
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,140
Cultivate evil for the sake of evil, nothing else.

165
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,260
They express themselves in darkness,

166
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
or darkness without leavening motive.

167
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,180
Now, this ardent purity allows them to access a secret place

168
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,860
where the cultivation of evil proceeds in exponential fashion,

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,860
and with it, the furtherance of evil's resulting power.

170
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,320
This place of power is tangible,

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,820
and as such, it can be found, entered, and perhaps utilized

172
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,220
in some fashion.

173
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,120
You don't believe me, do you?

174
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,960
You think I'm mad?

175
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Overworked?

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,240
Go away.

177
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,380
I was kind of worried about Dallas.

178
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,020
It was the so-called hotbed of birchism.

179
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,040
And it just seemed if there was any place in Texas where we'd have trouble,

180
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,200
we would have trouble there.

181
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,260
They say the cult may look weird,

182
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
and shocking today,

183
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,820
but a year from now,

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,940
when the presidential campaign heats up,

185
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,220
and people see the choices they're truly confronted with,

186
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
they will run to Bob with open arms

187
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,020
as the only sane alternative.

188
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,380
Upcoming revival meetings will be held in Chicago,

189
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,500
Austin, Texas, Baltimore, and Minneapolis.

190
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,940
Oh, and there's one of those upcoming revival meetings

191
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,280
heard in the background right now.

192
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,820
Ooh, looks like a messy one.

193
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,240
Yeah, they're a lot of fun, friends.

194
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,280
Actually, those revival meetings will not be held in Minneapolis

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,580
or any of those other places,

196
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
but I thought that would be a good place to tell you

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,860
that there are some upcoming revival meetings,

198
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,740
none of them around here.

199
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,140
Upcoming subgenius events include the Big X Day party

200
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,340
in Austin, Texas, on July 5th,

201
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,660
and we'll be talking about that in more detail

202
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,280
with Pastor Buck Naked next week.

203
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,000
So set your calendars.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,260
X Day, every X Day, July 5th,

205
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,180
there's a party in Austin that I can't go to

206
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,440
because on July 5th, my family tries to stay above the earth

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,920
in airplanes or something,

208
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,420
and this July 5th, when that party's going on,

209
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,340
we'll be landing in Asuncion, Paraguay,

210
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,820
if things go according to schedule,

211
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,160
on our way to the Green Hell outpost.

212
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,400
We'll be landing in the northwest of Dobstown,

213
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,400
Dobstown 2 in the Amazonian jungles.

214
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,740
There will be a subgenius revival of some kind

215
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,020
at the Fantasy Fair,

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,420
Dallas Park Plaza Hotel downtown,

217
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,900
on July 20th,

218
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,940
July 20th, Fantasy Fair,

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,800
and, well, I'm going to be,

220
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,220
we're going to be flying around over Asuncion, Paraguay again

221
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,420
at that exact moment, I just found out,

222
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,140
but I'm sure we'll show the finished subgenius

223
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,720
MTV video and so forth,

224
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,680
and we'll think of something,

225
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
you don't need Reverend Stang to have a D-vival.

226
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,260
And then, of course, in July 26th,

227
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,860
the Starwood Pagan Naked Witches Wildness thing

228
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,900
in Sherman, New York.

229
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,280
For information, those of you with tape recorders

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,120
can call 216-932-5421,

231
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,760
and in November, I'm not sure when,

232
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,020
the Phenomicon in Atlanta, Georgia,

233
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,360
starring yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang

234
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,900
and Pope Bob Anton Wilson.

235
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
And dear friends, you know, there's three,

236
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,560
three count them, radio shows that people in the Bay,

237
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,120
three subgenius radio shows that people in the Bay Area

238
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
can now listen to.

239
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,820
And, in fact, they, two of them are on at the same time.

240
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,440
Doesn't that just figure?

241
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,740
There's Father Joe Mama's show at KZHU,

242
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,420
Stanford, Sunday at, well, actually,

243
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,500
The Hour of Slack, who are listeners in Stanford, California,

244
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,740
plays Sunday at midnight, KZHU at Stanford.

245
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,880
And, of course, you can get up at 4.30 in the morning,

246
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,080
in Berkeley, and listen to KPFA, Saturdays,

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,860
4.30 in the morning, the show.

248
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,260
And the new one, KZHU, the subgenius show,

249
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,860
once again, Saturday mornings, 4 a.m.

250
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,620
on KHSU, 90.5 FM, for those of you far, far away.

251
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,500
And that's the way it is.

252
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,940
Here again.

253
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

254
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,900
I'm part of the state

255
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,580
Stood against the decree

256
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,480
I knew it, thought I'd keep

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,140
I can't do this to see you sicker

258
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,860
I'm sick of all

259
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,180
I'm sick and sick and sick and sick and sick and sick and sick and sick of all

260
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,060
Don't call me Steve.

261
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,340
Don't.

262
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,420
Is that my show?

263
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:55,880
Stupid me.

264
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,200
Oh, we need a, yes, we need new side beat coming up here.

265
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
I forgot to, uh, over here.

266
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,860
Hey, some more show, man.

267
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,980
Hey, some more show.

268
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,520
Okay, now we're marching the little show ant troops around.

269
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:05,960
Here we go.

270
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,780
Yeah, we're the camp followers.

271
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,280
Come on, it's only 618.

272
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,000
You just getting up for work Monday morning?

273
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,240
Watch my show while I go out for a minute.

274
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,060
Oh, it won't go anywhere.

275
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,760
Anyway, I went out there.

276
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,200
Sure enough, the cats had a big old rat out there.

277
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,720
They were just like a field rat.

278
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,160
It was easy.

279
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,540
So, uh, I didn't want it eating that rat.

280
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,300
Then when the rat ate the cat.

281
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,860
I just picked up the rat up by the tail and I walked up the house.

282
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,980
And I took the burp.

283
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,020
And that sucker was working about 5,000 RPM.

284
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,040
And he just bedded down through there getting courage.

285
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
While I was holding on to the tail.

286
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,360
And the old burp just went off and off and off and off.

287
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,960
And I just beat up the little old ant.

288
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,440
And the old dethrone, he was just sinking.

289
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,900
He was vibrating up and down.

290
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,820
And I was like jumping about 25% dethrone.

291
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,720
I thought I was going back.

292
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,740
First met up with him back in the con TN myself.

293
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,680
Big as puppies.

294
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,480
And they had no fear.

295
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,080
Not a death.

296
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,900
Nothing.

297
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,940
Because the VC, we learn them with a hot meal.

298
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,900
Now, do you have any idea what a VC rat is?

299
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,000
Try raw American whole mayo.

300
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,080
Thank you.

301
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,100
Come.

302
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,540
This way.

303
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,920
Serve enough meal.

304
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,540
Real nice and fancy.

305
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,340
They do stick one of our boys to the ground.

306
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,160
Through his hands.

307
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,940
Through his feet they do.

308
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,520
Stick him.

309
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,160
Like Jesus.

310
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,380
Then they make the cut just above the abdomen.

311
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,000
Now, this wasn't a fatal cut.

312
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,300
This is merely an intro.

313
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,580
Then they get a rat.

314
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,120
A real hungry rat.

315
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,960
One they haven't been feeding for about a week.

316
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,120
And they do it.

317
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,960
And they stick his nose down inside.

318
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,020
And if the damn thing wasn't starving enough.

319
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,220
They cover it with a flaming rice bone.

320
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,280
Let me tell you.

321
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,040
That gray black son of a bitch would have nowhere else to go but inside.

322
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,440
And he starts turning his way through looking to come into that loud deep sound.

323
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,400
And then.

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,040
And then.

325
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


326
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


327
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


328
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


329
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


330
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


331
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,100


332
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,920
I saw that thing he see.

333
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,240
Ow.

334
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,260
That little goat.

335
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,260


336
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,260


337
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,260


338
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,120
This is my old town association.

339
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


340
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


341
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


342
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


343
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


344
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


345
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,120


346
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,480
This city.

347
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,200
I haven't seen it.

348
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,360
I don't think I've seen this anywhere.

349
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,360


350
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,220
Just hold on.

351
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,700
Hold on.

352
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:20,700


353
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,160
Oh, that's the way it is.

354
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,160


355
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,160


356
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,440
Just dig into the room.

357
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,440


358
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:23,860
And, uh.

359
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,240
Anybody close the door, Frank.

360
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,960
Not me.

361
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,080
There's some music from Reverend Zoot Allors.

362
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,500
Pretty music here.

363
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,840
Listen in headphones, please.

384
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,460
Because when I listen to it, I get a headache.

385
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,160
My show? Your own dad's show gives you a headache?

386
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,780
Why? How come?

387
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,960
Because you're my daddy.

388
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,680
I see. Figures.

389
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,860
Yeah. That's my girl.

390
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:26,480
And may all your Christmas is be well.

391
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:57,560
That there was this cabal of men who had been working together at least since 1960

392
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:05,160
when they had put together a group to assassinate Fidel Castro and Raul Castro

393
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,300
and that they were engaged in criminal operations against Cuba

394
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,840
and then in 1965 were the same group of guys involved in criminal operations

395
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:13,840


396
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,720
in Laos and Cambodia and Thailand, involved in narcotics smuggling to get funds

397
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,480
to fund things that Congress wasn't approving.

398
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,020
That was one of the original reactions of the liberal community

399
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,400
is that this was outrageous to be suggesting that there had been this long-term conspiracy

400
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,240
of just a small group of men doing these similar things over and over again.

401
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,840
And one of the areas that got a lot of attention...

402
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,960
...the entire adult life, as a matter of fact, behind the veil of national security...

403
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,040
...I remember my oath of allegiance, Roy, was not to shred documents.

404
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,920
It wasn't to lie before the U.S. Congress.

405
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,120
It wasn't to cover up my boss's wrongdoings.

406
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,300
My oath of allegiance was the United States of America

407
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,220
and to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

408
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,700
A lot of people, including, I believe, Oliver North,

409
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,340
if he would have remembered his oath of allegiance,

410
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
might have gone back...

411
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,380
...and done it differently than he did.

412
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,700
I have been a soldier all my adult life.

413
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,980
All I've ever wanted to do was wear the uniform of the United States.

414
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
And I've done so proudly and successfully.

415
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,640
But it doesn't mean that I'm dumb.

416
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,120
I may have been born in the dark, but I wasn't born yesterday.

417
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:40,260
When my country is beset with a sickness,

418
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,820
as a human body might be with a cancer,

419
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,700
then I think there's a duty to excise it.

420
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,360
And the very fact is that America is in more trouble right now

421
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,240
than it ever has been during World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War.

422
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,780
And it's a time for real patriots, real warriors, to come out and be valiant

423
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,860
and take a stand before we wake up someday, Roy,

424
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,160
and try to figure out who stole America.

425
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,360
There are only three kinds of people that I've found in this world.

426
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,220
Some who wait for things to happen,

427
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,200
a whole bunch who wonder what happened,

428
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,780
and a few who make things happen.

429
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,900
Theodore Shackley, who went on to become the director of corporate operations for George Bush,

430
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,340
when Bush was the director of the CIA,

431
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,300
that this man had been the CIA station chief in Laos,

432
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,360
and had been working with Richard Secord and Jack Singaloud,

433
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,660
and the same group of men,

434
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,820
and that they had been involved in

435
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,680
thwarting a major opium trafficker by the name of Van Pao,

436
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,780
a member of the Hmong tribe,

437
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,240
and that they were working with him smuggling opium,

438
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,580
and that funds from a portion of the profits from this opium smuggling

439
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,380
was being used to finance the training of a political assassination group

440
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,600
within the Hmong tribe directed against the Pathet Lao.

441
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,960
There's no such thing as national security right now.

442
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,200
The most important thing is,

443
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,560
we're not keeping secrets from the Russians.

444
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,120
We've got Mikhail Gorbachev as our man of the decade.

445
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,320
We're keeping secrets from the American people.

446
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,380
And any time that you've got a country where men are above the law,

447
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
you have a tyranny.

448
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,000
And we have been admonished to watch out for things like that

449
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
by great patriots such as Thomas Jefferson.

450
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,660
So I'm doing my duty right now.

451
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,700
I'm doing guard duty for America.

452
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,120
I'm here to let you know what's going on.

453
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,840
I'm not here to save anybody.

454
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,000
The battles are going to be fought individually.

455
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,280
And collectively.

456
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,920
A lot of the people listening, Roy,

457
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,780
will probably figure,

458
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,200
oh gosh, my arms aren't long enough to reach around this problem.

459
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,520
I'm a little person.

460
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
My voice can't be heard in Washington, D.C.

461
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,020
But together, things happen.

462
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,680
And you can't say that small groups of people

463
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,460
don't cause things to happen,

464
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,920
because when you look back in history,

465
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,460
that's exactly who causes things to happen.

466
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,820
It was a minority that took over this nation from Great Britain.

467
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,320
It'll be a minority that sustains the Constitution and this nation,

468
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,580
I think, in the peril we face today.

469
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,060
The United States military in Vietnam was a secret Nazi military.

470
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,380
And the Vietnamese freedom fighters and Viet Cong and the communists

471
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,200
defeated these secret Nazi military people over in Vietnam.

472
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,360
And kept South Vietnam and North Vietnam from coming under the secret Nazi control

473
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,200
by the United States of America and the West.

474
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,580
If you can't join the Communist Party

475
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,460
in fighting the underground,

476
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,740
for freedom and democracy,

477
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,880
to rule the world,

478
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,720
and defeat secret Nazi and open Nazi dictatorships on Earth,

479
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,180
and to keep those plans all the way,

480
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,440
then this is Radio Moscow on your shortwave radio.

481
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,820
Keep in touch with Radio Moscow.

482
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,680
That's where the truth comes from,

483
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,060
is Radio Moscow and other communist countries.

484
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,660
But mainly Radio Moscow is the radio you want to listen to

485
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,640
to get information about what's happening around the world

486
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,160
and the truth about what's going on around the world.

487
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,800
Now they're operating on that singer.

488
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,180
If I have to witness this one more time, I think I'll...

489
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,980
See this stuff.

490
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:38,980


491
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:38,980


492
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,520
One of these mornings

493
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,800
Yeah, don't show us The Witness any one more time.

494
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,580
Bob comes creepin' in the loo

495
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,940
And remove the entire top of the grave

496
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,600
One of these mornings

497
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,140
Okay, now we're taking the top of the head off.

498
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,400
Don't let her confirm that.

499
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,220
Oh, I fainted

500
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,940
in my secular incision in the Durach Matar

501
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,960
Durach Matar? It doesn't matter?

502
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,400
You're right.

503
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,660
One of these mornings

504
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,280
Old man Bob comes creepin' in the loo

505
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,460
me

506
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:34,080
now if that isn't scary what is creeping down the drain

507
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,460
oh

508
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,160
attention tension between right and left show

509
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,760
show's over let's go

510
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,140

the goal post of life

523
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,680
reach or clean

524
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,600
the

525
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:12,680
the

526
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,720
the

527
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,760
the

528
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,040
the

529
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,640
the

530
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:24,900
the

531
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:24,900


532
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,460
chain edge go ahead hey mike thanks for calling one has to admire what you're trying to do

533
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,980
because if we could ever get a large body of

534
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,380
people to agree on anything uh the world would certainly be a better place

535
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,680
but if you know your history and i know you do about the early church there's always been dissension

536
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:54,000
the disciples of jesus descended with paul in his version of of the message of jesus

537
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,200
and uh when the church finally did get power one of the first things it did was started to

538
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,080
persecute those that didn't agree with the authority i'm afraid that that as long as we have

539
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,260
as long as we're able to think freely uh we're going to have different points of view and different interpretations

540
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:17,960
i know something they don't know i know something young dale merely suspects

00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,520
the dead rather like the kali worshipers in india another fine bunch of zanies i can tell you

545
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,920
blood for breakfast blood for lunch

546
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,600
those were the good old days that kind of nonsense has always been going on

547
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,860
so um again i think that that you're fighting against human nature here unless you're willing

548
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:04,220
to have a kind of almost like total mind control where people are fed a dogma and they can't deviate

549
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,060
from that and they're attached to something that's really not their own they're not their

550
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,500
taught that from childhood and not allowed to think beyond that,

551
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,500
but even that has proven not to work.

552
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,060
Well, yeah, it would depend.

553
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,280
The only way I'd be for total mind control

554
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,140
is to establish the fact that the mind that we're thinking with is Jesus.

555
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
If we are thinking with a mind of pride.

556
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,580
Here.

557
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,320
Dropkick me, Jesus, through the goalpost of life

558
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,420
Hand over hand, neither left nor right

559
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,900
Straight through the heart of the righteous of Christ

560
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,260
Dropkick me, Jesus, through the goalpost of life

561
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:50,800
Hey, every apostle of Christ was a dreadlocked bearded man

562
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,400
Every apostle of Christ was a dreadlocked Ethiopian

563
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,980
This is a message to all church and denomination

564
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,560
Respect is due to be dreaded as the man

565
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,200
Because you've never seen the image of a fallen Jesus yet

566
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,040
Hey, I have never seen the image of a fallen Jesus yet

567
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,920
I have never seen the image of a fallen Jesus yet

568
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,700
He is a cold and dreadlocked Nazarene man

569
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,960
Look in yourselves and trust me, Jesus, that you are not alone in this world.

570
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,440
I do understand why you've never seen the image of a fallen Jesus yet

571
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,160
Oh, yes

572
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,180
By the old time religion

573
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:46,540
By the old time religion

574
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,900
By the old time religion

575
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,280
Because it is good enough, all right

576
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,620
If it was good for Moses and David

577
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,200
If it was good for David and Solomon

578
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,400
And, yeah

579
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,960
Shedrach, Meshach, and Abednego

580
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:02,960


581
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,700
And, yeah, I'm not going to be a Christian

582
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,420
All right, guys

583
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,100
Now, if you can somehow get Christians to think about those things

584
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,540
And stop thinking about, you know, these other crazy nonsense things

585
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,100
That really don't have very much to do

586
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,620
I think that you're going to find a little more success

587
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,020
Than trying to get everybody to agree about doctrines

588
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,600
All right, man, thank you much

589
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,340
So what's the point, Bob?

590
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,480
The point is that people have always been afraid

591
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
And the governments have always been afraid of that

592
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,020
And the governments have always been afraid of that

593
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,020


594
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,200
And the governments have always been afraid of that

595
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,200


596
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,260
When you have the kind of big governments in the world

597
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,500
Like we do today with nuclear weapons

598
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,100
People ought to be afraid

599
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,360
And it's really only sensible

600
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,920
Bob

601
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,620
Some kind of action

602
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,300
Bob

603
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,460
You know, I'm not sure her prediction is going to come true or not

604
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,640
Bob, in 1977, she was saying

605
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,480
Stockpile gold and silver, the end is coming

606
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,200
Yeah, well, hey, so

607
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,980
Let it, let it

608
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,220
Get out Pat Robertson about this kind of stuff

609
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,940
Pat Robertson, get off Pat Robertson

610
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,340
What's Pat Robertson got to do?

611
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:02,680
You want to start judging?

612
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,060
Pat Robertson isn't

613
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,300
Pat Robertson isn't

614
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,380
Pat Robertson is not building bomb shelters

615
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,340
Pat Robertson isn't channeling demons

616
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,000
He'd like to cast a few out

617
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,560
How do you know he's not channeling demons?

618
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,740
Oh, give me a break

619
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,520
The man professes faith in Christ

620
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,480
And his evangelical testimony at Witness and Theology

621
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,540
You know the Bible a lot better than me

622
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,320
And you surely ought to know

623
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,500
That the devil can quote Scripture pretty well

624
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,640
Oh, get off

625
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,420
What are you?

626
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,960
Are you a prophet?

627
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,780
Dropkick me, Jesus

628
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,940
Don't post a post

629
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:32,940


630
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,300
I'm going to bite

631
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,820
Oh, make me, oh make me, Lord

632
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,600
More than I have

633
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,720
Make me your master game plan

634
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,680
Free from the earth with a tentacled chin below

635
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,900
I've got the will, Lord, if you've got the toe

636
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh, yes, dear friends, a beautiful sequence there.

637
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,940
Dropkick me, Jesus, on the ground.

638
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:02,940


639
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,420
Kick Me Jesus, of course, by the Wheeler Dealers,

640
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,780
including Brother Cleve Duncan on the accordion there.

641
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:21,940
Before that, Reverend D. Lee Lama on Bob, Bob, Bob Larson's show.

642
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,700
And happy Father's Day to D. Lee Lama there and Alexandra Eileen.

643
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,660
And I've got a new tape that sort of applies to the subject matter

644
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,820
by a band called The Uninvited, Mick Maldonado and The Uninvited.

645
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,040
Yes.

646
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,680
The Uninvited

647
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
The Uninvited

648
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:27,520
The Uninvited

649
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,680
The Uninvited

650
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:27,680
The Uninvited

651
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
The Uninvited

652
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:27,680
The Uninvited

653
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:57,680
The Uninvited

654
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:27,680
The Uninvited

655
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:57,680
The Uninvited

656
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:27,680
The Uninvited

657
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:57,680
The Uninvited

658
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,680
This show just fits in this plastic bag, see?

659
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,040
Plastic bag.

660
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,140
They take some tap water and just pour it in the bag,

661
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,520
and they stick your little goldfish in there.

662
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,800
You could get, the same place you get the goldfish,

663
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,200
you could buy little ducks and little rabbits.

664
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,580
You could buy another,

665
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,960
what I really liked was the little turtles that they painted the backs.

666
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,620
They'd paint the backs, and they'd paint them like different colors,

667
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,520
and nobody knew at the time that it caused a long, slow, painful death

668
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,800
to those turtles to paint their backs that way.

669
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,660
They would have to grow with the paint on their backs,

670
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,840
and the little shells, little plates of their shell couldn't expand properly,

671
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,440
causing unbelievably intense pain over the duration of their entire life.

672
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,920
But that was just secondary to the enjoyment that the little child got

673
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,320
from witnessing the struggle for life

674
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,420
that that small little reptilian creature,

675
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,180
exhibited.

676
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,780
It began innocuously enough with three days of mind-blowing procedural debate

677
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,200
and query readings of committee reports,

678
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,160
like most conventions, all about as interesting as a mole on the Pope's behind.

679
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,880
But at the end of the third day,

680
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,060
the First International Congress of the Church of the Subgenius

681
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:12,360
erupted into a full-fledged riot over the forced resignation of Church Leader Reverend Ivan Stang,

682
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,420
involved in the recent no-sex scandal,

683
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,640
the cult violence which left over 35 dead and scores more injured or missing,

684
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,180
lasted over 36 hours.

685
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,820
Well, we finally got rid of that guy.

686
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,240
I was glad about that.

687
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,540
None of the dead or injured belonged to the Church.

688
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,600
When interviewed about this, several old men stated...

689
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:30,880
What's that?

690
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,860
How did you get rid of that Ivan Stang guy?

691
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,160
Well, it took a combination of perseverance, power, personal power,

692
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,080
and...

693
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,580
Poison oak?

694
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,360
Poison oak.

695
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,700
Yeah, we actually took poison oak.

696
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,720
We tortured it.

697
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,920
We have unique out first signs

698
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,600
that this reality is not real.

699
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,600
It's just a matter of time before it's unravelling.

700
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,480
Like if the chair you're sitting on suddenly dissolves.

701
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,260
Odds are it wasn't beamed up to the ship like on Star Trek.

702
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,920
It's your reality falling apart at the edges.

703
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,980
And there's nothing you can do about it.

704
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,400
You might as well just enjoy it.

705
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,100
Reality will collapse.

706
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,580
And then there are advantages to reality collapsing.

707
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,200
If your job is part of your reality and it collapses,

708
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,260
well, hey, you don't need to go to work.

709
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,940
Won't need to pay your electric bill.

710
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,280
If the whole power company is just a figment of your imagination.

711
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,180
Don't even have to brush your teeth.

712
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,420
Your teeth are imaginary too, as well as those nasty germs.

713
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,820
So if you find yourself in a disembodied void,

714
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,520
surrounded by color and light,

715
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,580
and nothing around you makes any sense,

716
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,940
take advantage of it.

717
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,820
Could be fun.

718
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,760
So,

719
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,260
I'm not going to be the one to tell you

720
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,260


721
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,260


722
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:26,620
how to create the super- stewardess of the Makluks Reading Ladder,

723
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:26,680
is it?

724
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:28,860
I'm going to be

725
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,080
an abominable lover of仇,

726
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,020
who will make relations with seven werewolves.

727
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,120
Reflecting on those mistakes you stole from archaeology civilization,

728
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,980
I'llrudely present theolinus with my final vision of male middle child,

729
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,980
the ark of Kabbi's last life.

730
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:51,240
How do I put that here?

739
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,020

740
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,580
uh

741
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:59,820
america's religious education contradictory surveys find new york puzzles and peculiarities

742
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:05,840
abound in information turned up by surveys of religious conditions in america like these

743
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:12,120
quirks most people say they read the bible regularly but are uncertain about its features

744
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,980
for example fewer than half know who delivered the sermon on the mount

745
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,800
jesus did for you

746
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,020
thisy

747
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,700
is creed

748
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,180
making clear the difference between egyptian

749
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:25,560
delivery is crypto

750
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,340
is spreading the false call and greater

751
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,340


752
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,340


753
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:26,700
color

754
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,000
and the

755
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,280
弊

756
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:37,980
cancer

757
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,380
cook

758
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,020
in your house

759
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,440
loo

760
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:47,080
Easter, but a fourth of them don't know what Easter signifies. It signifies the

761
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:54,200
escape by Jesus on UFOs. Despite churchly laments about moral relativism and a

762
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,620
loss of the sense of right and wrong, 85% of Americans agree that there are clear

763
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:05,660
moral guidelines of what's good or evil that apply to everyone. Three-fourths

764
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:15,140
believe in heaven, and most think they're going there. I bet you do. 60% believe in

765
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:24,260
hell, but only 4% see much chance of getting there. Oh, that's what they all say. These are

766
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,820
among curiosities found in recent surveys by the Gallup Organization, usually of

767
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,480
about 1,200 adults, and summarized by its Princeton religious reader. Figures

768
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,520
collected through nationwide

769
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,680
telephone interviews for 13 months have found that 86.5% of the population is

770
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,900
Christian and 1.8% is Jewish. Where variety showed up was in the many kinds

771
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,300
of Christians, the denominational diversity that historically has

772
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,880
typified the United States. In the survey, 75% said they had no religion. No, I'm

773
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:04,760
sorry, friends, this is important. 7.5% of Americans said they had no religion.

774
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,360
And that's the only thing that's important.

775
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:15,120
And 2.2% declined to identify their religion. And friends, that 2.2%, that's us and half

776
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,100
of the Jews. In the recent Gallup surveys, 82% of Americans said they believe the Bible

777
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,980
is either the literal or inspired word of God, and more than half said they read the

778
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,820
Bible at least monthly. But half could not name any of the four gospels of the New Testament,

779
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,500
which are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Take a look.

780
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:35,500


781
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:35,500


782
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,820
Take notes, kids. The other half could name at least one. Well, what does this tell you,

783
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:52,780
friends, that half of them are really dumb? But on the other hand, who killed Will Frazier?

784
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:59,940
The subgenius movement was Will Frazier's entire life and his consuming passion for 15 years.

785
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,220
From the time he was a teenager, he hungrily immersed himself in Bob

786
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Bob's occultism. Satan was pleased. By the age of 30, an uncanny sequence of dramatic

787
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,800
events had propelled the brilliant Will of Dobbs into a meteoric rise to international

788
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,600
renown as an expert in crystal powers and subgenius religion.

789
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,640
Will Frazier had two acclaimed books published by one of America's largest publishers. His

790
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,280
subgenius work was featured on TV's 2020. He was able to write his own ticket on the

791
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
National Lecture Circuit.

792
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,600
As a famous star on the subgenius scene, he was riding high. But one day, unexpectedly,

793
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:47,760
a dark and hideous force entered Will Frazier's life. Overpowered, he was sucked into an incredible

794
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,620
vortex of unimaginable evil and blackness. In desperation, Will cried out,

795
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,940
Jesus help me, and from that moment, Will Frazier's life changed totally.

796
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,260
Saved from doom above the grace of God inside the subgenius world.

797
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,260


798
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,260


799
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,260


800
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,260


801
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,260


802
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:10,280
nightmare is Will Frazier's revealing expose of what the subgenius really stands for. Here is the

803
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,780
church of the subgenius in all its meanness and brutality, the deceptive plan to murder and

804
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,760
eliminate Christians, the scheme to usher in an occult messiah, and the plot to demonize every man,

805
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:28,320
woman, and child, and much, much more. Just days before this book was released, Will Frazier was

806
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:36,340
found dead. The police report states only that his car veered mysteriously off a 300-foot cliff

807
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:47,120
into the rocky valley below. Yes, dear friends, a frightening, frightening thing, but, but you know,

808
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,520
you can, you can get away from it, friends. You can get away from it by doing this.

809
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,320
Write for free information on the church of the subgenius.

810
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,220
Yeah, that's right.

811
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,020
You just drop us a postcard. It's easy. And say on the postcard,

812
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,520
oh, dear Bob, send me free information. And that number to write to is, of course,

813
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:28,140
Bob at post office box 140306. That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214. Yeah. And that's 75214.

814
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,540
That's what this book is all about.

815
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:33,720
Free information from the church of the subgenius, whose radio show you have been listening to.

816
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,960
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang. This is the subgenius radio ministry,

817
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,040
our slack, and, and, and...

818
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:48,900
This is the swinging love corpses in the background. Please stay tuned.

819
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,160
I'm

820
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,540
I'm

821
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,640
I'm

822
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,180
I'm

823
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,460
I'm

824
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:54,500
I'm

825
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,300
I'm

826
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:55,300


827
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,380
I'm

828
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,820
I'm

829
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:56,820


830
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,400
I'm

831
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:57,400


832
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:57,460
I'm

833
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,920
¶¶

834
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,200
¶¶

835
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,200
And this is Mojo Nixon coming home to take us out.

836
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,620
Yeah.

837
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,780
Yeah.

838
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,580
I saw Al and Arby's.

839
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,760
I saw Moses at McDonald's.

840
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,460
I saw the Ram-A-Lam-A from Alabama at the barbecue pit on University.

841
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,160
Gee, I saw, I saw, I saw Buddha at a Burger King.

842
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,940
I saw Joey at a Jack in the Box.

843
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,980
I just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just can't stop, yeah.

844
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,640
I saw Mother Mary at a Roberto's on El Cajon.

845
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,260
Man, I'm in a twat.

846
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,960
So, so, so, so.

847
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,220
And there I was.

848
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,860
I woke up and I was kind of standing.

849
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,980
I was kind of someplace.

850
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,280
Out where the, out where the interstates turn to dirt.

851
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,780
Out past the fire roads.

852
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,240
Out past Route 140.

853
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,060
Down, down where the train trestles go over the graveyard.

854
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,980
Back behind the dynamo.

855
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,020
Back beside Route 140.

856
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,360
Yeah, I'm still out by Otah Lakes Road.

857
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:51,060
Underneath the water tower.

858
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,180
I got a thousand.

859
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,580
Why, why, why, why, why the power?

860
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,260
Yeah.

861
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:56,660
Yeah.

862
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,440
I was in a fine.

863
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,220
You know, when Jesus walks up to me and he says, Mojo.

864
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,160
Mojo, I'm going to take you to some place you need to be.

865
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,720
And I said, I said, take me Jesus.

866
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,820
And Jesus took me.

867
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,340
There we were.

868
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,540
I looked around.

869
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,280
I looked around and all I saw was couches.

870
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,520
Everywhere I looked I saw couches.

871
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:23,180
Not the kind you want to sit on, but the kind you want to, the kind you want to sleep on, you know.

872
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,820
And it was like these bonfires and big cauldrons on top of them.

873
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,700
With generic yellow label, Top Ramen just boiling away.

874
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,020
Boiling away, way, way, way.

875
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:33,800
It was going everywhere.

876
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,500
And the trees had these kind of beer taps on them.

877
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:43,420
And out of them was coming this strange mixture of food, barns, gin, and Mountain Dew.

878
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,340
And I said, I love, love, love, love, love, love, love you.

879
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,140
Oh, yeah.

880
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,300
I was feeling so fine, so fine.

881
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,120
I was about to go out of my mind.

882
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,160
I saw the entire Robert Johnson, John Lee, Hooker, Muddy Waters record collection stretched before me.

883
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,740
And a brand new stereo.

884
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,280
I got a thousand watts of power.

885
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,980
I got a new car.

886
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:00,840
It's got a second gear.

887
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,500
And I'm feeling fine.

888
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,440
I ain't going to work no day job no more because that's not my life.

889
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,340
That's not my wife.

890
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,020
I'm going to cut it out with a knife.

891
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
So I asked Jesus.

892
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,380
I said, man, like, where am I?

893
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,080
Jesus kind of scratched his chin.

894
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,580
And he hadn't shaved in a while.

895
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,640
And he said, Mojo?

896
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:23,340
Mojo?

897
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,260
I said, am I?

898
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,840
I'm at the big rock candy mountain.

899
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,780
He said, no.

900
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,300
I said, am I in paradise?

901
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,340
He said, no.

902
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,440
I said, is this like the upstairs, you know, heaven?

903
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,220
He said, no.

904
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,500
Jesus looked up in the sky.

905
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,400
And there was a big white thing up in the sky.

906
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,520
And there were these kind of lines going across.

907
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:43,460
And the hair on the back of my neck stood up.

908
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:52,320
And Jesus said, I feel fine because, because, because I'm down by the power of life.

909
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,240
That's why I feel so fine.

910
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,880
That's why I'm holding my mind.

911
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,140
I said, I'm down, down, down, down, down by the power of life.

913
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,720
La, la, la, la, la, la, feel so, feel so, feel so, feel so down by the power of life.

914
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,620
I feel, feel, feel so fine.

915
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,460
Ain't that right, spirit?

916
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,260
Oh, yeah.

917
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:18,200
I said, I'm down by the power of life.

918
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,520
I'm doing all right, OK.

919
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,360
Hey, hey, hey.

920
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,680
It's just a trickle.

921
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,880
My luck's on bail.

922
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,240
Oh, yeah.

923
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:25,240


924
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,640
My luck won't bail on a, on a, on a hill or hill.

925
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,640
I'm down, down, down by the power of life.

926
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,880
By the power of life.

927
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,860
I'm down by the power of life.

928
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,240
Let's go, yeah, oh yeah.

929
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,440
Oh, oh, oh.

930
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,600
Keep it going, boy.

931
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,280
Keep it going, boy.
