1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm linked to contaminated steroids.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,380
The Centers for Disease announces new meningitis sooner than usual.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,660
The FBI has acknowledged it was a case of so-called PR News.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,580
Because of fears they could end up in the hands of PR News.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,260
PR News.

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,080
On Wall Street, 31, 13, 24, 5, and 78, GM says this is PR News.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,700
Governor Jerry Brown now wants to allow lower-cost smog regulators.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
Funeral services today for 24 smugglers.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,860
The fungal outbreak appears to be connected to PR News.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,820
Washington.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,260
I don't know what I want, but I want it now.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,960
Fried or fried, dear?

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,540
Now!

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,800
Fried?

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,400
I want my meat burnt, like St. Joan.

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Bring me Calvin's horseradish with vicious mustard.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,080
To pierce the tongue like Cardigan's lances.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,920
The Soul Genius.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,460
That's the trouble with Italian airplanes.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,180
Too much hair on the wings.

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,080
Yeah, here it is.

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,860
Hello?

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,940
That's good.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,580
Uh-huh.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,140
I see.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,820
Uh-huh.

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,100
I don't understand it.

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,140
All right, thank you.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,820
4-7?

30
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,300
Right.

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, thank you.

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,680
Well, just a minute.

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,220
I'll get a pencil.

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,620
Bye.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,300
Hey, wait a minute.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Beach party, beach party.

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,580
It never stops.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,540
Beach party, beach party.

39
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,220
I'm tired of this nightclub.

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,100
It never stops.

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,740
This band is so bad.

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,580
It never stops.

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,640
Why do I have to pay five dollars every night?

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,560
Beach party, beach party.

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,440
To Steve White.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,940
Beach party, beach party.

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,940
Well, how many times do we have to play?

48
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,060
Beach party, beach party.

49
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,780
This worst song.

50
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,860
Beach party, beach party.

51
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,700
Over and over and over.

52
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,100
The genius beach party.

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,000
Over again.

54
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,140
The genius beach party.

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,800
The genius beach party.

56
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,780
The audience.

57
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,200
The audience.

58
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,320
Nobody was getting a tan.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,900
It is.

60
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
The genius beach party.

61
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,180
Wow.

62
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,520
So, are there any more questions that you can direct to the church at this time?

63
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,180
It is the seven long nights.

64
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,540
We'll see if we can fight our way through the studio and just sort of...

65
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,680
Whoa, tan, whoa, tan.

66
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,140
Nor's got it, that stupid band.

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,220
Well, that's not actually...

68
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,960
No, here, see, they're screaming and they're hurting.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,440
They're turning over in the roasting oil of bad music.

70
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes, it's just a horrible sight.

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,860
It's a good thing that you, the subscriber, don't have to watch this on any other...

72
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,420
Well, unless you have the TV on, of course.

73
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,980
...that you find out early in the morning.

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,060
And good morning to you.

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,920
Yes, we have a caller here just about ready to materialize here.

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,620
We're going to put him on hold just for a few moments.

77
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,300
Moments to let the nasty conspiracy vibrations...

78
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,080
Actually, you want to know what Darth Vader looks like, yeah?

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,740
Are you from KBFA?

80
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,300
KBFA phone line.

81
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah.

82
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,660
Tenth Planet callback.

83
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,480
And what is...

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,700
Yeah, what is the Tenth Planet like?

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,260
Tenth Planet callback.

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,760
Hello?

87
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,440
Hello?

88
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,500
We can barely hear you.

89
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,960
Hold on now.

90
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,700
Can we turn the listener up, Bob?

91
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm trying.

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,680
You're there.

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,640
We're trying to get you in here.

94
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Okay.

95
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,380
Actually, you're probably using a conspiracy telephone.

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,000
Is that right?

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,880
Yes, that's right.

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,840
Okay, well, that's...

99
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,020
We're having a hard time breaking through the conspiracies.

100
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,060
Mind blockings and stuff, and we'll try to get you in here.

101
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
Hold on just a second.

102
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,200
Keep talking.

103
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,620
Keep talking.

104
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay.

105
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,340
Give it...

106
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,820
That's to give a signal.

107
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
Well, we can barely hear you, but...

108
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,920
Not to make you feel funny.

109
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,040
What is it that we...

110
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,180
What is it?

111
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,480
I wanted to ask how to get the tape of Terrence McKenna.

112
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,760
All right.

113
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,700
We'll have to ask him.

114
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,020
We're playing Kill the Caller tonight.

115
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,520
Welcome.

116
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,500
Yeah, is there any place I can write away for information on the...

117
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,840
Yes.

118
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,220
Yes, you can.

119
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,000
Box.

120
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,160
One, one, eight, nine...

121
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,960
Seven.

122
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,220
Eight.

123
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,160
Ten.

124
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,160


125
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,960
The other churches, you know, like tax-free and everything.

126
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,020
Better.

127
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,420
You got the wrong church, man.

128
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,380
This isn't tax-free.

129
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,940
This is a radio show in California.

130
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,240
But you can talk to those radio guys in just a minute here on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

131
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,600
Can you guys send me a donation?

132
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Sure.

133
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,340
How much do you want?

134
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,420
Well, just a couple bottles right now.

135
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,200
A couple of bottles?

136
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,140
We can send you 50 cents.

137
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,240
How about 50 cents?

138
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,740
That's all we can afford is 50 cents.

139
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,360
The treasure of the subgenius.

140
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
So we call it 50 cents.

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,820
The open man is right here to give you 50 cents.

142
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:37,580
As long as you have the Bob given quality of slack to determine the lies of the conspirators

143
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,440
and to create new lies of your own.

144
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,140
Dear friends, the show.

145
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,100
Hold the wool over your own eyes.

146
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,440
And relax.

147
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,180
In the glory of Bob.

148
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,480
In the safety of your own delusion.

149
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Relax in the safety of your own delusion.

150
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
And so.

151
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,580
Why afford that task to anyone else?

152
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,960
From across this land they came.

153
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:12,140
The subgeniuses joining at the lonely and solitary campground of Wisteria in the tropical hell of southern Ohio.

154
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,880
Surrounded by a national disaster area declared by President Barack Obama.

155
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,040
As sewers backed up.

156
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,020
Power cut out.

157
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,980
And people died like flies from a lack of air conditioning.

158
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,260
Even though you have the wonderful.

159
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Well, no.

160
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,280
It was in one of those.

161
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,680
One of those areas that had been declared a disaster area because of that.

162
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,980
Rainstorm.

163
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,260
That horrible, horrible.

164
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,080
On earth.

165
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,260
That earthly hurricane.

166
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,680
The homage to hummus.

167
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
The hurricane that came through there.

168
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,540
An on land hurricane.

169
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,840
That came through there and destroyed Wisteria before we arrived.

170
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,340
Built beneath the earth.

171
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,580
And everything else.

172
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,460
Actually, Wisteria survived.

173
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,780
It was like an oasis.

174
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,780
Yes, only the subgeniuses were spared.

175
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,020
A miracle before all.

176
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:15,040
To show that the rays of bright, blinding, brilliant light shining through the clouds illumine only the humble camp of the subgenius pilgrims.

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,340
And we only had to pay.

178
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,540
A million degrees.

179
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,960
From the soles of my feet to the tippy tips of my whole ear.

180
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,460
I am a doctor for Bob.

181
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,920
And let me say that prior to this moment, I had the least ability to understand the doctors for Bob.

182
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,220
Of any subgenius in the church.

183
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,440
But tonight, with an artist elimination experiment being such a success.

184
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,140
I truly feel that I am for the first time a true doctor for Bob.

185
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,160
But Bobby is bigger than I.

186
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,040
Uh oh, I think he's caught it.

187
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,760
Doctor, give him something for his cough.

188
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,740
Alright, alright.

189
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,020
Here's a quarter.

190
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,600
Oh, that's not much.

191
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,640
Not much of a cough.

192
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,040
Well thanks, Douglas. I'll take over.

193
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
It's alright. You'll be yourself again in a minute.

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm...

195
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm so sorry, everybody.

196
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,140
Now you just drink this.

197
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,340
Are you a doctor for Bob?

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,900
I am a doctor for Bob.

199
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,500
I am a...

200
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,720
SON KILLER!

201
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,060
I'm beaten.

202
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,580
Asshole.

203
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,100
Freeman.

204
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Eardrum split.

205
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,280
Hell of a doctor for Bob.

206
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,900
I don't feel well.

207
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
What's the matter with you?

208
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,860
Oh, I don't know.

209
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,920
I was the doctor and he told me what to do, but I didn't do it.

210
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,880
He said to take one pill three times a day, but you can't do that.

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,180
I think I'd rather die than do that.

212
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,820
I'm a doctor for Bob.

213
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm a doctor for Bob.

214
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,700
Man, it's a gas.

215
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,260
I figure, you know, some of those roaches they put out in grass and the glass acid will put you on the moon in an hour.

216
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,320
But reality?

217
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
That's where it's happening.

218
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,680
What?

219
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,060
What's the use of pretending?

220
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,400
I can't stand this anymore.

221
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,600
Don't, don't.

222
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,800
Doctor please.

223
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,120
Please, doctor.

224
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,120
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

225
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,460
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

226
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,320
Short, short.

227
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:17,500
Short visit.

228
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,560
Poor guy.

229
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,660
Pretty bad, huh?

230
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,960
No, the guy's really a mess.

231
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,380
The beatnik walked up to the epileptic and said, oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

232
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:27,620
Go!

233
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,420
That little clip was something called Underground System Afrobeat.

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,640
No connection.

235
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,260
I don't think.

236
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:18,140
Before that, the Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley on July 20th, when Dr. Hal and Dr. Drummond had returned from our 50-next-day drill.

237
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,300
More of that later, plus Sam Singleton.

238
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,360
Before Puzzling Evidence, the Doctor Music collage was mostly by St. Byron Brown.

239
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,360


240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,360


241
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,360


242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
And, of course, the late Bob Warner from the 1985 subgenius album Bad Doctors.

243
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,740
More Doctors next week.

244
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,380
DJ Reverend Slutmaster Sarcastro did the titles.

245
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,380
And Leigh Murr does PR news and other collages.

246
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,520
Now, back to Puzzling Evidence and Weird Stuff.

247
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,580
Oh, weird stuff.

248
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
You guys are in some weird sex cult in the middle of Ohio?

249
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,660
That's right.

250
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,720
Waiting for rocket shots?

251
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
A UFO sex cult.

252
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,440
How can anyone even find the stamina?

253
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,880
It's exhausting.

254
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,040
And this being said, there were two weddings there.

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:08,900
The second one was performed with the bride and groom in the three-piece suit with the tie I thought was going to expire.

256
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,800
Man, he was sitting over there in the sun.

257
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,700
And he's listening to Stang go on and on about the Yeti making cycle and so forth.

258
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,180
He sat in the sun.

259
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,900
His girlfriend, or his new wife, his fiancee sat in the sun with him.

260
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,040
And they had these portable fans that blew on them.

261
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,900
I DJed for this event.

262
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,180
They smoked a lot of cigarettes and chewed a lot of gum while they waited.

263
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,660
Based on what was in the headphones.

264
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,620
A little nervous, I think.

265
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,320
Yeah, they're looking ahead to 70,000 years of wedded bliss.

266
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,060
They all fall in shame.

267
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,620
What do you mean hell?

268
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,960
Well, wedded bliss, the felicity of domestic dalliance.

269
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,780
Yeah, what'd he say?

270
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,600
Is this the part of the show where we eat ice cream in front of everybody?

271
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:55,840
Yeah.

272
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,880
Dr. Drummond is eating ice cream.

273
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,700
We announced about the ice cream again and again.

274
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:07,000
She has an eating disorder and can't eat unless other people are also eating.

275
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,760
Before she starts eating?

276
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,060
Yeah, I don't have that disorder.

277
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,960
I'm a hog.

278
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,300
I'll just start.

279
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,540
I'll just plow right in.

280
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm not going to wait for everybody else.

281
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,480
I'm eating this and I'm enjoying it.

282
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,440
And I'm wondering what kind of a cocktail of foul chemical implants I'm getting with

283
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,980
this corn syrup.

284
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,980
Corn syrup and preservatives.

285
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,260
Did you worry about that kind of thing when you were in Brazil?

286
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,000
They didn't have that kind of thing in Brazil.

287
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Or Bolivia.

288
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,080
Did they have an ice cream sandwich there?

289
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,800
Well, they had an ice cream sandwich, but you watch this old man run around in a circle

290
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,140
turning this thing that turned the tub and they got the ice cream out and spread it on

291
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,960
the thing for you.

292
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,940
So an old man made an ice cream sandwich right in front of you that had no preservatives

293
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,340
and additives and so forth.

294
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,960
You used the stinky old sweaters?

295
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,680
You used the stinky old sweaters.

296
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,560
You used the stinky old sweaters.

297
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,560


298
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:55,560


299
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,960
And he melted the goat to get the ice cream.

300
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:07,700
No, actually there are Nestle's there and somebody else, but there is a lot of homemade

301
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,240
ice cream in Brazil.

302
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,920
Seems like a lot of people like it.

303
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,540
Real strange flavors.

304
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,580
Avocado, jackfruit.

305
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,660
What were those little red things?

306
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,260
There's one, it's called.

307
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,960
This is the hour of slack.

308
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,940
And if you're not listening closely, you're going to hear a lot of things.

309
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,260
And if you're not listening closely and paying attention, you are probably never going

310
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,220
to get it.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Oh, sorry.

312
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,300
That was the one little liquid slack.

313
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,300
The last bottle of liquid slack.

314
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,400
It's just liquid.

315
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,100
Would you like to share the straw with me, Dr. Howell?

316
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,200
The last in the bottom of the cylinder.

317
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,340
The sweetest.

318
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
The sweetest.

319
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:53,920
The sweetest.

320
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,540
Drops.

321
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,260
The last two drops.

322
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,380
Here, you have one.

323
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,100
And I'll have one.

324
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,280
Closer to the bone.

325
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,860
Let's cut this other drop.

326
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,180
Let's all have a drop.

327
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,000
Can you tell us more about?

328
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,480
About X Day?

329
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,940
Yeah.

330
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,420
Well, we had a giant roast pig.

331
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,680
Yeah.

332
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,200
So sue me, little Susie.

333
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,340
Called EMU somewhere else.

334
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,680
Dr. Howell and I did probably six, nine or 10 hours of the hour of slack.

335
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,960
How I miss your frenzied squealing.

336
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,900
During the hour of slack.

337
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:23,900


338
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:23,900


339
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:23,900


340
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:23,900


341
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,700
that time frame.

342
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,380
The meat is sweetest

343
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,820
closer to the bone.

344
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,600
And as we did

345
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,380
the hour of slack,

346
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,340
we sweated.

347
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,340
Did you lose some weight?

348
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,340
I lost some weight

349
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,880
during that.

350
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:32,960
You ate some out of

351
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,260
some bacon.

352
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,300
I just lost my teeth.

353
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,880
Oh, yes.

354
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
We did.

355
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,520
Despite all that

356
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,360
eating of meat

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,060
and steak

358
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,140
and especially the pig,

359
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,700
the pig went on forever.

360
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,280
And by the time

361
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,000
I got there,

362
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,120
many, many people

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,860
had been eating it,

364
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,600
but there were still

365
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,100
large amounts

366
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,080
of this animal

367
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
that you could just

368
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,740
saw off.

369
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,860
And it was all delicious.

370
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,020
It was excellent.

371
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:56,420
Yeah.

372
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,240
The only time

373
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,520
I've ever seen that done,

374
00:13:59,560 --> 00:13:59,860
of course,

375
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,060
the head was out there

376
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,600
on display,

377
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,560
but I'm not interested

378
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,140
in that part of the animal.

379
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,180
The cheek meat.

380
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Yes, I know.

381
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,540
Did it have an apple

382
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,060
in its mouth?

383
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,320
It had...

384
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,440
It didn't, actually.

385
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:12,920
I don't know

386
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,880
what it had in its mouth.

387
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,800
Now, they were lazy

388
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,240
on that one.

389
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,900
And those tusks there.

390
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,380
Those big tusks.

391
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,360
They were all lazy.

392
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah, they're not

393
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,100
They're not lazy.

394
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,720
They did a good job.

395
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,060
They did a good job

396
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,200
cooking the pig.

397
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,700
And then,

398
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
then Doc,

399
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,900
it was Doc,

400
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
not Doc Holocaust,

401
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,080
the other Doc

402
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,780
did...

403
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,480
Right?

404
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,300
One of those Docs.

405
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
There was a lot of Docs there.

406
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,860
He served

407
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,500
the wonderful steaks.

408
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,140
Yeah.

409
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
So, yeah,

410
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,180
it was nice.

411
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,900
We had some great meals.

412
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,900
And then,

413
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
while I think it was,

414
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,640
who came on?

415
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,480
Somebody came on

416
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,720
and said,

417
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,960
after the amino acids

418
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,520
that night,

419
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,900
went on for a long time.

420
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,920
Was that trademark

421
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,580
Gunderson

422
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,080
of the

423
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,240
Evolution Control Committee?

424
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,580
No, that was before.

425
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,400
This was after.

426
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,800
Remember,

427
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,320
there was some

428
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,620
person that played

429
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,280
until about

430
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,300
five in the morning.

431
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,220
That wasn't just

432
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,200
Pisces and Sud?

433
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,060
No.

434
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,900
Some...

435
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,760
He must have

436
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,400
already been asleep.

437
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,480
Well, I did

438
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,400
a night

439
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,980
with...

440
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,580
where I did a number

441
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,180
with Fat Mandy

442
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,500
and Princess

443
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,060
Rihanna.

444
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,600
Right, right.

445
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,260
Now, this was the final night,

446
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,540
the Saturday night.

447
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,820
This is the last night.

448
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,760
This is the final,

449
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,040
the final night.

450
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,260
This is...

451
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,220
You never say never.

452
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
...the worst day

453
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,580
of the mess

454
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,520
of your life.

455
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,960
I will have more stupidity.

456
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,580
This was their finest hour.

457
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,540
Hour?

458
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,340
Well,

459
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
Extinguish all smoking material.

460
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,980
Never, never, never,

461
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,460
never give up.

462
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,580
Shaken, not stirred.

463
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah.

464
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,340
Princess, we?

465
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,440
What are you doing?

466
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,400
Say, dance like a hoe.

467
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,300
Dance like a hoe.

468
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,060
Dance like a hoe.

469
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,880
I'm not allowed to use

470
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,280
the word hoe at home.

471
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,380
I can't even say home properly.

472
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,140
We're dancing like hoes,

473
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,960
so give us money.

474
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,680
The song says

475
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,840
dance like a hoe.

476
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,840
Yeah, we're garden implements.

477
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,980
This is the way we're moving.

478
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,740
Well, what if I say

479
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,780
dance like a hoe?

480
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,140
Then all of a sudden

481
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,480
it's all about

482
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


483
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


484
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


485
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


486
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


487
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


488
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


489
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


490
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,480


491
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,040
I'll get mad at you.

492
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,000
demanding too much.

493
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,120
You don't like the word hoe.

494
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,280
I hate the word hoe.

495
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,040
So you dance like a cavewoman

496
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,420
at the bottom.

497
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,400
Only if you put the apostrophe

498
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,980
before and the apostrophe after.

499
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,020
Because that shows

500
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,560
you're missing letters.

501
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,800
That's it.

502
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,540
That hate shows

503
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,460
somebody calls me a hoe,

504
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
I just fucking laugh.

505
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
Somebody calls me a whore,

506
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
I'd be hurt.

507
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,700
They leave off

508
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,920
those extra letters

509
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,580
and it makes all the difference.

510
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,140
I hate you.

511
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,460
I hate you.

512
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


513
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


514
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


515
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


516
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


517
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


518
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


519
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,460


520
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,860
That and what's in the background right now

521
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,420
was the rave music of either DJ Gravity or Poly Culture,

522
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm not sure which,

523
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,540
from 15X Day with Reverend Suzy the Floozy and us yakking.

524
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,940
But now I'm going to do something tonight

525
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,920
that I almost never do on this show.

526
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,700
I'm going to play over 30 minutes almost straight

527
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,760
of one man talking,

528
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
and it's not even me.

529
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,460
That one man is probably

530
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,460


531
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,660
my brother Sam Singleton,

532
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,260
the atheist evangelist from near Atlanta, Georgia,

533
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,260
who was invited to anti-preach at 15X Day

534
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,660
by Reverend Suzy the Floozy of WREK Atlanta

535
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,800
after she met him at the Atlanta Atheistical Freethinkers

536
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,320
and Intelligent Weirdos Club meeting.

537
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,800
When he was speaking at 15X Day,

538
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,760
I was so busy recording or else recuperating

539
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,320
that I didn't really get to truly listen to his rant.

540
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,720
Tonight I was marking the cuss words in it

541
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,460
to remind him

542
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
that I had to move for the broadcast versions of this show,

543
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,400
which is especially ironic in this particular case.

544
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,200
I realized how tragic it was

545
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,400
that I broke his rant up into five parts for our slack.

546
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,580
Also, the very end of his rant is timely

547
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,240
in a sense that I dare not take advantage of.

548
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,720
So we're giving the rest of this show

549
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,380
over to Brother Sam Singleton,

550
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,240
the atheist evangelist.

551
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,040
When I first heard

552
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,380
that there was an entire field of theology

553
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,160
called apologetics,

554
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,820
I naturally assumed it had been set up

555
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,120
to deal with the problem of why God is such an asshole.

556
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,140
Why anybody with a conscience

557
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,680
wouldn't want to avoid him

558
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,200
like one of the plagues he enjoys visiting upon his children.

559
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,740
But no.

560
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,900
The study of God's mean side

561
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,500
forms a whole other branch

562
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,200
called theodicy.

563
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,460
From theo for God

564
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,460
and idiocy.

565
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,700
Theodicy.

566
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,320
Apologetics is about defending God's existence,

567
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,120
not getting him to say he's sorry.

568
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,180
Of course, if you can't establish that,

569
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,420
you can't expect anybody to take any of the other stuff very seriously.

570
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,340
You need you some faith.

571
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,140
The gospel according to Benjamin Franklin says,

572
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,320
the way to see by faith

573
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,800
is to shut the eye of reason.

574
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,460
Good point, Brother Ben.

575
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,680
Because if you got faith,

576
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,800
what do you want with reason?

577
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,300
Faith is the only thing you need to know.

578
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,100
Faith is hope gone insane.

579
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,580
The gospel according to Merriam-Webster says,

580
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,680
faith is firm belief in something for which there is no proof.

581
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,540
Well, if you got proof, you don't need faith.

582
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,640
Of course, that didn't stop some of the faithful

583
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,520
from trying to prove God's existence.

584
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,280
Apologetics grew up around trying to prove God's existence.

585
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,520
They were trying to explain belief in God

586
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,600
in ways rational people could listen to without busting out laughing.

587
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,120
As the gospel according to H.L. Mencken puts it,

588
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,080
trying to explain the unknowable

589
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,920
in terms of the not worth knowing.

590
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,160
Sorry's got nothing to do with it.

591
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,680
God's not sorry. He's just mean.

592
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,400
And setting aside whether God is too

593
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,460
cruel

594
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,280
or lazy

595
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,320
or disengaged to bother protecting His own children,

596
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
you're still left with all this stuff

597
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,620
you might as well not even try to understand

598
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,380
since you can't get there through reason.

599
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,780
That's always struck me as a sure recipe

600
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,920
for a spiritual discernment pissing contest

601
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,080
in which each believer claims that his revelation

602
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,960
trumps his sisters or brothers.

603
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,720
God showed me.

604
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,420
No, He showed me, ass lick.

605
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,640
Who was I supposed to believe?

606
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,720
The one person I knew for a fact God was not speaking to

607
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,120
was me.

608
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,820
He never said shit.

609
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,200
I began to suspect He never said shit to anybody else either.

610
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,220
Even as I continued to say my prayers

611
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,180
and tried to hang on to the naive belief

612
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,200
that my own personal God was on call at any time

613
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,100
to supersede the laws of nature on my behalf,

614
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,600
I could see He wasn't doing shit.

615
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,600
Either He wasn't paying attention

616
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,480
or He wasn't up to the job,

617
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,560
or maybe...

618
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,060
I want to pause just long enough to acknowledge

619
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,580
the agnostics among us.

620
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,020
The Gospel according to Merriam-Webster

621
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,520
has something to say about what makes an agnostic.

622
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,260
Bless your pink little hearts.

623
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,480
One who is not committed

624
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,340
to believing in either the existence or the non-existence

625
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,420
of God or a God.

626
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,800
God damn.

627
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,160
That doesn't sound very good.

628
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,700
Puts me in the mind of Revelation 3.

629
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,460
Because you are lukewarm,

630
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,840
you are neither hot nor cold,

631
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.

632
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,680
But Brother Sam,

633
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,700
we wouldn't want to be too hasty in ruling out the God as I asked us,

634
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,240
for instance.

635
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,180
You can't say for certain that she doesn't exist.

636
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,200
Yep.

637
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,620
You're agnostic, I.

638
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,760
You see, I'll go way the hell out on a limb

639
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,080
and say outright

640
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,660
that there is no Isis.

641
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,700
No fucking Jupiter.

642
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,900
No teapot.

643
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
No Zoroaster.

644
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,220
No God.

645
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,860
No Jesus.

646
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,020
No none of them.

647
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,800
You go right ahead and be agnostic.

648
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,840
Just remember to set out some cookies for Santa.

649
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,980
The fix I got myself born into was not my fault.

650
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,800
At least not up to a point.

651
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,120
The point where I wanted people to stop treating me like a child.

652
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,680
The Apostle Paul said,

653
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,760
and Paul wrote in the 13th chapter of 1 Corinthians,

654
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,900
When I was a child, I spake as a child,

655
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,880
I understood as a child, I thought as a child,

656
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,120
but when I became a man, I put away childish things.

657
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,760
I got to that stage most teenagers go through

658
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,060
and some never outgrow

659
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:30,940
of being extra vigilant about letting anybody pull the wool over my eyes.

660
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,680
My bullshit meter was fixed in the super sensitive mode.

661
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,900
And it came to me

662
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,080
that with an omnipotent being on the loose,

663
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,440
every other being would have to be completely impotent.

664
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
God would have every damn bit of the power.

665
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You and I would have none whatsoever.

666
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,580
No free will.

667
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
God damn logic.

668
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,140
In matters of morality,

669
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,620
an omnipotent God is as worthless as hair on bacon.

670
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,700
And even if an omnipotent God and free will were not mutually exclusive,

671
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,640
every prayer of repentance would still be meaningless,

672
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,520
would still be empty,

673
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,600
would still be coerced.

674
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,180
You can say you would have done it anyway,

675
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,060
but won't nobody believe you?

676
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,220
Put yourself in God's place.

677
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,620
How can you trust that somebody has done something willingly

678
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,900
because they love you or respect you

679
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,140
when you know they're getting paid for it?

680
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,940
Or they're afraid of what'll happen if they don't play along?

681
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,460
Again, they can say they'd have done it anyway,

682
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,380
but God damn.

683
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,940
It's an uneven arrangement all around.

684
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,040
God does not love you half as much as He wants you to love Him.

685
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,580
I pity God if the reward is absent

686
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,840
or if you take away the threat.

687
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,880
My people wouldn't have liked what the Gospel Corridor said.

688
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,620
And Einstein has to say on the subject of everlasting reward and punishment,

689
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,760
Man would indeed be in a poor way

690
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,540
if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment

691
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,340
or hope of reward after death.

692
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,340
Do you hear them tell it?

693
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,320
That was all that stood between them and their church-going friends

694
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,500
becoming the most vile and depraved pestilences ever to pollute the planet.

695
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,780
Fear of punishment

696
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,900
was why you didn't smoke,

697
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,120
drink,

698
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,380
cuss,

699
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,800
fornicate,

700
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,720
play cards,

701
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,540
dance,

702
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,060
go to the movies,

703
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
watch TV.

704
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,200
And why the hell would you do anything good

705
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,880
unless there was a reward attached?

706
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,760
Every action

707
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,460
was something of a transaction.

708
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Just don't expect the quo

709
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,300
until you've ponied up the quid.

710
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,260
And I'm thinking,

711
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,780
anybody who looks to the Bible as a model for moral, just, ethical, or decent behavior

712
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,800
is fucking a dead dog.

713
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,040
You might as well look to the pre-Columbian Aztecs for moral guidance.

714
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,280
The difference

715
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,240
between the Aztecs and the believers in the God of Abraham

716
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,080
is that

717
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,340
thanks to some nice folks in the old country,

718
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,280
sacramental basketball played with the heads of those whose living hearts

719
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,000
have been cut out before their eyes

720
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,580
and shown to them as the last thing they'll ever see

721
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,860
is no longer recognized by the National Council of Churches

722
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,180
may have died out altogether.

723
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,220
But if Aztec nogginball is still being played,

724
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,460
then it's not the only thing that's going to be practiced somewhere in the world today.

725
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Some folks say I should speak of it

726
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,420
in terms only acceptable to the athletes themselves.

727
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,860
That bugs me.

728
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,200
Don't make a public profession unless you want to hear back

729
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,680
from the public.

730
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,060
The Bible belongs to everybody.

731
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,220
Not just the ones that treat it like their own family album.

732
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,340
And anybody who won't even bother to read the whole thing

733
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,160
should have the good grace to refrain from pontificating until they have.

734
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
My people

735
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,440
like to make out like they some kind of

736
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,040
biblical authorities.

737
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,900
But they just pick at it

738
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,300
like picky little buzzards.

739
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,860
Careful to take only the parts that agree with them.

740
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,840
The parts they can swallow

741
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,040
and regurgitate without digesting.

742
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,520
By God they know the Bible says what it means

743
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,660
and it means what it says.

744
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,920
Even if they don't know what it says.

745
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,500
Let alone what it means.

746
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,940
So I tried to get my cousin Palmer,

747
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,360
he my Uncle John Wesley Middleboy,

748
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,540
and was attending Roberts Oral University at the time

749
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,160
to admit that the God he worshipped was a limited one.

750
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,780
A God-like.

751
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,700
Some kind of little old low fat God.

752
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,900
Since God either has all the power or he doesn't.

753
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,580
That switches either on or it's off.

754
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,660
There is no third position.

755
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,200
The best Palmer could come up with was that

756
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,560
God gave humans enough free will

757
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,300
to decide for themselves whether to accept him

758
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,120
and how to behave.

759
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,060
But he was still omnipotent.

760
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,320
I explained to Palmer how

761
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,180
he was as good as saying that

762
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,080
God is only relatively omnipotent.

763
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,140
He just said he'd pray for me.

764
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,240
And I still did not slap that boy.

765
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,220
Free will is hard.

766
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,600
You have to decide things for yourself.

767
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,600
Belief in God is a voluntarily self-inflicted intellectual lobotomy

768
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,760
performed by stuffing your cranium full of toxic sawdust

769
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,860
that crowds out brain cells and eats away IQ points.

770
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,400
Everybody's heard that quote from the Gospel according to Voltaire.

771
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,100
How if there were no God it would be necessary to invent one.

772
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,600
Do you remember what the Gospel according to Jean-Paul Sartre says about that?

773
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,440
How even if there were, even if God existed

774
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,980
it would be necessary to deny him

775
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,280
since the very notion of God negates freedom.

776
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,800
You're goddamn right, Brother JP.

777
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,400
Of course that's exactly what some people want, isn't it?

778
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,960
Freedom is scary.

779
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,480
Especially other people's freedom.

780
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,500
We don't want to be free and we can't have you being free either.

781
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,200
For some folks being God's livestock represents a kind of freedom.

782
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,880
Not just from personal responsibility

783
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,080
since an omnipotent God means no free will.

784
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,580
But from all rules.

785
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
Don't like natural laws?

786
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,000
Suspend them.

787
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,100
Can't get a definition?

788
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,900
To jive with your position?

789
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
Just make up some shit.

790
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,760
You never have to tax your brain trying to figure out how stuff works

791
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,820
because God is behind everything.

792
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,980
There is no question that you don't already know the answer to.

793
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,520
Cheap fantasy is seductive.

794
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,000
But stupid.

795
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,380
Stupid.

796
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,200
Stupid.

797
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,240
Well that's a mighty harsh word.

798
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,800
I don't like using it.

799
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,160
I just don't have a better one to describe betting everything you've got

800
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,140
on the hearsay promise of a payoff

801
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,840
that can't be collected until you're dead.

802
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,040
Palmer asked me.

803
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,200
He said, don't you want to go to heaven?

804
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,400
I told him, hell no.

805
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,740
Everybody in heaven is either an idiot or an asshole.

806
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,000
Because once you're there, you cease giving a hurry of shit.

807
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,420
All the loved ones you were so worried about back on earth,

808
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,920
fuck them.

809
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,160
I got mine.

810
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,460
It has to be that way or it wouldn't be heaven, would it?

811
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,320
You can't have grief or regret intruding on your bliss.

812
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,060
Or what would be the point?

813
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,080
No, it's burn in hell, losers.

814
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,960
I don't care if you were my baby, my husband, wife, parent, friend.

815
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,020
The selfishness is complete.

816
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,760
There is no more to be desired.

817
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,320
It's like the imaginary 40 virgins.

818
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,760
Suicide bombers get their puny little peckers and a peek over.

819
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,240
God damn.

820
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,860
See if you haven't come across this one.

821
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,760
I was talking to Palmer again.

822
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,120
Just the other day.

823
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,440
And I must have said, God damn, without thinking about it.

824
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,720
I do that.

825
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,360
Boy, it's been partial to God damn.

826
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,020
And Palmer starts in on me about how since I used the Lord's name in vain,

827
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,140
I must believe in God.

828
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,560
Well, I reminded Palmer how Proverbs 26 says,

829
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,500
Answer not a fool according to his folly.

830
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,240
Why the hell should anybody, believer or no,

831
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,960
give the first curly little hair on a red rat's ass whether anybody else is an atheist?

832
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,480
Let alone try to convince them that they're not.

833
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,480
Or worse, tell them that atheism is just another brand of belief.

834
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,740
Atheism is not a religion.

835
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,840
It's not a cult.

836
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,660
Atheism is to believe in God,

837
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,380
what a vacuum is to air.

838
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,260
The absence of theism.

839
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,360
If you sucked all the belief in God out of the universe,

840
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,320
what you'd have left is atheism.

841
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,680
And far less methane gas being released into the atmosphere.

842
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,500
I got more to say about God damn.

843
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,900
When Clark Kent's editor at the Daily Planet,

844
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,440
Perry White,

845
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,140
says, Great Caesar's Ghost.

846
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,580
You see, he's not actually invoking the specter of Julius Caesar.

847
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,160
Any more than saying holy cow causes sanctified bovines to pop into existence.

848
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,220
So I'm gonna go on saying, God damn.

849
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,800
I say it with a little G.

850
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,320
But it's okay if you hear it with a big G.

851
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,780
I'm pretty much gonna stay off politics tonight.

852
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,860
Other than to note that God is a parasitic slime mold

853
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,100
that's been sucking the brains out of the USA since before it's founded.

854
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,340
The pilgrims, the Europeans,

855
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,600
tracked it over on those shoes with the big buckles on them.

856
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,440
And over the past 400 years,

857
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,640
it's worked its way into all the questions,

858
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,460
all the cracks and crannies of American life.

859
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,880
We're not just talking about in God we trust on the money.

860
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,060
Every public school,

861
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,280
courthouse,

862
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,600
city hall,

863
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,840
the federal courts, the government itself,

864
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,940
they reek of God.

865
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,280
They got God smeared all over them.

866
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,720
I resent the hell out of my taxes being used to

867
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,060
promote God's brand name.

868
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,840
In God we trust.

869
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,480
The gospel according to Mark Twain said,

870
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,400
and it wouldn't sound any better if it were true.

871
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,360
It's like the government has to keep reminding me

872
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,300
that I'm permanently relegated to America's hind tit

873
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,180
just because I don't buy into that shit.

874
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,020
You ever think about the number of times you're exposed to the word God in the course of a day?

875
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,920
We gotta start paying closer attention.

876
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,440
Noticing when God shows up uninvited.

877
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,880
Every in God we trust,

878
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
every one nation under God,

879
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,620
every Ten Commandments monument,

880
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,020
every prayer that opens a session of a legislature,

881
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,700
every federal observance of a Christian holiday.

882
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,060
Not that we should get fewer days off.

883
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:41,380
We ought to be able to get them without celebrating our own marginalization.

884
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,860
These state sponsored professions of belief are designed to calm the insane.

885
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,200
Reminding the rest of us that we're merely visitors on the ward

886
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,500
is what you'd call an ancillary benefit.

887
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:11,900
Well the Constitution guarantees even the pathologically delusional

888
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,020
the right to speak any nonsense they like.

889
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,180
What they say in the privacy of their own loony bins is their own business.

890
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,840
As long as it's all between consenting adults and they leave the children out of it

891
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,860
and they don't prevail upon the likes of Brother Sam to pick up their tax burden.

892
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,040
The government already earned a rights to their program.

893
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,280
They're programming and does their PR for free.

894
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:45,240
You buy, sell, rent out property, hire or fire.

895
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,660
You are a business.

896
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,800
Pay your fucking share you deadbeat parasites.

897
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,520
And when citizens that do pay taxes

898
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,280
try to pass laws that require these civic leeches to chip into the community pot

899
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
who decides the outcome?

900
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,960
A bunch of legislators who could never get elected without professing belief in God.

901
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,240
Nobody cares that the gospel according to the article 6 of the US Constitution says

902
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,320
no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any public office or trust under the United States.

903
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,220
The problem isn't with the Constitution.

904
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,280
It's with the voter.

905
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,660
Of course you can always turn to the courts.

906
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,260
You'll know the building by the big-ass Ten Commandments out front.

907
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,260
The very courthouse where Sister Singleton and I go to do our county business has one.

908
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,260
I bet yours does too.

909
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,620
And God forbid you should ever be accused of a crime

910
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,120
or called upon to give testimony in a civil proceeding.

911
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,760
And if the bailiff asks,

912
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,860
do you swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth so help you God?

913
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,580
What, are you going to call the proceedings to a halt so you can explain?

914
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,340
Well, I can't swear to a God I don't believe in.

915
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:27,620
So you can make a point of being a member of the one minority that political correctness hasn't gotten to yet.

916
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,100
If you don't believe in God, you're a fool.

917
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,420
If you got any sense, you'll say,

918
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,520
hell yes I swear to God.

919
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,660
Jehovah, Yahweh the Almighty, He whose name must not be spoken.

920
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,000
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

921
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,880
Praise His holy name.

922
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:55,240
That ninth commandment posted outside the front door there commands me not to bear false witness against my neighbor.

923
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,920
And that's flat what I'm not going to do.

924
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,840
That I swear to God by God.

925
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,460
Swearing an oath before God is the nod and the wink that lets the government know you can be trusted to join the military.

926
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,020
Preside over a court.

927
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,480
Serve in Congress, the White House, the State House, City Hall.

928
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,760
You're one of them.

929
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,920
You promised not to call bullshit on the whole deal.

930
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,820
I may be willing to be mad at a God that does not exist.

931
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,020
But that's it.

932
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm God damn if I'm on fear of God.

933
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,540
Sure some of His people bear watching.

934
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,820
But I'm no more afraid of God than I am of this flying spaghetti monster deal.

935
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,900
That is not to say there's nothing to fear.

936
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,320
There's nothing left worth worrying about.

937
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:06,040
You want to know what causes Brother Sam to wake up in a cold sweat at a quarter to noon.

938
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,460
Not be able to get back to sleep again.

939
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,000
Even with the 700 Club playing in the background.

940
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,600
It's knowing that this enthusiastic embrace of the improper.

941
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:23,880
It's knowing that this enthusiastic embrace of the improper.

942
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:38,180
This obstinate fidelity to falsehood is damn near an absolute requirement for the highest offices in the most powerful government in human history.

943
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:48,020
It scares the bejesus out of me that the people entrusted with our very lives are avowed fantasists.

944
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,860
Full fledged year round residents of the United States.

945
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:53,860


946
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,980
Full fledged year round residents of the United States.

947
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,240
Who use our taxes not only to shove big wads of God up our asses.

948
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,620
But to wage sectarian war in our name.

949
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:09,480
As if it's us Christians and Jews against those Muslims.

950
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,260
I want it understood.

951
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,920
Brother Sam does not throw in with sanctimonious thugs and pious bullies.

952
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,480
And I don't give a first shit which fairy tale they favor.

953
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,540
The gospel according to Voltaire also says.

954
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,760
If we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities.

955
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,120
You want absurd?

956
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,900
Imagine a universe without mysteries.

957
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,680
A universe that's a closed book.

958
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,320
I'll tell you one thing for God.

959
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:51,940
God damn sure.

960
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,400
Nobody ever learned anything from a closed book.

961
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,840
Atrocities?

962
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,380
Well start by torturing logic and language.

963
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,660
But save the most depraved shit.

964
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,880
For infidels.

965
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,580
Fellow believers.

966
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,880
Not that actual heathens.

967
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,840
Non-believers like Brother Sam shouldn't be maltreated.

968
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,200
That's what minorities are for.

969
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,860
I'll grant that not all believers are as extreme as the ones that raised me.

970
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,560
Or those that put out a contract on a cartoonist.

971
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,540
Or tell women or homosexuals that they're not good enough or smart enough.

972
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,300
And don't have a right to personal freedom.

973
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,820
But near as I can figure.

974
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,160
Once you take that initial step off the deep end of reason.

975
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,840
And accept God on nothing but faith.

976
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,860
You're down to splitting hairs over whether the sugar plum fairy has buckles or bells on her shoes.

977
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,400
You might as well grab a rattlesnake with one hand.

978
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,820
And a bottle of rat poison with the other.

979
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:20,380
And kick up a Holy Ghost can can to Hosanna sung in unknown tongues.

980
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,580
Whoa! I heard somebody say.

981
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:37,680
Brother Sam you done committed one giant ass generalization heaping all believers together that way.

982
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,460
I know.

983
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,600
Before we wrap up.

984
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,240
I wouldn't be of any count as an evangelist.

985
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,840
Even in the ironic sense.

986
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,720
If I denied y'all a chance to experience the taking up of an offering.

987
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,360
The church of the subgenius got enough to do without taking Brother Sam to raise.

988
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,580
So this is how we can do this without a fee.

989
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,160
And if you're hard up.

990
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,720
Just drop in anything that Brother Sam might find interesting.

991
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,420
Or useful.

992
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,820
Thank you.

993
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,080
If we have ushers would you start the little basket around.

994
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,420

¶¶

1042
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,380
Whatever you believe,

1043
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,880
or do not believe,

1044
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,880
you are more than the sum of those things.

1045
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,080
Somewhere down the line, folks took to confusing

1046
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,920
what they believe with who they are.

1047
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:23,900
And that's why we can't even discuss this shit

1048
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,440
without me having to worry about

1049
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,340
somebody calling down a holy war on my ass.

1050
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,680
The godly got enough to do without killing each other.

1051
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,280
They don't need to be fucking with Brother Sam.

1052
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,860
If I was the kind of evangelist that believed in sin,

1053
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,860
the one I'd preach against

1054
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,780
would be willful ignorance.

1055
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Because that is the most dangerous

1056
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,960
and destructive thing I can think of.

1057
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,480
Individually,

1058
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
or as a group,

1059
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,200
a really huge-ass group,

1060
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,960
say 3.4 billion,

1061
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:17,560
lying,

1062
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,580
especially to yourself,

1063
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,360
is one of those things

1064
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,080
that you can't do.

1065
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,200
¶¶

1066
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,120
You give it its head,

1067
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,140
and it will flat run away with you.

1068
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,120
You swallow the first lie,

1069
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,460
and the rest go down easy.

1070
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,140
If you can honestly say,

1071
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,040
I believe I have a destiny,

1072
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,820
and it's in the almighty hands of the God of Abraham,

1073
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,560
or a blue elephant,

1074
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,080
or the,

1075
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,460
or the,

1076
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,460
or the,

1077
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:57,960
or the,

1078
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,200
or the,

1079
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,220
or the,

1080
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,860
or the,

1081
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,240
or the,

1082
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,720
or the,

1083
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:02,780
or the,

1084
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:02,780


1085
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:02,920
or the,

1086
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,420
and I want you to come forward

1087
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,280
and bring all the cash you got on you.

1088
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,600
And just put it right here in one of these offering baskets.

1089
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,860
Because you definitely ought to be in charge of your own finances.

1090
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,420
Brother Sam will just look after it for you

1091
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,720
until you come to your senses.

1092
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,400
Or until the rapture.

1093
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,100
Everybody else,

1094
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,440
get out there and raise hell

1095
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,080
and put a chunk under it.

1096
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,540
That is the gospel according to Brother Sam.

1097
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,360
Good night.

1098
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,020
God damn.

1099
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,680
Thank you very much.

1132
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,660
Prayers go unheeded.

1133
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,560
Of course they're unheeded.

1134
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,340
How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?

1135
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,840
They talk of war against the faithful.

1136
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,800
I beseech thee, rise up against them.

1137
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,320
Smite someone who deserves it for once.

1138
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,860
Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse.

1139
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,480
You're best off solving your own problems.

1140
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,780
But, but Metal Lord...

1141
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,680
What part of nay dothn't thou understand?

1142
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,200
As Brother Singleton didn't exactly say,

1143
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,680
he preached for free at X Day 15

1144
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,760
and even had to buy himself and his wife

1145
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,580
subgenius ministerial ordainment packages.

1146
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,800
I hope that helping to spread his ministry

1147
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,980
with this humble radio show and crazy man podcast

1148
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,480
will make up for that.

1149
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,600
And I can also suggest that if you want to know more,

1150
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,780
simply Google Sam Singleton

1151
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,160
or try

1152
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,140
samsingleton.com

1153
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,240
or

1154
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,880
the Atheist Evangelist.

1155
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,060
Pricebop.

1156
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,620
So yeah, X Day 15 is nowhere to be found on YouTube yet.

1157
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,700
It's so sad.

1158
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,280
So sad, so sad.

1159
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,000
I was chosen for some kind of

1160
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,240
X Day...

1161
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,280
I think everybody's just waiting for Stang

1162
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,540
to put their official one.

1163
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,280
They're all like...

1164
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,700
The tripod shot from back in the room.

1165
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,180
It could be 106 degrees.

1166
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,340
I mean, what are you going to do?

1167
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:47,920
Where?

1168
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,060
I took...

1169
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,620
I took some video.

1170
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,820
I took some video of...

1171
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,400
I had my GoPro camera strapped to my head.

1172
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,100
Nice.

1173
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,540
And I was walking around in the audience

1174
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,380
and I'm taking pictures of the stage,

1175
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,380
a video of the stage.

1176
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,160
I'll have to show it to you.

1177
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,920
It's parts of it.

1178
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,520
It's kind of cool.

1179
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:04,980
Yeah, yeah.

1180
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,180
Shows you some of the potential of that GoPro.

1181
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,620
But I was cutting people's heads off

1182
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,740
because I didn't have it turned up enough, you know?

1183
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,420
And I had this kind of stuff going on.

1184
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,400
And for a while,

1185
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,120
I was so sweaty

1186
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,340
that my...

1187
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,720
The heat from my head

1188
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,860
was going through that thing

1189
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,220
and was fogging up the external cover.

1190
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:25,680
Sure.

1191
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:29,520
And so I was getting these weird foggy vignette kind of things

1192
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,560
on that, you know, it's a wide-angle lens.

1193
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,100
Yeah, yeah.

1194
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:33,780
That's funny.

1195
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,980
But then that kind of went away.

1196
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,360
But yeah, you've got to put that up on YouTube.

1197
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:37,980
I'll show you that stuff.

1198
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,040
It's the only video on YouTube ever.

1199
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,800
Yeah, yeah.

1200
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,760
And now that Facebook's slack hole went away,

1201
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,560
it's like you can't...

1202
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,120
There's nothing.

1203
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,140
Yeah.

1204
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,100
The slack hole, too, is back, but...

1205
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,700
No, it's not.

1206
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,380
The wind has gone from the sails.

1207
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,380
The wind.

1208
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,180
The wind.

1209
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,900
I'm blowing some wind right now.

1210
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,440
I bet.

1211
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,040
So are we.

1212
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,700
But we just wanted to pick it up

1213
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,320
because we were where the troopers fell,

1214
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,680
and now we're moving fast through history.

1215
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,900
That's what they do at X-Day.

1216
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,040
These guys just got back here from the end of the world.

1217
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,860
I got a bunch of stuff from X-Day.

1218
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,820
Pictures, videos.

1219
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,200
The whole time you guys were gone,

1220
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,860
we were saying,

1221
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,660
you're dead,

1222
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,580
and you're on this flying saucer.

1223
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,280
And you're in the pleasure saucers.

1224
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:21,860
Yeah.

1225
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,940
And I was lying the whole time.

1226
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,560
You were?

1227
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,820
Yep, because here you are.

1228
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,760
Now, why would you do that to your audience?

1229
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,640
Because I'm sort of like a man of the clock.

1230
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,360
This audience that comes back to you week after week.

1231
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,340
I'm sort of like a pastor.

1232
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,380
You're sort of like a cult leader.

1233
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,340
Yeah, sort of.

1234
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,520
In a secretly famous way.

1235
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,680
But not, you know.

1236
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,820
But they don't know.

1237
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,680
Who can possibly know?

1238
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,400
All they know,

1239
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,180
is that all this radio show stuff

1240
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,600
is being done all the time,

1241
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,540
all over the place.

1242
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,920
And nobody knows where it comes from.

1243
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,340
From PR News in Washington,

1244
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,100
I'm detained at an airport in Istanbul.

1245
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,080
Taken to an Istanbul police station for questioning.

1246
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,020
The 2013 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees

1247
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,860
say Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney

1248
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,700
could come loose during intimate same-sex campaigning in Ohio.

1249
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,680
They say Google is in trouble.

1250
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,000
They say they're illegally profiting from PR's reports.

1251
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,180
But Google still must confront thousands of suspects today.

1252
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,160
They say this is PR News.

1253
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,280
So, will you be, do you have CDs to play on the Ask Dr. Hal of...

1254
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,580
Well, I remember I sent a request to you with some material,

1255
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,920
which I was hoping could be transferred to...

1256
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,000
Oh, okay, sure.

1257
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,080
You know, I didn't realize it was connected to your album.

1258
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,420
I mean, boom.

1259
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,800
I'm less than 12 hours.

1260
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,880
...watching, but there's a hundred times as much as you can watch.

1261
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,300
Yeah.

1262
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,200
Which 10% should you watch?

1263
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,140
Now it's...

1264
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,820
See, that's the thing.

1265
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,800
Information management is the key to the future.

1266
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,740
How do you sift through all of just the subgenius channels?

1267
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,340
You have to prioritize your...

1268
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,520
Just the hundreds of channels that Stang runs on subgenius alone.

1269
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,780
Only playing a few moments of subgenius.

1270
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,080
Yeah, how do you possibly, in today's...

1271
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,140
Well, it's an age-old problem, is that the...

1272
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:10,520
How many...

1273
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,200
You have to allocate your attention to the things that have the highest priority.

1274
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,180
Because you've got a limited amount of attention.

1275
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,540
Your capacity for attention is limited, and the time...

1276
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,120
...subgenius business...

1277
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,460
But your wants are infinite.

1278
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,000
So what are you going to do?

1279
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,520
What are you going to do?

1280
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,000
What are you going to do?

1281
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,560
What are you going to do?

1282
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,120
What are you going to do?

1283
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,080
What are you going to do?

1284
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,360
What are you going to do?

1285
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:39,520
What are you going to do?

1286
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,740
Yes, what are you going to do?

1287
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,140
What are you going to do?

1288
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,900
What are you going to do?

1289
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,560
There we go.

1290
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,040
There we go.

1291
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:47,820
Gonna steer her...

1292
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,800
straight and true. I'm looking down into the

1293
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
maw of the whole world. Somebody said

1294
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,320
there's a pleasure saucer,

1295
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,580
but I don't see anything down there.

1296
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,480
Down there, it's partly concealed

1297
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,000
under hundreds of tons of earth and rocks.

1298
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,660
Yeah.

1299
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,360
File here.

1300
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,900
But according to a Native

1301
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,060
American legend, it will emerge

1302
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,540
one day.

1303
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,500
Yeah, keep talking.

1304
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,800
Oh, she wants a shiitake. Here you go.

1305
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,520
Here's a portobello.

1306
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,640
The only talking dog is shiitake,

1307
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,360
who is now speaking

1308
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,040
on the other channel.

1309
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,140
You've been listening

1310
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,100
to the Subgenius

1311
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,440
Radio Ministry

1312
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,520
Hour of Slack.

1324
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,480
Praise Bob!

1325
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,980
A thank you,

1326
00:58:59,020 --> 00:58:59,920
Reverend Baby Bear.

1327
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,780
And finally, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

1328
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,180
Slack is something

1329
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,120
that's sometimes very ephemeral.

1330
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,180
It only lasts for a second.

1331
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,260
But sometimes slack can be

1332
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,820
prolonged and drawn out.

1333
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,160
The thing about slack is

1334
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,040
it is never

1335
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,580
truly achieved

1336
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,420
until you reach the point

1337
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,260
of realizing

1338
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:23,280
that the only thing

1339
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,580
that is important

1340
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:25,540
at all

1341
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,740
is right now.

1342
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,460
Friends,

1343
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,800
we're glad you listened to this show

1344
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,380
and we're even more glad

1345
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,300
that some listeners have donated enough

1346
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,580
to help us keep on going

1347
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,140
for another couple of months.

1348
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,260
Not just this show, but

1349
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,160
subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1350
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,680
But if you truly love Bob

1351
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,540
and want some of that slack back

1352
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,220
to rebound to you,

1353
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:55,060
you should go to subgenius.com

1354
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,660
front page or especially

1355
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,600
the radio page or the catalog

1356
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,700
store pages

1357
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,040
and help out financially as best you can.

1358
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,820
Now, we know

1359
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,560
what it's like to be on the brink of

1360
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,480
total poverty and we don't want any

1361
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,380
subgeniuses to make their own situations

1362
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,680
worse. But some of you

1363
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,000
still have jobs.

1364
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,860
Even $5

1365
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,340
makes a big difference

1366
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,320
even if it's only once a month

1367
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,920
from enough of you.

1368
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,280
$50 makes an even bigger difference.

1369
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,640
All we're saying is that

1370
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,040
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1371
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,100
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1372
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,680
We also take checks and money orders to

1373
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,580
Subgenius Foundation.

1380
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,420
Thanks for anything you can do to help

1381
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,240
let there be slack.
