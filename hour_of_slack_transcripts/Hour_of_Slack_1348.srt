1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,520
If I had a kid listening right now, I think I'd tell her to go to sleep.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:12,360
As if I had a kid, I'd write an indignant letter to this radio station for polluting the airwaves with a tide of blasphemy.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,900
My daughter always told me that an hour of slack gave her a headache.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,360
That's right.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,900
An hour of slack gives me a headache.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,800
It gives me a headache, too. It makes flies come out of my ears.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,200
Oh, gross, man, how'd you do that?

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,600
He's the lord of flies.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,120
I did that because...

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Do you have social brain?

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,120
What'd he say?

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,940
88.1 KFCF in Fresno, which I was just listening to lots of recently.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,760
Fresno, Fresno, Fresno.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,060
And all over the world.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,640
On kpfa.org, the interwebs, on Armed Forces Radio, on little pirate radio stations.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,100
Are we on Radio Free Europe?

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,820
All the time.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
Not that, but the voice of America.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,580
Yes, as they cower behind the iron curtain, quivering in terror.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,600
Cowering like jay.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,080
The brave voices of Radio Free Europe.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,860
Spread the American...

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,380
Happily, we're not on Radio Valencia.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,620
Oh, no, we're not.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,240
No, we're not.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,320
But I don't know why that...

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,460
But these guys will be later.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,640
Well, it's true.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,360
And I can speak my mind there like a free yayhoo.

30
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,340
Like an idiot with the God-given right to spew my own...

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,680
Twisted philosophy.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,640
Criminals.

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,280
Power, speed of light.

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,160
And you don't mean that maliciously speaking of idiots this way.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,380
No one can stop me.

36
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
And now...

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,540
Once again, it's time for the Ask Dr. Hal Show.

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,360
Live on radio.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,860
Hello.

40
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,820
Well, my friends.

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,500
Tonight we have an...

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,200
Exceptionally terrifying story for you.

43
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,320
One that will freeze your blood.

44
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,700
And cause your two eyes to start forth from your spheres.

45
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,100
And each particular hair to stand on end.

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,560
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,500
Yes, indeed.

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,160
And why?

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,700
You might well ask.

50
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,100
Is it reputed to be scarier than usual?

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,540
Because there's a little bit more...

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,020
More meat on those bloody bones.

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,320
Hello.

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,540
I'm Dr. Howland Owl.

55
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,900
And tonight is a special broadcast we call...

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
Subgenius All-Stars.

57
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,660
And what did he...

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,760
What did the caller say?

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
The caller wanted to know what your third favorite state was.

60
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,060
Oh, why.

61
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,220
That is, of course, the state of absolutely blissful torpor.

62
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,400
Ah.

63
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,180
What a great...

64
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
That was such a great...

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,060
Yes.

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm sure that that caller could have gotten through.

67
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,460
Number one would be the state of pure slack, of course.

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,220
Yes, exactly.

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Which is not the same as torpor, although they are certainly related.

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,140
Well, it is...

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,320
It is related.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,260
But you have to get to the state of blissful torpor by going through the others.

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,840
Still, it is not as...

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,640
The state of semi-consciousness is fun to flirt with from time to time.

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,160
I pointed it out.

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,660
Yes, I said that.

77
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,280
Don't you agree?

78
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Well...

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,680
You already pointed out the state of semi-consciousness?

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,520
I pointed out the boundary marker just on the edge of the frontier,

81
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,520
and right over the edge, the state of semi-consciousness can be found.

82
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,440
Straddling that point.

83
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,960
You can stand on four points.

84
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,560
Well, there's the phone.

85
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,100
They're calling us, harassing us.

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,700
They're not satisfied with what we're saying.

87
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,700
There's an impulse, an instinct to answer the phone and try to see...

88
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,140
Do you want me to answer the phone, Dr. Howell, and I'll take a relay of the...

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,440
How can you do it?

90
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
I'll go over there and...

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, but you can't hear on it.

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,180
I might.

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
Well, let's try it.

94
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,740
I'll try one more time, but this phone thing, it likes me not.

95
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,500
I feel like I'm falling like a deaf man through the canyons of my mind.

96
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,900
Stop talking for a moment, gentlemen.

97
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,340
Let's see if some whispering, lisping phantom on the phone has anything to say worthy of interrupting the stream of our speech.

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,520
I can hear this individual over here.

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,500
I can hear you by actually holding the phone next to my ear.

100
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Well, it's not supposed to work that way, but let me do it.

101
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:32,600


102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,560
You can hold the phone up to the microphone and see what happens.

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
Yes, uh-huh.

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,920
Now, Dr. Howell is engaged at this point on the phone, intently listening to the words...

105
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,840
The phone that's supposed to be tied into the radio mixer.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,180
...intently listening to the words that the callers are saying.

107
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,960
We don't hear those words, but Dr. Howell is parsing the sentence out.

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,740
to understand what the real meaning is behind it.

109
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,300
Conspiratorial ideologue, no doubt.

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,180
I can hear him breathing heavily.

111
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,340
You know, on my show, we only allow one person to call in.

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,720
And then you kill them?

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
No, it's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

114
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,140
And the only reason he has to call in is because his car doesn't work.

115
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,740
He gets paid to call in, right? Don't you pay him?

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
I pay for his long distance.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,360
I mean, don't you, like, have to pay to get people to call?

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,020
Yeah, on my show, nobody listens. I have to pay people.

119
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Well, no, you pay to have the best caller.

120
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,080
That's what it is.

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,980
See, we have to take random callers.

122
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
Just anybody can call.

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,800
The question is, what is the correct plural of Jesus?

124
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,900
And now I will hang up the phone.

125
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,460
Usually on the way to the station, I'll find a wino and give him a buck.

126
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,360
Now, I have a question to answer.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,380
Say, call this number at 930.

128
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,140
Right, right.

129
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,060
That's how I get called.

130
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,020
You can say it here.

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,100
Here's a $10.

132
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,260
This is a question.

133
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,800
That's how I found lonesome Cowboy Dave.

134
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,380
Piled on.

135
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,160
Put in by the caller.

136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Here's a 10 spot for a bottle of wine to ensure you do it.

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,560
But I have to say, I like to answer questions.

138
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,720
I would answer them.

139
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:17,140
But I'm just not able because of the difficulty, which the caller confirmed others have been having also at this station.

140
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,660
So I'm going to say, do not call.

141
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,400
I will not pick up the receiver.

142
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,040
But this last caller did have a question.

143
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
And the question for me is,

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
what's the correct plural of Jesus?

145
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,260
Dr. Drummond, Dr. Stang, would you like to throw something in?

146
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,060
I use the term jizai on the job, in my work.

147
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
I use the term jizai as well on the job.

148
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,220
In fact, there's a special email folder that certain people's mail goes into automatically.

149
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,340
I only see it when I feel like looking at the kooks in jizai folder.

150
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,840
Well, you need to talk about.

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
The plurals of Jesus.

152
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes, that's what I'm going to do.

153
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,940
I need to talk.

154
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,340
So let me say.

155
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,540
You need to talk up more?

156
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:01,560
Me?

157
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,240
Let me say that what we've got going here is the Latin plural of Jesus.

158
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,820
The word given by Reverend Stang is jizai.

159
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,380
But of course, that is, he is using the Catholic liturgical medieval Latin pronunciation.

160
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,280
Those of us who believe that the correct pronunciation of Latin by the German classical scholars,

161
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,120
is the correct one, would say j-z-e.

162
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,440
J-z-e, spelled with two i's.

163
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,140
You know, just like a Catholic priest would say jizai, eh?

164
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
So essentially, that is the correct answer for Latin.

165
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:45,520
But how about the correct answer for the English language that we all speak more than we speak Latin?

166
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,240
A mess of Jesuses.

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,960
A pride of Jesuses.

168
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,940
A gang of Jesuses.

169
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,820
You have given it.

170
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
A clutch of Jesuses.

171
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,380
It's a gang of Jesuses.

172
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,260
You have said it.

173
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,100
A host of Jesuses.

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,300
Jesuses is the correct word.

175
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,200
A host of Jesuses.

176
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Yeah, that would make sense.

177
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,880
Well, we weren't looking for the descriptive noun for the pack, the ravening pack of risen

178
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,500
Christs.

179
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,280
When in doubt, just say Christs, as in the three Christs of Ypsilanti.

180
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,720
The only thing about that is that technically, a Christ need not be Jesus.

181
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,880
A Christ is only an anointed one.

182
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,620
That's true.

183
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,280
But Jesus is a Christ, so he can be a Christ as well.

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah, but it works one way.

185
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,980
He's the Christ and a Christ.

186
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,900
So when we're talking about Jesus titty fucking Christ.

187
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,000
Those are the two lesser known middle names of the Savior.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,780
Right, but we really have a strong affection in the Church of the Subgenius for the fighting

189
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,120
Jesus.

190
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,320
That's right.

191
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,280
Because he didn't turn the other cheek.

192
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,920
He actually got pissed off and mowed down a whole row of his enemies.

193
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,060
If I offend thee, kill someone.

194
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,800
That's what he said.

195
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,940
That's your fighting Jesus who said that.

196
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,720
The sound of a leprechaun orgy and full swing.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,580
And there they are.

198
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,940
First they were hopping over the hollyhocks and leaping over the gates.

199
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,720
I don't know if I can watch this video much longer.

200
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,520
Just look at them, the randy little buggers going at it.

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,100
And you know, over there, there's the pot of gold under the rainbow.

202
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,380
But you wouldn't want it now.

203
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,260
At least without rubber gloves to touch it.

204
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,820
The frosted lucky charms.

205
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,060
They're magically delicious.

206
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,240
They're hanging men and women for a few.

207
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,740
That's a horrible noise in the background.

208
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,840
Reminds me of those chihuahuas in the back.

209
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,680
That's a Turet's Laugher.

210
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,440
And look, a giant beehive of infuriated African killer bees.

211
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,360
Oh, we went to the Chihuahuas.

212
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:56,960
Chihuahuan desert where there was a chihuahua, a deadly attacked chihuahua hiding behind every cholla cactus.

213
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,260
Aye, Chihuahua.

214
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,900
And, uh, did the...

215
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:06,280
Ah, pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers.

216
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
Green spleens, yellow intestines.

217
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,180
Blue diamonds, purple horseshoes, and red balloons.

218
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,100
Little purple lungs.

219
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,900
Pots of gold, leprechaun hats.

220
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,780
Red arteries and purple veins.

221
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,540
Shooting stars.

222
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,920
And an hourglass of blue and green.

223
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,180
They're after me lucky charms.

224
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,900
They're magically delicious.

225
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,400
Tee hee hee hee hee hee.

226
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,880
Oh yeah, watch out.

227
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,280
Purple horseshoes, red balloons.

228
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,960
It's dark. Turn your lights on.

229
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,740
It's dark out there.

230
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,320
Turn your lights on.

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,920
When you turn your lights on, it causes the leprechauns to explode in puffs and puffs.

232
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,960
And spruce clovers.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,360
And green stars.

234
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,180
I thought that was trolls that exploded when exposed to light.

235
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,580
Remember how they defeated the Saucermen in the movie Invasion of the Saucermen?

236
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,080
Uh, you'll have to refresh my memory.

237
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,640
Teenagers at Lover's Lane turned their auto headlights on them and they burst into smoke and disappeared.

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,380
It was that easy?

239
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,020
Yes.

240
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,900
It was like Triffids, all you have to do is spray them with salt water.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Yes, only if the military had known, you know.

242
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,420
You guys coming here?

243
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,140
They were having trouble suppressing the fact of an alien landing. That's also in that movie.

244
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,280
And if Martians come, all you have to do is sneeze on them.

245
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:36,840
I always thought they were from Venus, because of Forrest Ackerman's captions in his magazine where he called them the hydrocephalonic horrors from the planet Venus.

246
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,020
Oh my gosh. Have you heard about this?

247
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,880
Weren't they hydrocephalonic horrors?

248
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,560
Certainly.

249
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,960
And not only that.

250
00:11:45,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Years ago there was a vinyl model kit that you could put together of these critters and one of them showed the pituitary dwarf from inside the suit, which was an optional head that you could put on it and have him carry the Venusian head under his arm.

251
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,840
My tinnitus has just gotten a lot worse.

252
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,780
In addition, the hands come off and crawl around, they have eyeballs on the back and they inject you with alcohol.

253
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you remember?

254
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,860
I remember.

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,060
I'd like to remind you of the recent changes to the marshmallow lineup in the Lucky Charms.

256
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,560
That was a nice refreshing.

257
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:32,160
The star shape took more of a shooting star design in 2004, the orange five-pointed star being added together with a white trail.

258
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,660
Tiny sickles, wee hammers and little light stars.

259
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,200
More recently, in the late 2005, another different kind of marshmallow was added, the hidden key.

260
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,940
It is a solid yellow marshmallow that resembles the shape of an orange star.

261
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,320
The key is locked in chains.

262
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,040
You can see the key is locked in a closed door, similar to the shape of a tombstone.

263
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,340
Flat on the bottom, flat sides with a round top.

264
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:02,040
When liquid is added to the cereal, the sugar inside the marshmallow dissolves and the shape of a skeleton key appears as if by magic.

265
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,700
A skeleton?

266
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,340
Yes.

267
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,840
Lucky Charms and its magical hidden skeleton key.

268
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,200
Capers, xenotops and gravestones.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,740
Did you Irish thugs run off that sexy girl you had calling you?

270
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,640
Where's that sexy babe?

271
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,900
There's my dear handsome chintz.

272
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,000
There she is.

273
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I must be off for the evening.

274
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:27,940
My jaw is jittering because it is so cold out here where I am having to call from so that I can speak in a full tone of voice.

275
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,440
Yeah, where she comes from, they don't let women phone from inside a house.

276
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,680
Why don't you throw on some garments?

277
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
There's biddies in there.

278
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Less chilly.

279
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,260
Watch out for the biddies.

280
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,280
There are small, small children that must be up for work and school in the morning.

281
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,100
Ah, yes, we can't interfere.

282
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,680
They put their children to work, so.

283
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,860
The workaday world must go on.

284
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,540
Those children have to go to work early in the morning and get a good day's work in.

285
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes, sir.

286
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,180
But it has been lovely visiting with you all.

287
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,760
Thank you, Mrs. Queen of UFOs.

288
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,940
Now time to drop into a deep sleep.

289
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,180
Thank you, Mrs. Queen of UFOs, for coming to our class and giving a nice presentation.

290
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm detained in North Korea.

291
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,340
An airport spokeswoman says this is PR News.

292
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,160
Residents of the mid-Atlantic states created rivers of mud causing millions in property damage.

293
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,560
Coldest, snowiest emergency disaster emergency national guard state police shut down.

294
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,960
PR News canceled.

295
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,100
A commercial airplane crossed into North Korea on Christmas Day to protest religious PR News.

296
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,560
Sleep?

297
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,700
Well, yes, it's me.

298
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,980
And I'm calling up to find out if anyone there still knows how to smell the sleep.

299
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,800
No.

300
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,100
The dewy feathered sleep.

301
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,380
The sleep of the just.

302
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,500
It's Gabofam.

303
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,860
No, Mrs. Gabofam.

304
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Nobody knows how to do those two-sided...

305
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,100
That's not Mrs. Gabrogfran.

306
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,240
That's Mr. Gabrogfran's mom.

307
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh, this is so confusing.

308
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,140
I was wondering when the old, good old show was going to be back.

309
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,320
It's never coming back.

310
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,520
Mommy, I'm glad you're hearing the good old show for me.

311
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,260
It's all the real show, guys.

312
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,660
Well, you can still hear the good show on our Slack where we play ancient tapes.

313
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:09,780
Good old show.

314
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,320
The good show.

315
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,320


316
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,860
From the previous century.

317
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,840
From back in the days when good old...

318
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,300
The good old show for me.

319
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,080
Back when Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence were on and Philo and Lies and Gabrogfran.

320
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,700
Before the...

321
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,240
We love to play those old, old shows.

322
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,140
It became all from here to here.

323
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,240
Your lovely charms are magically delicious.

324
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,600
It's all programmed from Seattle now.

325
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,300
Oh, those are the days.

326
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Ever since Claire Channel took over the Puzzling Evidence show.

327
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:36,460


328
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,940
It's 420 and you can see the show the way it used to be.

329
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,760
Look at that.

330
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


331
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


332
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


333
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


334
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


335
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


336
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:39,760


337
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,100
In a golden glow of nostalgia.

338
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,540
It was never that good.

339
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,780
Lord.

340
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,680
And at this momentous moment of 420, I must take my leave.

341
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,020
And what about when...

342
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,920
Reverend Puzzling Evidence, Evidence Evidence.

343
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,920
There she goes.

344
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,540
Reverend Howell and Reverend Ivan Stang and...

345
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,060
Princess We Are Doe slipping beneath the bosom of the lake.

346
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,380
And what happened to the poor little collars smashed and crushed and reconstituted and

347
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,420
flushed?

348
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:09,480
I don't know.

349
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:09,540


350
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


351
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


352
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


353
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


354
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


355
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


356
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


357
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


358
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


359
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


360
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


361
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:09,620


362
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,760
They're magically delicious.

363
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,620
By a palinogenesis.

364
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,160
Just collect the ashes.

365
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,840
We turn them into the type material that we record on.

366
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,840
Well, what about the schluling the schlill?

367
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,420
No one knows how to do it these days.

368
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,400
They always have to be lucky sho.

369
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,180
You just have to put it in the hopper and give the crank a couple of turns for it.

370
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,400
Oh, that feels good.

371
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, you'll like it.

372
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,520
And when you drop into the collector, you'll be a new man.

373
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,600
If you like that, I'll be a new man.

374
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


375
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


377
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


378
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


379
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


380
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,600


381
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
Well, that tried the chipper.

382
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,620
You love the chipper.

383
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,300
As long as I...

384
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,580
I'll sort of eat new man.

385
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,620
...the chipper, our infuriated chimpanzee bites off faces.

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Oh, that's my style.

387
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,520
Yes, it's not to defeat a farm.

388
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,200
Queen, may I have some reverence?

389
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,040
I am off.

390
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,880
There she goes.

391
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,440
She's fading away like a little bubble.

392
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,040
Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs and a great American.

393
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,100
Yes, and she's helping me because since I started this call, I've lost over six pounds.

394
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,580
I'm not a human being.

395
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


396
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


397
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


398
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


399
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


400
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


401
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:09,580


402
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,180
I'm a human being.

403
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,380
Oh, that is sad.

404
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,800
Here's something for you.

405
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,860
Here's something.

406
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,560
Pink hearts, yellow bones, orange stars, pink holes...

407
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
Can't you use the star sign?

408
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
...and now, new blue diamonds.

409
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,440
Oh, new blue...

410
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,480
Oddly enough, puzzling evidence looks six pounds heavier.

411
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,180
Oh, it's because of that blue crop pillow you've been eating all night.

412
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,200
Oh, yes, that's true.

413
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,860
So, it's what about those six pounds I owe you?

414
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,260
Wait, this is not working at all.

415
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,960
I guess you can forget about that now.

416
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,360
And now...

417
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,300
This is all wrong, Joe.

418
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,940
...pink hearts, orange stars, yellow bones, green clovers, blue diamonds...

419
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:34,940


420
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,820
You're talking too fast.

421
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,340
...and now with the new...

422
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,020
I always have to write this down.

423
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,400
It's like some gambling game for kids.

424
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,400
...brown livers, purple lungs, green intestines, and pink hearts.

425
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,860
There's spin the GoPro, Brandon.

426
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Whoever points to has to kiss.

427
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,000
Heart stars, balloons, horseshoes, clovers, and blue moons, pots of gold, rainbows.

428
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,340
Who can keep up with this, Tom?

429
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,620
Gibbets and kidneys.

430
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm not going to be able to play this one in Cleveland because of all the Irish.

431
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,120
Smashings of bacon.

432
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,040
Rashers of ham.

433
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,600
The Irish will get upset when I play this.

434
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,340
Are you going to the...

435
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,760
Nobody cares when you bash the Irish.

436
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,440
They're great.

437
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,240
They're like a bashable...

438
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,560
I'm going to play this one.

439
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,560


440
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,560


441
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,560


442
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,560


443
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:09,640
...good-looking animal.

444
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,240
A vibrant group that nobody cares about anymore.

445
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,660
New caller, who do we have here?

446
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,480
...puzzling evidence...

447
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,060
I can see him, but I can't see his lips moving.

448
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,020
I'm in the same room in Philo's office...

449
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,440
See, what's funny is I actually can see his lips moving.

450
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,020
...on the screen right now.

451
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,980
Philo's making coffee.

452
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,880
We're making calls.

453
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,240
Who makes me mean it?

454
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,720
It's pornography.

455
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
It's a natural consequence of my synesthesia

456
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,900
is that every time I hear someone talking,

457
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,860
I see lips moving in the backs of my eyelids.

458
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah, I smell colors.

459
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,480
Sometimes I see subtitles, too.

460
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:52,980
And they don't smell none too good in here.

461
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,320
Your day-to-day life, like, imagine going through life

462
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,020
with there being subtitles for everything that everyone says.

463
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,720
Yeah, Japanese subtitles.

464
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,260
Well, mine are actually in English.

465
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,340
That's the funny thing, you know,

466
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,520
because they're speaking English to me.

467
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,900
Like, it's always in the language that they're speaking.

468
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,400
If I can figure out what they're saying.

469
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,880
Well, do you, like, parenthesize Martian

470
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,180
or whatever you're paraphrasing?

471
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,140
Oh, yeah, Martian, definitely.

472
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,960
Like, it looks poise, you know?

473
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,480
If I could do that, I wouldn't need the hearing aid.

474
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,500
There's a number of different Martian dialects, though,

475
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
and you've got to be really careful about which one you go.

476
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,680
Because it's not just that Martian is a tonal language.

477
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,860
You know, if you go like...

478
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,280
versus...

479
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,760
Like, that's the difference between

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,920
I was milking your cow and I was milking your mother.

481
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,540
So you've got to be really careful

482
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,260
when, yeah.

483
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,020
You can find out more about that on those here,

484
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,540
Lindquan and RadioValencia.fm,

485
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
where they have a Martian on their show.

486
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,200
Really?

487
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:46,960
Oh, that's right.

488
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,360
They do have a Martian on RadioValencia.fm.

489
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,060
Well, they have a whole, like, community there,

490
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,380
and they play music from the harbor and stuff like that.

491
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,680
So they're, like, openly admitting...

492
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,820
They're openly admitting to harboring illegal aliens.

493
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,980
I mean, we've had a ban on visitation from Martians

494
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,800
ever since the 50s.

495
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,420
Yeah.

496
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,860
That's pretty bold to not just smuggle a Martian

497
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,360
into the country.

498
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,740
But advertise that you do.

499
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,700
That ban was hindered by the Martians

500
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,820
because they were here first.

501
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,380
Now there's all these cultural issues,

502
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:12,980
like, you know,

503
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,660
sir, you know, your skull is exposed

504
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,740
and stuff like that.

505
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,140
Could you...

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,660
For them, that is like a religious thing

507
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,620
to expose your skull in public.

508
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,280
Well, you know,

509
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,120
according to some definitions,

510
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,300
we are the Martians.

511
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,300
Yeah.

512
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,560
I shouted out who killed the Martianese,

513
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,800
and after all, it was you and my knees.

514
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,920
Be great, yeah.

515
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,560
That's Traeger's talk.

516
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,080
That's what it is.

517
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
The corporate states of America

518
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
to claim that you are the Martians

519
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,100
rather than they are.

520
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,920
Yeah.

521
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,800
Well, how could we just like to

522
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,500
put them on staff, keep them busy?

523
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,300
Well, you know, I am a devotee

524
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,100
of the Roman deity Mars.

525
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,840
Oh, yeah.

526
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,300
Good idea.

527
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,900
The Roman deity Mars, yeah.

528
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,960
The god of war and blood.

529
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh, Mars.

530
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,280
Conquer.

531
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,780
Yeah.

532
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,220
I guess.

533
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:57,740
Yeah.

534
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,040
I like to run my enemies before...

535
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,180
Yeah.

536
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,680
See the fight...

537
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,260
Talking on the show.

538
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,580
...or something like that.

539
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,360
Unfortunately, all of my gods

540
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:05,960
are full of...

541
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,720
Peanuts.

542
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:07,620
Yeah.

543
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,660
It's part of the show.

544
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,320
See, but my god has almonds

545
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,020
instead of peanuts.

546
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,700
That's what makes him so tasty.

547
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,180
Yeah.

548
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:14,380
Yeah.

549
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,400
Top of the line.

550
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,740
You can get that particularity

551
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,200
from that.

552
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,460
Mundane working class god, I guess.

553
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,460
Well, working class god

554
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,140
is something to be...

555
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,680
It's so immediate.

556
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,740
I don't think god is something to be...

557
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,640
If he only knew the philosophical

558
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,820
and conundrums he just advanced

559
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,740
himself into.

560
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
And the cult of Mars has its...

561
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,500
Well, I think it's temple services

562
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,660
on Tuesdays, actually.

563
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,960
That's the holy day of Mars.

564
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,660
They have to do their running throughs

565
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,040
and their sword dances and stuff.

566
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,400
Yeah.

567
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,140
How can that be?

568
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, the reason it's on Tuesdays

569
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,680
because it's...

570
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,940
Well, in Spanish, it's Martes,

571
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,920
which, you know, it's the day of Mars.

572
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,740
That's true.

573
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,140
That's it.

574
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,480
Yeah.

575
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,760
I love it.

576
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,160
All that Roman stuff.

577
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,880
No, thanks.

578
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,080
Well, Stang is familiar with Wotan's Day.

579
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,200
Oh, yes.

580
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,500
Yeah.

581
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,040
Well, yeah.

582
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,200
That's...

583
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,540
It's also...

584
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,000
I even had a band with Dr. Drummond,

585
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
and I had a band called Doctors for Wotan.

586
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,060


587
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,740
We knew everything about Wotan.

588
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,660
And Wotan...

589
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,700
I've got his missing eyeball

590
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,720
in my briefcase.

591
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,780
You know, the Wotan services,

592
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,180
of course, you know, you...

593
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,020
They do have a big orgy

594
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,160
because those are had on Wednesday,

595
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,880
which is hump day.

596
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,280
Hump day?

597
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,640
Yes.

598
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,640
Of course.

599
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,460
Yes.

600
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,720
Hump day, donkey day.

601
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
But only elephants or protrusions

602
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,800
are allowed.

603
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,680
Usually, some of them, like,

604
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,880
are categorically smaller,

605
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,060
but some of them, you know,

606
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,280
their brains well back to, you know,

607
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,340
exposed skulls and brains...

608
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,720
And his priests are all hunchbacks.

609
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,700
His priests are all hunchbacks nowadays.

610
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,320
As they should be.

611
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,100
They should have, like,

612
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,640
those bald pates with the...

613
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,260
Well, don't forget this little spot.

614
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,080
Yeah, like a capuchin.

615
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,500
I think the one gig card

616
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,880
and a little reader.

617
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,520
It's got the wheels for the helichopper.

618
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,440
It's got the camera that fits in the nose.

619
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,300
It can fly over Bob's house

620
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,340
and watch the orgies as they unfold.

621
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,940
Man, what a...

622
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,340
There's no better way to go.

623
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,460
Yeah.

624
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,520
I mean, if you have to.

625
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,660
Of course, you know.

626
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,360
I don't want to go.

627
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,280
Well, the way to go

628
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,820
is to jump into Bob's pipe.

629
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,920
Or to relieve yourself.

630
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Or to let him smoke you.

631
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,440
In a public place, if possible.

632
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,340
That's a true expression of freedom in my...

633
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,800
You know, that's just where I'm coming from.

634
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,060
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

635
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,120
Bob's pipe is big enough for all of us.

636
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,100
Yep.

637
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,820
It's a fatty,

638
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,360
as they usually say in French.

639
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,320
Yes.

640
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,860
Actually, I believe the French pronunciation is

641
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,580
fat-ee.

642
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,680
Le fat-ee.

643
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,740
Le fat-ee.

644
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,160
Le fat-ee.

645
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,020
These guys are so show-off.

646
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,320
Because they're cultured out there in Cleveland.

647
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,380
Because I can...

648
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,720
Because I can pronounce fake words.

649
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,480
Like Clare.

650
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,340
Yeah, I can't pronounce fake words.

651
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,660
I just...

652
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,800
I can't pronounce them.

653
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,180
They're fake.

654
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,540
Okay, Stang.

655
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,340
Here's an...

656
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,580
Pronounce the word insouciant.

657
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh, yeah.

658
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,740
And then give me the terminology.

659
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,840
But that's not a fake word.

660
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,980
I actually did not know how it was pronounced

661
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,620
until now.

662
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,560
You know, I used the word insouciant

663
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
the first time I ever got drunk.

664
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,420
What does it really mean, though?

665
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:02,840
I...

666
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,360
It occurred to me that I was insouciant.

667
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,880
It means you're without worries, without cares.

668
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,620
Ah, insouciant.

669
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,400
Yeah.

670
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,620
Sans souci.

671
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,500
There was actually...

672
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,360
I think there used to be a restaurant.

673
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,200
Maybe it's still there or not, like in Tower City.

674
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,620
Yeah, Tower City.

675
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,080
There's a restaurant called Sans Souci.

676
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,440
Oh, Sans Souci.

677
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,940
That's what they say in Francais.

678
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,080
They say Sans Souci.

679
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,800
That's French for Hakuna Matata.

680
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,500
Hakuna Matata.

681
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,480
I can see it on the subtitles there.

682
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,340
Yeah.

683
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,280
These are...

684
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,420
I think...

685
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,360
I need glasses.

686
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,300
I need a sub...

687
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,340
I need glasses.

688
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


689
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


690
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


691
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


692
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


693
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,780
Subtitles and a hearing aid to hear the show.

694
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,260
You can also shingle your roof with subtitles.

695
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,160
Oh, you could use...

696
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,120
If you're a true subgenius, you should have subtitles.

697
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,820
...your last operation.

698
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,120
I couldn't bring myself...

699
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,360
Can you bring yourself...

700
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,080
Don't worry.

701
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,700
You can't speak until the funny microphone sound effects record has been ceased.

702
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,420
And I think it stopped.

703
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,680
I think it stopped.

704
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,640
With the back end...

705
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,360
There we go.

706
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,020
There you are.

707
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,000
There's a glitch in the tiny...

708
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,160
I think Dr. Howell's doing it.

709
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,760
...fire.

710
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,780
Well, there could have been a strange supernatural phenomenon.

711
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,040
And here, a mischievous sprite or an imp playing tricks...

712
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,820
Haltergeist.

713
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,020
Yes.

714
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,200
Holtergeist.

715
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,800
They make up the principal part of spontaneous material manifestation.

716
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,600
Or the principal type.

717
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,040
Speaking of howling, Dr. Drummond and his daughter and I heard a hoot owl out in the

718
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,340
woods.

719
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,300
Are you sure you ain't just as crazy as a hoot owl?

720
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,760
No.

721
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,660
We heard it.

722
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:35,660


723
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,180
It was a great movie.

724
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,180


725
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,620
It was a real animal, man.

726
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:37,800
Yeah.

727
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,920
Well, that's pretty damn good.

728
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,180
It's like a live animal.

729
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,840
Believe me.

730
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,300
It's an honor to hear a hoot owl out in the woods.

731
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,240
I am...

732
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,460
It was a live animal, man.

733
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,140
We heard one.

734
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,860
We know that it still exists.

735
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,680
I see deer every day.

736
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,520
No matter where I go, I see deer.

737
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,320
There are...

738
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
You do.

739
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,280
You see deer.

740
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,300
Yes, I...

741
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,820
I really do.

742
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,500
I see deer.

743
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,960
I see deer on every highway.

744
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
I haven't seen one today, actually.

745
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,340
I have not seen a deer in...

746
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,740
in Dr. Drummond's neighborhood.

747
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,420
I hear deaf people.

748
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,160
But I bet you have.

749
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,280
Hmm.

750
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:10,940
Yes.

751
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,000
They're everywhere.

752
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,040
And I say bring back the wolves.

753
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,260
Those deer are eating at my little flower bed

754
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
in my front garden.

755
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,740
We're not answering the phone tonight,

756
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,300
so please stop calling whoever's trying to.

757
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,800
It won't work and it spoils the program.

758
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,360
Huh?

759
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,380
I said I hear deaf people.

760
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,780
I know, we heard that.

761
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,120
Yeah, that's a terrifying revelation.

762
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,800
We might have to change the entire nature

763
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,320
of this broadcast into...

764
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,100
They make sounds.

765
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,640
Deaf people do.

766
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,480
They make sounds they can't hear.

767
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,540
It's true.

768
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,960
Honk if you're deaf.

769
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,340
Well, it'll take a moment

770
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,160
for the consecutive translation.

771
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,780
So we're going to have that honk-a-thon

772
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,060
in a little while.

773
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,260
So you can get away with that

774
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,740
because they...

775
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,640
You know why I'm talking about.

776
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,120
Well, what are you talking about now?

777
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,480
I would like you to explain yourself.

778
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,540
Making fun of the deaf.

779
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,760
But, my dear sir,

780
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm sympathizing with them.

781
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,140
This is a radio show.

782
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,200
And besides that,

783
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
I think that deaf people

784
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,580
have just as much of a sense of humor.

785
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,520
I happen to know that they talk...

786
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,640
Oh, my, the phones are ringing off the board.

787
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,820
They have funny names for us hearing people.

788
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,180
Oh, of course they do.

789
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,420
They have their whole subculture

790
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,300
of ways of...

791
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,280
Of making fun of us.

792
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,240
...of feeling like they've got one up on us.

793
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,380
Of us hearing people.

794
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,760
Well, they are without having to listen

795
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,180
to a lot of annoying chatter.

796
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,220
Yeah, and a lot of bad music.

797
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,740
The other day,

798
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,460
I was eating in a little restaurant

799
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,480
with my friend Mr. Sister

800
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,720
and his son, Princess Lee.

801
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
A name-dropper.

802
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,120
And this...

803
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,080
A woman walked over

804
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,240
from across this busy restaurant

805
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,220
and said,

806
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm blind, by the way.

807
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,360
I couldn't help but hear

808
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,280
what you were saying

809
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,460
about such and such.

810
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,240
And she threw in her comments.

811
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,040
We'd seen her

812
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,940
around the neighborhood a lot before

813
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,300
but had never talked to her.

814
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,160
And I realized that

815
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,280
I could...

816
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,960
While I could barely hear

817
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,540
these guys talking to me

818
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,340
over their burgers

819
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,040
right in front of my face...

820
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,540
She was across the room and heard it.

821
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,620
She was across the room

822
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,780
and could hear everything

823
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,260
everybody said.

824
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,560
I was reading their lips.

825
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,360
But that means in addition to...

826
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,720
As soon as she walked away,

827
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:29,940
I went,

828
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,920
did you see how funny-looking

829
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,860
that blind woman was?

830
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,460
But she...

831
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,000
I know she did.

832
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,580
She has to have exceptionally good eyes

833
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,140
to be able to see lips across the room.

834
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,720
I know I couldn't do it.

835
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,600
No, no, she could hear.

836
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,280
She was blind.

837
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,800
She was hearing their lips move.

838
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,680
I thought you said she saw their lips move.

839
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,840
I may have said that.

840
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,560
I may well have said that.

841
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,460
No, I meant she heard the sounds...

842
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,840
I'm always a few steps behind.

843
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,800
She heard the sounds their lips made.

844
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,480
Pope Black was right about me.

845
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,580
I'm just a sort of dull-witted person.

846
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,040
Several steps behind.

847
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,120
Dr. Hal is stupid.

848
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,800
Quote.

849
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, yeah, that's what Pope Black said.

850
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,080
He said that, yeah.

851
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,000
And he must have known

852
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
what he was talking about.

853
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,320
It was after a rant in Amsterdam.

854
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,560
Dr. Hal got up and did his usual brilliant thing.

855
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,760
And David Lee Black later said,

856
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,760
Dr. Hal is stupid.

857
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,640
And in his mind,

858
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,420
I'm sure he spelled stupid with an E.

859
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,780
Hmm.

860
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,320
That's just the way they are, you know.

861
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,640
How about two O's?

862
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,020
No, that would look too deliberate.

863
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,360
Maybe he was just making a joke.

864
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,800
That's the way Mad Magazine spells stupid.

865
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,320
They mean it.

866
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,720
I invented a new religion called

867
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,760
I-do-itology.

868
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,100
When did that happen?

869
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,260
Is this a subset of the church?

870
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,580
It might as well be.

871
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,120
It's for idiots,

872
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,860
but idiots can't spell idiot.

873
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,100
They spell it usually as if it were to say I-do-it.

874
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,860
I-do-it.

875
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,060
It's really more related to Scientology

876
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,240
than Church of the Set Genius.

877
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,140
Well, it sounds somewhat similar.

878
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,480
I-do-itology.

879
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,660
You can't...

880
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,360
You have to say it that way

881
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
even though it doesn't make sense to other people.

882
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,740
Like, you do it all is the idea.

883
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,060
Because it's more realistic.

884
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,220
If the real idiots made a church,

885
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,740
they'd spell it I-do-itology.

886
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:19,760
Yeah.

887
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,180
And probably have.

888
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,280
If I thought of it,

889
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,580
then somebody somewhere's already done it.

890
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,620
I did it.

891
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,580
You did it.

892
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,380
You started the Church of I-do-itology.

893
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,920
But what about the Church of the Subgenius?

894
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:31,660
The subgenius.

895
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,440
Isn't that what they all want to hear us talk about?

896
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,420
We are.

897
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,520
Well, you're talking about the Church of I-do-itology.

898
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,240
Everything falls...

899
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,800
Well, part of our tenets in the Church of the Subgenius

900
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,160
includes the power...

901
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,240
the plan to spin off into a schism

902
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,980
every time we think of a new one.

903
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,980
Anything a subgenius...

904
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,480
Instantaneously.

905
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,700
Like the universe itself.

906
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,840
Starting new religions at the...

907
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,600
It's just instantaneously.

908
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,280
The sacred concept of erasability.

909
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,100
Dr. Drummond himself was taught that by Bob.

910
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,100
Directly.

911
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,140
I've had people try to evoke the sacred doctrine of erasability to say,

912
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,500
well, I'm the new high E-pop.

913
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,380
I said, well, I invoke the sacred doctrine of erasability to say you're not.

914
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,180
And also, I own the trademark.

915
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,740
So, go shove it.

916
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,400
Well, they're trying to take a job which is not open.

917
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
No one can just become an E-pop.

918
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,340
And an actual E-pop would not say that he was, but would rather show.

919
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:32,820
Show.

920
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:33,900
Right.

921
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,040
Bob doesn't have to brag.

922
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,700
You don't hear Bob bragging himself up.

923
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,280
It's about doctrine.

924
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,000
It's not the real Bob.

925
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,160
It's about doctrine that's, you know, the revealed doctrine.

926
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,360
Not some Bobby's doctrine in his head anyway, you know.

927
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,600
I wish you would talk closer to the mic like you care.

928
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,760
I do care, but I'm on this short little chair here.

929
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,300
No, no.

930
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,140
It's all right.

931
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,140
Let me wiggle it again.

932
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,820
Now just wiggle until you feel comfortable.

933
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Get comfy.

934
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,440
And put up your...

935
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,900
Your seat.

936
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,700
Your feet or whatever.

937
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,680
Now I've turned it completely off.

938
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,660
Bang the microphone as much as you want.

939
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,260
And then when it's all finished, the voice of the bard, Ivan Stang, shall be heard again in the land.

940
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,320
Oh, I can use your mic.

941
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:26,980
At WCSB, you may have noticed that any time you touch the table you're sitting at, you hear a booming sound like thunder.

942
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,380
A sound of thunder.

943
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,100
I feel like Lemmy.

944
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,380
Have you ever seen Lemmy on Motorhead?

945
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,560
He always sticks his...

946
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,000
He...

947
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,300
He has the mic way up like this so he can stick his head up and go...

948
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,520
But is that comfortable?

949
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,540
It's a way of avoiding popping.

950
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,720
It is.

951
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,880
It's a way of avoiding...

952
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,100
And I'm...

953
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,820
See, I'm no longer popping.

954
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,360
But you don't...

955
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,300
You might pop the vertebra in your neck by bending your head back so severely.

956
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
Stress the atlas joint until it...

957
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,060
The easel speeds!

958
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,680
The easel speeds!

959
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
The popping sound was heard.

960
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,160
The easel speeds!

961
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,720
Well, I...

962
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:12,980
I do salute you, though, for the inventiveness with which you have approached this problem, which characterizes the overman's typical behavior.

963
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,160
Yes, I saw this on a picture once.

964
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,240
Yes, in all ways.

965
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,880
He did it for you, Dr. Howe.

966
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,720
I know, selflessness.

967
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,780
The bar was poking you in the posterior.

968
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,100
Yes, I know.

969
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,920
The bar was trying to have its way with you.

970
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,540
Well, but fortunately, a noble being saved me from an ignoble fate.

971
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,640
We were...

972
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,680
We were joking over here because it was pointing at you.

973
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,060
It was pointing at you, precariously, waiting to make its own...

974
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,080
You be the...

975
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,780
The...

976
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:35,920
The...

977
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,440
Instigator of the sound.

978
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,180
You know, if that's all they throw at me, then I'll say, God damn it, it's all right.

979
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,460
That sounds like Winston Churchill to me.

980
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,860
I...

981
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,500
I...

982
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,780
I...

983
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,060
I...

984
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,240
I...

985
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,320
I...

986
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,780
I...

987
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:49,780


988
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:49,940
I...

989
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:49,940


990
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:49,960
I...

991
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:49,980
I...

992
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,320
I...

993
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,260
I...

994
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,200
I...

995
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,000
I...

996
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,260
I...

997
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,280
I...

998
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:04,380
I...

999
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,520
I...

1000
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:04,660
I..

1001
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,580
I...

1002
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,060
I...

1003
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,180
I...

1004
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:07,200
I...

1005
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,200


1006
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,320
I...

1007
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:07,320


1008
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,000
I...

1009
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000


1010
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,320
I...

1011
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,200
I...

1012
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,200


1013
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,280
I...

1014
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,100
I...

1015
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,100


1016
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,260
I...

1017
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,260


1018
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,780
I...

1019
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,360
I...

1020
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,340
I...

1021
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,320
I...

1022
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,540
Fly.

1023
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,580
Run by the gals.

1024
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,120
Flee.

1025
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,480
Fly with your hearts and your stars.

1026
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,500
Flee, Fiance.

1027
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:22,980
Fly.

1028
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,460
Isn't it sex day today?

1029
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,920
Sex day.

1030
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,220
It is not.

1031
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,060
Every day is sex day.

1032
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,400
Oh, I guess not.

1033
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,100
You haven't been doing your subgenius catechism.

1034
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,040
No, but I always have to be like a child.

1035
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,180
Don't you remember what our lawgiver laid down?

1036
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,640
What is this catechism they're talking about?

1037
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,380
It's like a little chat box on the left side of the...

1038
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,060
Something you do on...

1039
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,640
A chat box?

1040
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,860
There's shit in...

1041
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

1042
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,960
You just have to empty that.

1043
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,020
Rake through your chat box.

1044
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,240
She said chicken, I think.

1045
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,640
Take the solid waste out.

1046
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,820
Mail it to Bob D.

1047
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,000
1,000 tons of solid waste.

1048
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,720
Yes, that's true.

1049
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,440
The solid waste management company will have something to say about this.

1050
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
What about the solid waste management team?

1051
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,600
I drove past several solid waste management companies in the desert in New Mexico.

1052
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,700
You passed them because you did not deign to stop them.

1053
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,660
I assumed that that was a euphemism.

1054
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,720
You're looking for a graveyard.

1055
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,880
Oh, I still manage my solid waste.

1056
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,020
I should be lying in the graveyard.

1057
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,220
Okay, let's go to the graveyard.

1058
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,860
Here we are.

1059
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,840
I have to transfer responsibility of my solid waste over to the municipal water department every morning.

1060
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,720
I'm covered with dew.

1061
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,700
Get out of that municipal water.

1062
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,920
That's for everybody to drink.

1063
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,240
Oh, at that point it's known as wastewater.

1064
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,140
And look at the size of the skeeters they've got out here.

1065
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,420
Those things are mutants.

1066
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,420
We all pay for ourselves.

1067
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,160
It's magically delicious.

1068
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,640
Would you stop it with this Irish Lucky Charms thing?

1069
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
It's driving me mad.

1070
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
Mad, I tell you.

1071
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,620
Okay, I'm sorry.

1072
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,540
Which part is it that drives you mad the most, the Lucky Charms or the Irish?

1073
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,660
The hammering of the nail.

1074
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Oh, okay.

1075
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,760
The part about the hearts and stars and horseshoes and clovers.

1076
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,440
Yeah, the horses and bolfers.

1077
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,520
Dead horse shoes.

1078
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,520
On the dead horse.

1079
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,940
It's a night of fire.

1080
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,120
By Porsche.

1081
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,900
And the Porsche kicked him right in the jaw and broke his hip.

1082
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,880
He came out from the set, not keeping time to the back.

1083
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,320
I hear lions in the back.

1084
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,700
So where's Lies?

1085
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
I thought we were having a reunion here.

1086
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,080
He's in that hourglass that the sand is falling down on.

1087
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,860
They call him up to wake him up.

1088
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,940
Wake up Lies.

1089
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,660
He has no right to sleep when the rest of us are awake.

1090
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,140
Why don't you call him and wake him up so that he's ready for us when we call?

1091
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,340
Because.

1092
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm not a doctor.

1093
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,260
Let's go over to his house.

1094
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,560
I'm a mere intern.

1095
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,740
Let's go over to his house and take pictures of all his artwork and put it on the internet.

1096
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,780
The solid yellow marshmallow shaped like a sandwich is something that Lucky Charms fans.

1097
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,660
Shut up about that Lucky Charms.

1098
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,700
Damn you, Philo.

1099
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,840
I swear I'll kill you.

1100
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,260
I'm going to kill you.

1101
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,380
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor.

1102
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,660
I didn't use an Irish accent.

1103
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,140
I was just trying to work it in.

1104
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,180
I'm not using an Irish accent.

1105
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
Give me my permission.

1106
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,540
I don't have to give an Irishman permission to use an Irish accent.

1107
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,260
The wicked boasts death of his heart's desire and blessed for covetousness of the Lord and Paul.

1108
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
You can abuse the Irishman freely.

1109
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,340
They're the only ethnic group that are allowed to be abused in public.

1110
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,580
God damn it is a real easy one to cut.

1111
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,440
You can turn that into a damn it and nobody will ever know the difference.

1112
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,900
But you don't have to have censorship here on this radio show.

1113
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,600
There's a Wi-Fi hotspot around here called FBI surveillance band.

1114
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,100
Huh?

1115
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,800
Now let's not interfere with our friends in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1116
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,960
You know, Big Brother and Big Sister don't have to do this.

1117
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:07,920
Or our friends at Transportation Security Agency and the National Security Agency now called with perfect coordination the...

1118
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,280
What?

1119
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,860
Everybody's, you know, trying to get Big Brother and Big Sister.

1120
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,260
I want to get Big Brother and Big Sister's attention.

1121
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,440
I want to have as many friends on Facebook as I can.

1122
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,480
Don't you want to be a Big Brother of America?

1123
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,720
I'll be like those people on TV on Superstar Date and dance along.

1124
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,440
Everybody just wants to be a star.

1125
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,740
I'm going to be famous on Facebook.

1126
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
I'm going to make Yahoo comments and let them know who they're dealing with.

1127
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,220
I just want a Wikipedia entry.

1128
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,600
Anybody out there can be my friend if they make a Wikipedia entry.

1129
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,220
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1130
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,300
Well, they've been making one about you.

1131
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,920
But what if it was...

1132
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,260
Some ignorant blunderer telling a complete untruth about your great...

1133
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:49,880
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1134
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,500
That's the response.

1135
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,640
That's where it begins.

1136
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,960
I don't.

1137
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,080
Listen to the prank call tapes, Dr. Drummond.

1138
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,420
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1139
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,840
Count how many times you hear that.

1140
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,380
When the guy catches on that he's being pranked and he gets mad.

1141
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,900
You don't know who you're dealing with.

1142
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,320
Yeah.

1143
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
That's the threat that he makes.

1144
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,060
Well, you better solve five then.

1145
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,820
Half the Internet is people saying,

1146
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,300
you don't know who you're dealing with.

1147
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:23,460
And they flash that giant bowie knife they hold up with the serrations on it.

1148
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,740
In real life, that's different.

1149
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,680
Then you know who you're dealing with, the dangerous guy with the knife.

1150
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,120
When they do that on a prank call or the Internet,

1151
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,020
it's just a loudmouth hollering.

1152
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,780
Say, pardon me, but you're somewhat mistaken.

1153
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,680
I do know who I'm dealing with, a large, angry man with a knife.

1154
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,100
Right.

1155
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,860
All right.

1156
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,200
More or less had to say that a couple of times.

1157
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,500
But what are you going to do about it?

1158
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,220
That's my question.

1159
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,000
In real life, I've had to a couple of times say, oh, I'm sorry.

1160
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,120
I'm really sorry that I made you mad.

1161
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,720
I do know who I'm dealing with.

1162
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,300
And it was a dumb thing for me to say.

1163
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,180
I do know who I'm dealing with.

1164
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,120
And I know that in life, we are often troubled.

1165
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,580
And if I can lift your burden in some way.

1166
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,220
Other times I've found that just running works.

1167
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,360
Usually I can run faster than drunk bullies.

1168
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,940
Let me run.

1169
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,780
I'm running for my health.

1170
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,060
I used to be able to.

1171
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Now I don't know a place for an old man no longer.

1172
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm sorry for saying that.

1173
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,880
Flying around the moon and no attention paid directly matters no more.

1174
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,920
Well, now you're being too sad.

1175
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,480
It can't be that bad.

1176
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,200
You didn't have grandkids beating on you like I did for a day.

1177
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,760
Well, uh...

1178
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,740
I never know whether I'm really here at the show or just...

1179
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,480
Or if you're just a tape recording of it.

1180
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,120
Of some previous time you were on the show.

1181
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,060
If I'm in the desert or looking at my home movies of the desert or...

1182
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,260
I think I'm in the desert now looking at home movies of me on the show and listening to me on the show.

1183
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,240
That's what Princess Wee was doing just a little while ago in her car.

1184
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,980
She was in the car just laying around in the car in the middle of the night.

1185
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:02,760
Hmm.

1186
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,600
Sounds tasty, really.

1187
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,000
It sounds like French toast on a stick.

1188
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,340
Yeah.

1189
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,400
That could be the culinary sensation.

1190
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,760
You know, I remember the new...

1191
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:12,820
That was sweet to me.

1192
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:12,820


1193
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,280
French toast on a stick shops that are opening up all over town now.

1194
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,500
French toast on a stick.

1195
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,040
Mmm, yum.

1196
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,480
They put one right next to Beard Papa.

1197
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,640
In regular or premium?

1198
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,480
Have you been to Beard Papa?

1199
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,280
Beard Papa?

1200
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,360
No, but I've been to Hootie.

1201
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,340
Beard Papa National Monument.

1202
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,220
Beard Papa is this...

1203
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,080
The home of the Beard Papa.

1204
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,540
You wonder why it even exists.

1205
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,000
It's a cream puff place.

1206
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,240
All they sell is cream puffs and fondants.

1207
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,500
Oh, isn't that the oldest cream puff factory in Texas?

1208
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,600
This looks like some Swedish import.

1209
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,580
Oh, now you guys woke up the EO hippest.

1210
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,920
I can hear it peeing upstairs.

1211
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,060
That's like a racehorse.

1212
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,540
On a flat rock.

1213
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,700
Like a very small racehorse.

1214
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,900
Like on a flat rock, right?

1215
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,140
It just splashes everywhere.

1216
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,720
Like a cow peeing through a screen.

1217
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,800
Going down off the edge of a cliff onto a flat rock.

1218
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,180
I never could understand why they had to go through the screen.

1219
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,140
That gives it more of a hiss before the splash.

1220
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,720
Also, it filters out any impurities before the splash.

1221
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,080
You know, it's an old movie sound effect recording technique.

1222
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,600
About half the sound effects you hear are that very same sound.

1223
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,380
Car racks, everything.

1224
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:32,380
The sound of a cow peeing off a cliff onto a flat rock through a window screen.

1225
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,220
So you come into a free prostate biopsy clinic?

1226
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,540
I wish you hadn't mentioned that, Dr. Gubrog.

1227
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,800
Friend, I'm still hurting from the last...

1228
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,540
Well, me too.

1229
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:54,040
You get to be a male of a certain age and if you have health insurance, that gives them license to have their way with you.

1230
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,580
It's one more way to pay for health insurance.

1231
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:02,440
Luckily, my family doctor is a skinny little old former hippie woman.

1232
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:03,840
Oh.

1233
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,900
She's skinny. Well, she's my age.

1234
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,000
That's pretty old.

1235
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,240
And she's very, very skinny. Has skinny little fingers.

1236
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,800
Oh, that sounds good.

1237
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:12,800


1238
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,520
So fun.

1239
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,180
So you can take four at once.

1240
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,180
Oh!

1241
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:26,640
Princess Wee was in the room during my last examination and afterwards, after I'd been pounding the little table going,

1242
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,780
never go to prison, never go to prison, the doctor looks at Princess Wee and says,

1243
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,100
he is rather dramatic, isn't he?

1244
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:33,520
Well, I don't...

1245
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,560
She was right.

1246
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,140
Well...

1247
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,980
It helps ease the pain to scream and moan.

1248
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,360
It sure does.

1249
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,560
It does. It sure does.

1250
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,660
So did you have the full procedure or just barely the tickle?

1251
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,340
I've had both, actually.

1252
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,620
You had the 18 needles?

1253
00:43:52,100 --> 00:44:09,280
Well, I've had the one where they puff you up like a balloon and film your insides and carve away a few little polyps and then you stand there expelling a scentless, perfectly clean air while an orderly chit-chats you up.

1254
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,340
But you haven't had the 18 needles and the proper procedure?

1255
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,200
No.

1256
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,760
Oh, that's one to look forward to.

1257
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,240
Well, knowing me, I'm sure I'll make the acquaintance of every one of those 18 needles.

1258
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,520
I got it.

1259
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,660
That's something you can pick up, uh, simple.

1260
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,080
My papi has.

1261
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,320
Simple success.

1262
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,060
See how this show is changing?

1263
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:31,980
It's aged.

1264
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,260
It's matured.

1265
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,420
And we're stint sitting around talking about our physical ailments.

1266
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,480
Well, you are.

1267
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,960
Like regular people in their fifties.

1268
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm trying to work in my patented, my patented 13-year-old.

1269
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


1270
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


1271
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:42,320


1272
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,340
13 steps to super sexy sales.

1273
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,700
Oh, that's right.

1274
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,500
Dr. Drummond has been, uh, exercising and his butt is small.

1275
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,520
He's slim.

1276
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,800
Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success.

1277
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,340
We're in direct competition with Dr. Howe's, uh, course on sex and success in real estate.

1278
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,560
Yeah, and what about the Dobbs, uh, sex sales slavery?

1279
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,460
We actually don't care about the real estate part.

1280
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,960
Slave and save.

1281
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,460
Convenience store.

1282
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,080
This is the show.

1283
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,300
This is the show.

1284
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,500
This is the show.

1285
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,160
We're trying to put, we're going to put the slave and save convenience stores out of business.

1286
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,120
Damn you.

1287
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,540
Because we do that in the eighth step of our patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success

1288
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,080
course.

1289
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,900
Oh yeah.

1290
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:30,280
We still have the, we still have the burger God franchise and the beer God franchise.

1291
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,740
Right.

1292
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,460
That comes up in step number 10.

1293
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,300
Oh, what did we decide?

1294
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:40,140
The new, the new log, the slogans for beer God, beer God, killer and beer and then burger

1295
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,600
God.

1296
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,160
The hunger killer.

1297
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,140
The hunger murderer.

1298
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,240
Hunger murderer.

1299
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:44,480
Yeah.

1300
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,300
Oh yeah.

1301
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,520
Well I usually just eat at the cat Stevens pork shop myself.

1302
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,420
We like, uh, I'm feeling kind of thirsty.

1303
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,260
Reverend staying.

1304
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,940
I need some beer.

1305
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,620
God thirst killer.

1306
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,560
There it is.

1307
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,040
Here it comes now on the guitar.

1308
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,880
And the crowd loves it.

1309
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,660
They just go wild that throwing roses down on the floor.

1310
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,140
And you'll learn all about it.

1311
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm going to go.

1312
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1313
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1314
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1315
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1316
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1317
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1318
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1319
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1320
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1321
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,300


1322
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,300
We call that in step number four of Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success.

1323
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,360
Oh no, I skipped that one.

1324
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:30,160
You know, Dr. Drummond is, uh, brought out his new patented 13th step this year.

1325
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,100
I notice that dramatic music.

1326
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,880
There is a Lou Lou.

1327
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,020
The last year you know, most of yours is 12 step courses only have 12 steps.

1328
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,880
However, Dr. Drummond has managed to work in one more step in his 12-step course.

1329
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,360
The banana peel step.

1330
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,620
Making it into the first known patented 13-step course.

1331
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,180
My God, how can one fall so heavily to the concrete?

1332
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,520
Our group has a step zero, and it's really, really fine.

1333
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,140
Ah, yes, it's an easy step, though.

1334
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,100
That's as far as I ever got.

1335
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,120
It's the most rewarding step.

1336
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,620
Because you can still do all the bad stuff.

1337
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,980
And give yourself a pat on the back.

1338
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,460
Yeah, I go to support groups for that.

1339
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,220
Where we all sit around and indulge in every temptation.

1340
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,780
Well, not every.

1341
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,520
Every temptation we can afford or talk somebody into.

1342
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,980
Oh, the anal feature support group is usually fun.

1343
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,480
It's not that much to brag about.

1344
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,460
No, no.

1345
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,260
But you can't brag like you can if you have one more step.

1346
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,100
That breath is fine.

1347
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,900
That represents an 8% step increase in the overall number of steps in your average 12-step program.

1348
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,860
Well, one more than zero, that's an infinite increase.

1349
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,040
Well, I'm just telling you about real whole numbers.

1350
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,520
Ones you can actually touch.

1351
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,240
And the 13th step is a magnificent advancement in the 12-step program.

1352
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,960
There is no 13th step in this hotel.

1353
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:57,940
You can't know that.

1354
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,300
On the staircase.

1355
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,740
But you won't know that until you get to the fifth step of the patented 13-step program.

1356
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,080
You have to take these steps one mile.

1357
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,360
By one.

1358
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,760
They can't just be just.

1359
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,220
You can't go from step one to step six.

1360
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,280
You can't go from step four back to step three.

1361
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,300
No man must take one step at a time.

1362
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,420
Charging up that curve.

1363
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,520
And you're going to feel so good by the time you get to the 12th step.

1364
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,700
You're going to say, wow, you know, if I was in some other program right now, I would be at the end of the program.

1365
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,900
But I can tell right now that I've got 8% of my program left.

1366
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,220
Time to launch into the air.

1367
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,160
With the 13th step.

1368
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,080
You have to pay extra for this.

1369
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,920
You know this 13th step comes free in my program.

1370
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,620
The 13th step is absolutely free.

1371
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,840
Well, actually, the cost of the 13th step is amortized over the previous 12 steps.

1372
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:56,260
You can actually take the cost of the first step during the one portion of the 13th step itself.

1373
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:02,480
It's amortized across the entire time period of all 13 steps.

1374
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,540
That's what makes it cheaper on average.

1375
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,800
Your average step is cheaper.

1376
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,340
Well, but how much of a price can you put on it?

1377
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,380
So you can only charge.

1378
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,780
Dr. Howell can only divide his course by 12.

1379
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,960
But the zero step one is free.

1380
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,780
12 modules of higher and higher advance.

1381
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,520
We have a 100% discount on step zero.

1382
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,680
Success in sex and real estate.

1383
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,700
At first, you need pay absolutely nothing.

1384
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:30,880
That's right.

1385
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,380
My first free of 12.

1386
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,700
A one quarter value of Dr. Howell.

1387
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,420
That was astonishing.

1388
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:36,620
A one quarter value of Dr. Howell.

1389
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:36,620


1390
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,880
Course and success in real estate can be yours for this amazing one time offer.

1391
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,400
But remember, these are not given away easily.

1392
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:54,980
They are rather rung like drops of blood out of the ragged ropes of the rosary of pain.

1393
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,640
Dr. Howell.

1394
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Yes, I am here, my child.

1395
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,340
I hate to mention this again, Dr. Howell, but your program only has 12 steps.

1396
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:03,960
Well, that's true.

1397
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,240
The 12 steps up to the.

1398
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:06,620
Decathlon.

1399
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:16,160
From PR news in Washington, I'm experiencing tear gas pains and also fired paintballs at the Columbia campus of New York Presbyterian Hospital.

1400
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,000
An earthquake ravaged Haiti on Wall Street.

1401
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,320
Five.

1402
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,960
The Labor Department says this is PR.

1403
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,680
Estimated losses are in the range of 200 to 300 dollars.

1404
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,100
Former President Bill Clinton has two hearts.

1405
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,280
Steve Barnes, communication director for the Clinton Foundation, said Mr.

1406
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,180
Clinton is on his way.

1407
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,900
To PR news in Washington.

1408
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,540
Someone is trying to wrap his 13.

1409
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,940
Well, yes.

1410
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,520
Tell me, please.

1411
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,700
I'll answer your question.

1412
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,540
What has have you?

1413
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,440
What is your question?

1414
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,200
Well, what has 12 steps and no reason?

1415
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,020
I'm really depressed.

1416
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,400
Why?

1417
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,280
Why would you be depressed?

1418
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,480
I have bipolar.

1419
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,440
A bipolar.

1420
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,300
A bipolar nature.

1421
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,020
Yeah, bipolar illness.

1422
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:03,660
Mental.

1423
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,760
Um.

1424
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,160
What are the.

1425
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,580
Those two two poles?

1426
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,840
They're of course, all of us bipolar or not oscillate between the twin poles of pleasure and pain.

1427
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,380
But I rather like those poles.

1428
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,300
Last hour we have comments from the peanut.

1429
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,880
The real experts become pole dancers from Poland.

1430
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,440
Or just the author, Frederick.

1431
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:34,760
Paul.

1432
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:35,620
However.

1433
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:35,860
It happens.

1434
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,720
The pole dancers from Poland.

1435
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,980
Yes, the pole dancers.

1436
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,120
You'll learn about those in step nine of the Dr.

1437
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,180
Drummond's patented 13 steps to super sexy sales success course.

1438
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:59,640
I don't know why anyone would buy that when my original course in success and sex in real estate is now offering a special extended version, which is entirely digital compatible and has apps.

1439
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:00,920
Apps.

1440
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,440
I tell you.

1441
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,020
Available at subgenius.com.

1442
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,820
If you are.

1443
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,420
Available.

1444
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,960
At all rocket ride convenience marks.

1445
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:11,680
If you happen to be a little, a little resistant to these.

1446
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,160
God.

1447
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,660
To the real estate portion.

1448
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,100
With macro earthworms, each in his own earth and where earth.

1449
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,200
Success and success in real estate.

1450
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,600
Dr. Hell, you promised an oil well in step number seven.

1451
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:27,280
You don't have to worry about those messy real estate in Dr. Drummond's patented 13 steps.

1452
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,980
No, I worry about another mess.

1453
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,240
But the oil and I get along extremely well.

1454
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,780
We had real estate up until the fifth step.

1455
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,440
And then we decided to shut it off because it wasn't worth anything anymore.

1456
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,780
Unreal estates.

1457
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,300
When you shoved it into the cold black sky.

1458
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,100
You shoved it into the cold bin of destiny.

1459
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,680
And look where you are now.

1460
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,420
You be stride the earth like a Colossus.

1461
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,860
Look at us striding away there.

1462
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,360
Yeah.

1463
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,900
There's nothing like having the right.

1464
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,840
You're playing that stride.

1465
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,740
Having the right shoes.

1466
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:04,500
Our strident music is successfully courting us into the future.

1467
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
That's good.

1468
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,500
This music contains encoded signals.

1469
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,500
All the depressed callers.

1470
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,320
I'll allow you to get a word in it.

1471
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,440
Reach your subgenius potential.

1472
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,120
Yeah, I remember you.

1473
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,660
You know, I'd be willing to waive the usual fee.

1474
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,740
Just introduce you personally to my hands on course in success in sex and real estate.

1475
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,800
Well, I'm willing to fight the other caller right now.

1476
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,740
Can't you calm down?

1477
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,800
You excitable fellow.

1478
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,980
Calm yourself, please.

1479
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,480
I'm not.

1480
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:34,820
Don't worry.

1481
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,820
Sir, I implore you.

1482
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,100
Pray.

1483
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,040
Calm yourself.

1484
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,140
Step seven has plenty of hands on work in Dr. Drummond's patent.

1485
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,960
Not since 1834.

1486
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,100
And that disastrous duel fought at the Evergreen Club.

1487
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,580
We lay our hands on everything we can get our hands on.

1488
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,600
Dr. Powell, don't you think we should start a charity?

1489
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,340
Well, I have started many in my time.

1490
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,740
But in a way, I feel like one who was mocked who said that you said you could help others,

1491
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,380
but you cannot even help yourself.

1492
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,600
That's the kind of charity I think we should start.

1493
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,280
One that's going to help others this time.

1494
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:17,480
Other charities have had trouble doing that, but this one is going to be the one that actually

1495
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
helps others.

1496
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,600
Have you forgotten everything Bob taught you?

1497
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,020
Sometimes Philo just follows his own slackful path.

1498
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,460
You have to follow my logic.

1499
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,040
It's not completely revealed yet, but you have to start it.

1500
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,660
This is part of my 12 steps, my 13 steps.

1501
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:39,300
I've got 12 modules in my program, as you know, but you have 13 steps, which is interesting.

1502
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,960
The same as the number of steps to the scaffold.

1503
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,300
I was actually inspired by your 12 step program, Dr. Howell.

1504
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,400
Well, you know what they say is the sincerest form of flattery.

1505
00:54:50,540 --> 00:55:02,240
And your 12 step program inspired me to create my 13th step, which gives my program 8% more steps than the average 12 step program.

1506
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:12,240
And with this 8% increase in the number of steps, your listeners can now enjoy a full and flashy sex life.

1507
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,840
The high stepping ones can.

1508
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:22,180
As well as a better path to sales success, because this is the 13th step to super sexy sales success.

1509
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,640
Yes, but you're banking on the weather.

1510
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,860
This is my way of helping others.

1511
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,320
That's the thing, you're expecting a fair wind.

1512
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,220
I'm expecting a fair wind.

1513
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,840
Yeah, listen, they're talking about the weather while we're talking about the wind.

1514
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,320
That amazing coincidence.

1515
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:46,360
You know, we were talking earlier about the thing, and I noticed that these two turntables are labeled in handwritten ink on the wood.

1516
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,120
It's so quaint.

1517
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,160
Thing one and thing two.

1518
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,520
Yes, there's a tall feline individual who set those up.

1519
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,240
After the famous critters in the family hat let loose that terrible day.

1520
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,000
Yeah.

1521
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,200
Thing one and thing two.

1522
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,200
At the WCSB Halloween party, there was a fellow dressed as Thing.

1523
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:02,560
Thing two.

1524
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,320
You know, it's the only book that they read anymore, so naturally they are fun.

1525
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,820
They spread that horrible stain.

1526
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,360
Oh, that horrible stain.

1527
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:18,980
I have now read about ten Dr. Seuss books and recorded them for my grandkids.

1528
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,560
They are quite good.

1529
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,460
So that my, Princess Wee and I will switch off doing parts.

1530
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,660
Like she did Gertrude and blah, blah, blah.

1531
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,200
But we made these little CDs so that.

1532
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:38,560
My daughter could go through the pages while Dee-Daw and Wee-Maw read the book to her.

1533
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,020
And it's Dr. Seuss, so that's got to be good for any child's.

1534
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:43,940
Now who was that?

1535
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,640
Well, you would think.

1536
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,520
Dee-Daw.

1537
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,580
Dee-Daw, yeah.

1538
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,820
Dee-Daw and who's the.

1539
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,200
Wee-Maw.

1540
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:49,980
Lee-Maw.

1541
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:50,800
Wee-Maw.

1542
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,740
Princess Wee is Wee-Maw.

1543
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,500
Wee-Maw.

1544
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,960
Because we're grandpas.

1545
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,860
And Daw-Doo.

1546
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,040
Now, Dee-Daw.

1547
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,420
Do you want us to move that out of your way?

1548
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:58,880
We'll have to make noise.

1549
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,760
What, that baby talk?

1550
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,840
We'll have to make noise to do it, Dr. Seuss.

1551
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,880
Don't worry, everything's under control.

1552
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,380
Here's the horrible part about all of this.

1553
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:11,620
I thought, well, it's a nice idea, you hear your grandparents reading the Dr. Seuss book

1554
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,100
or whatnot.

1555
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,460
My ex-wife reads other books.

1556
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,120
I only do Dr. Seuss.

1557
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:24,000
Now, not a week after doing my last Dr. Seuss reading, and believe me, I'm not trying to

1558
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,280
be Boris Karloff about it.

1559
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,980
I walked into a Walmart.

1560
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,620
A Walmart.

1561
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,060
And they were selling.

1562
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,820
I don't know what they were selling.

1563
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:31,820


1564
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:31,820


1565
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,460
They were selling children's books.

1566
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,360
And on every page, there was a tiny recorder and a tiny playback unit.

1567
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,920
So that the idea was a parent would only have to read the book to the kid once.

1568
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:49,380
You'd read it once and each, the first, you'd push go, read the first page, push go on the

1569
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,720
second page and read it.

1570
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,440
And then from then on, the kid, it was like an electronic babysitter book.

1571
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,120
You read the book to your kid without having to be there.

1572
00:57:59,220 --> 00:57:59,520
Man.

1573
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,060
But the kid wants you to be there more than he wants anything else.

1574
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,880
Pretty soon, you can just throw the module at your kid when they want you to read and

1575
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,340
you just go off somewhere else.

1576
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,920
Well, that's a type of Pavlovian training, a nightmare condition from a totalitarian

1577
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,500
state.

1578
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,880
Yeah, and it's in every homes, in every homes, in every homes, in every homes, in every

1579
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,680
homes, in every homes, in every homes, in every homes, in every homes, in every homes,

1580
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,280
in every homes.

1581
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,480
And thanks to Hustling Evidence.

1582
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,120
Say, say.

1583
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:28,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1584
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:28,760
Welcome.

1585
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,140
Dr. Howell.

1586
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,760
He's not here.

1587
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,220
You're welcome.

1588
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,340
Dr. Philo Drummond.

1589
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:32,880
You're welcome.

1590
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,320
For the garage space.

1591
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,120
You're welcome.

1592
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,400
And Dr. Sinister and all the poor, poor callers who included Gary Grogfran at one point.

1593
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,340
So we should just keep talking at this point, right?

1594
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,080
Well, I'll have to cut all of this out.

1595
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,860
Screw all those edits, all the work you stayed up all night doing.

1596
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:47,640
Screw that.

1597
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,840
Let's just talk about the cool stuff and be how cool we are.

1598
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,360
Did I say subgenius.com?

1599
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,060
Not at all.

1600
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,680
If you need more information about this show or any of the other shows or the Church of

1601
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,500
the Subgenius, you may look at it.

1602
00:58:59,500 --> 00:58:59,500


1603
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,340
It's subgenius.com.

1604
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,920
You can also write to Subgenius Foundation, post office box 181-417, Cleveland Heights,

1605
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,840
Ohio 44118.

1606
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,000
It only took me like three years to unlearn the old Dallas number.

1607
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:16,740
Yeah.

1608
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:16,920
Yeah.

1609
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,460
And now no one remembers it at all.

1610
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,100
If they remember anything, they're doing better than me.

1611
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:23,820
What was I saying?

1612
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:24,360
Finding the old books.

1613
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,460
What was I just saying?

1614
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,900
It was about how do you do it wrong?

1615
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,420
Anyway, I'm really on my way home.

1616
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1617
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1618
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1619
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1620
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1621
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1622
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1623
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:29,480


1624
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,520
And we're not really still sitting here in Philo's garage.

1625
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,720
I heard you a voice on the radio.

1626
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:37,700
You're staying.

1627
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,300
Of course you know me.

1628
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,820
You were sent here to kill me.
