1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's talk about headache, fatal headache.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,940
Common side effects include heart failure,

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,780
persistent fever, bruising, bleeding,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,920
lymphoma, nervous system, and blood disorders.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,860
Envision your possibilities.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,800
From PR News in Washington,

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,580
I'm accused of killing Congolese militia peacekeepers

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,500
from Bangladesh who murdered the French serial murderer

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,900
nearly two months ago near the border with Uganda

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,040
to determine if there is any possible PR news in Washington.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,660
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,400
We are having operating difficulties,

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,140
which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,420
This is basic civil defense information

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,920
from the Department of Defense,

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,740
Office of Civil Defense, Washington,

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,780
especially in time of emergency.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:51,280
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,320
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,860
And follow instructions by...

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,740
Ivan Stang.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,820
You may receive warning of an attack by outdoor warning systems or by...

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,840
What, what, uh, what, uh...

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,580
Radio or television or even by word of mouth.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,300
Unless local officials have instructed you otherwise,

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,200
go immediately to a...

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,760
Moab.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,700
My friend, you're in the desert.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,500
Then tune your radio to any local station that is broadcasting...

31
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,640
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

32
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,320
Watch it!

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,140
And listen for official information.

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
Follow whatever instructions are given.

35
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,840
Depend on radio, as the government will be broadcasting...

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,380
You don't, yeah, you don't come back now.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,920
I know you've been to some of you...

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Let me repeat, let me repeat.

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,360
In time of emergency, for official government information

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,940
and civil defense instructions,

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,900
tune your radio to any local station that is broadcasting...

42
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,000
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,460
Uh, yes, dear friend.

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,020
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,600
Yes.

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,340
Ah, friends.

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,400
Ah, yes, dear friends.

48
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Ah, yes.

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
Ah, yes, my friends.

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,720
Dear friends of the, uh...

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,900
Everybody doesn't like something.

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,020
But nobody doesn't like...

53
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,160
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,660
Yes, it's so beautiful.

55
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,340
That official information was brought to you by

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,660
Reverend Chain Smirker in Australia.

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,680
But this forthcoming official information,

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,920
which may contradict other official information,

59
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,700
is from Mr. Sister.

60
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,800
Technology System Profit.

61
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,660
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,260
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

63
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,820
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,640
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,700
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

66
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:56,760
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

67
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,440
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,960
The Soul Genius Powerhouse.

69
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


70
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


71
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:57,960


72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,560
For the next hour, sit quietly,

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,100
and we will control all that you see and hear.

74
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,020
Now speaking for the management.

75
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,480
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation

76
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,620
to provide programs which will be enjoyable,

77
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,640
entertaining, and tasteful.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,660
With full awareness of this controversial nature of this,

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,920
particularly because of its classification,

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
we subjected it to careful editing.

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,540
To eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste,

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,600
it was reviewed by an experienced program editor.

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,020
It is well within the restrictions of the code to which we subscribe,

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,300
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,100
than the industry code.

86
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,100
We are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,200
and assure you that this network will continue to adhere

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,620
to the high standards we have set.

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,920
We maintain the truth throughout the years.

90
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,340
Thank you.

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:58,660
Thank you.

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:58,880
Thank you.

93
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,620
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,800
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

95
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,240
which reaches from the inner mind to

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,880
the church of the subgenius.

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,620
The Church of the Subgenius.

98
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,600
The Church of the Subgenius.

99
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,840
That official information was from Reverend Self Slayer.

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,540
And this is Hour of Slack number 985.

101
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,860
For this show, besides the latest Lemurian leavings,

102
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,480
we have resurrected the ancient, crumbling,

103
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,800
subgenius media barrage tape number three

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,980
called Sex, Sickness, and Slack

105
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,780
from the year of 1981.

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,180
A newly remastered for CD.

107
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,120
And friends, going through this material from 25 years ago,

108
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,800
when Philo and yours truly were babies

109
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,620
and you weren't even born,

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
my God, it has caused to erupt forth

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,480
some long buried memories.

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,220
Memory is a beautiful thing if we control what we remember.

113
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,540
Now, our mind has a tendency to remember,

114
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,680
remember the bad and forget the good.

115
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,000
But all we can remember the time,

116
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,520
bring to your remembrance

117
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,620
things that brought joy to your soul.

118
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,960
Wow, look at her tits.

119
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,340
They are enormous.

120
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,620
How can they...

121
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,700
Hello? Hello?

122
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,700
How can they be showing so much tit

123
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,520
without showing any nipple at all?

124
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,820
Bob?

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,140
Bob?

126
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,120
Bob?

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,660
Bob?

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
Coming in just a few moments,

129
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,600
we will be speaking with Reverend Ivan Stang

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,460
and the Dr. Philo Drummond

131
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,980
with the Church of the Subgenius.

132
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,800
Just to give you a hint at what this is all about,

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm going to give you a little bit of a tease

134
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,420
about the church.

135
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,840
We're living in terrible,

136
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,960
perilous, chaotic

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,300
times. How has your life

138
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,400
changed since dogs came into your life?

139
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,420
The exodus are a reality

140
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,500
and my life is geared

141
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,640
towards their arrival.

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,160
I redefined my own space

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,420
and was able to center

144
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,560
my being. When I first heard

145
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,460
Bob on the radio, he said

146
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:17,980
that he could

147
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,440
heal and told me to put my hand on

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,420
the radio so that the Bob

149
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,600
energy could come out through the airwaves.

150
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,380
The only cult they want to

151
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,160
talk about is the subgenius foundation,

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,060
the church of the subgenius,

153
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,120
and the only reason they talk about it

154
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,180
is for the money.

155
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,760
I'm afraid of God. Oh, you are?

156
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,100
Yeah. Well, there's a lot

157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,820
of people out there just like you.

158
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,380
I tell you what, if you would,

159
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,820
put your hands on the radio right now.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,280
Put your hands, put your hands

161
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
on the radio.

162
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,180
Hello. Because we launched rockets

163
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,680
Now you can take your eye

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,780
and turn it up.

165
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,620
You'd think everyone would like that.

166
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,300
Cash free dollars. Cash back.

167
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,600
With a specially shaped treat that cleans dogs.

168
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,160
Families

169
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,320
love harassment now.

170
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,780
This Tuesday, he calmed the dead.

171
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,400
Love is setting rules

172
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
to help them keep marijuana.

173
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,880
And if you plan to get

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,660
saved, you'd better

175
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,500
do it now. There will be a

176
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,200
day not in the poop.

177
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,500
This is a future in which

178
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,520
Antichrist will be revealed

179
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,700
and the mark of the beast

180
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,660
will be introduced.

181
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,580
Humanity,

182
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,240
why do you bug us?

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,040
Oh, massive bring down.

184
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,340
The world is a bongo drum

185
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,920
and we are merely the

186
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,120
oobly-oobly-oobly-oobly-oobly.

187
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,380
Oh, I mean really different.

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,580
Edgar's much more advanced.

189
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Aren't you?

190
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
Aren't you, you little lion?

191
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,080
Darn you.

192
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,740
Mangalore, he was a

193
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,200
bongo-loy.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,300
He's happier than you and me.

195
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,880
Mangalore, he was a

196
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
bongo-loy.

197
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,960
And he determined

198
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
what he could say.

199
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,280
From PR News in Washington,

200
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm Alan Greenspan.

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
Greenspan said, said, he said.

202
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,240
Greenspan said, he said.

203
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,680
Greenspan called for more PR News in Washington, he said.

204
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,120
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says

205
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,720
he told a Senate panel Greenspan is subdued.

206
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,780
Greenspan says Greenspan continues

207
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,160
to expand at a reasonably good pace.

208
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
But he did not say by how much.

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Investigators want to know more

210
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
about Greenspan in Washington.

211
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,540
From reading some of your literature,

212
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,080
which you so helpfully brought up

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,760
a wheelbarrow full of this evening in the studio,

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,960
by the church, by your belief,

215
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,920
Slack is something that

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
when you join the church

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,360
you can do anything you want

218
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,860
because

219
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,400
it's within your Slack.

220
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,420
Well, when you...

221
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,140
And if anybody inhibits you,

222
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
they are hampering your religion

223
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,920
and violating the constitution,

224
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
your constitutional rights.

225
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,220
That's exactly right.

226
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,100
That's right, we're hoping

227
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,140
somebody will take this

228
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,720
to court sooner or later for us.

229
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,700
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

230
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,120
I challenge you to point out national talk shows

231
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,380
that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity,

232
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,520
that they do not belittle the marriage union

233
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,640
and the family lifestyle,

234
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,720
that they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

235
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,140
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show

236
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,500
that doesn't make light of God.

237
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,440
The Subgenius Foundation,

238
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,300
the Reverend Ivan Spang and Dr. Philo Drummond,

239
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,920
and they are, as we mentioned before,

240
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,120
the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation.

241
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,340
If you don't know about the school books depositories,

242
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,500
watch out for a police.

243
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,560
Because I'm number 6742 to witness it,

244
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,800
and they're coming after me.

245
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,760
So call me.

246
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,160
Hello there, hello to you.

247
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,120
We're picking up all your transmission.

248
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,980
That's the leader and the idea I want.

249
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
Whenever a party leader must...

250
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,820
The subgenius culture and subgenius living.

251
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,880
Gentlemen, I want to get a title.

252
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,960
The subgenius title.

253
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,140
It doesn't make fun of Godly laws.

254
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,580
Agreed.

255
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,140
They don't laugh.

256
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,660
They don't laugh at us.

257
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,220
They make a mockery of us.

258
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,520
Now we don't have to watch it.

259
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,240
We can turn it off.

260
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,620
Who will pay to clean up the contaminated land?

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,740
Call us and talk about what you'd wish.

262
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,120
Go ahead.

263
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm going to point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government

264
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,800
that the conspiracy is trying to get across on us.

265
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,960
And we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government

266
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,580
is going to be a one world religion.

267
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,660
And of course, that's what the subgenius,

268
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,460
the church of the subgenius is here for.

269
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,080
When he says,

270
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,840
you shall have tribulation ten days,

271
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,720
he means you're going to have a maximum of trouble.

272
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,680
And that's just the way things are.

273
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
The church is not at home in the world.

274
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:27,460
Oh.

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,140
I know I'm drunk now.

276
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,000
I forgot my favorite man sitting over there.

278
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,040
His name is...

279
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,060
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

280
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,460
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

281
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,840
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

282
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,060
Mr. Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

283
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,080
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

284
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,100
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

285
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,460
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

286
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,740
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

287
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:56,740


288
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,000
Mr. Bob Dovolina.

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,340
Mr. Bob Dovolina.

290
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,300
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

291
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,100
Mr. Bob Dovolina, won't you quit?

292
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,420
You really made me sick with your fraudulent behavior.

293
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,120
You're going to make me flippin' then the army couldn't save you.

294
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,920
Why don't you behave, you little rug rat?

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,860
Take a little tip from the tabloid.

296
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,440
Because I know I'm not paranoid.

297
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,320
When I say I saw you trying to mock me,

298
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,740
now you and your crew are on a mission trying to hawk me.

299
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,120
But it isn't happening, you fraudulent foes.

300
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,200
You used to front big time, now I suppose.

301
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,420
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted.

302
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,040
You used to make fun of, but now you want to rock it.

303
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,740
So you gotta kick it with the homies.

304
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,200
But D.E.L. is already hip to your cronies.

305
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,220
Me and C.M.P. just thought about this and never have we seen her.

306
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,100
Brother, who would have her like, Mr. Mr. Mr. Dovolina?

307
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,900
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

308
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,220
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

309
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,660
Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

310
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,060
Mr. Mr. Dovolina, Mr. Bob Dovolina.

311
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,060
Oh, who have you got?

312
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,120
You gotta get that cop here!

313
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,780
slash

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,880
Well, how's your sakes?

315
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,840
Who wrote this?

316
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:05,060
I'm just gonna write it myself, just to add a little bit of an edgy feeling.

317
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,800
Shout-outs to you, Bob Dovolina!

318
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,460
Who wrote it?

319
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,940
This Mobile Backup by the Joils Blue and The Pl 빠有點

320
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,420
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Dabalina

321
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,060
You thought you could manipulate, you thought you could fool me

322
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,280
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Dabalina

323
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,840
Cheech Wizard put me on a stuffer, then he schooled me

324
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,060
Prince could be fraudulent, just you wait and see

325
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,720
First he was my money grip, then he stole my honey dip

326
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
Mr. Dabalina is a serpent, don't you agree?

327
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,820
The little two-timer resembles Aunt Jemima

328
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,660
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie

329
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,200
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake, or would he?

330
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,600
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes

331
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,280
Notice the facade of the snakes

332
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,380
They all catch the baits, even though last year there was GQ

333
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,360
Took a lot of time before the D.E.L. could see through the mask

334
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,820
All I had to do was ask the Emperor and Kwame

335
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,620
And my maris thought if they were bombing

336
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,820
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules

337
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,360
The way you on my dick must really hurt your knees

338
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,820
You need to take feet and quit being such a goopy

339
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,200
Ever since I did a little show in Guadalupe

340
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,840
I never saw a goopy like you

341
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,200
But what is funny is you wanted to be down with my crew

342
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,720
The D.E.L. is not down with any clowns or justice

343
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,260
So I would suggest that you try to impress some professor Dabalina

344
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,800
Because you don't impress me, Dabalina

345
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
The style of justice is not the key, Dabalina

346
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,920
It's all in the mind and the heart

347
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,260
So you should start by remembering

348
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,060
You gotta pay a fee, Dabalina

349
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,940
Mr. Dabalina, Mr. Bob Dabalina

350
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,280
Mr. Dabalina, Mr. Bob Dabalina

351
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,620
Mr. Dabalina, Mr. Bob Dabalina

352
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,040
Mr. Dabalina, Mr. Bob Dabalina

353
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,740
Glory, how stupid

354
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,420
Mr. Bob Dabalina

355
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,620
Glory, how stupid

356
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,180
Mr. Bob Dabalina

357
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,260
Glory, how stupid

358
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,560
Praise Jesus, praise God

359
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:43,560


360
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm porque de que tú me crees

361
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,500
He's the one and only Kose otaku

362
00:15:48,500 --> 00:16:05,500
He's the one and only Kose otaku

363
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:34,640
Mr. Double Leader.

364
00:16:38,320 --> 00:17:05,480
Mr. Double Leader.

365
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:23,420
Mr. Double Leader.

366
00:17:36,380 --> 00:18:03,320
Mr. Double Leader.

367
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:35,000
Mr. Double Leader.

368
00:18:41,540 --> 00:19:05,460
Mr. Double Leader.

369
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:35,380
Mr. Double Leader.

370
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,280
Mr. Double Leader.

371
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,760
Mr. Double Leader.

372
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,040
Mr. Double Leader.

373
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:50,220
Mr. Double Leader.

374
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,860
This is PR News.

375
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,160
A Massachusetts judge is asking U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to strip in the courtroom.

376
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
Stripping in the monster head.

377
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,500
The Senate has approved raping a child on a vote of 98 to nothing.

378
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
The victim smiled and hugged handcuffs in shackles.

379
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,400
Some Democrats raised questions about PR's reports.

380
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,320
The State Department has denounced civil liberties and did nothing to stop PR News.

381
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,960
I support gay rights.

382
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,940
I think that those nasty, stupid fags are in a shower stall.

383
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,940
I would say that we have had a lot of those.

384
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Young and nasty and stupid.

385
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,820
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

386
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,480
We have millions and multiplied millions of crooked politicians.

387
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,660
God put a death penalty upon adultery.

388
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:48,580
When we see millions and multiplied millions of people spending hours and hours before the television.

389
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,520
Learn how to crack safes, rob banks, kill policemen and get divorces and break up homes.

390
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,280
All these soap operas hour after hour warps people's minds.

391
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,740
Pull ahead. All decks condition red.

392
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,420
Wednesday is Ladies Night.

393
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,060
Underscored ladies admitted free.

394
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,060
Their drinks 25 cents and 50 cents.

395
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
A shy little girl leaving all that she knew behind her.

396
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,340
What this gonna do to kill me, man?

397
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,680
Hour after hour warps people's minds.

398
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,900
That shows that they're crooked.

399
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,540
That shows they're perverse.

400
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,380
That shows that they're stupid.

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,960
That shows they got warped minds.

402
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,840
That's what people's minds runs on.

403
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,220
And that the morals are breaking down.

404
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
And that's what it did in the Roman Empire.

405
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,560
Right before the Roman Empire fell, their morals broken down.

406
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,200
Straps on your shoulder.

407
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,260
Straps on your back and on your hand.

408
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,200
Straps on your shoulder.

409
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,320
Straps on your back and on your hand.

410
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,620
So it's pissing you aside.

411
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,280
Letting water flow into the land.

412
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,200
Hey, have a little fun this week.

413
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,680
Enjoy free refreshments, free gifts.

414
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,260
It's a pretty strong church we find and uh...

415
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,200
We need to know little brother, huh?

416
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,100
Something else about it.

417
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,820
In an effort to get people to stop smoking marijuana in this country,

418
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,680
the government is thinking about putting a sales tax on rolling paper.

419
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,900
Yeah, yes, you're right, yeah.

420
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,200
So...

421
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,480
And for school, yet we fall short when it comes to taking care of our own.

422
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm looking for one to bear you.

423
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,600
I'm looking for one to bear you.

424
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,420
But nothing comes my way.

425
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,620
Organization formed to oppose moral majority.

426
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
How is this hard?

427
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,440
Of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

428
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,800
And to accept homosexuals as teachers in our Christian school.

429
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,100
Our church happens to believe that homosexuality is a sin.

430
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:07,640
And boldly speak the pense йaz TWO

431
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,140
Y quarter out of that is now polymorphism.

432
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:11,680
The stup辛苦 he would make everywhere.

433
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,820
The stup Paul because he's gone.

434
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,360
go everywhere other than Stoneway.

435
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,640
In the other corner,

436
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,060
Seth Sue from Winnipeg.

437
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
This bitch had a dick

438
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
longer than a table leg.

439
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,060
And stop trying to force

440
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
immorality into the law,

441
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,400
which makes people

442
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
accept immorality.

443
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,700
That's when I was in college,

444
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,760
because I simply wasn't

445
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,560
the praiser of God,

446
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,820
a chosen person, a Jew.

447
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,980
Our television programs

448
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,940
laugh at homosexuality.

449
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,800
Hey, they laugh at immorality.

450
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,900
They laugh at ungodliness.

451
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,480
They make a mockery

452
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,000
of the holy word of God.

453
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,920
And God says,

454
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,460
when you change my truth

455
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,220
into a lie,

456
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,220
I'll give you up

457
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,320
to vile affections.

458
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
That was another hole

459
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
I didn't recognize.

460
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,480
My dick was so long,

461
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,240
the bitch needed circumcised.

462
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,920
You talk about homosexuals

463
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,660
come out of the closet.

464
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
Did you ever dream

465
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,420
the day would come

466
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,120
in American history

467
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,840
when grown men would stand up

468
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,920
and possess to be making

469
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,800
physical love?

470
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,300
They would say,

471
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm a gay man.

472
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


473
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


474
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


475
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


476
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


477
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


478
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


479
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


480
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


481
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


482
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


483
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:24,960


484
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
Don't tell me that I'm a sissy.

485
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I'm a he-man.

486
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,860
But I'm in love with that man

487
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,420
right there,

488
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,200
and I'm married.

489
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,260
Larry the faggot

490
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,020
was fleeting from the ass

491
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,880
because this motherfucker

492
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,260
backed up on a dick

493
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,440
a little too fast.

494
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,820
For those of you

495
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,360
who are passionate bird lovers,

496
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,220
thank you.

497
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,600
I'm sure this song

498
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,440
will have a lot of appeal.

499
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,240
Whenever I've sung it,

500
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:53,980
it has brought forth

501
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,820
scores of letters

502
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,040
from woodpeckers

503
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,880
all over the country.

504
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,440
I stuck my finger

505
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,460
in a woodpecker's hole

506
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,340
and the woodpecker said,

507
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,420
God bless my soul.

508
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,440
What a very odd thing to do.

509
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,440
What a very odd thing to do.

510
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,880
Though I know you're merrier

511
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,540
than old.

512
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,620
Old King Cole,

513
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,200
you should exercise

514
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
a little self-control

515
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,660
and to stick your finger

516
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,700
in a woodpecker's hole

517
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
is a very odd thing to do.

518
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,740
Do-do-do-do.

519
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,780
Do-do-do-do.

520
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,780
What a very odd thing to do.

521
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,220
I've been reading about

522
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,500
where a lot of churches,

523
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,260
even in Benecost,

524
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
have accepted homosexuality.

525
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,580
Ain't that the truth?

526
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:50,920
That's the truth.

527
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,120
And claiming to have

528
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,720
the Holy Ghost.

529
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,480
Well, that's deception.

530
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,560
Ain't a bigger abomination

531
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,340
in the world

532
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,380
than women wearing men's clothes

533
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,100
and men wearing women's clothes

534
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,540
and people being perverts.

535
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:02,940
That's the,

536
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,640
two of the greatest sins

537
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,120
in the world

538
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,060
is idolatry,

539
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,800
witchcraft,

540
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,380
homosexuality,

541
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,380
and men and women

542
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,700
wearing the clothes

543
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,820
of the opposite sex.

544
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,600
It's abomination.

545
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,420
And whosoever

546
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,320
do it is abomination.

547
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
And there's more people today.

548
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,100
Their minds are perverted.

549
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,480
Their life is perverted.

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,660
And they've been given over

551
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,940
to a reprobate mind.

552
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,380
So many people today,

553
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,240
even people that aren't homosexual,

554
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,940
their minds are perverted.

555
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,340
It's filled with filth.

556
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,340
And it's filled with

557
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,680
all the ungodliness

558
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,460
and wickedness

559
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,880
that comes from the pit of hell.

560
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,260
And you see it on television.

561
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
You see it in the movie houses.

562
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,380
And you see it on the,

563
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,060
in the,

564
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,960
on the market stand.

565
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,520
Hey, and how about pornography?

566
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,280
Jax, all you have to do

567
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,060
is look around you.

568
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,400
Female body parts

569
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,860
are available just about anywhere.

570
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,420
Or pick up some picture books

571
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,900
with a free orifice included.

572
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,460
Miracles of Engineering,

573
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,840
yours for the plucking.

574
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,220
If you don't mind

575
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,560
the smell of vinyl,

576
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,640
you're such a shit.

577
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,620
From Media Barrage 3.

578
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,920
And before that, friends,

579
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,280
The Woodpecker's Hole,

580
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
that marvelous song

581
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
was by Patti Roberts.

582
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,660
From the album,

583
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,920
Songs for Gay Dogs.

584
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,100
Yes, that's the title of it.

585
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,100
That was submitted to

586
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,900
all binary slack

587
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,820
by Reverend Polar Bear.

588
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,040
And now,

589
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,580
some recordings

590
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,340
from last year's

591
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,580
Winter Star Symposium.

592
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,280
Not last month's,

593
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,960
but last year's.

594
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,440
But, yeah,

595
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,100
we don't add to

596
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,280
the word of Bob,

597
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
but we are always trying

598
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
to find better ways to say it.

599
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
You know,

600
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,380
better, better,

601
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:49,780
better PR.

602
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,000
Just because a statement

603
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,920
is correct

604
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,120
doesn't mean that it's

605
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,680
a smart thing to say.

606
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,620
That having been said,

607
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm going to keep going anyway.

608
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
And tell you all, friends,

609
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,400
that, despite what you may have heard,

610
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,160
Bob is coming.

611
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,240
Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

612
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
that man represented there

613
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,320
by that graven image,

614
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,000
is coming.

615
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,980
Now, when you've heard

616
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,460
that Jesus is coming

617
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,360
and he never does,

618
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,460
but what they mean by that is

619
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,720
Jesus is on his way here

620
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,700
from somewhere else

621
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,760
and he is about to arrive.

622
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,980
When we say Bob is coming,

623
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,300
we don't mean he's on his way here.

624
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,380
We mean literally.

625
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,760
Bob is coming.

626
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,580
When you have an orgasm

627
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,240
or whatever,

628
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,840
that's Bob.

629
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,480
Bob is coming.

630
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,120
It's that simple.

631
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,140
Okay?

632
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,820
It's not so complicated.

633
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,860
So, you may know Bob

634
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,360
better than I do.

635
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,960
Better than you think.

636
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,560
Now, we've also,

637
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,800
another thing we've said

638
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,960
is that you can be alone

639
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,800
with Bob.

640
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,840
Praise Bob.

641
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,680
That is his greatest gift to us

642
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,520
is that we don't have to have

643
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,340
this asshole preacher guru guy,

644
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,040
you know, breathing down our necks.

645
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,880
The other thing I meant

646
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,620
was just for some of guys, boys,

647
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,420
it's not queer if it's Bob.

648
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,080
I have to remind myself of that a lot.

649
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,340
But yeah, Bob plays in mysterious ways.

650
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,460
Now, um...

651
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,140
Now, mama's on the bottom

652
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,280
and papa's on the top.

653
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,380
Baby's in the crib,

654
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,900
the hall and poet to her pop job.

655
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

656
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,300
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

657
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,460
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

658
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,620
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

659
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,340
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

660
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,760
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

661
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,920
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

662
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes, my baby knows.

663
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,860
Now sea is sea

664
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,140
and land is land.

665
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,320
Can't get my boogie

666
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,720
I can get it by hands up.

667
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,920
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

668
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,060
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

669
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,980
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

670
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,180
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

671
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,280
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

672
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,560
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

673
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
Yes, my baby knows.

674
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,560
Now I boogie it in the kitchen

675
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
and I booke it in the hall.

676
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,860
Bookie it in my hand

677
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,000
then I slung it on the wall.

678
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,260
Stop.

679
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,420
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

680
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,440
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

681
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,720
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

682
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,860
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

683
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,840
Hey, Bubba Rebob.

684
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,720
Hey, Barbaribob! Yes, my baby knows.

685
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,340
Now a nickel for some butter. Nickel for some lard.

686
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,900
Put it on my boogie till my boogie got hard-chopped.

687
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,140
Hey, Barbaribob! Hey, Barbaribob!

688
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Hey, Barbaribob! Hey, Barbaribob!

689
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,220
Yes, my baby knows.

690
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,680
There's a little red rooster, she's a big red hen.

691
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,300
Ruffle up your feathers, let's hop, clip it in, chop.

692
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,620
Hey, Barbaribob! Hey, Barbaribob!

693
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,900
Hey, Barbaribob! Hey, Barbaribob!

694
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,780
Hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, yes, my baby knows.

695
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,900
Out in the crap earth sittin' so bold, gonna get me some of the old, not whole jobs.

696
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:05,300
Hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, yes, my baby knows.

697
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,400
Out in the crap earth sittin' on the lot, the green flies are buzzin' and I'm gettin' damn hot jobs.

698
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,880
Out in the dni's havin' cold, the world ain't bulletproof, I ain't gonna sleep till nightfall.

699
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,880
Yes, my baby knows.

700
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,900
Now, pensar red, ready for a pluckin', I got a gal who's gonna take your head and play the struggle.

701
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,280
Hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, that's my gal.

702
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,260
Hey, Bobbery Bob, hey, Bobbery Bob, yes, my baby knows.

703
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,700
Now, belly to belly and skin to skin got two little things workin' out and it's just me.

704
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm aumphin' in for pennant, and my baby knows

705
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,380


706
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,760
Yes, my baby knows

707
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,240
Now my papa is a skunk, my mama is a slut

708
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,580
My cock's sucking, brother's got my sister knocked up

709
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,920
Shouts, hey, Bobber-y Bob

710
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,240
Yes, my baby knows

711
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,320
Now the cattle's in the pasture and the hog's in the corn

712
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,620
Granny's in the crapper blowing grandpa's horns

713
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,980
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

714
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,120
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

715
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,360
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

716
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,220
Yes, my baby knows.

717
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,020
Got a brand new shimmy with a tank full of gas, mouth full of tootie, and a hand full of ass.

718
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,320
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

719
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,620
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

720
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,720
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

721
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,780
Hey, Bobbery Bob.

722
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,600
Yes, my baby knows.

723
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Sit down. Don't sit down, but at least set your dogs to find them.

724
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,920
Never mind the dogs.

725
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,620
I found some tracks. Come on.

726
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,340
There's one thing that'll stop them.

727
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,320
I reconciled.

728
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,580
And that's the lady.

729
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,300
A white lady.

730
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,940
Who can eat more than two eggs?

731
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,900
A white lady.

732
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,080
Bob?

733
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,340
Do you know what you're talking about?

734
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,880
Hey, I wonder if you and her will recast the talk away yesterday.

735
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,700
From now on it'll end in gobbling up their time ago.

736
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,320
Such reputations.

737
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,780
All right.

738
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,080
But now I need to take care of my desk.

739
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,320
Decided to let Bobbery know you're earning when you explain the race to help those kids.

740
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,380
If that's what we need in theio life,

741
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,400
Thank you.

742
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,400
Thank you.

743
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,860
Thank you.

744
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,900
Thank you.

745
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,560
Thank you.

746
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,120
Thank you.

747
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,420
And before that, friends, we heard some lemur.

748
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,220
And now, more Hour of Slack.

749
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,940
Ah!

750
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:49,860
Ah!

751
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,880
Ah!

752
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,460
Ah!

753
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,800
Ah!

754
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,520
Ah!

755
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,120
Ah!

756
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,440
Ah!

757
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,920
Turn it off!

758
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,800
I'll tell!

759
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,500
I'll tell!

760
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,160
I'll tell!

761
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,080
Turn it off!

762
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:00,720
Ha ha ha!

763
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,440
Oh!

764
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,200
Oh!

765
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:04,740
What?

766
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Like?

767
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,360
Like?

768
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,320
Like when you...

769
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,300
You scream?

770
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,100
Like when you sing to some bitch, man, and...

771
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,820
And they laugh, you know?

772
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,720
And...

773
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,980
And they...

774
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,440
They laugh harder, and...

775
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,980
And...

776
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,620
When we know...

777
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,080
When we fuck, you know, they laugh.

778
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,980
And they kill you.

779
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,440
Man, you can't get enough of that.

780
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:30,840
They're there.

781
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,220
And you can't...

782
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,000
You can't kick a fucking dog, and they're...

783
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,180
They're behind you, and they're kicking, man.

784
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,980
And...

785
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,360
And...

786
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,100
And...

787
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,080
And they're...

788
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,080


789
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,080


790
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,080


791
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,280
And it's like I'm...

792
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,780
And they're fucking...

793
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,260
They're fucking...

794
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,100
I don't know...

795
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,700
And they're kicking you in the...

796
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


797
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


798
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


799
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


800
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


801
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


802
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,700


803
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,920
Oh, that was Roberto de la Rosa.

804
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,380
Thanks to the great, late David Boone.

805
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,180
From PR News in Washington, I'm designed to extort big settlements from PR News.

806
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,960
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops, fueled by big cars,

807
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,180
Cigarettes, painkillers and alcohol killed 20 people and wounded dozens.

808
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,840
The church paid $158 to PR News.

809
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,320
On the plus side, the church's cock washing is safe.

810
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,900
President Bush would take drugs away from federal judges and put them into the hands

811
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,660
of PR News.

812
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,800
Wholesale prices rose by $310,785.58.

813
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,080
PR News marred the holy news in Washington.

814
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm pledging to try to get unmanned surveillance aircraft

815
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,020
to spy on deaf mammals accused of opening fire with an assault-style rifle that can

816
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,460
simplify Israel's transfer of Jericho to PR News.

817
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,240
Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan talked on this.

818
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:59,140
Give a person who makes $6.50 an hour another baby and they're going to feed on it.

819
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,540
Greenspan update there by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

820
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,660
And now...

821
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,900
Doctors for Bob.

822
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,700
And will you come over, bringing those long things I like.

823
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,380
Them long and slender things over by Bob's place.

824
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,280
Oh, some of them are only thirteen years old.

825
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,540
Is that going to fix me to say something about Bob?

826
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
That was Bob we were singing about.

827
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,340
I think that was Bob.

828
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,900
If you're talking about your straight Bob, your righteous Bob, your true Bob, you're

829
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:37,900


830
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:37,900


831
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:44,280
Bob that is there and yet, well, I'd still be here and so would you.

832
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,820
This is true.

833
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,180
So, I guess there's nothing but we can do but sing about Bob.

834
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,540
Oh, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

835
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,760
Yes, sir.

836
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,300
Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

837
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,120
Why, sure, Dad.

838
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,600
What's cooking?

839
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,100
You mind if I smoke in your room?

840
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,960
Oh, I know, Dad.

841
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,440
Go ahead.

842
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,040
Thanks.

843
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,160
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

844
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,720
Yeah.

845
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,100
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

846
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,460
Yeah.

847
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,460
Remember I...

848
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,940
Well, to begin with, you ought to know the medical terms for certain parts of the body.

849
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,340
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he calls it a...

850
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:36,580
A male organ.

851
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,340
A male organ.

852
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:37,840
Well, son...

853
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,800
Oh, you mean the electric razor.

854
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,160
Oh, no, you rascal.

855
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,660
No, no, Bob.

856
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,860
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid.

857
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,160
That's wrong, isn't it?

858
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,760
I mean...

859
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,660
Oh, no, son.

860
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,920
It's not at all wrong.

861
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,180
You see, the body manufactures that fluid all the time.

862
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:03,520
And when the supply becomes too great, as it does sometimes, nature opens a sort of a safety

863
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,540
valve in your sleep and passes off.

864
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,560
And, you know, when you're in a hospital, you're not supposed to be in a hospital.

865
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,560


866
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,560


867
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,560


868
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,560


869
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:06,560


870
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,420
Now, one of these nights before very long, you may find that some of it passes off in

871
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:11,800
your sleep.

872
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,400
My mother would probably have a fit.

873
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,560
She just had the curtains washed.

874
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,420
Oh, here's a match.

875
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,460
Your pipe's gone out again.

876
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,300
Well, thanks.

877
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,360
Gee, our bodies are complicated, aren't they, Dad?

878
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,100
Oh, you bet.

879
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,820
More complicated than the biggest dynamo ever built.

880
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,620
Oh, but, Dad...

881
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,680
Why do fellows get these, uh...

882
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,420
You know what happens when you stuff yourself with cake and Coke, son, so you're ready to

883
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,660
pop.

884
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,220
Sure, I get a stomachache.

885
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,620
You bet.

886
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,900
God made the desire of us so that we'd be sure to get our vitamins each day.

887
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,400
Golly, the way he figured everything out.

888
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,160
He sure did.

889
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,200
But always remember this, son.

890
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:04,460
Well, son, so closely has God connected our emotions with our bodies that...

891
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,600
Oh, my God.

892
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,200
How's that?

893
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,200


894
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,200


895
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,200


896
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,200


897
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,620
And remember that you can always knock them with a simple one-two punch.

898
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,060
Get it?

899
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
I got it, Dad.

900
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,420
Fine.

901
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,560
Now, if you have any questions, come and tell me about them.

902
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,620
Ouch!

903
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,620
A little bit of a confounded back of mine there.

904
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,720
Come on, Dad.

905
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,700
Let's get on with it.

906
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,340
The Bob's Dad there.

907
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,600
Thanks to Reverend Shane Smirker for that particular reference.

908
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,600


909
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,600


910
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:34,600


911
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,780
And now, friends, Lemurian news.

912
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:59,260
Oh, by the way, a listener or downloader noted lately that, for the first time, that all Lemur cuts of all kinds are three seconds long or 13 or 23 seconds or 33 seconds or 43 seconds long.

913
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:08,920
Always in tune with the mathematically perfect 13013, the number of Bob, the main number of Bob.

914
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,440
I had never noticed that about Lemur stuff, and you'd think I would, but, well, we all have our strange obsessions, you know.

915
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm plotting to assassinate religious patients till 5 o'clock tomorrow evening.

916
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,240
In stocks 174-1006-1100.

917
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,900
27-28-2030.

918
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,860
It's been a dramatic day for PR's brain-damaged president in February.

919
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,900
Persistent PR News state.

920
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,140
More than 170 people have ended their lives since PR News took effect in Washington.

921
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:04,540
NotVERTEEN has seen hundreds of calls for help for their children.

922
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:04,540


923
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:04,540


924
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,160
Dem.

925
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,220
italic music catches sensitivity.

926
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,940
of the ground. Alien

927
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,300
signals beaming down.

928
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,600
They say, hey pal,

929
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,400
can you hear us now?

930
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,980
Oh wow, listen to the

931
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,540
sound. UFO transmissions.

932
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,240
UFO

933
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,660
transmissions.

934
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:46,780
I

935
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,760
can hear the sound.

936
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,800
Now the alien leaders

937
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,240
are on a mission and they give

938
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,880
me the details with each

939
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,180
transmission. Some are good

940
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,900
and well, some are mean.

941
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,860
Screaming louder than

942
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,180
Howard Dean. They say, hey

943
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,280
pal, can you hear us now?

944
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,700
Oh wow,

945
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,040
listen to the sound. UFO

946
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,340
transmissions.

947
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,360
UFO transmissions.

948
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,380
UFO

949
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,660
transmissions.

950
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,600
UFO

951
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,760
transmissions.

952
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,040
I can

953
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,980
hear the sound.

954
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,160
They say, hey pal,

955
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,920
can you hear us now?

956
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,540
Oh wow, listen to the

957
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,680
sound. UFO

958
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,060
transmissions.

959
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,200
UFO transmissions.

960
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,060
UFO

961
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,360
transmissions.

962
00:45:59,220 --> 00:45:59,840
Can you keep a secret?

963
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,120
UFO transmissions. Can you keep a secret?

964
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,660
I can hear the sound.

965
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,900
Now I keep a record

966
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,920
of each transmission and the

967
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,800
secret meaning which I

968
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,220
keep hidden. I hear a sound.

969
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,820
I write it down.

970
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,580
I hide the pages

971
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,120
underground. They say, hey

972
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,800
pal, can you hear us

973
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,620
now? Oh wow,

974
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,380
listen to the sound.

975
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,220
UFO transmissions.

976
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,480
UFO transmissions.

977
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,240
UFO

978
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,360
transmissions.

979
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:57,100
I can hear the sound.

980
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,940
Down, down, down.

981
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,280
By distracting the others.

982
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,960
So that in the event of Omega Contingency Plan C,

983
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,980
they'll be too distracted.

984
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,900
Well, anyway, the less said, the better.

985
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,820
Anyway, you should look at ufophil.com.

986
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,440
The hideous noise that came after Lemur's PR news earlier

987
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,100
was from a poo-water towel.

988
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,200
The band that I'm in,

989
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,160
and with Princess We Are Doe.

990
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And now, more news.

991
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,220
From PR news in Washington,

992
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,080
I'm probably preparing to probe Prime Minister's priests

993
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,120
in PR's Palestinian pain prison.

994
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,420
The head of a Senate panel came on a Minnesota Republican

995
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,720
today on Wall Street.

996
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,500
The doubt threatened to retaliate.

997
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,620
Did you read about that woman,

998
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,060
the 80-year-old woman that was about to get raped?

999
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,900
She was on crutches,

1000
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,300
and the only thing that stopped her

1001
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,540
was the fact that she'd been...

1002
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,120
Yeah, that's where I quit.

1003
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,080
She had cancer,

1004
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:27,720
and she had cancer,

1005
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,580
and she was taking radiation,

1006
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,800
and it made her assailant unable to penetrate her.

1007
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,700
So they beat her with a crutch.

1008
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,220
Are you kidding?

1009
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,220
Nice guy, huh?

1010
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,560
Oh, God.

1011
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,660
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

1012
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,460
A guy like that, to me,

1013
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,980
they should do nothing less than draw and quarter him.

1014
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,460
Well, televise and draw and quarter him.

1015
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,500
Worse yet, they should torture him for months

1016
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,180
before they can do anything.

1017
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,020
They should kill him, you know?

1018
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,240
And every week they tune in and show a little footage.

1019
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,040
Flayed Alive.

1020
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,620
Flayed Alive, Flayed Alive.

1021
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1022
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,760
Flayed Alive, Flayed Alive.

1023
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,480
It's coming.

1024
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,780
We should look for televised executions by the late 80s.

1025
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,880
It has got to stop.

1026
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,640
Man, I'll tell you what, it's just,

1027
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,460
it seems like the weirdos are,

1028
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,660
I mean, the really weirdos,

1029
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,160
the dangerous weirdos are outnumbering the,

1030
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,580
the harmless weirdos now.

1031
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,120
Uh-huh.

1032
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,240
It's giving a bad name for all weirdos.

1033
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,580
Oh, they teach them that shit in public school now.

1034
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,000
When Bob takes over, that'll be no more.

1035
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,660
I mean, what they should do to guys like,

1036
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,880
you know, that rape women,

1037
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,480
they should cut off their dick and balls in both arms

1038
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,240
and let them go through society that way.

1039
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,480
Because then he could never hit an old lady again.

1040
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,260
Yeah, that's right.

1041
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:49,940
They could just.

1042
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,080
That's right, they could cut his dick off.

1043
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,740
He could still go out sort of raping them.

1044
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,880
Yeah, and he could shove them in their crotch up there.

1045
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,620
Yeah, you know.

1046
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,200
That crotch?

1047
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,660
Yeah, right.

1048
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,100
I think they'll cut their arms off

1049
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,920
and then brand on their forehead,

1050
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,140
I used to beat little old ladies.

1051
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,700
Then they would be subject to whatever ridicule

1052
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,120
society gave them and unable to do a thing about it.

1053
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,240
Let every man be the judge, jury, and executioner.

1054
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,960
And let each criminal's works be known.

1055
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,300
That's right.

1056
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,000
That is right.

1057
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,680
Branded on their forehead.

1058
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,420
I mean, for hard,

1059
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,980
for highness, for highness' crime.

1060
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,600
Right, I mean, just some gophering,

1061
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,880
you know, maybe at the end of your little finger or something.

1062
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,600
Chop off the front half of your foot.

1063
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,460
Or a certain degree of voltage for a certain period of time.

1064
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,160
Or a trip on some mind drug that's guaranteed

1065
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,720
to make you see Satan's minions.

1066
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,500
Or put them on some amusement park rides for weeks.

1067
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,200
Or give them a disease.

1068
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,320
Yeah.

1069
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,160
A really, really awful rabies.

1070
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,860
A real painful disease.

1071
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,900
Give them shots for it.

1072
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,280
Yeah.

1073
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,960
Put them in a closet full of rabid bats.

1074
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,100
Those dirty guys haven't even touched the surface

1075
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,240
of the things they could do.

1076
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:03,800
I know it, man.

1077
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,440
It'd have to be pretty strictly regulated

1078
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,780
because you'd get people that became guards like that

1079
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,040
and became torturers just because they liked it.

1080
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,380
Yeah.

1081
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,500
Because they liked to inflict pain rather than

1082
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,600
because they liked to.

1083
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,900
You'd have to screen the people out and make the,

1084
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,440
and have the ones that really don't want it happening.

1085
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,780
They really hate inflicting pain to do it.

1086
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,160
Yeah.

1087
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,440
Of course, that would bump them out.

1088
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:27,920
Right.

1089
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,140
Yeah.

1090
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,780
Well, you'd just get people who are into the technical thing.

1091
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,000
They're just, they were into studying how many neuron

1092
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,960
signals with the equipment.

1093
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,280
Like researchers, you know?

1094
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:36,820
Yeah.

1095
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,840
Like the kind of guys that, there's a research doctor

1096
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,440
for a laboratory and he's used to cutting monkeys' heads open

1097
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,920
while they're alive and stuff like that.

1098
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,100
Yeah.

1099
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,640
It's no big deal.

1100
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,780
I mean, he cuts their vocal cords so they can't scream.

1101
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,580
I think Bob would go along with most of that.

1102
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,640
I mean, I'm not for this, this, hey, man, do your own thing.

1103
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,960
Why?

1104
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,860
Or kill me.

1105
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,480
Or kill me.

1106
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,600
Which maybe quite a lot of you could get a short duration marriage.

1107
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,780
Either fuck you or kill me.

1108
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,180
That is a.

1109
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,560
Why?

1110
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,280
That will stop a spiritual penalty for short-

1111
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,340
Fuck me or kill me, baby.

1112
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,600
I mean, one or the other.

1113
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,320
Shut up.

1114
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,320
I feel like I gotta shut up.

1115
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,200
Eat shit or kill me.

1116
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,380
That sounds like a good idea.

1117
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,580
They're talking dirty.

1118
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,020
Eating my shit and killing yourself.

1119
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,320
Always talking dirty.

1120
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:24,500
That was baby Philo, baby Stang, and the late baby Dr. X

1121
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,620
in 19-

1122
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,240
1980.

1123
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,960
Old-timey friends from Media Barrage number three.

1124
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,720
And now, baby Mark Hundahl.

1125
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,740
Hi.

1126
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,560
Have I got something for you.

1127
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,680
This is the one and only Mojo bag.

1128
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:53,240
And with this, you don't need no long hair or cool cigarettes

1129
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,620
or cool guys' sheds.

1130
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:02,120
Because you could have any woman you want with the Mojo bag.

1131
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,120
And you don't need no knife or gun.

1132
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:14,780
Because ain't nobody can hurt you when you got the Mojo bag.

1133
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,480
But you too can have the one and only Mojo bag.

1134
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,240
Yeah, I'd give it to you for, oh, I guess about $8.

1135
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,560
$8.

1136
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,960
$8.

1137
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,620
$8.

1138
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:25,620


1139
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:25,620


1140
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,400
I accept no substitutes.

1141
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,480
But one word of caution.

1142
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,580
One word of caution.

1143
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,820
Don't you never look inside the Mojo bag.

1144
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,900
Because it got the juju.

1145
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,220
And that is hot stuff.

1146
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,620
Friends, we're coming up on show number 1,000.

1147
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,040
That's right.

1148
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,620
Hour of Slack number 1,000.

1149
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,440
And we would like to have a compilation of your comments.

1150
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,660
Yes, listener comments.

1151
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,620
And we'd like to have a compilation of your comments about the Hour of Slack.

1152
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,760
And heck, make it about the whole Church of the Subgenius if you want.

1153
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,920
Because really it's our 25-year anniversary coming up.

1154
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,460
25 years since Bob's word was made public.

1155
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:14,320
Actually, on January 1st of 2005, that was really our 25th year anniversary.

1156
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,500
But we didn't notice.

1157
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:22,120
So friends, if you have something interesting to say about your favorite or most hated Hour of Slack,

1158
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:27,040
or something it did, or anything interesting about it and you,

1159
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,060
you can write it and email it to me.

1160
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,420
And Dave or me or Princess We will read it.

1161
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,040
Make it a couple of paragraphs.

1162
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,700
Make it no more than a minute long.

1163
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,780
Or you can send us an MP3.

1164
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,700
That's stang at subgenius.com is the email address.

1165
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,880
You can find that on subgenius.com if you forget it.

1166
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,020
You can also find our address.

1167
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,500
Which I will give you now if you need to submit something or whatever.

1168
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:12,800
The Subgenius Foundation is at a post office box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1169
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,800
Once again, that's box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1170
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,000
And the zip code is 44118.

1171
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,000


1172
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:31,880
The background music is by Tom and Joe, Yellow Stucco House.

1173
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:39,480
And now, from PR News in Washington, I'm sentenced to PR News in Washington.

1174
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:46,460
Again on Wall Street, PR's Putin killed at least four people outside PR's nightclub at a British base in Germany.

1175
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:51,460
Another soldier was forced to simulate sexual PR news tied up lying on the ground.

1176
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,000
The next day, the press was a little bit more active in the news.

1177
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000


1178
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,000


1179
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,040
PR's brain damage judges refused to grant an indefinite feeding tube because it partly obstructed PR News.

1180
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:08,340
In a case that has attracted virtually no media attention, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stole a cross from the Pomona campus and the revenue base.

1181
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:15,520
Instead of calling the police, the school dragged the cross back to the Harvey Mudd campus where the 11-foot cross was set ablaze.

1182
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:20,840
School administrators stated that the cross burning was to intimidate and oppress people of Claremont colleges.

1183
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,060
And the police began to follow.

1184
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:23,920
Lemur did it friends.

1185
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,520
But now, a piece of music by Skou Auslander.

1186
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,740
Reverend Skou Auslander did the next piece.

1187
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,980
It's called the Roy Batty Blitzkrieg Prodigal Son Remix.

1188
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,180
And I know how Roy feels here.

1189
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,800
I want more life.

1190
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,320
Bubble. Bottle, bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

1191
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,560
Fiery the angel's stealth.

1192
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,980
Deep thunder rolls around him.

1193
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,580
I'm not going to show you.

1194
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,640
But I'm going to show you.

1195
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,160
If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.

1196
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,460
Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven.

1197
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,640
I've done questionable things.

1198
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,600
All sort of extraordinary things.

1199
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,900
Revel in your time.

1200
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,820
If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.

1201
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,760
Wake up.

1202
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,240
Time to die.

1203
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,440
No!

1204
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,800
If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.

1205
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,440
Quite an experience to live in fear.

1206
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,260
That's what it is to be a slave.

1207
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,120
If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.

1208
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,200
Nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.

1209
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,940
I want more life.

1210
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,560
Fucker.

1211
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,180
Fucker.

1212
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,840
Fucker.

1213
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,480
Fucker.

1214
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,120
Fucker.

1215
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:32,780
Fucker.

1216
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,420
Fucker.

1217
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:33,980
Fucker.

1218
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,780
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

1219
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,120
That's what it is to be a slave.

1220
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,120
For god's sake, wait!

1221
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:46,840
Listen to me!

1222
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:47,820
Five.

1223
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,760
Four.

1224
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,140
Three.

1225
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,240
Two.

1226
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,480
One.

1227
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,880
From PR News in Washington,

1228
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,500
I'm still in the hospital in Rome recovering from PR's PR.

1229
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:04,400
The Bush administration is again targeting ordinary Arabs familiar with the coal mine outside a hotel in Somalia.

1230
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,940
What?

1231
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,280
Pope John Paul II shot an American Cardinal for Ash Wednesday,

1232
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:14,800
which marks the traditional period of bloodshed and reflection that culminates with PR News in Washington.

1233
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm likely to stay modest for the immediate future.

1234
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,660
Pope John Paul II,

1235
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,040
who is the president of the United States,

1236
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,520
has approved legislation that would help protect unscrupulous federal judges.

1237
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:32,700
Catholic Church officials aren't saying yet when the 84-year-old pontiff will return to his class-action lawsuits.

1238
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,200
President Bush continued his gene therapy experiment that killed a patient.

1239
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,860
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1240
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,740
number 985,

1241
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,260
a rerun of Media Barrage 3,

1242
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,100
partially.

1243
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,320
More is at...

1244
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,520
www.subgenius.com

1245
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,700
Everything's possible with Bob.

1246
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,040
There's really only one solution.

1247
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:03,520
Bob.

1248
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,540
Everything's possible with Bob.

1249
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,700
So call 13-013.

1250
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,740
There's no Bob.

1251
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,380
That's 13013.

1252
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,220
Call Bob.

1253
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,700
We're the sickest people I know.

1254
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,060
I'm not part of this.

1255
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:16,860
What's our view?

1256
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:17,880
Really?

1257
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,880
I'm not part of this.

1258
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,280
I can read visionists.

1259
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:20,560
Yeah.

1260
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,640
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1261
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:26,000
Once a schism started,

1262
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,960
there are all sorts of schisms starting.

1263
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:28,420
Really?

1264
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:29,180
Schisms are fast.

1265
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:31,120
Kill them if they can't take a joke, man.

1266
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,200
They're all false prophets.

1267
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,700
Don't give me this denounced all-profits bullshit.

1268
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,080
Fuck this tape.

1269
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,460
Yeah.

1270
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,080
Fuck this tape.

1271
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,140
Fuck this tape.

1272
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,440
Very, very deep enough.

1273
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:48,760
From PR News in Washington,

1274
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,480
I'm from a bakery in Baghdad,

1275
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,200
intentionally,

1276
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,760
withholding information about PR News in France.

1277
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,880
