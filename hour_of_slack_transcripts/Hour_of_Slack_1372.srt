1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
And now, the S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-Genius Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,360
Ah, yes, dear friends. We're going through recordings from 15 X-Day, chronologically,

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,260
until I get time to mix it up more.

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,060
Last week we played the first Hour of Slack recorded at X-Day

5
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,640
before a live audience from the Caffeina's Cafe in Wisteria Campground,

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,540
right after the whole southern half of the state was hit by freak high winds and heat

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,720
that knocked out the power almost everywhere but Wisteria.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,720
This week, we pick up where last week left off with the second half of that July 3rd show

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:58,220
with Papa Joe Mama, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Dr. Hal Robbins, Priestess Pisces, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,440
It ends with a relatively short Ask Dr. Hal session, short because a lot of people hadn't yet arrived at the campground.

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,280
Nonetheless, I'm confident that you will find the show full of yucks.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,380
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,080
Oh, I remember that guy.

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,580
Yeah.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,560
The local paper has a low rent.

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,020
Dear Abby-like column.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,620
And they complained about a guy in the workplace who constantly says, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck,

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,300
and snaps his fingers and whistles.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,100
That's right.

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,060
Dr. Hal picked up a local paper that was so pink that the Dear Abby woman,

21
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,300
a woman who had written to their Dear Abby type advisor,

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,340
whining that her husband groped her and wanted sex all the time.

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,160
Yes, the other one was about my husband constantly squeezing my bosoms and my bottom.

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,480
Really?

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,000
I won't stop.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,520
I won't stop.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,400
Even in public.

28
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,700
Yeah, I mean, it's like a man doesn't want to do anything else.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,740
This is the way the pinks live.

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,880
Screw me.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,500
I can't understand it.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,160
He has a dirty mind.

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,180
He wants sex for things other than children.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,040
Disgusting.

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,020
Well, it really was like that.

36
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,540
And the sad thing was the response from the advisor was something along the lines of,

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,460
well, there's a new operation called a lobotomy that will help your husband with his abdomen.

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,600
Abnormal sex drive.

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,680
She actually said he should see a medical doctor.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,700
We girls know how men get.

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,340
Wouldn't an orchid...

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,500
This guy was 50 years old, okay?

43
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,260
She should be damn glad the guy is still chasing her around.

44
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,320
Now, Reverend Stang, remember your blood pressure.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Wouldn't an orchid-octomy actually be better than a lobotomy?

46
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,500
She just needs to tighten up his Mormon underwear a little tighter and these problems would go away on their own.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,220
Gird up thy loins and take up thy cudgel in the peace of thy tent.

48
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,020
You're 50 years old and you're griping?

49
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,440
You're having a hard time?

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,440


51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:49,440


52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,800
Your husband wants to have sex?

53
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,600
I think an orchid-octomy.

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,100
There's something really wrong with this bitch.

55
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,700
What is an orchid-octomy?

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,820
An orchidectomy.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah, orchidectomy.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:02,460
If I knew anybody who was 50 years old or older who likes sex constantly, I think I'd vote for that guy for office.

59
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,300
Snip.

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:14,280
I have noticed that young people seem to turn pale and want to puke when they hear people my age even mention sex.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,960
Well, it's totally unnatural.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Old people with wrinkles and sags having sex?

63
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,400
Oh my God, that's the most horrible thing ever.

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:29,100
I don't know the name of this movie, but the very last movie that beloved middle American folk hero Andy Griffith was in

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:35,400
was one where Andy Griffith, in full old age, had sex on screen and had a blowjob.

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,100
What?

67
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,960
And this caused people to have heart attacks in movie theaters.

68
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,060
It was the last movie he ever made. I don't know the name of it.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,180
But people just did not want to see that.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
They didn't want to see it so much.

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,700
Randy Griffith.

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,780
Andy Griffith.

73
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,440
Randy Griffith.

74
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,880
Andy, Andy.

75
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,660
Well, he wasn't.

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,860
You know, he's expanding as an actor.

77
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,100
Even the voice of Jehovah is angry that this subject was mentioned.

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,120
So perhaps we should pass on it and speak of a better thing.

79
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,040
Now, Otis, before I let you out of jail, you're going to have to do me a little favor.

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,340
Did Goober blow it?

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,780
It came as it comes to all men in the back of Goober's gas station.

82
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,920
No, I didn't see the movie.

83
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,860
I read about the kerfuffle, you know.

84
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,300
People.

85
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,500
People dropping dead in theaters and so on because they were so horrified that this happened.

86
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,320
And I also read the local critic in San Francisco saying,

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:36,120
you probably don't want to watch Andy Griffith having sex and getting blown.

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,940
It was Goober who tackied. That's why he wears that hat.

89
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,960
No, it was Goober.

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,300
Maybe you should make your own movie.

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,160
Well, we knew about Goober.

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,920
Actually, more to the Rock Hudson.

93
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,440
The idea to me of seeing Andy Griffith without his trousers,

94
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,980
is one of the most repugnant things I've realized lately.

95
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,580
There's a reason why this.

96
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,780
What you see, G. Gordon Gordon, what you haven't done, what I've done every year,

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,140
which is go to something called Burning Man,

98
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,640
where you really do see those sky-clad seniors with the vertical wrinkles in their buttocks and all sorts of things.

99
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,620
Well, I thought Burning Man was where you went to see hot chicks and tits.

100
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,820
For every one of those, there are a dozen superannuated decrepit specimens.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
Or even worse,

102
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:28,060
there's the totally sunburned red jock wearing only sneakers, yelling and screaming with a can of beer in his head.

103
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,540
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,380
Well, that's why Puzzling Evidence goes, isn't it?

105
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,480
Puzzling Evidence hasn't gone for years.

106
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,960
Backstay is still young.

107
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,180
And at Burning Man, they say, what happened to that Puzzling Evidence guy?

108
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,800
Does he sell insurance or something?

109
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,720
But I go every year.

110
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:49,440
And if you go, come to my show on the day of the burn, as it always is, in Center Camp Cafe Mainstage, Saturday.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,500
Actually, they've cut us down to a single hour.

112
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,220
Isn't there some genius ruling about promoting yourself in other places?

113
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,600
No, that's all right.

114
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
That's our sacred tradition.

115
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
Burning Man is non-commercial, you see.

116
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,780
Yes, we don't use money out there.

117
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,440
No, they only use blowjobs.

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,780
We are on the barter system.

119
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,660
Old people and blowjobs?

120
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,420
Oh, that's so horrible sounding.

121
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,880
Well, you say it's horrible, but they can take out their dentures.

122
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,600
So there are certain advantages.

123
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,780
I've got my teeth, thank you very much, Papa Joe.

124
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,760
I don't need dentures.

125
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,320
We are afraid of you getting them.

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,860
When was the last time you had a wink job from somebody who was missing an eye?

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,340
Well, I had a girlfriend who used to keep an eye out for me.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,000
The eye socket is the key to the...

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,500
And then there's that third nostril job.

130
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,700
What was that line that was in an underground comic?

131
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,420
The only worthy receptacle for the seed of genius is the eye socket.

132
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,340
The brain is the only worthy receptacle for the seed of genius.

133
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,860
And she says, please, sir, spare me and I'll wink you off.

134
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,920
That's right.

135
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,820
That was one of the other Beach brothers, right?

136
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,740
It was James Osborne, who is now dead, who drew that.

137
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,620
There are some guys who prefer the detached earlobe instead of the attached earlobe.

138
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,560
S. Clay Wilson lingers near death.

139
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,580
Spain is near death.

140
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,980
R. Crumb is perfectly comfortable in his medieval hippie village in France.

141
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,400
And Gilbert Shelton also lives there.

142
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:26,060
His wife drags them from America to France, where they can drink wine, be celebrities, and see London and see France.

143
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,500
And live amongst people who can speak down their nose and eat way too much butter.

144
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,480
Personally, I'm a detached earlobe fetish guy.

145
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
The other is just too eerie.

146
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,560
Do I hear a thunder in the background?

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:37,740
You do.

148
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,520
That is no illusion.

149
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,380
The laughter as well as the roar of heaven.

150
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,780
Could the sources be coming early?

151
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,420
Is that the sound of the sound barrier being broken?

152
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,860
I have no idea what it is.

153
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,060
Is that the sound barrier being broken?

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
It's Dobbs moving the furniture around.

155
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,700
It's Dobbs moving the furniture around.

156
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,860
It's sonic booms.

157
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,600
I know the exits are coming early.

158
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,220
I can tell.

159
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,900
Look at the way it's clogged.

160
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,880
The light is gone.

161
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,380
It's getting dark out there.

162
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,080
In the secret places, Duffy murdered his wife.

163
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,200
The Devil stopped beating his wife.

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,400
And darkness covers the land.

165
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,260
The plague of frogs boils.

166
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:17,380
And those curious bugs with little human faces and stings like scorpions, like in that movie, The Mist, they're also promised as the wrath of Jehovah in the air.

167
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


168
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


169
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


170
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


171
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


172
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


173
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


174
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,380


175
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,780
The final days.

176
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:28,240
But when they do liberate him, think of all those little bobs that will come out with those glowing people heads and those little bird bodies that will be really-

177
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Well, they're kind of cute.

178
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,780
Just don't let them sting you.

179
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,220
Yes.

180
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,760
They have a crown-like arrangement on top of the head.

181
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,160
Yes.

182
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,240
Just like in the book of Revelation.

183
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,180
That entire inspiration for The Mist was actually based in the San Francisco fog bank that would come rolling in each night and bring out all the crazies.

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,680
Yes.

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes, absolutely.

186
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:57,440
In The Mist, the interesting thing is that all the crazy people turn out to be right and the sane people turn out to be wrong and make profoundly wrong decisions.

187
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,200
Much like San Francisco.

188
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:11,340
Well, I suppose if we're going to cast dispersions at each other's homeland, something could be said for the Florida panhandle and its vagaries, its curiosities and quirks.

189
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,320
My granddaddy lived in Florida and he had a giant pet spider.

190
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,660
I've got no frog stick.

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,920
Where's my frog stick?

192
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,180
I want a frog stick.

193
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,680
What kind of spider was that, Dr. Howell?

194
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,100
I don't know.

195
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,100
It was bigger than Hell and lived in his bathroom and polished up the local insect life.

196
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,020
It used to be in the past.

197
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm so sorry that it's not on a four track, because then I could separate each one.

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,660
Spiders would be imported in the US in bunches of bananas.

199
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,200
Yes.

200
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,940
I was just saying earlier to Papa Joe, if it was a four track, we'd have four hours of slack recorded at one hour.

201
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,800
One can recognize an attack on another.

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,020
I just simply separate each one.

203
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,940
I think that is taking advantage of the eight track.

204
00:09:50,280 --> 00:10:00,640
Not just from its aggression and venomous bite, but from the fact that the fang sheaths of the chelicerae are a bright red color and the rest of the spider's body is glossy black.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,880
I've never seen that, but there's no mistaking the red hairy fang sheaths, which are covered with urticating bristles.

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,860
I actually had one of those spiders.

207
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:10,860


208
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,000
You're not talking about the unmentionable part of a male's eating spider?

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000


210
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,060
Of a what's eating spiders?

211
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,960
The ones that eat the unmentionable part of a male that we can't talk about.

212
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,420
All right.

213
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,080
Well, if we can't talk about it, I can't make that matter clear.

214
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,200
But one should always look down the...

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,260
What?

216
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,860
The giant dick eating spiders?

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,300
Yes.

218
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:28,940
He said it.

219
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,620
He said it.

220
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,760
Now we can talk about it.

221
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,640
Now we can talk about the dick eating spiders.

222
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:31,820
Oh, yeah.

223
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,800
Everybody's afraid to even mention them, because they'll come scurrying out of the woods.

224
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,680
It's easy.

225
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,660
They're not in the woods.

226
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,440
But actually, they mostly are on the other side of the camp.

227
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,020
Yes.

228
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,600
It's down where the...

229
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
They don't come down here very often.

230
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,140
Yes.

231
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,660
They're down where the subgenius is on.

232
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:43,680
And they only...

233
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,400
If you don't have a giant dick, you've got nothing to worry about.

234
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,020
Yeah, I thought they...

235
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,240
They'll whittle you down to size.

236
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,340
They wait until it dangles within the little porta-potty hole and then they leap onto it.

237
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,340


238
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,340


239
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,200
Absolutely nothing at all.

240
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
No, those are just the normal...

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't think I even have a giant dick.

242
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,300
Super-sized spiders and scorpions also.

243
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,020
I'm not even sure I have a dick.

244
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
Last time I used it was...

245
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,360
I found in the...

246
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,480
1985 or something like that.

247
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,000
...porta-potties.

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,740
I don't want to think about it.

249
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,920
They prey on insect life that comes in through the hole in the...

250
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,380
Reverend Stang has no sense of humor anymore.

251
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,660
A man has been warned.

252
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,020
He's always looked first before you look.

253
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,000
...by stupid subgeniuses and now he just doesn't laugh anymore.

254
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,640
And it's sad.

255
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,080
He used to be a jerk.

256
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, if you aren't worried...

257
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm worried about the multiple dick-eating spiders.

258
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, you know...

259
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,000
The one thing...

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,260
There's no point worrying about...

261
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,860
...the...

262
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,040
...the...

263
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,400
...the...

264
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,460
...the...

265
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,920
...the...

266
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,300
...the...

267
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:27,400
...the...

268
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,560
...the...

269
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:27,900
...the...

270
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,360
...the...

271
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,360


272
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,560
...the...

273
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:29,960
...the...

274
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,000
...the...

275
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,120
...the...

276
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,020
...the...

277
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,480
...the...

278
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,900
...the...

279
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,680
...the...

280
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,160
...the...

281
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,440
...the...

282
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,640
...the...

283
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:58,720
...the...

284
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:58,740
...the...

285
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,180
...the...

286
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,180


287
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,260
The lice.

288
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,080
They are all dangerous animals.

289
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
They're just ziping each other up basically.

290
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,420
And they're...

291
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:06,420


292
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,900
Ye Guitar, Braninnenstein, members of Cibocca...

293
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,840
...Blan あا fa s耶

294
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,340

295
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,360
...

296
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,360


297
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,360


298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,520
...

299
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,520


300
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,520


301
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,540
...

302
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,540


303
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,560
...

304
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,580
...

305
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,600
...

306
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:13,620
...

307
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:13,640
...

308
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,500
tubes awaiting to be inserted

309
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,960
in patients. And then the patient

310
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,200
feels a strange tickling sensation

311
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,500
and then a sudden sharp pain.

312
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,640
And the nurse just says, oh, that's just

313
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,680
the catheter. Just ignore it.

314
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,900
Specialized

315
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,380
parasites, or not even parasites,

316
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,260
symbionts,

317
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,620
arthropods, live on human beings.

318
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,580
Well, sure, you've got those little guys that live in your

319
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,460
eyelashes. In your eyelashes, they're different

320
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,020
from the ones in your eyebrows.

321
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
I have to insert a candida fish

322
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,520
just to clear everything out before I can

323
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,500
pee. Very well. Oh, this candira

324
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
will really ream a tube out, there's no

325
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,540
doubt. How do you get it out? It gets clogged

326
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,700
up unless I slip a little candira

327
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,420
up there. You don't have to slip

328
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,320
one up. You can just wave it over the bowl

329
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,680
and it'll jump out and leap right up there.

330
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,380
It's the only vertebrated

331
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,600
animal that is parasitic on man

332
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
and does swim up

333
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,300
the male urethra

334
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,140
to begin to drain

335
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,920
the blood of its victim.

336
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
Let's not forget one of the lesser known

337
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,100
human parasites, the

338
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,240
Tourette parasite that attacks

339
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,920
subgeniuses in particular.

340
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,120
It gets in your mouth and it consumes

341
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,420
your tongue. And then it replaces

342
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,020
your tongue with the parasite.

343
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,720
It looks like a giant leeching bug.

344
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,120
I thought it ate the part of your brain that stopped you

345
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
from swearing all the time.

346
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,160
Once it got up there, you just said

347
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,900
filthy words all the time

348
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,060
because it ate your brain.

349
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840
You can't help yourself.

350
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,220
I can't understand them any better than

351
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,860
you can. Shug-us disease,

352
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,480
a scourge of Central and South America.

353
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,940
Who can't you?

354
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,480
It's spread by these

355
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,220
blood-drinking insects.

356
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,800
They resemble a large

357
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,980
hemipteran, a large flat

358
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,840
bug.

359
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,080
And they creep upon you at night.

360
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,460
And they shave off

361
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,160
a little bit of your skin.

362
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,100
But you don't feel it

363
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,980
because they also inject a little

364
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,260
anesthetic in there.

365
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,620
I'm only in retirement. I don't kill people anymore.

366
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,660
But I still work for Bob.

367
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm glad this has been put to rest.

368
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,940
It's terrible.

369
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,680
Spirochete.

370
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,100
Into your open wound.

371
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,660
And this is the genesis of Shug-us disease.

372
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,440
And that's his problem to deal with.

373
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,280
This Tourette parasite.

374
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,940
Named after Dr. Paul Shug-us.

375
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,900
Once it's eaten your tongue,

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,900
and it replaces your tongue with this large leaf stain,

377
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,940
it becomes your tongue.

378
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,120
You can't get rid of it.

379
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,820
You can get rid of it, but then you'll have no tongue.

380
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,040
So you're better off to just stick with the parasite.

381
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,780
That's the one that makes you swear?

382
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,760
Is that what makes you swear is the parasite?

383
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,540
Well, it makes you swear because it's now in charge

384
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,340
of everything you say.

385
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,080
You can't speak.

386
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,780
You can't speak without your tongue.

387
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,440
Really?

388
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,060
So it has control of your speech center now.

389
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,660
But you can blame the parasite.

390
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,960
With flattering lips and a double tongue do they speak.

391
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,880
The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,360
and the tongue that speaketh.

393
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,180
What if you split your tongue?

394
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,580
Would you be able to talk in two different...

395
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,800
Well, you can get a piggyback parasite

396
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,440
that can do that.

397
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,000
Him speak with forked tongue.

398
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,700
Two for the price of one.

399
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,280
But they usually do that only when they're copulating

400
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,340
inside your mouth.

401
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,220
Well, I'm okay with that, but how much do they cost?

402
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,720
Do you get them at Parasite's or us?

403
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,240
What?

404
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,920
I know they're transmitted through you kissing somebody

405
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,500
who has it.

406
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,140
W.C. Fields said he didn't drink water

407
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,780
because fish fuck in it.

408
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,440
Fish did what in it, Dr. Howell?

409
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
W.C. Fields doesn't drink water.

410
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,540
Didn't drink water because he said fish fuck in it.

411
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,260
Oh, that's the word I was wanting to hear.

412
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,720
I thought it was fish kissing in it.

413
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,640
But then somebody else I know says water

414
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,160
is too dangerous to drink

415
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,540
because all groundwater is now contaminated.

416
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,540
So he only drinks coconut milk.

417
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,420
Coconut milk in vast quantities.

418
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,180
Well, actually you can get a new thing from Japan

419
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,340
bottled in plastic called light water.

420
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,460
Half the hydrogen of old heavy water.

421
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,360
And you think I'm lying.

422
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,000
It's true.

423
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,980
They've got that stuff in a plastic bottle

424
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,360
with light water.

425
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,740
Coconut milk taken in vast quantities

426
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,020
is a natural laxative.

427
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,660
So he spends his time scuttling from the commode

428
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,960
to his computer.

429
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,420
I'll guarantee you anybody who would create a bottle

430
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,080
diet water with coconut milk.

431
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,220
Would become a millionaire in this country overnight.

432
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,300
Just diet water.

433
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,620
Let's get in on the ground floor of the new diet water craze.

434
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Half the hydrogen.

435
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,200
Fewer calories even than regular.

436
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,860
All of the oxygen.

437
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,720
There you go.

438
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,400
Diet water.

439
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,280
Light water.

440
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,500
Light in every respect except taste.

441
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,300
That's right.

442
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,700
You know what's missing from this conversation

443
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,680
is lonesome cowboy Dave and Dr. Philodrummond.

444
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,760
If they were here I could just go away and leave this

445
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,080
horrible noise just going on.

446
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,860
On thy belly shalt thou go and doth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.

447
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,980
Everyone would talk to him but have a beer in legumes trailer.

448
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,920
Well that's the thing.

449
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,940
No one would shut up for even a second.

450
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,840
I thought we were supposed to come here and speechify.

451
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,280
Yes but they seem to think we're not allowed to speak at the same time.

452
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,580
It's the voices in your head Hal.

453
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,320
It's supposed to be voices in your head.

454
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,260
I know but you never know when the wonderful enlightening words of wisdom

455
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,340
are going to come forth.

456
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,860
Well this way it ensures that

457
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,400
when they finally do come forth no one will be able to understand them.

458
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,280
Well that's the whole idea of prophecy isn't it?

459
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,920
It's the whole idea of understanding it until it happens.

460
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,860
If it makes sense it's no longer a thing.

461
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:30,380
Actually Jesus, there's a part in the Bible where Jesus basically says

462
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,680
don't try to preach to the others because those who are not capable of

463
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,840
understanding the message will run around repeating a garbled version of it.

464
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,340
And boy did they do that.

465
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,220
So he basically was going don't try to save everybody's soul.

466
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,200
They're not worthy.

467
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,140
Only a few can understand these parables.

468
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,360
And God damn if he wasn't right.

469
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,340
There's only so much room on the saucers.

470
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,680
Holy head shit.

471
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,760
Don't worry folks.

472
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,540
Lightning never strikes in the same place twice.

473
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,900
I saw that lightning bolt hit.

474
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah I did too.

475
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,340
I heard it.

476
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,420
That settles it.

477
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
Bob paid for it.

478
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:12,840


479
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,780
Sinners in the hands of an angry God.

480
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,820
I think it hit the reverend with the long hair out there in the back of the church.

481
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,560
I'm surprised the power's still on.

482
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't think anybody wants to go and see what happened to the people in the grind house.

483
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,260
Yeah it's the grind house.

484
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,520
Fight see Taj is running down there to see how many.

485
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,460
Yes it was a divine message from Jehovah.

486
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,520
Did it knock out the grind house?

487
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,560
We have been blaspheming up here and he is tired of it.

488
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,640
So he has thrown a thunderbolt.

489
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,440
A bolt of Zeus like intensity.

490
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,240
A petulant fit from senile Jehovah one.

491
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,580
And probably was aiming at us being old and senile.

492
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,360
He missed us and hit the grind house.

493
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,500
The thunderer's bolts.

494
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,380
Old Nobodad.

495
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:58,800
Yes.

496
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,980
Is it hammered together by Hephaestus in his celestial forge?

497
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,480
This is where the saucers come up from under the earth in time for X day.

498
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
And the water is under the earth.

499
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,220
We kept saying where are the X's?

500
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,120
We were walking on top of them.

501
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
They were just waiting to be activated.

502
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,320
Right remember how the Spielberg war of the worlds begins.

503
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,860
Lightning can't strike twice the same.

504
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:29,360
Slowly the earth buckled and gradually the silver forms slipped through the fishes and men.

505
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,340
And the heavy play of sexual textures was worth it.

506
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,100
Now there was a lightning struck.

507
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,560
It was a vision Dr. Howe.

508
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,420
It was a vision of wondrous.

509
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,040
When that lightning bolt hit all of a sudden I had this.

510
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,700
This flash of the discs among the tree.

511
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,440
Oh it was a moment of.

512
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,620
And the tantalizing whiff of ozone.

513
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,860
It was an epiphany.

514
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,120
I have a true X day Starwood lightning story.

515
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes.

516
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,560
It happened at Brushwood.

517
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,200
After a failed X day.

518
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,020
At Starwood.

519
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,160
Or maybe it was the festival in between.

520
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,280
Lightning struck a metal pole.

521
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,660
They forget Dr. Howe.

522
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,900
A dozen people fell down.

523
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,620
Nobody was severely injured.

524
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,540
But all the merchants that were around the area.

525
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,420
And one of them was Mrs. Blipo Abernathy at the time.

526
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,180
The former Mrs. Abernathy.

527
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,980
And she said that it felt like.

528
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,400
It knocked her out.

529
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,340
Beware the dreadful lightning flash.

530
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,880
She said I feel like I've had this one set of batteries my whole life.

531
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,400
And they've just been changed.

532
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,400
She said that she had a little bit of trouble calculating.

533
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,300
Change for people at her shop.

534
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,260
Yeah I was going to ask.

535
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Did the prices go down after that?

536
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,180
Or the all dreaded thunderstorm.

537
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,080
It reminds me of the time I was up in the Andes.

538
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,220
Dr. Howe and I was caught in a vicious.

539
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,520
This is a true story.

540
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,540
A vicious thunderstorm.

541
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,700
At this camp we were at with some friends.

542
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,560
And immediately behind the camp was this enormous spur of granite.

543
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,100
That went up like 200 feet.

544
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,200
And we were camped in the lee of that.

545
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,100
And this thunderstorm came in.

546
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
And we thought this is amazing.

547
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:11,900
This is terrific.

548
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,420
Look at that.

549
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,120
And the lightning came down and hit that piece of granite.

550
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,160
Struck it.

551
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,240
Or came up from it.

552
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,240
And that thing rang like a gong.

553
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,000
A big huge multi ton piece of stone.

554
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,920
Rang like a big gong.

555
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,640
Wait a minute.

556
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,080
This sounds like the beginning of the monolith monster.

557
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,620
As if it receives millions of megavolts of electrical energy.

558
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,880
Yeah it was amazing.

559
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,900
It was like somebody went boing.

560
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,900
Oh there it went again.

561
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,400
On cue.

562
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,880
As you pointed out, lightning does not fall from heaven but actually rises from the earth.

563
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,480
No more boing.

564
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,320
In the interest of full disclosure, all these thunder sound effects are being added by Ivan Stang on the mixing board.

565
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,300
Yes we'll put all these sound effects in in post.

566
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,100
Don't worry about it.

567
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,860
Actually there really is no thunderstorm.

568
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,400
We're making this up and Stang is putting the movements in the flexors.

569
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,020
We're not even sitting at the same table.

570
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,700
We're all calling in on phone lines.

571
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,880
In fact we're not really at Wisteria.

572
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:04,860
We're sitting in the city.

573
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,040
We're sitting in a little smelly room.

574
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,140
And that's why we're staying in the slacker mansion.

575
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,720
We're upstairs making this show and pretending we're in Ohio.

576
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,840
Drinking instant coffee with Cremora.

577
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,660
We're too well informed to actually attend next day anymore.

578
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,240
Why drive all the way there when we're...

579
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,860
So we're just...

580
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,300
Why should we participate in such low class goings on?

581
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,940
Ours is a high and lonely destiny.

582
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,860
It's sort of like this...

583
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,320
Lonely is right.

584
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,600
How many people have gotten the audience here?

585
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,460
Not many.

586
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:31,700
Five?

587
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,920
But you're the best...

588
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,480
The best driven in the audience in the entire...

589
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,000
They know they'll be able to hear it a lot better on Hour of Slack three months from now.

590
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,740
I hope I'll be able to hear it a lot better on the Hour of Slack and so on.

591
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,500
Yeah, I'm curious as to what's been said.

592
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,520
Yeah, it's kind of like a Grateful Dead concert, you know.

593
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,080
I mean, if you want to go and get the drugs, you attend the concert.

594
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,020
If you want to hear the music, then you get the albums.

595
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,420
I missed my Grateful Dead concert.

596
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,920
Didn't hear a bit of it.

597
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,920
Put me sound right to sleep.

598
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,940
But you got the drugs.

599
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,780
I want to tell you, I agree with you because I went to see them one time and it was the most boring band I have ever seen.

600
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,820
Was that at Armadillo, by any chance?

601
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,360
No, it was in San Antonio at that big convention center thing.

602
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,500
And it was, I forget who, Mott the Hoople or somebody like that opened for them.

603
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
And then it was the Grateful Dead and they were just...

604
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,540
I was able to stay awake all through New Riders of the Purple Sage, but man, ten minutes into the Dead, I was dead.

605
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,340
Well, that's why they named him that.

606
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,920
I found out that even the Grateful Dead audience has it.

607
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,020
I remember I was a good smathering of conspiracy thinking when I was given a pair of tickets to attend the Grateful Dead.

608
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,000
And because I wasn't that interested in them at that time, I went out to sell them.

609
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,360
This is at Stanford campus.

610
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,400
So I just said, Grateful Dead tickets, 20 bucks.

611
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,620
And someone came up to me and said, he's a counterfeiter.

612
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,380
He's a counterfeiter.

613
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,180
Don't buy those tickets.

614
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,920
Nobody sells Grateful Dead tickets for 20 bucks a pair.

615
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,760
And I went, okay, fine.

616
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,260
Grateful Dead tickets, $50.

617
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,800
Someone else came up, bought it from me.

618
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,860
True story.

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,260
A true subgenius.

620
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,860
And I told you.

621
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,840
This membership's $135.

622
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:14,920
There's a Grateful Dead national museum and shrine where they have a huge statue of Jerry Garcia's hand, which is missing the middle finger.

623
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,340
Well, actually, it has a little stub, doesn't it?

624
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah, he's stubby.

625
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,380
That's because he overused it.

626
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
He's got a stumpy middle finger.

627
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,160
It's stumpy, yeah, sure.

628
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,320
You know, but if you had that one finger, think what you can get on it for eBay.

629
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I mean, that would just be Jerry Garcia's middle finger.

630
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:36,520
Well, we sold Puzzling Evidence's teeth here at an X Day auction one year.

631
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:45,720
And now it's 310, ten minutes after the hour of three as we broadcast from the famous X Day.

632
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,180
And I'm going to have to edit the hell out of this if it ever ends up on the air.

633
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,180
Any time you go to one of those legends or special Gold's Gym.

634
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,560
Have faith, doctor.

635
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,480
Have faith.

636
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,580
We're here to support Jim.

637
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,980
No, we're here to not have faith.

638
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,900
That giant medicine ball.

639
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,260
Well, how many weeks do we have?

640
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,180
All we have is faith in Bob.

641
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,660
That's Enterprise.

642
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,200
5D.

643
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,620
That's what I'm saying.

644
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,460
Have faith in Bob.

645
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,840
You'll be able to edit the show.

646
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,060
Put that Bob head up on the wall and he'll smile at you.

647
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah, that old Bob head will...

648
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,660
You've been doing this for 1,369 weeks?

649
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,760
I ask you.

650
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,380
That's your karma, doctor.

651
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:22,480
I've been doing this stupid show every week for 1,369 goddamn weeks.

652
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,820
Dang.

653
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,060
And your point is?

654
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,040
I might tell you at least done 1,400.

655
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,040
And hopefully this...

656
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,600
Tomorrow will be the last one.

657
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,880
And then the answers will be...

658
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,160
The last one.

659
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,100
And we won't have to go through the horrible token July 5th hour of slack where we go,

660
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,180
oh, well, maybe it was...

661
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:38,760
They were tiny.

662
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,700
Yeah, that's it.

663
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
We stepped on them.

664
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,380
Oh, that was last year's show.

665
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,440
Oh, maybe...

666
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,360
They're invisible.

667
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,300
Maybe they got the wrong planet.

668
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,140
No, they're invisible.

669
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
We just couldn't see them because we weren't pure enough.

670
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,660
Yeah, we weren't pure enough.

671
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,360
We couldn't see...

672
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,460
We didn't have enough naked girls.

673
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,760
We weren't clean enough.

674
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,620
We weren't good enough.

675
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,380
We didn't raise the prices enough.

676
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,200
69.

677
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,020
There's always some idiotic excuse for why the...

678
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,020


679
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,060
Religion completely bottomed out and failed.

680
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,380
Of course.

681
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,380
But what other religion doesn't have the same thing?

682
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,040
We just have more of it.

683
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,720
All religions go in for it.

684
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:07,720


685
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:07,740
We have...

686
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,740
We are...

687
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,880
We get to be hypocritical every single year to the max.

688
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,960
And these other people are still waiting.

689
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,260
We have more freedom of hypocrisy.

690
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,520
The Christians are still waiting.

691
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,200
They're going, oh, the rapture's gonna come.

692
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,960
We're still waiting.

693
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,700
We're so happy.

694
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,160
Oh, Jesus rules.

695
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,260
And we know that's all a bunch of...

696
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,900
Well, that's how we separate the people who have two faces.

697
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,000


698
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,760
And those who don't.

699
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:28,860
And those who don't.

700
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,240
All the other religions have...

701
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,420
They don't give you a way of proving that they're bogus.

702
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,640
We have a way of showing that you truly do believe, that you see every single year that

703
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,700
it doesn't work, and yet you still believe.

704
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
That is faith.

705
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,220
This is faith.

706
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,800
That is faith.

707
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,920
That's what I'm talking about.

708
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,820
You should have that faith, Dr. Friedrich.

709
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,220
The FIB.

710
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,280
The Jehovah's Witnesses can't out-cook us.

711
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,140
And believe me, they try.

712
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,800
In fact, our book, Revelation X, was actually based on one of their books, loosely, in a

713
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,640
structural sense.

714
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,760
I thought it was the Watchtower.

715
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,600
I thought their book was based on us.

716
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,180
Well, we do owe a lot to Watchtower and the Wake.

717
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,220
Papa Joe Mama and I were on a bus and...

718
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,180
...free Jehovah's Witness magazines that you find in laundromats.

719
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,880
In fact, the original...

720
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,300
Our profane conversations...

721
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,280
Bob originally commissioned us to do that first pamphlet to leave around in laundromats

722
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,340
for free.

723
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Our Bible carrying Jehovah's Witness.

724
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,600
But when I paid the printing bill...

725
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,460
He left his book of kookery behind.

726
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,600
...it went against my every grain.

727
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,020
And he took it.

728
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,340
That's genius.

729
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,780
What, give something away?

730
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,200
And we reshaped it into...

731
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,880
Surely he meant one dollar.

732
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,320
...Revelation X, the Bible...

733
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,580
But see, I got that pamphlet for free, and look how much money I gave back to the church.

734
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,340
But as profane...

735
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, but it was Bolivian money.

736
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,040
Well, it was still money.

737
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,020
What do you want?

738
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,480
I mean, you know, just because your dad couldn't figure out what the relationship was between

739
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,780
10,000 old pesos and new...

740
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,380
You actually did send us 600 bucks at one point.

741
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,760
Yes.

742
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,140
But those are old...

743
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,700
He had money at one time.

744
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,380
Those were silver certificates.

745
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:57,860
Yes, believe it or not.

746
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,600
Then he joined the...

747
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,140
And he donated to the church, and now he's a...

748
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,720
Penniless.

749
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,440
...a pensioner.

750
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,320
A pensioner, yes.

751
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,180
Go to the international airport and have a change at the terminal.

752
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,840
Sitting in the sun, waiting for the flowers to bloom.

753
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,100
Into your local currency.

754
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,540
Looking at my cat, wondering when the Xs are coming.

755
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:20,300
He was a rich rancher in Bolivia with all the cocaine he could possibly want, and then

756
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,420
he joined the church of the subgenius.

757
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,760
And look what happened.

758
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,680
And he was wiping the butts of some of the...

759
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:26,680


760
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,780
He was wiping the butts of some of the severely retarded high school kids for...

761
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,180
15 years.

762
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,720
15 years.

763
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,280
And he got more slack.

764
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,860
That's the weird thing about it.

765
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,020
Horatio Alger story.

766
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,400
Yeah.

767
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,400
Gee, Gordon Gordon got more slack wiping retarded kids' butts than he did as a rich

768
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,380
smuggler living the life of James Bond.

769
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,800
No, I was a stinking white overlord for a while there.

770
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,660
Well, that's why he gets all the good shit.

771
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,460
Down in the steaming jungle.

772
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,680
Direct inspiration from the subgeni.

773
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,600
But then those ants came.

774
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,120
Yes.

775
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,580
The green...

776
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,600
The army ants came to green hell and ate all of his hell.

777
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,900
Superior mutants.

778
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,820
I mean, every one of those pieces of tissue had some holy message on it.

779
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:01,960
It happens periodically.

780
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,840
It was the inflation monsters that drove me away when I was having to carry 50 pounds

781
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,860
of money just to buy a beer.

782
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,100
You just have to look at that message and decipher it in much the same way a Rourke

783
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,560
inkblot...

784
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,360
Oh, that's the message Bob wants me to give in this week's sermon.

785
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:24,080
So Gordon's sermons based on the tissue paper from his superior mutants, that's the source

786
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,140
of much of our salvation.

787
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,160
It's the best shit there is.

788
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,860
What's he talking about?

789
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,480
It sounds illicit.

790
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,240
We have to listen back to the tape.

791
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,380
Yes, this will all be edited out.

792
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,960
That's how we're able to make these statements.

793
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,780
That's right.

794
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,060
We don't condone anything irregular.

795
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,220
We have to watch out for the FCC and...

796
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,260
John Law might be listening.

797
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,560
We don't want them to know where we get all our great ideas.

798
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,300
You know, actually, if I send out a show with cussing on it, Reverend Susie the Fluesy

799
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,360
will personally beat me up.

800
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,740
Oh dear.

801
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,100
And not in the fun way.

802
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,980
Oh dear.

803
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,540
You know, some of us actually have shows on real stations that air while children are

804
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:05,540


805
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,700
With listeners, no less.

806
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,300
I've got listeners who force their kids to listen to Hour of Slack.

807
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,620
Now, Johnny, don't forget to listen to your Hour of Slack before going to bed.

808
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,200
That's right.

809
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,840
They have these tiny earbuds.

810
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,340
They're really listening to rap songs or something.

811
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,380
Yes, our tiny earbuds.

812
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,280
If you're not good, we will send you to bed.

813
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,280


814
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,160
We will send you to bed without the Hour of Slack.

815
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,060
It is, I have to admit, horrible at times when people walk up to me and go,

816
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,300
Wow, that Bob stuff.

817
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,140
Yeah, my parents were into that.

818
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,540
They made me read that stuff.

819
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,140
You know, it's like, oh my God.

820
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,900
How sad.

821
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,360
Or even worse, Hour of Slack.

822
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,180
I used to listen to Hour of Slack when I was a teenager.

823
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,060
And this is a 40-year-old you're talking to.

824
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:47,760
You mean Bob?

825
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,500
He's still alive?

826
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,740
And I always end up having to go, it's still on.

827
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,980
He's not for long.

828
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,740
Maybe I shouldn't tell that story at every Hour of Slack and more people would listen.

829
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,120
It's also become a part of our traditions.

830
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,040
No, it's old is new again.

831
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,000
That's the way we look at it at the Church of the Subgenius.

832
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,020
Recycling is the new green.

833
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,760
That's right.

834
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
The green church.

835
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,180
Yes, we're not going to pollute the atmosphere anymore with new ideas.

836
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,020
Right, air pollution.

837
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,260
We'll just use the same old.

838
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,520
Recycle.

839
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,300
We'll recycle.

840
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,120
What's wrong with recycling?

841
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,400
We'll just recycle everything.

842
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,400
We have to.

843
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,340
We are recycling.

844
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,680
We have been for 30 years.

845
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,840
Oh, I just realized that.

846
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,420
Geez, I thought it was all new stuff.

847
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,440
Well, how would you know?

848
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,400
How would any of us know if it was new or old?

849
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,320
It's synthesis.

850
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,560
That's what it is.

851
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,240
Recombining in an ever more entertaining way.

852
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,900
We've been saying the same thing every five minutes.

853
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:40,780
Yes, that's right.

854
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,700
Well, I think it's important for the scholars out there, I think there may be one or two of them, to make the distinction.

855
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,200
And Dr. Howell, I think, could second this notion that the Church of the Subgenius wasn't invented in the 1950s or anything.

856
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,040
It was discovered.

857
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,280
There's a big difference, an invention versus a discovery.

858
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,900
The Church of the Subgenius is now and forever will be and it forever was.

859
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,740
So it cannot be invented because it was always there.

860
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,380
It was just a matter of, it's like fire.

861
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,560
You don't invent fire.

862
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,080
You discover fire.

863
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,660
And you don't invent dobs.

864
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,180
You discover dobs.

865
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,320
You discover a method of contacting dobs.

866
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,380
Yeah, but I mean, on the old ones, the head launchings were real.

867
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,080
I mean, the old versions of the Church really did have heads on pipes.

868
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,480
And being launched from cattle.

869
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,620
And the blood rush.

870
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,400
Now we just pretend.

871
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Gah.

872
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,720
We ritually enact it.

873
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,540
The original subgenius church, the Spanish Inquisition, they knew how to do it right.

874
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,520
Well, that's the way it is with all the religions.

875
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
I mean, back in the brutal days.

876
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,040
The Russian Orthodox Church, Ivan the Terrible, my grandfather.

877
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,260
Mormons really did have multiple wives.

878
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,860
I thought that was you, Ivan the Terrible.

879
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:47,160
No, I'm descended from you.

880
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,940
I am, in fact, the legal heir to the throne of all the Russias.

881
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,180
And the crown jewel.

882
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,620
On all pot slack, they call you Ivan the Terrible.

883
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,740
This is why they resisted...

884
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,480
I don't expect anybody to believe me.

885
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,980
That's a common delusion.

886
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,840
Well, I'm related to the King of England, so...

887
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,420
Are you really?

888
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,600
Well, hell no.

889
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,040
Which one?

890
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,940
None of them.

891
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,480
I thought it was your wife that was the Anastasia.

892
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,360
But if you can say Ivan the Terrible, I can certainly say the King of England.

893
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,120
You're saying she's no longer Anastasia?

894
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,040
I thought she was the heiress that disappeared.

895
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,600
Right, yeah.

896
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,740
Oh, okay, okay, okay, I got it.

897
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
Well, except they found her skull.

898
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,140
Yep.

899
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,440
Yeah, I thought that was the skull that you were...

900
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,740
Wouldn't believe that she had her skull.

901
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:21,920
So it's really her.

902
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,620
Her skull was surgically removed.

903
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,260
So you're descended from the illegitimate...

904
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,940
To commit an imposture.

905
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,680
...person who pretended to be Anastasia, even though Anastasia...

906
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,660
No, no, no, no.

907
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,720
I'm the illegitimate descendant of Rasputin...

908
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,300
Rasputin, ah!

909
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,140
...and the Tsarina Alexandra, the last Tsar.

910
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,500
The mad monk.

911
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,200
Yes.

912
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,200
And he's been sleeping with Anastasia.

913
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,680
My real name is Ivan Stankovich, but they...

914
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,180
But isn't that a Jewish name?

915
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,980
Actually, it's Ivan Romanov Rasputin Stankovich.

916
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,480
Of course, when we moved to America, we Americanized it to Smith.

917
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,180
Well, didn't you?

918
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,620
I thought it was Smith.

919
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,000
And then in order to come off, in order to convince Hollywood people that I was Jewish,

920
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,980
I changed it to Stank.

921
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,980
Now, you're leaving out the other...

922
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,220
You started as Smith, then you changed it to Smut, and then from that to Smith.

923
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,500
Actually, you want to know something really horrible?

924
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,320
Yes.

925
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:20,760
My first name, Douglas, is really named after the family who adopted my grandfather.

926
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:28,240
His real last name, which would be my first name had the adoption not happened, was

927
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,000
McNutt.

928
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,180
M-C-N-U-T-T.

929
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,400
I thought it was Shuffler Gruber.

930
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,280
So, I technically could be...

931
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,420
My real human street name would be McNutt St. Clair Smith.

932
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,480
One nut.

933
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,200
One...

934
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
I have the nut in my...

935
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,520
As it is, I have an ass in my name.

936
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,220
The Douglas has two S's.

937
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,740
I have a...

938
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,000
So, you heard it here first, folks.

939
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,460
So technically, I've got eight cheeks.

940
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,000
Well, this is a common theme in people, historical figures.

941
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,360
I've got eight.

942
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,360


943
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:58,360


944
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,500
I mean, Hitler was supposed to be Shuffler Gruber, but it changed to Hitler and who

945
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,980
you are.

946
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,700
Don't we know somebody with a name like that in the West Coast?

947
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,200
McNutt.

948
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,080
Stank.

949
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,180
I mean, it just wouldn't be the same.

950
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
You don't say, hail McNutt.

951
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:07,820
Douglas.

952
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,440
Somebody.

953
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,060
Well, it would sound too perfect.

954
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,440
It's like the St. Clair part.

955
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,100
I've got a damn saint's name in the middle of my name.

956
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,220
My family's...

957
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,600
No one in my family's ever been Catholic.

958
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,500
And the St. Clair...

959
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,720
And the St. Clair...

960
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,880
St. Clair is the patron saint of television.

961
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,080
But actually, isn't St. Clair an appellation of an old English noble family?

962
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,900
I don't think it's Catholic at all.

963
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,440
I think it's an old...

964
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,200
There are no coincidences.

965
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
Everything happens for a reason.

966
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,460
Actually, St. Clair is the patron saint of television.

967
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,960
Yes, I just said that.

968
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,300
You can always tell yourself it was Catholic.

969
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,600
If you'd have been listening, Stan, I would have heard that.

970
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,040
He doesn't listen.

971
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,500
If he hadn't been talking, I would have heard.

972
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,400
I wasn't talking.

973
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,400
What?

974
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,380
I wasn't talking.

975
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,580
When did that ever happen?

976
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,480
Prove to me that that has happened.

977
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,560
He wasn't talking to you.

978
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,720
Because we're not the type to preach it.

979
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,480
We're talking for the historical record.

980
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,660
Hey, man, let's do this more often.

981
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,360
Oh.

982
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,860
If all the subgenius preachers were to shut up, the foreheads themselves would open up

983
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,280
and scream.

984
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:17,400
Well, we seem to have bypassed the recent lightning storm, momentary tantrum from the

985
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,400


986
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
Now, we were going to do an Ask Dr. Howe.

987
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,360
I'm here to ask Dr. Howe.

988
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,560
I'm here.

989
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,780
Ready and waiting.

990
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:28,640
Now, to do Ask Dr. Howe, the thing is that we need to hand out the—if anyone has a

991
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,900
question, there are pens and pencils here, and here is paper to write it on.

992
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:43,400
The way Dr. Howe works is you have paid your X-Day fee, so he'll answer your question

993
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,640
for nothing.

994
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,160
No, I never—

995
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,340
But if you grease the brain cells of people—

996
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,340


997
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,340


998
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:56,460
Because if Dr. Howe, with a dollar or five-dollar bill or something like that, you'll get a

999
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,700
cleaner, finer brand of bullshit.

1000
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,320
Right.

1001
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:07,220
You'll have the slickest—slickest snot on a door handle he'll be.

1002
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,140
It's my advice.

1003
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,360
It's my advice.

1004
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,380
It's your question.

1005
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,580
Slicker than snail shit.

1006
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,920
What?

1007
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,120
Anybody knows advice is what you—worth what you pay for it, so—

1008
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,920
Now, in advance, let me warn everyone who participates.

1009
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,680
The question—

1010
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,260
Oh, what?

1011
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,600
What question should I ask has already been asked a thousand times.

1012
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,480
It doesn't matter.

1013
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,180
It's up to them what question they want to ask, even if it's one of those hoary old chestnuts.

1014
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,440
And that was my question, is what question should I ask, Dr. Hal.

1015
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,800
When do they have fruit or vegetables?

1016
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,440
They have fruit and vegetables.

1017
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,600
Standing on the corner.

1018
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,940
Fruitus evidurus.

1019
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,140
Chestnut whores.

1020
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,380
I've never heard of that.

1021
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:54,040
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, what songs the siren sang or the name Achilles used when he hid himself among women?

1022
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,420
Who killed the toads in the rice that ate the poppy cockalorum and the cockahoopatrice?

1023
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:11,080
I can give you the answer to these esoteric questions, but you must actually justify your question with a slight donation.

1024
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,360
Otherwise, I shall know that you honor your...

1025
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Your query not.

1026
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,840
And it will inhibit my ability to be engaged with your answer.

1027
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,720
Very nicely put, Dr. Hal.

1028
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,420
It's just like a warning, like the fine print on the box.

1029
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Well, we have a question, but we do not have the emolument.

1030
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:43,320
At any rate, that's at least a slight flicker of response, which is perhaps better than we are entitled to.

1031
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,200
Would you like to read that?

1032
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,640
Yes, I'll go ahead and read the questions.

1033
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh, this is two questions with no money.

1034
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,140
With no offering.

1035
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,240
What is going...

1036
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,180
No, no money.

1037
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,240
Well, I...

1038
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,720
Bring a man a cookie.

1039
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,780
Bring a man a cookie or something.

1040
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Bottle of water.

1041
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,880
That's all right.

1042
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,580
An old dead centipede.

1043
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,160
Forge ahead.

1044
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:03,840
Just got to make an offering.

1045
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,180
It's a meaningless ritual.

1046
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,620
Okay, here's the first question.

1047
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,260
With a cleaving from society's laws and morals.

1048
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,500
From the little boy up in the front asks, WTF?

1049
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,380
What?

1050
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:13,820
The...

1051
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,780
What the...

1052
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,900
What the frack?

1053
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,360
Bureau of Wienerschnitzel, Tobacco and Firearms.

1054
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,040
What does your Facebook middle name, Cypress, mean?

1055
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,480
Sick, he wrote.

1056
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,400
Cypress Sick.

1057
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,020
Well, it's a sick Cypress.

1058
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,880
I think it's misspelled a little bit.

1059
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,060
Well, he did spell it wrong.

1060
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,680
My name isn't spelled in this fashion like say-frez.

1061
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,120
It is Cypress.

1062
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,400
And so the use of the...

1063
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,640
The Latin syllable sick as it were thus is wrong.

1064
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,240
Absolutely.

1065
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,700
It appears with an I where you have a Y.

1066
00:39:52,900 --> 00:40:00,020
But it is Welsh and of a significant vintage.

1067
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,920
Among the ancestors of this Welsh clan are Macduff.

1068
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,300
You may remember Macduff.

1069
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,900
Lay on.

1070
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,240
That's one of my ancestors, Macduff.

1071
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,800
Who from his mother's womb...

1072
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,260
Was untimely ripped.

1073
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:15,760
Yeah.

1074
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,500
And his father laid on that Macduff.

1075
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,500
The only one who could kill the Macbeth who had a charmed life.

1076
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,740
His father laid on that Macduff.

1077
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,600
So I'm actually entitled to wear a kilt if I want to.

1078
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,720
But I don't want to.

1079
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,400
What's your fave kids TV commercial jingle or song?

1080
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,980
Can you perform it now?

1081
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,740
As if I liked TV kids commercials.

1082
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
It's difficult.

1083
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:51,600
But like R. Crumb and many others, I'm tormented by never being able to forget all the hundreds

1084
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,600
and thousands of TV commercials which were poured into my awakening brain at an early

1085
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,960
age.

1086
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,680
So now I could recapitulate them.

1087
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,920
But to do them stimulates the presence of a brain worm.

1088
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,160
I see Priestess Pisces is here with more questions.

1089
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,020
But first I have to come up with some damn kid TV commercial.

1090
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,780
I don't know.

1091
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,660
Poor Jingle.

1092
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:15,980
I'm accessing.

1093
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,680
Where did the yellow go?

1094
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,360
I couldn't include the theme song.

1095
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:19,920
What yellow?

1096
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,920
I wonder where the yellow went.

1097
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,540
This isn't a kids TV commercial, but you'll wonder where the yellow went when you brush

1098
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,020
your teeth with Pepsodent.

1099
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,840
Yai, yai, yai.

1100
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,680
Do you want him in the band?

1101
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,440
Sure, sure.

1102
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:31,980
How about the theme song?

1103
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,980
Reverend Heathen has just brought the sacred ranch-style bean supply, so there will be

1104
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,680
a pyroflatulation contest later tonight.

1105
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,580
Only Parliament gives you.

1106
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,440
At midnight on the stage.

1107
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,600
Parliament gives you.

1108
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,660
Don't bring any gasoline or flammables.

1109
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,760
The filters are recessed and made to stay unneat.

1110
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,300
Green quarter inch away.

1111
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:53,720
That's not a children's commercial.

1112
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,920
Every Parliament gives you.

1113
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,020
Dr. Howell, check it out.

1114
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,700
Extra margin.

1115
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Smoke a Parliament cigarette.

1116
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,640
Thank you.

1117
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
Dr. Howell, do you remember the theme song to Underdog?

1118
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,160
Excellent.

1119
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,380
Excellent indeed.

1120
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,720
Got any more in there?

1121
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:13,580
Well, you're not smoking cool, cool, cool all the time till you move up to cool.

1122
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:13,800
Cool.

1123
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,400
Cool's activated charcoal filter lets that flavor through.

1124
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,580
Feel extra coolness in your smoke as cool comes through for you.

1125
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,100
You're not smoking cool, cool, cool all the time till you come up to cool.

1126
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,280
Here's one.

1127
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,200
It says, why do things do things?

1128
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,800
Well, as you know, or perhaps as you do not know, most things do not do things.

1129
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,440
And all through the universe, one looks almost in vain for things that do things.

1130
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,080
And in fact, for things at all.

1131
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:00,180
Because most of the universe is empty space, unused, with only a few floating hydrogen atoms in it.

1132
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,920
But at interesting parts of our universe, there are things.

1133
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,660
There is matter, first of all.

1134
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,780
And it's very curious that when you inject energy into matter, as in...

1135
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,680
from a cozy, comfortable hydrogen-helium fusion reaction like we get from our star,

1136
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,720
the center of the heating system,

1137
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,180
then matter shows a strange propensity for self-organization.

1138
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,880
Not even is this confined to living matter.

1139
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,680
But crystalline formation occurs.

1140
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,380
And complex formulations of crystals occur,

1141
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,740
like the ones in that giant cave recently discovered,

1142
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,860
in Mexico.

1143
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,820
But of course, beyond that, life continues to organize itself into complex life forms.

1144
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,380
And these things do things in order, here's your answer,

1145
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,700
to maintain their level of organization.

1146
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,540
So never stand in the way of this directive, for it is also thy directive.

1147
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,660
And now here's another one.

1148
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,800
It says, tell about the Zilch Zond.

1149
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,240
Zop, zoop, you know, under fire and the drip.

1150
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,560
Is this one line?

1151
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,380
Tell about the Zilch.

1152
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,780
Zop, zop, or is it 20p?

1153
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,640
Or is it 200p?

1154
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,900
Or is it zop, zoop?

1155
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,660
Dr. Howell, I think he's talking about that plastic thing that we used to tie in knots

1156
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,920
and drop over a bucket, set on fire over a bucket of water, and then it went zop.

1157
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,960
That? You mean the Zilch Zop Zoop?

1158
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,300
Yeah.

1159
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,060
Yeah, the Zilch Zop Zoop.

1160
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,200
Dr. You mean drop burning, making noises and hit the Zop?

1161
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,280
It's kind of like the modern pastime of creating Barneys,

1162
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,940
as they are called, with lighter fluid inside a large glass vessel.

1163
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:57,860
Well, it's a harmless way for enterprising, eager youngsters to entertain themselves.

1164
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,740
And of course they can go on from there to more virile and deadly explosions.

1165
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,020
Ah, see there's some more.

1166
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,700
Here in the bounteous bosom of Priestess Pisces,

1167
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,340
I'll continue to remove these.

1168
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,620
Oh, alright.

1169
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,780
Nope, nothing.

1170
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,300
Dr. I think she has some in her panties too, I'm not sure.

1171
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:17,980
Well, we'll get there.

1172
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,280
Now, here's one, before I even unwrap this other one.

1173
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,580
Now things are elevated and correct.

1174
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,260
And here we go.

1175
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:33,900
Were the fruits orange and peach named after the colors or vice versa?

1176
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,680
Well, actually, they, the colors, vice versa is the answer.

1177
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:39,680


1178
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,020
The orange is orange.

1179
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:49,520
Orange and the peach, certainly there was no color peach before the first hairy, shambling,

1180
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:58,300
primitive progenitor of modern man sunk his yellowing canines into a tempting peach hanging on the tree.

1181
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,900
Oh, can you imagine the delectable flavor of that first peach?

1182
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:09,660
Its scent and the rush of juices into the questing mouth of this hungry man.

1183
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,620
Hungry humanoid.

1184
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,600
And we have to give these cavemen, as they are called, although few actually lived in

1185
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,980
caves, a lot of credit for, not only for eating the first peach, which is kind of a no-brainer,

1186
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,500
compared to, say, eating the first lobster?

1187
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,820
What adventurous, primitive gourmand is going to do that?

1188
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,140
Or clams?

1189
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,860
Oysters?

1190
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,380
Queasy things that people, even today, feel qualms about eating.

1191
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:45,520
Were easily snapped up by the avid choppers of Homo neanderthalensis and early human types.

1192
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,340
Peking men, Zinjanthropus.

1193
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:56,220
But in their defense, it may be said that they were almost always real hungry.

1194
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,160
Now here's one I have.

1195
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,620
Oh, we already did this one.

1196
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,660
That one's from Papa Joe Mama.

1197
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,840
It's a very good question.

1198
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,040


1199
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:05,260
All right.

1200
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,620
How long will the pleasure saucer take to arrive to Planet X?

1201
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:17,060
Well, you know, they operate in a different timeframe than we do here.

1202
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,000
You might say it could all take place between the beats of your heart or the kick of your watch.

1203
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,060
Eh, Reverend Stang?

1204
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:33,040
Well, I was going to say I have never seen any evidence that the saucers are going to Planet X at all.

1205
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,100
But how long does it take to go there?

1206
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,940
I've never even asked where they're going yet.

1207
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,880
They're from Planet X. We know that.

1208
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,120
They're from Planet X.

1209
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,480
We don't even know whether they're going to Planet X.

1210
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,960
We get our own saucers. We go wherever we want.

1211
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:56,560
Well, maybe they need to stop and, you know, drop off their laundry, pick up their mail, before they head out into the deeps of space.

1212
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,860
Maybe they're so big they're actually larger than Planet X. They are the new Planet X.

1213
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,260
Well, that we will find in good time.

1214
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,880
But I'm sure you all remember.

1215
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:12,140
The planet Mongo, ruled over by the pitiless Ming the Merciless, right?

1216
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,560
Ah, yes.

1217
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:22,540
The planet Mongo was a wandering planet that entered our solar system and caused trouble, caused the Arabs to riot and so forth,

1218
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:30,900
and caused Flash Gordon with Dr. Zarkov and Dale Arden to rocket off and land and begin an endless series of adventures.

1219
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,860
Well, this was laughed at by sneering, snobbish scientists.

1220
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,780
Until just last year, when it was discovered that there are wandering planets.

1221
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,880
Not just asteroids and other celestial bodies, but unaffiliated planets.

1222
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:54,440
And they might well wander into our solar system just in time to give the special launching platform for the Xists.

1223
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,520
And they might also give them an added boost of speed, always necessary in sidereal navigation.

1224
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,840
Indeed, interstellar travel requires a lot of time.

1225
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:04,840


1226
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:12,120
Just as much as it requires the enormous amount of energy, greater than any found on Earth, to achieve the proper acceleration.

1227
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,360
But you also have to stop.

1228
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,400
And stopping in space is another suite of problems.

1229
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,320
However, I think I'm through with that question.

1230
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,220
Do you like me?

1231
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,420
Is the question I now have.

1232
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,140
And there's a place I can check.

1233
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,160
Yes, no, maybe.

1234
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,640
Hmm.

1235
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,420
How interesting.

1236
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:33,920


1237
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,580
How would you answer such a question, G. Gordon Gordon?

1238
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,040
What do you think this questioner is really asking?

1239
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,960
Because often we have to determine the question behind the question.

1240
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,840
I think they're insecure, Dr. Howell, because they need approval.

1241
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,980
But who needs my approval?

1242
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:00,980
I think it's more likely that I'm being mocked by some sneering person who doesn't care one way or the other whether...

1243
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:01,120
No, no, Dr. Howell.

1244
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,840
We respect your marvelous intelligence.

1245
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,560
It could be that they maybe have a crush on you.

1246
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,040
Ah, it could be.

1247
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,900
Well, my answer then must not crush them in return.

1248
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:17,760
Let me just say that I, of course, like every subgenius, I welcome all subgeniuses at any time.

1249
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,840
Just as Ivan Stang does.

1250
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,820
Yes, these elder subgeniuses are the nicest folks on Earth.

1251
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,260
Salt of the Earth.

1252
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:31,260
And if you come and want to stay at their house and eat their food and hang out as long as you want,

1253
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:34,540
and ask them as many questions about Bob and subgeniuses as you want,

1254
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,860
you know you're welcome.

1255
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,660
And so the answer is resoundingly, as it must be, in the affirmative.

1256
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,440
What's that in your decolletage?

1257
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,780
Let me just find. Is there any money in there?

1258
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,420
Well, are you sure?

1259
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,360
That's a freebie.

1260
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,280
Well, all right. That's all right.

1261
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,940
I think I'd have to dig deeper to make sure.

1262
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,320
Okay. Now here we are.

1263
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:02,380
If a train leaves Seattle at 2.43 p.m. and travels at 75 miles an hour for 537 miles,

1264
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,880
50 miles per hour for an hour afterwards,

1265
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,420
and stops twice on the way to South Dakota's largest cheese factory,

1266
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:19,400
will G. Gordon Gordon unscrew his wooden hand and smoke it?

1267
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,960
That's a really good question.

1268
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,140
Yes. Well, is that what it would take?

1269
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,420
You know, I have Dr. G. Gordon Gordon right here.

1270
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,440
I don't need to guess at this answer.

1271
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,160
I can simply ask him, is this what it would take to get you to unscrew your southpaw hand?

1272
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,580
I bet he screws his own wooden hand three times a day.

1273
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,800
Yes, but it says, and smoke it.

1274
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,160
Because, you know, once it's smoked, it's gone.

1275
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,500
I must answer that question and say that I only use a vaporizer,

1276
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,780
so I cannot tell you whether I would smoke it or not.

1277
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,700
But I certainly would inhale it if I could unscrew it.

1278
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,080
Well, there you have the answer.

1279
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,880
It will not be smoked. It will be inhaled, whatever the provocation.

1280
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,660
But smoking, that's so passé.

1281
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,060
So passé.

1282
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,100
That's so the old way, not the new way that we avidly embrace.

1283
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,280
All right, we're going to take a brief break now.

1284
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:27,300
And I would also like to add that if you do not have your green band on by 5 o'clock,

1285
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,760
Dr. LeGume will be going among the people to find out.

1286
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,080
Why you don't have a green band.

1287
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,860
Why you don't have your electro-stimulo-negative-reinforcement bracelet.

1288
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,840
And in fact, shortly here, the enforcers will be out in force,

1289
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:48,880
looking to see who is trying to sneak under the radar by not receiving their wristbands.

1290
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,100
They are ushers. They're simply to guide you in the appropriate path.

1291
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,060
Pay no attention to the sharp objects in their belt or in their hand.

1292
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,480
It's not the sharp objects that are so worrisome.

1293
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,580
It's the blunt objects that bother me.

1294
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,040
Well, if you're offered a blunt, take the offer up.

1295
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,280
Take it advisedly.

1296
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,500
I do believe that the tape has been changed.

1297
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,280
So Papa Joe is welcome to come back up.

1298
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,300
He can stay down there.

1299
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,620
Yeah, but we're almost done.

1300
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,560
I have one more question.

1301
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,660
That was just handed to me by a young fellow.

1302
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,620
Maybe you should grab that beer while we're grabbing this book.

1303
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,860
Yeah, and I never did get my pie of sky meat.

1304
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,280
All right.

1305
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,020
Well, this is a question here.

1306
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,600
Was Socrates actually Socratic is the question.

1307
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,580
And of course, the answer is none was ever more.

1308
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:45,100
That question and answer method, which we kind of honor here at the show,

1309
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:51,120
is a good way to find out not only what you are capable of learning,

1310
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,760
but what you already knew.

1311
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,840
The idea is you already know the answer, just as I know that when I achieve the goal,

1312
00:53:59,840 --> 00:53:59,840


1313
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,020
these little slips, I have the answer in my hand.

1314
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:06,540
Because every question contains the germ or seed of the answer.

1315
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,560
Indeed, the idea of a question presupposes the idea of an answer.

1316
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,540
Both are concepts of equal meaning or lack of meaning,

1317
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:22,860
which we project upon the inexpressive face of the universe.

1318
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,460
Just as in ancient days, the god of a people might be, let us say,

1319
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:34,180
a meteoric stone which fell from heaven over whose rough and rugated surface

1320
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,660
the blood of the sacrificial victim was often splashed,

1321
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,060
and in dripping from its surface sometimes was conceived to resemble

1322
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,440
the peering, leering face of the god.

1323
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:55,000
Later generations made a more acceptable god, perhaps the beautiful figure of Venus,

1324
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,440
or a young woman, which they clothed in silk,

1325
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,820
in spectacular raiment.

1326
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:04,800
Because the method always is to refine things,

1327
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,080
until ultimately we refine it entirely out of existence again,

1328
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:15,100
the invisible, intangible god that you can't see, hear, or even whiff.

1329
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,060
Well, does that end us? Should I say a poem?

1330
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,960
Are we through with the Ask Dr. Hell show?

1331
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
Sure, yeah.

1332
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,860
So let's have that poem, and I will conclude this session of Ask Dr. Hell.

1333
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,180
I was a windy boy and a bit,

1334
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,260
and the black spit of the chapel fold

1335
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:38,000
sighed the old ramrod dying of women.

1336
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,420
I tiptoed shy in the gooseberry wood.

1337
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,100
The rude owl cried like a tell-tale tit.

1338
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,080
I skipped in a blush as the big girls rolled nine pin down

1339
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,940
on the donkey's common.

1340
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,700
And on seesaw Sunday nights,

1341
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,440
I wooed whoever I would with my wood,

1342
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,020
and with wicked eyes,

1343
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,600
the whole of the moon I would love and leave

1344
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,800
all the green-leaved little wedding's wives

1345
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:10,340
in the coal-black bush and let them grieve.

1346
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:15,600
When I was a windy boy and a bit,

1347
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,360
and the black spit of the chapel fold

1348
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:23,860
sighed the old ramrod dying of bitches.

1349
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,380
Not a boy and a bit by the wick-dipping moon,

1350
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,000
but drunk as a new-dropped calf,

1351
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,120
I whistled all night in the twisted flues.

1352
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,720
Midnight wives grew in the midnight ditches,

1353
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,240
and the sizzling beds of the town cried quick

1354
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,760
whenever I dove in a breast-high shoal,

1355
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,380
wherever I ramped in the clover quilts.

1356
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,560
Whatsoever I did in the coal-black night,

1357
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,900
I left my quivering prints.

1358
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,360
When I was a man,

1359
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,500
you could call a man,

1360
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,300
and the black cross of the holy house

1361
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,060
sighed the old ramrod dying of welcome.

1362
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,260
Brandy and ripe in my bright bass prime,

1363
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,300
no spring-tailed tom in the red-hot town

1364
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,900
with every simmering woman his mouse,

1365
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,180
but a hillicky bull in the swelter of summer

1366
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,980
come in his great good time

1367
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,280
to the sultry-biding herd,

1368
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,580
I said.

1369
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,500
Oh, time enough when the blood creeps cold,

1370
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,840
and I lie down but to sleep in bed

1371
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,520
for my sulking, skulking coal-black soul.

1372
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,760
When I was a half of the man I was,

1373
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,920
and served me right as the preacher's warn,

1374
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,180
sighed the old ramrod dying of downfall.

1375
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,360
No flailing calf or cat in a flail-towel,

1376
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,580
no flame or hickory bowl in milky grass,

1377
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,220
but a black sheep with a crumpled horn.

1378
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,900
At last the soul from its foul mouse-hole

1379
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,880
slung pouting out when the limp time came,

1380
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,620
and I gave my soul a blind-slashed eye,

1381
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,120
gristle and rind an aurora's life,

1382
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,480
and I shoved it into the coal-black sky

1383
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,780
to find a woman's soul,

1384
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,920
and I gave my soul a blind-slashed eye,

1385
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,060
and I shoved it into the coal-black sky.

1386
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:34,020
Now I am a man, no more, no more,

1387
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,660
and a black reward for a roaring life,

1388
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,940
sighed the old ramrod dying of strangers.

1389
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,600
Tidy and cursed in my dove-cooed room,

1390
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,180
I lie down thin and hear the good bell's jaw,

1391
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,920
for, oh, my soul found a sunday wife

1392
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,540
in the coal-black sky,

1393
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,520
and she bore angels,

1394
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,140
harpies around me out of her womb.

00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,700
Chastity prays for me, piety sings,

1396
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,860
innocence sweetens my last black breath,

1397
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,400
modesty hides my thighs in her wings,

1398
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:14,840
and all the deadly virtues plague my death.

1399
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,800
Thank you.
