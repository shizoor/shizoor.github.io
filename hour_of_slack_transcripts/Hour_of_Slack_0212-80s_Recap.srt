1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,180
Texas and we're back.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
Listen to the subgenius.

3
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,420
Our house.

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,300
What?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,940
When people get paranoid,

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,400
even though there may be some justification to it,

7
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,580
and that is the feeling develops for a long period of time.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Society's against you,

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,140
that they regard you as an enemy,

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,920
that, you know,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,620
after a while that can generate with you

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,340
returning hostile feelings.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,980
If they felt they feel that they're acting

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,100
under God's inspiration or whatever,

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,820
then anything's possible.

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,540
We'll have to wait and see if this plays out.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, despite that evaluation,

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,920
workers have to be smarter,

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,040
which is what corporate leaders tell us,

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,100
but the workers also have to be dumber.

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,000
That is, jobs are being smartened up and dumbed down.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,840
For every new job for a computer programmer in New York,

23
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,300
for example,

24
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,460
there are about 14 jobs for cashiers.

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,200
The cashier's cash register in most of the fast food organizations

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,080
takes about nine minutes to learn

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,440
and they want to cut it down to seven.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,140
And the less math you know, the better.

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,020
There are no numbers on the keys.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,460
If you're smart enough to spot a French fry on site,

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,780
you're smart enough to work at McDonald's.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,880
So at the time the schools are trying to increase their standards,

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,680
there's an incredible array of jobs and services

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,340
that require almost no education at all.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,060
Oh, yes, dear Frenzy.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,860
Where in the days of youth forever mixed in mine,

37
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,100
now, ere the compline hour of being alone

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,160
at hands itself,

39
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,220
and a puff or so before we yield

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,420
our spiritus to the wind.

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,920
And there goes that wind,

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,440
and we brought in a big bucket,

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,980
a shovel,

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,360
and we brought in a big shovel.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,360


46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,360


47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,360


48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,660
You see him here being lifted up to the door of the station.

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,340
And it's once again, dear friends,

50
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,000
the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,540
Ah, yes, and this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,900
Will O'Dobbs is here,

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,420
co-engineering and ready at,

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,840
if this storm doesn't put out the electricity,

55
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,100
to take your calls here at the station in Dallas

56
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
only between nine and ten o'clock on Sunday nights,

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Central Standard Time.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,840
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,780
Yes, it's a big bag of show tonight, dear friends,

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,540
because, well, as we approach the new year,

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,140
we'll do the...

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,320
Since everybody else is doing their decade roundup,

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,720
we'll be looking at the new decade,

64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,460
the last decade,

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,020
the X-Decade,

66
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,600
during the next couple of shows.

67
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,340
Eventually, you'll learn Dob's predictions

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,800
for the coming New World Order

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,580
and the terrible tribulations coming up in between.

70
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,320
But we'll begin looking ahead by looking back.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,620
Also, you'll be hearing some clips

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,340
from some live subgenius,

73
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,840
some revivals,

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,880
a wonderful new Papa Joe Mama sermon

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,340
that will touch your heart,

76
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,340
and other marital aids,

77
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,680
audio marital aids you can stick in your ear.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,820
What do you want?

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,940
You want information.

80
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,400
You won't get it by hook or by crook.

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,980
We will.

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,720
We will.

83
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,840
We will hurt you.

84
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,820
Because the truth hurts, dear friends.

85
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
Looking back,

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,300
over,

87
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,840
the lovely 80s,

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
the ugly 80s,

89
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,660
I suppose you could say,

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,900
in 1980,

91
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
there was no AIDS

92
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
and no crack.

93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,740
Rock Hudson was a he-man.

94
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,020
There were very few homeless.

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,420
There were few, if any,

96
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,640
video recorders,

97
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
home computers,

98
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,360
answering machines,

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,800
fax machines,

100
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,800
compact discs,

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,340
self-published fanzines,

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,440
independent casinos,

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,340
set bands,

104
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,080
or microwave ovens, for that matter.

105
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,140
The Russians lost a nuclear reactor.

106
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,080
We lost a space shuttle.

107
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,920
And Bhopal, India lost 3,000 residents.

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,080
Africa lost a few hundred million residents.

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,520
The whole planet lost a lot of ozone layer and rainforests.

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,300
And there was a kid that got a baboon heart and died.

111
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,200
And L. Ron Hubbard died.

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,340
And J. Allen Hynek died.

113
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,040
And Marshall McLuhan died.

114
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,360
And Huey Newton died.

115
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,900
And Colonel Sanders died.

116
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,080
And the Shah of Iran and the Ayatollah both died.

117
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,660
And Dian Fossey and Emperor Hirohito died.

118
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,240
Sugar Ray Robinson died.

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,540
And Charles Adams died.

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,620
And Desi Arnaz died.

121
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,320
And Hugh Perry died.

122
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,220
And Boma died.

123
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,500
Mel Blanc died.

124
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,940
John Carradine died.

125
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,620
And Salvador Dali died.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,020
And Buckminster Fuller died.

127
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,040
And Lightning Hopkins died.

128
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
And Graham Chapman died.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,040
And Moe Howard died.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,060
And Jay Ward died.

131
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:25,040
And Cary Grant died.

132
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,300
And Robert Curtis died.

133
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,300


134
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Heinlein, Sergio Leone, John Lennon, Bob Marley, Juan Miro, Vic Morrow, Vic Morrow,

135
00:06:45,020 --> 00:07:00,080
Roy Orbison, Sam Peckinpah, Slim Pickens, Anne Rand, Peter Sellers, Kate Smith, Francois Truffaut,

136
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:11,180
Peter Tosh, Andy Warhol, Muddy Waters, Jack Webb, Johnny Weissmuller, Orson Welles,

137
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,280
Wally Walsh,

138
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:22,060
Greg Irons, Vaughn Bodie, Dave Sheridan, Mae West, J.R., Bob Dobbs.

139
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,020
A few thousand species and a lot of oxygen.

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,040
Bummer.

141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,260
On the other hand, friends, there were gains.

142
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,620
The populations of several Central and South American tar paper shantytowns rose to 30 million each.

143
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,620
The Alaskan beaches.

144
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,720
Well, certainly, unified Africa has turned into beef, men, and could I say cows?

145
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:58,720


146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,300
to make in 17 может seem terrace view spears times etc.

147
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,460
... well, then, you can raise them and you can have Anda taking

148
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:00,460


149
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,380
presupys and serving women and men to procure a Janga Tenggu Liberty 음악 competition.

150
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,920
Yet wood above.

151
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
That is not the case for relocated work.

152
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,000
It was not.."

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,020
vindictive soccer.

154
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,460
Some show!

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,220
Golly!

156
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay, man.

157
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,980
I'm gonna kill myself.

158
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,960
Gee, that's no good.

159
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,320
Does anyone want to walk up and speak to the show mic?

160
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,040
Go for it.

161
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,500
Okay, you can find out what it's like for me to get on.

162
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Go for it.

163
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,560
Church of the Subgenius is more than unmotivatable therapy.

164
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,320
Unmotivational therapy, that is.

165
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,600
Unmotivational.

166
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,340
It is.

167
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,420
No, that's true.

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,340
It is more than unmotivational therapy.

169
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,960
Because that just opens up the limits completely.

170
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,580
I mean, it could be anything.

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,840
It could be that armadillo dead on the side of the road that you had to watch.

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,440
It could be the discarded syringes washing up on those.

173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
New Jersey beaches.

174
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,020
It could be the free syringes handed out to AIDS sufferers

175
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,180
to prevent them from spreading it further.

176
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,120
It could be the poor, pathetic bastards sitting in this room.

177
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,360
Where's all the hate?

178
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,500
It could be that body.

179
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,440
Don't you need to vomit your hate out into the little show deck?

180
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:39,880
You can't.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,700
I mean, God, this thing's been running for 45 minutes.

182
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,240
And I ain't heard.

183
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,060
The only kind of hate I've heard was the church against its own members.

184
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,020
And that's sad.

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,100
That's a sad, pathetic thing.

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,240
How much money have we made?

187
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,200
Man, I hate the ulcers on the back of a tropical forest.

188
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,320
I hate it.

189
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
I hate everything that grows at the bottom of the sea that you can't see.

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,020
Just because we don't have the technology.

191
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,780
I hate those lesions that grow on the back of my ears when I don't wash enough.

192
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,580
I hate it.

193
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,320
I hate it.

194
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,300
I hate it when blood comes out of my eyes.

195
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
I hate it.

196
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,160
I hate it when I tear my own hair out.

197
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,840
I hate it when I wake up in the morning and I crawl out of bed.

198
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,740
And I leave my bed with me.

199
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:39,160
I hate it when somebody comes up with a razor blade as I'm walking into work

200
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,340
at 8 o'clock.

201
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,460
And I wake up in the morning and they cut my britches.

202
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,600
And they fall on the ground and I'm standing there.

203
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,600
And I forgot to put on my underwear.

204
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,340
What about the poultry?

205
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,760
I hate it when Bob comes to my house with a garbage sack full of poultry claiming to be my in-law.

206
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm not married.

207
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm not married.

208
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,280
I hate it when Bob takes one of those...

209
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,520
...

210
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,080
...one of those big industrial ball bearings and makes it into a pot roast.

211
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:36,880
I hate it when I see the summer constellations arise in the middle of winter.

212
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,020
I hate it when I see the summer constellations arise in the middle of winter.

213
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,480
Praise Bob.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,260
Look, one man's already on the floor spazzing me.

215
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,860
Spazzing me!

216
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,200
Oh, God almighty, I'm speaking in tongues.

217
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,260
Chug!

218
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,500
Big hands, dirty tongues.

219
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,320
Big hands, dirty tongues.

220
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,420
Man, I know what you mean about having that when you don't wash behind your ears.

221
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,920
Woo!

222
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,160
Here it's moved!

223
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:26,060
Sex and violence, sex and violence, sex and violence, sex and violence, sex and violence, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, violence.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,880
Sex.

225
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,460
Now sex in magazines, sex on TV, sex in songs on the radio.

226
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:32,860
Sex.

227
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,700
The human body is a helpless receptor before the vast electronic hum and buzz of our world.

228
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,520
Commercials are aimed either at the stomach or at the genitals or sometimes at both,

229
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,780
as when the act of drinking a soft drink causes buttocks and breasts to rise before the drinker.

230
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,980
...

231
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,060
...

232
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:02,160
For it is to you, first born and first fruit of woe, to me, branded sheep,

233
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,820
pick of the waste or paper-bascal, by the tremors of thundery and olorin's dog-star.

234
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,060
Hello, friends, and welcome.

235
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,500
The sermon tonight is entitled, The Pain of Bob.

236
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,220
I want to begin tonight by asking a personal question, if you don't mind.

237
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,960
How many of you have ever been tortured?

238
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,280
I mean, really tortured?

239
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,420
Raise your hand if you've ever really been tortured.

240
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,760
Ha! It was a trick question.

241
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,140
If you've ever really been tortured, you wouldn't be able to raise your hand.

242
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,260
You wouldn't have any arms.

243
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,460
You see, real torture changes you for life, however short that may be.

244
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,340
Real torture is not something you can experience or forget or go back to the way you were before.

245
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,280
No one knows us more than our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

246
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,240
Bet you didn't know that, did you?

247
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
J.R. Bob Dobbs was regularly tortured.

248
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,260
And you probably don't know that.

249
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,580
You probably thought his assassination was the height of his pain.

250
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:10,860
Ha! Compared to torture, Bob's assassination was an orgasm of pleasure, total euphoria, complete bliss.

251
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,120
The tickling sensation one feels as a bullet ricochets through the body.

252
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,860
The sweet numbness of shock slowing the world down around you.

253
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,720
The warm, lazy feeling of swimming in your own blood.

254
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,120
You see, Bob's sacrifice wasn't that he died for us.

255
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,420
Dying was fun.

256
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,120
At least in comparison.

257
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,700
In comparison to his real sacrifice.

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,440
The sacrifice of life.

259
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,520
That's why we worship Bob.

260
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,420
Because he lived for us.

261
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,680
And it was torture of everyday life that Bob suffered for you and me.

262
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,220
And yet, even in the midst of that pain, Bob was not bitter.

263
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,300
The conspiracy strapped him down.

264
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,400
The conspiracy rammed bamboo shoots up his fingernails.

265
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Jammed razor blades in between his toes.

266
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Threw salt in his paper wounds.

267
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,300
And yet, Bob never requested divine intervention.

268
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,720
Instead, he rolled his eyes heavenward and whispered with failing breath,

269
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,400
Forgive them, Father.

270
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,620
Because I'm going to get even!

271
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,580
And friends, payback time is just around the corner.

272
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,500
And that's good news for all the subgenies who want to help Bob avenge the pain.

273
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,460
We've talked about X-Day.

274
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,080
We've talked about the trials.

275
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,060
We've even discussed the fate of the few fortunate enough to escape.

276
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,960
The final judgment.

277
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:39,100
But have you ever stopped to consider the sheer magnitude of the bureaucracy and red tape that must exist for the X's to carry out the judgment on those found guilty?

278
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:46,960
We're talking about millions of conspiracy dupes, accomplices, pink boys, and self-proclaimed normals.

279
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,280
And that's just the followers, mind you.

280
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Let's not forget the leaders.

281
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,760
They're the ones that deserve special attention.

282
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,340
But will they get it?

283
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,040
After all, efficient as they are, can the X's be?

284
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,740
Will the X's really process some four billion earthlings and yet guarantee the extra time and attention to detail that those extra guilty deserve?

285
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,580
Probably not.

286
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,340
And that's where you and I come in, friends.

287
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:20,000
Because Bob needs us to help fulfill his holy covenant, his sacred promise to do unto those as they did unto him.

288
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Now, when Bob promised to get even with those who tortured him,

289
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,020
he didn't just mean those handful of torture masters who were directly responsible for the torture.

290
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,400
He meant those who were directly responsible for his torture only.

291
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,580
Why, Bob cares for all the oppressed.

292
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,780
Not just the subgenies either, but anyone tortured for any reason.

293
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,360
Be it because of your religion, or what you think, or that you think at all.

294
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,340
It doesn't matter.

295
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,100
And don't let size fool you either.

296
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,120
Bob cares as much about the little guy as he does the big one.

297
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,680
It's just as important to Bob to get the child abuser as it is to get Edie Amin.

298
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,920
And just how does Bob propose to punish this scum of the earth?

299
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,780
Glad you asked.

300
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,340
Now, I don't know about you, but me, I'm a smoker.

301
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,660
Yeah, I know I shouldn't do it.

302
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,540
It's bad for my health, makes me smell, keeps me short of breath, etc., etc., and I keep meaning to quit.

303
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,500
But it does have one redeeming quality.

304
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,340
It gives me a little trademark, a greeting card, a, uh, I mean business card, if you will.

305
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,820
Something for me to give my clients so they remember me and all the excitement.

306
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,900
I like to take that cigarette, suck in a nice long, hard,

307
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,480
deep puff, get it nice and hot, and bury it in the subject's navel.

308
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,280
Oh, it'll hurt him.

309
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,420
Don't you think it won't?

310
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,420
That belly button is where life begun.

311
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,900
And there's a lot more than just sentimentality attached to it, trust me.

312
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,200
Now, after I've gotten their attention, I don't like to waste time with, you know, small talk.

313
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,220
Time is money, right?

314
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,860
That's one concept that conspiracy appreciates even when they're under the blade.

315
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,380
So I get right down to business.

316
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,980
I get me a bucket, and I get me some water.

317
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,940
Fill the bucket with the water and stick their head in it.

318
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,920
I hold them down.

319
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,120
I keep them down.

320
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,200
A little longer.

321
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,280
A little longer still.

322
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, they squirm.

323
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,800
They start to kick.

324
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,960
Watch out for those feet now.

325
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,440
They can buck you if you get in the way.

326
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,720
Make sure they're secured.

327
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,180
Up come the bubbles.

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,560
Keep them under a little longer.

329
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,360
And finally, lift them up by the scruff of the neck.

330
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,220
Now you got a subject you can work with.

331
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,580
He's cold, he's wet, and he's scared.

332
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,620
Now, he'll probably be the last one to admit it, but he's ready now for the pain of Bob.

333
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,920
Now, a lot of folks come up and stop me on the street.

334
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,060
And say, Father Jarmama, what do you recommend for the ultimate pain?

335
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,920
Hot poker?

336
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,040
Bowling water?

337
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,840
Dry ice?

338
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,020
Well, I tell them that stuff is fine and dandy, but let's face it.

339
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,900
We're not living in the dark ages anymore.

340
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,040
We've got electricity.

341
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,300
The power of power.

342
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,520
Now, don't start carping about energy crisis either.

343
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,160
Cost is not a factor here.

344
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,940
The best is none too good for these guys.

345
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
Which brings me to an important point.

346
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,920
Always keep a licensed physician on hand when you're using a doctor.

347
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm a physician friendly Mr. Kilowatt.

348
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,500
That's for three reasons.

349
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,640
First and foremost, your own protection.

350
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,540
That's right.

351
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,200
Electricity is dangerous.

352
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,740
Accidents can happen.

353
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,140
People can get hurt.

354
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,100
And when they do, no delays.

355
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,140
Your doctor's right there.

356
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,680
Secondly, preservation of your subject.

357
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,000
You don't want him to die.

358
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,240
If you wanted him dead, you'd just take him out and shoot him.

359
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,960
But what would that make us?

360
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,440
Executioners?

361
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,400
Are we executioners?

362
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,120
No, we're debt collectors.

363
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,820
We're just balancing the books.

364
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,460
And believe you me, we're not doing anything to these folks that they haven't done to someone else.

365
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,500
These are professionals you're working with.

366
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,560
They've seen it all.

367
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,440
They've done it all.

368
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,760
And if you want their respect, you've got to act like a professional.

369
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,540
You've got to be efficient.

370
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,660
Which brings us to reason three for having a doctor.

371
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,400
He'll show you just when to back off, how to keep your subject alive, and more importantly, how to keep him conscious.

372
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,140
Don't be afraid to use them for this.

373
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,360
That's their job.

374
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,700
That's what they're paid for.

375
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,540
That's what they went to seven years.

376
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,600
That's what they went to medical school for.

377
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,220
But now you're all set.

378
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,160
You've got everything you need.

379
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,960
You've got your doctor.

380
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,080
You've got your patient.

381
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,480
And you've got your electricity.

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,360
Now, I'm not going to insult your intelligence telling you how to use electricity.

383
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,380
Anyone could hook up a lamp cord to an outlet and let it rip.

384
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,620
And I'm sure you already know that the tender parts are best.

385
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,780
The underarms, the bottoms of the feet, the genitalia.

386
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,360
Why state the obvious, right?

387
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,900
If you need any guidance, just follow your heart.

388
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,600
And remember what Bob said.

389
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,800
When it comes to torture, it is not about the money.

390
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,500
It is more blessed to give than it is to receive.

391
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,920
Herein is the word of Bob.

392
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,740
Praise Bob.

393
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,580
Amen.

394
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,580
Oh, praise Bob and amen to you, Father Joe Mama.

395
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,880
A marvelous, wonderful, inspirational moment.

396
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,340
You know, I consider Father Joe Mama to be, right now, to be the top king of subgenius preachers.

397
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,920
I really do.

398
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,220
I've been most impressed with that young man.

399
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,420
He's a young graduate of the Dobstown School for Preachers.

400
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,440
Dear friends, what you've been hearing here, let's see my little list.

401
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,380
Background music, a lot of it's been the Swingin' Love Corpses.

402
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,900
Also, a lot of the new collage bits that you'll be hearing more of,

403
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,160
and you've heard some of, like the Sex and Violence collage there,

404
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,200
is by, well, it's a mystery tape from radio station WHRW in Birmingham, New York.

405
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,460
There was no name attached to the tape.

406
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:36,340
A long, elaborate log, which was very helpful, and no human name, or even church name.

407
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,720
So, you got me.

408
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,560
But I believe now is about time to get back to...

409
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
...a very old one.

410
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,120
What?

411
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,360
Three different rockets from the first of the Hades.

412
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
The Jones Rock and the New Beatles.

413
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,780
Three hot-headed aliens from the States down in the South.

414
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,300
Aww.

415
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,120
Of course.

416
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,980
A special unit.

417
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,400
The Predictions.

418
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,860
Dear friends, or no, we're not gonna do the Predictions.

419
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,980
As I said, we have to work our way up to them.

420
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,560
These are Predictions in the background.

421
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,520
And I don't like those Predictions in the background.

422
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,900
They're confusing me.

423
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,960
There we go.

424
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,840
Actually, we're gonna continue with the...

425
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,340
...the 1980s Decade Roundup.

426
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,440
And that was an impressive list of dead subgeniuses, now wasn't it?

427
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,680
But, as we said, there were a few good things that happened.

428
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,860
We lost all those people, but the federal deficit grew.

429
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,800
In 1980, it was only $40 billion.

430
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,120
Can you believe it?

431
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,560
It's like three times that now.

432
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,160
Look, I can see it over there in the corner, growing bigger and bigger.

433
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:58,700
Now, there was a big economic boom, you know, we must be fair, where at least the rich got richer.

434
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,240
But then, you know, somewhere in the late 80s, everything sort of came crashing down on everybody's heads.

435
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,380
And when Reagan left office, all but the very richest ended up poor again.

436
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:19,320
And we all are getting the bill for the last 20 years of free love, drugs, pollution, waste.

437
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,580
And big business deals.

438
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,020
And of course, we're gonna have to pay that up, dear friends, in safe sex.

439
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,980
Burned out brains, wrecked immune systems, and stock market crashes, layoffs.

440
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,560
Although, probably, we'll weasel out of most of that and our kids will end up paying it, see?

441
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,960
But we'll be dead, so they won't be able to get revenge on us.

442
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,180
And there were other things on the bright side, too, besides that.

443
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,300
But, like, little Jessica, you know.

444
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,300


445
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,920
And, um, McClure.

446
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,840
And those three whales got saved.

447
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,220
And Princess Charles married Lady Di.

448
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,340
And there wasn't a world war with thermonuclear weapons that destroyed the world.

449
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,060
And the Church of the Subgenius went public.

450
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,340
We must not forget that now.

451
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,740
In 1980, went public.

452
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:16,620
And most importantly of all, probably, the King of Norway came to the Texas State Fair and, praise Bob, he was saved by doctors.

453
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,100
For Bob.

454
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,820
And there were tremendous cultural, artistic, and scientific advances.

455
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,480
Moonwalking was invented.

456
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,960
The breakdance craze, the skateboard craze came along.

457
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,620
The bankruptcy craze.

458
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
The invention of Prince and Michael Jackson happened in the 80s.

459
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,120
Shirley MacLaine and Nancy Reagan helped invent the New Age at its very best.

460
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,340
Halley's Comet failed to expose the Antichrist.

461
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,300
Crystals were discovered to be useful for healing.

462
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,740
For thousands of pinks.

463
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,240
Rap was invented.

464
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,120
Now where would we be without rap?

465
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,540
MTV.

466
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,120
Video games.

467
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,440
Rubik's Cube.

468
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,220
The Garbage Pail Kids. That was one of my favorites.

469
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,680
Yuppies were invented.

470
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,860
Boy George.

471
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,780
The TV show Dallas.

472
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,620
Mondale.

473
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,860
Rambo.

474
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,740
Saturday Night Live.

475
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,640
Quail.

476
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,300
Vanessa's.

477
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,140
Williams and White.

478
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,740
We Begin the Bombing in Five Minutes.

479
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,240
Devo.

480
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,800

Spuds McKenzie.

484
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,420
Morton Downey.

485
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,300
Jimmy Swaggart.

486
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,080
Jim Baker.

Bhagwan Rajneesh.

489

Louis Farrakhan.

490
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,540
David Duke.

491
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,720
Jerry Falwell.

492
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040

493
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,280
Gold Chains.

494
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,040
More Pills.

495
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,320
False Slack.

496
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,240
The Strange and Terrible Saga, dear friends.

497
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,000
And here's a fast overview of the 80s.

498
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,160
The fastest overview that you'll ever get.

499
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,240
And when you're listening to this,

500
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,220
the patterns will become evident, finally,

501
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,780
as you listen,

502
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,120
and make the connections.

503
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,800
And at the end, dear friends,

504
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,520
it'll all make sense.

505
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,440
Believe it or not,

506
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,480
suddenly the curtains will fall

507
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,220
and the blinders will be stripped from your eyes.

508
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
And you'll realize that we didn't have to

509
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,700
dobbs up this little history of the 80s very much,

510
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,640
because it already sounded like a satire from hell.

511
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,860
So, in 1980,

512
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,220
Subgenius pamphlet number one was printed.

513
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,400
Castro started sending us 100,000 of his undesirables.

514
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,520
Rhodesia turned into Zimbabwe.

515
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,120
The rescue mission to save the Iran hostages fails,

516
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,780
even though Ali North is helping them.

517
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,820
Success might have meant re-election for Carter.

518
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,280
The Persian War started. Solidarity started in Poland.

519
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,220
Duarte becomes president of El Salvador in 30 years.

520
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,540
Thousands of people disappear.

521
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,960
The deal is nearing completion.

522
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,180
Bummer.

523
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,200
1981.

524
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,340
The minute Reagan becomes president,

525
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,540
Iran releases the hostages.

526
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,480
The deal is clinched.

527
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,900
The Gang of Four is deposed in China.

528
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,180
Israelis bomb an Iraqi nuclear power plant.

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,460

00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,820
Now Jader's going to balance seven foot miles on the tag

714
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,140
as he slides down that giant laser blade

715
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,760
into a tub of live fur.

716
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,680
Still, mind, have, least, still.

717
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,500
Have, I, mind, still, have.

718
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Mind, least, still, have.

719
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,520
What? What? What?

720
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,220
The least on my mind?

721
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,260
What's the meaning of the word meaning?

722
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,720
What's the meaning of the word word?

723
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,160
What's the meaning of the word the?

724
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,220
What do we mean by me?

725
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,420
What do I do?

726
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,460
My name is Suburban.

727
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,220
Pick the mimic, I'm the sock, the boondling lady.

728
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,240
Do the, I do, I do.

729
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,960
Yee-haw.

730
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,140
I was epistemizing.

731
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,760
I'm the puppy, drop to some toes.

732
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
The caller's really getting into the swing of things.

733
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,340
Call a condola.

734
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,820
Keep those donations flowing.

735
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,140
I swear, folks, to send all your money to Dr. Hell, care of this station,

736
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,740
and if you have any left over for Jane or Hypercretes, send it to me.

737
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,860
Here on the show.

738
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,900
And remember, there's still time to make fast prats to that snack bar.

739
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:04,180
There's ten minutes until showtime is over.

740
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,860
You are about to experience a fully subterraneous show.

741
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,760
Come on, give me a break, people.

742
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,660
So, sit back, relax, and enjoy our presentation.

743
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,360
Can I get some popcorn? Time to get a hot dog?

744
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,240
Time to stretch.

745
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,120
Go, man, go. Dig that thing.

746
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,360
Father time is limping toward the refreshment stand.

747
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,840
Only 45 minutes until showtime.

748
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,540
How about a soft drink?

749
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,380
All colors.

750
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,700
Hey, how about a hot tamale?

751
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,840
Hot corn.

752
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,040
Coffee?

753
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,260
Hear it all the time.

754
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,200
Pista, pizza, pizza, pizza.

755
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,900
Only 50 hours until showtime.

756
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,960
You couldn't get a better car than this, baby.

757
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,600
And it's going, it's getting further and further away.

758
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,420
Yeah, go, go, go.

759
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,840
Go, go, go.

760
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,260
Go, go, go.

761
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,220
Rock missing.

762
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,640
It is the number one.

763
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,240
Tool being used with the devil.

764
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,080
Rock music sets itself above God.

765
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,860
Now listen, we are programmable.

766
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
The devil knows how to program you.

767
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:29,280
The devil has programmed two generations of young people for absolute total destruction through his music.

768
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,320
Now, the devil wouldn't be the devil if he didn't have music.

769
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,240
The big sound.

770
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,180
The big sound.

771
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,620
You know what they said in Syracuse, New York, when they were going to have a concert?

772
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,100
The police chief said it's not the violence I worry about as much as the nudity.

773
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,180
Dancing.

774
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,260
Dancing.

775
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,400
Nudity.

776
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,480
Violence.

777
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,600
Dancing.

778
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,860
Dancing.

779
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:55,940
Nudity.

780
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,020
Violence.

781
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,440
Young people are killing themselves at a rapid rate.

782
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,820
I believe much of it has a result of rock music.

783
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,320
Our homes.

784
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Our homes have been torn down.

785
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,140
The walls of purity have been torn down.

786
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Morality in general has been put in the sewer because of rock music.

787
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,240
These gods.

788
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,520
That's supposed to get you all nervous and jerky.

789
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,120
Because it can make us feel relaxed.

790
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,200
It can make us feel scared.

791
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,700
Isn't that interesting?

792
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,300
You'll notice they don't play the Tennessee Waltz in a Halloween fling.

793
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:37,300


794
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,420
Now, would you agree with me that there's patriotic music?

795
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,760
Yes.

796
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,120
Would you agree with me there's funeral music?

797
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,360
Yes.

798
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,180
Would you agree with me that there's scary type music?

799
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Yes.

800
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,820
Would you agree that there's relaxing type music?

801
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,160
Yes.

802
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,780
Matter of fact, there is also boogie type music.

803
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
Boogity boogity boogity boogity boogity.

804
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,060
And now, here's Johnny!

805
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:06,260
Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.

806
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,080
Here is a bulletin.

807
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,220
Here is a bulletin.

808
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,400
What is it?

809
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,540
Stand by, please.

810
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,780
Stand by, please.

811
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,400
In Dallas, Texas.

812
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,180
It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route.

813
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,220
In the motorcade route.

814
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
It is me.

815
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,740
I'm me later.

816
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,420
Three shots were fired.

817
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:35,920
Three.

818
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Put me on, Bill.

819
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,660
Put me on.

820
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,100
Three.

821
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,100
Put me on, Bill.

822
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,780
Put me on.

823
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,240
Three.

824
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,020
President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.

825
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,780
Stand by, please.

826
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,960
Stand by, please.

827
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
More details just arrived.

828
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,780
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

829
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,860
She called, oh, no.

830
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,980
Oh, no.

831
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,940
The energy.

832
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,100
Oh, no.

833
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,100
The faith.

834
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,260
Oh, no.

835
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,060
The devotion.

836
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, no.

837
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,380
The motorcade sped on.

838
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,020
The world is very different now.

839
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,640
Something has happened here, we understand there is been a shooting.

840
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,020
Something has happened here, I can see many, many motorcycles.

841
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,480
I can see many, many motorcycles, this is Kennedy's pink suit.

842
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,940
Something has happened here, many, many motorcycles, this is Kennedy's pink suit.

843
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,900
Something has happened here.

844
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,860
Something is wrong here.

845
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Something is terribly wrong.

846
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,880
More details just around.

847
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,100
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

848
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,160
She called, oh, no.

849
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,300
Oh, no.

850
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,260
The energy.

851
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,400
Oh, no.

852
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,360
The faith.

853
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,540
Oh, no.

854
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,380
The devotion.

855
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,600
Oh, no.

856
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,700
The motorcade sped on.

857
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,220
It's, it's, it's the idea.

858
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,200
Flash.

859
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,800
Apparently official.

860
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,400
The flash.

861
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,100
Apparently official.

862
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:28,020
President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.

863
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,420
Time.

864
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,520
Time.

865
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,400
Time.

866
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:36,780
Time.

867
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,880
Time.

868
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,600
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.

869
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,840
There is a prisoner.

870
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,000
There is a prisoner.

871
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,860
Wearing a black sweater.

872
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,180
Do you have anything to say in your defense?

873
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,880
Oswald has a shot.

874
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,040
Oswald has a shot.

875
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,800
Jack Ruby.

876
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,060
Jack Ruby.

877
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,240
Jack Ruby.

878
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,240


879
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,580
Ruby.

880
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,660
He runs the carousel club.

881
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,780
Here is the ambulance.

882
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,480
More details just arrived.

883
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,680
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

884
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,740
She called, oh, no.

885
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,900
Oh, no.

886
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,820
The energy.

887
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, no.

888
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,940
The faith.

889
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,140
Oh, no.

890
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,940
The devotion.

891
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,220
Oh, no.

892
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,380
Oh, no.

893
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,300
The motorcade sped on.

894
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,680
More details just arrived.

895
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,900
Mrs. Kennedy jumped up.

896
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,960
She called, oh, no.

897
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,060
Oh, no.

898
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,020
The energy.

899
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,180
Oh, no.

900
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,160
The faith.

901
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,340
Oh, no.

902
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:39,980
Oh, no.

903
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:39,980


904
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:39,980


905
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,400
Oh, no.

906
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,120
Oh, no.

907
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,220
Oh, no.

908
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:42,800
Oh, no.

909
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,140
Oh, no.

910
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,160
Oh, no.

911
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,540
The motorcade sped on.

912
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,800
Thanks, Bill.

913
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,180
Oh, dear friends.

914
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,060
That was, I know you want to know who did that.

915
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:54,260
That was done by, according to the log that came with the mystery tape, from which I got

916
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,460
that.

917
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:00,440
It was done by, it's called The Motorcade Sped On by Steinsky and the Mass Media.

918
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,040
If you know anything about who Steinsky and the Mass Media is, please let me know.

919
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,040


920
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,040


921
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,040


922
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,040


923
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,500
I'm going to call the station here.

924
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,780
I'm going to speak to Will O'Dobbs itself.

925
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,360
Will himself.

926
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,860
I don't know why I say that.

927
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,940
Will is very definite.

928
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,300
Him.

929
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,560
Yeah.

930
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,300
I mean, go to Horn Inn on my territory.

931
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,700
There's a whole heap of bird dog-head stuff where I'll be taken away from you.

932
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,380
At 823-7490.

933
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,280
And it was, see, there was one.

934
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,200
You can hear it.

935
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,440
Oh, yeah.

936
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,020
He's a little bit off.

937
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


938
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


939
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


940
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


941
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


942
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


943
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


944
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


945
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,020


946
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,520
You can hear him there in the background.

947
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,680
And what a historical show.

948
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,460
We're going to pop back over here to Berkeley for a second for the KPFA.

949
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,620
More than an hour, less than a show.

950
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,480
Show puzzling evidence.

951
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,700
Dr. Hal Robbins and I believe special guest, Jane or I.

952
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,320
We shall never let our scalpels grow rusty except for the purposes of torture.

953
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,920
None of it's real.

954
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,420
Just remember, none of it is real.

955
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,840
There was a couple of sand.

956
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,720
There was behind us.

957
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,020
Is what I'm saying live or is this a tape?

958
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,900
What you're saying is live, but we're thinking of taking a rockin' away break.

959
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:17,960
Hmm.

960
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,000
But you don't rock it away, do you?

961
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,840
I don't what?

962
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,100
You don't rock it away, do you?

963
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,120
Well, if this is a tape, just turn me off.

964
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,160
That'll be $44.67.

965
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,560
Thank you.

966
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,160
Come again.

967
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Part two of Show Puzzling.

968
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


969
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


970
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


971
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


972
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


973
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,000


974
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,280
Show.

975
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,200
You have now reached part two of your hour of slack show tape.

976
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,740
You may now continue.

977
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,580
Proof.

978
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,040
Proof that the brain is nothing more than an alien parasite that infests the human body

979
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,300
shortly before birth.

980
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,420
No, it is not the brain.

981
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,200
Rather, it is the pipe.

982
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,980
Pipe the pipe.

983
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,460
Pipe the pipe.

984
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,080
Pipe the pipe.

985
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,000
Pipe the pipe.

986
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,340
Pipe the pipe.

987
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,900
Pipe the pipe.

988
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,300
Come at you, crack.

989
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,960
Crack into the crack.

990
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:12,780
Crack into the crack.

991
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,720
It's easy for you to say.

992
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,060
Now, when you meet Bob Dobbs on the highway, will you really kill him?

993
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,980
Will you have it in your heart to walk up to that man, Bob?

994
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,300
That man who hates you so much?

995
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,800
That man you love to hate so much.

996
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,720
Walk up to Bob and just...

997
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,320
End it all?

998
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,660
I didn't do it.

999
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,600
Would you really do it?

1000
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,800
I had to stop and pick him up off the side of the road and give him a ride wherever he wanted to go.

1001
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,520
I was compelled to do so.

1002
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,700
I'm sorry.

1003
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,440
We're killing my engine!

1004
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,180
We're killing it!

1005
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,020
I pushed the pedal down but my engine wouldn't run.

1006
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,240
The gas wasn't going to it.

1007
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:00,080
Man, you know that's why we were born with organic baseball bats?

1008
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,360
For it's time to bash Bob over the back of his head with it.

1009
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,460
You know that's why women are weaker than men.

1010
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,760
Hey!

1011
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,120
You're waiting on the pie.

1012
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,880
Come on, you can do it.

1013
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,780
You hate the pie.

1014
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,700
I was too weak to kill him.

1015
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,880
I fell under his spell.

1016
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,060
I understand what you're going through.

1017
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,160
What is this?

1018
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,560
I'm creating a social!

1019
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,200
Let's kill these wimps!

1020
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,480
Kill them wimps!

1021
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,420
Looks like we don't need steak.

1022
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,480
Man, I'm going to chop these wimps into bits and pieces.

1023
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,700
They don't stop sticking or something.

1024
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,220
...fingernails into my head.

1025
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,180
...in the middle of an end of earth.

1026
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,760
...the world's going to be...

1027
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:59,160
Oh, friends, that, uh, the lead hate-ranter there was, uh, at that fantasy fair revival was known as Nirvana Day.

1028
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,840
We're wondering about...

1029
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,060
Friends, we're out of here.

1030
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,500
We're taking my probe, but we're in danger of losing the entire...

1031
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,240
That was the other thing I wanted to say.

1032
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,300
...manager of the church.

1033
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,500
Ah, yeah, I don't care. As long as I get more of these...

1034
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,380
We cannot run this ministry on love alone, children.

1035
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,220
Give Wellman more show.

1036
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
We could, but...

1037
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,560
Keep him going.

1038
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,720
...don't bring me down after reach down in your pocketbook's deep...

1039
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,360
Maybe if we just sold everything we owned, we could stay on the air another day.

1040
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,380
Those native girls are doing their wicky-wacky, ruck-eaty dance.

1041
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,680
Wow, the Hubba Bubba Show or anything like that.

1042
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,820
Wow, take a look at them.

1043
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,620
You don't have to tell me that three times.

1044
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,300
Look at them, you know, those are...

1045
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,980
Look at them, look at them, look at them.

1046
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,380
They say every gesture, every movement has a meaning of its own, and you can believe that.

1047
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,860
Watchin' these whacked-out wackinies and...

1048
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,240
My God, now they're...

1049
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,520
My eyes have been glued to that one in the middle.

1050
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,140
If I could only pull them off, that would be super glue or something.

1051
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,220
Mama, by me death.

1052
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,880
Not you, Bozo.

1053
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,800
I was talkin' to the lady.

1054
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,800
You're tellin' me. My eyes have been nailed to that one on the...

1055
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,280
...end for the past 30 minutes.

1056
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,700
Oh, your eyes are as big as your stomach's a heap.

1057
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,460
You'll need a 30-pound claw hammer to get those incredibly painted out of there.

1058
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,040
...unrestorated population made your eyes.

1059
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,500
In our country, it is considered...

1060
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,960
I'm no doctor, but I think you're gonna need a chainsaw to get your eyes back.

1061
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,240
Hey, you don't need a chainsaw to tell which way the wind blows. See?

1062
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,640
Hey, listen, I'm not in medicine. Maybe I could be a staple instead.

1063
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,800
You're gonna need something to...

1064
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:26,120
You're telling me my eyes have been stapled to that one on the far right for the past five light years.

1065
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,300
...need to be needed.

1066
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,100
Hey, I'm no MD, but you're gonna need a staple puller to leave this dance hall.

1067
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,240
Yeah, you'll need to have that staple taken out of your navel. What do you think you are?

1068
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,560
You're no MD, you're a dear.

1069
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,760
Well, let's use this odd-

1070
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,700
These days, everyone hears voices.

1071
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,560
Oh, God, he's lost it.

1072
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,360
Most of the punk rock's made on independent labels, right?

1073
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:54,860
Okay, now, if you take the album out, and you look past the last song on a given side...

1074
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:00,640
...in between the last song and the actual paper label on independent record companies...

1075
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,480
...you've got to engineer a little stencil, a little message...

1076
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,700
...from anything from Happy New Year to Your Brain is Wasted.

1077
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,100
For some people, these voices don't even come from the outside.

1078
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,880
They come directly out of their knees or the metal plates in their heads.

1079
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,860
Five o'clock Sunday afternoon, and I'm stuck in a traffic jam that stretches 150 miles from here.

1080
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,340
Now, let's get in one more call.

1081
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,300
We talk, we read, we listen to Mozart sometimes.

1082
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,340
Right now, I am coming in through your ears, which filter what I am saying up into your brain.

1083
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,500
You know what I hate?

1084
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,100
Say hate to what I'm saying.

1085
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:53,320
I hate it when you say it.

1086
00:49:53,340 --> 00:50:00,140
I hate it when I'm playing with my fishing kit, and I get the fish hooks caught in my urethra.

1087
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,440
That's the brain that's your approach.

1088
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,220
So I take a pipe, and I shove it in there to make it bleed more.

1089
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,280
Then I twist it, and I squirm it.

1090
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,160
Then I take the pipe and put it in my mouth and suck out the frog.

1091
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,600
And then I have to give a big shout.

1092
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,820
And then I have to give a big shout.

1093
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,960
And then I have to give a big shout.

1094
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,160
So I have to give a big shout.

1095
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,220
Then I take a pipe and call it slimy worms!

1096
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,700
And they crawl into my brain, and I see a pipe in front of my face again.

1097
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,560
And I eat it!

1098
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,760
And then I turn into a worm!

1099
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,160
And then somebody shoves a fish hook in my urethra.

1100
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,760
Praise Nirvana Dave, dear friends.

1101
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,480
I hate that too, man.

1102
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:53,600
Well, see? Something happens. All you gotta do is bring Bob and just drag Bob into it.

1103
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:01,940
The problem is the moon is in third conjunction with the fourth dysfunction of Mercury's opposite on the other side of the moon that we can't see.

1104
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,300
He's not supposed to know that.

1105
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:15,060
In fact, it's through the slack field Bob's pipe conjunctively blows outward instead of sucking in.

1106
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,400
You're all in Bob's pipe. Every damn one of you is sitting in Bob's pipe right this minute.

1107
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,840
Can't see the edges of the bowl right now. Can you?

1108
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,280
If you could just see, if you could see, you'd see the edges of the bowl.

1109
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,060
You'd see the bowl of Bob's pipe surrounding you.

1110
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:43,740
You'd see the flames coming down, licking at your brain so he can inhale your brain.

1111
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,960
And you'd see that you were floating in an ocean of ice cold pills.

1112
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,880
But, oh, too blind. So many are so blind.

1113
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:03,000
Well, it seems that Troop S. Cecilia has her own schismatic clench bowing down before her.

1114
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,940
The iron clench, they call it.

1115
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,700
That's right, kids. Reminding you that the father of the gods is fair and we shall all vanish without a trace.

1116
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,340
I will!

1117
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,720
In our stingy, merry, softened stroomings of hair,

1118
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,540
part in them and soothe in horror and mingliness,

1119
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:31,460
that was deep, dark, and ample like this green, white, blue.

1120
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,780
I visited

1121
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,540
The idée Patronin

1122
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:58,540


1123
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:58,740
If I did not know, what would you have learn?

1124
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,800
And I said,

1125
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,300
Forget it, I will not.

1126
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:09,060
to give you the beginnings of the predictions series for the 1990s. And this time it's going

1127
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:15,160
to take the form of investment advice from J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, channeled through

1128
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,240
me, your host, Reverend Ivan Stank. Friends, those of you with money to burn, and if you

1129
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:29,600
want to make money with money in the coming tribulation times, here are some growth industries

1130
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:35,860
that are foolproof investments. These are industries that are going to pay you back

1131
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:43,800
a hundredfold on your investments, dear friends. Number one, ice. Ice. You know, smokable methamphetamines.

1132
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,800
You can definitely look for this industry to grow. Crack will be passe. Ice addicts

1133
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,620
will make fun of people who are still nothing but wimpy old crack addicts. Number two growth

1134
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,020
industry, drug rehabilitation.

1135
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,300
Drug rehabilitation, especially of the religious variety, and in fact, number three investment

1136
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,800
opportunity is religious cults in general. However, that ties for the number three place

1137
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,740
best investment with lowbrow comedy oriented entertainment companies. If you can combine

1138
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,580
the two, dear friends, you're going to be doing great. Number four investment opportunity,

1139
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,760
medicine. Both conspiracy type medicine, like cancer treatment, for instance, like pain

1140
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:34,060
painkillers, new painkillers, and also quackery, new age vitamin and nostrum sort of scams.

1141
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,720
Number five, self-defense courses and security technologies and companies, especially electronic

1142
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:48,360
security, locks, bars on the door. Number six, survivalist industries, training, supplies,

1143
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:54,200
and arms. Number seven, illegal abortions. Number eight, home video and computer entertainment

1144
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:01,780
systems, which require people to not leave the home. Number nine, law. Any kind of legal

1145
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:07,760
services at all will be a big growth industry. Number ten, employment services, such as job

1146
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:14,360
finders, and related to that, number eleven, family-sized cheap tents. Cheap tents, the

1147
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,440
cheapest housing, but big ones, family-sized, old families living for the rest of their

1148
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,180
lives in a good, well-made American tent. Number twelve, cheap bookshelves.

1149
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:30,860
Riddle fiberglass broomsticks. This relates to a teenage fad that if you want to look

1150
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,720
in your prescriptures in the Dateline for Dominance predictions in Book of the Subgenius,

1151
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,720
which by the way has many more predictions than we're reading here tonight, and other

1152
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,180
ones. These are unpublished ones. Number twelve, growth industry, water purifiers. Number thirteen,

1153
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:51,820
air purifiers. Number fourteen, food sterilizers. Number seventeen, ozone replenishment devices.

1154
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,100
Number fifteen, plastic surgery.

1155
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:59,960
Number sixteen, high-tech police supply and surveillance device manufacturers. There's

1156
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,120
going to be a lot of demand for that. Number eighteen, real estate in the far north and

1157
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:12,240
arctic in preparation for the greenhouse effect, dear friends. And I think that was a beautiful

1158
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,200
Swingin' Love Corps song hidden in the background under the rant. You'll just have to take my

1159
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:24,180
word for it that it was fantastic and wonderful. And as we wait for the upcoming show, which

1160
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:31,780
here in Dallas is the collector's showcase, but in other cities is insert show title here,

1161
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:40,860
which is a great, great show. We just love it here in Texas. And so somebody was cutting

1162
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:47,200
a phylo in the background. But we're going to hear phylo sing just to lift you out of

1163
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:53,820
this. I know it's been interesting, this historic overview of the last ten years. And

1164
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,380
I think there's a lot of good hints for investment opportunities in the future in the nineties,

1165
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,520
at least up until 1998. Of course, your best investment, dear friends, is always going

1166
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,520
to be a church of the subgenius membership card. And you can get information because,

1167
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:14,560
you know, otherwise what's the rest of it worth? What is, really ask yourself, what's

1168
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,780
the rest of it worth unless you have that membership card and gigantic package which

1169
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,160
allows you to board the flying saucers of planes and air carriers. Another interesting thing,

1170
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:31,080
pleasure when the men from Planet X come to take we subgeniuses away to some better world at the

1171
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:37,880
end of the 90s. More on that later. And you can find out about those things by writing this post

1172
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:42,600
office box I'm about to give. That's right. You can write to Bob, ask for free information from

1173
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:55,920
Bob, Pox 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214. Once again, for those of you on drugs, that's an old joke.

1174
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:12,420
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214. And here's the swing and love courses with

1175
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:12,580
their great friends, Bob and Bob.

1176
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,820
Great new old hit, Pick a Booger. Thank you.

1177
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,260
Thank you.

1178
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,400
Thank you.

1179
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,180
Thank you.

1180
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,300
Thank you.

1181
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,660
Thank you.
