1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,220
Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,760
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

3
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,560
All quarantined, all strapped in my suit.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,140
Pressure suit's all pressured up.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,220
Yeah.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,360
It's here.

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,600
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,500
Waiting for the moment, the final countdown.

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,100
And that's where we're at.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,040
Just hours away from the final hour.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
The final minute.

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,100
The final second.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
X-Day.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,120
Thought I'd never get here.

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,240
It's kind of late now.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
We're there.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,880
There's nothing else to do.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Just sit, look out the window.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,920
And...

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
We wait for the lights.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,380
X-Day GORDON THEогh

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,760
Is your pleasure-ship hovering above, waiting for the final hours to pass?

25
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,860
Tomorrow Tribes

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:55,860

goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia blue.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:20,460
My names. We'll see you. Goodbye mom. Goodbye dad. I gotta go into space.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,540
One two. Hey bleepo. Yeah.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:39,680
Um, Chaz and I have been planning our, which reruns we're gonna, we're gonna run as since there's only another like week of broadcasting left on the planet.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,400
Oh God.

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah, I've done 638 hours of slaps.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,340
Down to a few hours now.

35
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,340
And we're gonna start rerunning number one. I mean, for what radio station?

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,220
Right.

37
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:01,700
And what were you planning, thinking of doing Chaz? Are you just gonna run reruns or like what's your first show after the, after you leave?

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,460
Well I was, I, I.

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,260
Or is there, are you just gonna blow it off?

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,340
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was under some understanding that they were gonna install some black, black box, black box, black box in the studio here.

41
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,980
I don't know what the technology of this really is. You know, like I say,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,440
You can ask me too, Stan.

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:29,220
I don't understand how a lot of this is gonna, you know, take place. I don't understand how a lot of this happens. I just know that it won't fail because of me.

44
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,900
The vehicle lift weighs, uh, close to six and a half million pounds.

45
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:45,880
We all are in this together as a team effort. We're gonna make it work. And I don't know how to make it work. I don't know how to do most of this mission.

46
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,360
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.

47
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,080
And it won't fail because of me.

48
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,580
Hello, world.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,440
Hello, world.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,760
Chaz here.

51
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,980
ESO Radio, broadcasting live from the pleasure ships.

52
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,020
Oh, yeah.

53
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,420
Where you gonna go?

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,280
Where you gonna go?

55
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,160
When the sex goddesses come for you.

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,540
Gonna go to the place that's the best.

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,820
When I lay me down to die.

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,320
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,640
Going up to the spirit in the sky.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,540
It's where I'm gonna go when I die.

61
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,260
When I die and they lay me to rest.

62
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,740
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:02,300
And it's so beautiful from out here. It's so pretty. The earth. It's just that little blue and white and little marble hanging there.

64
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,160
Gosh. That's where it all began.

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,720
We'll see ya. Goodbye.

66
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,320
Prepare yourself. You know it's a must.

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,300
Gonna have a friend in Jesus.

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,360
Friend in Bob.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
So you know that when you die.

70
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,880
Bob will recommend you to the spirit in the sky.

71
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,940
Swamp Radio.

72
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,080
Be so very lonely.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,740
Your 2008 tears will fall.

74
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,560
Failure is not an option.

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm so happy.

76
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,280
Happily as I've been going further and further back.

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,760
Backwards.

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,020
In my career.

79
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,580
As I get better at what I do.

80
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,740
Well at least you got better and were able to get as far as major market broadcast radio.

81
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,060
Bleepo. There are those of us that.

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,140
I would say major disappointment might be the word used.

83
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,540
But he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,600
I mean I don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation or.

85
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,980
There was major disappointment and there was General Electric.

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,660
Oh there. I thought you were gonna refer to the guy's erection again.

87
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,820
And then there was Admiral Bob.

88
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,220
Oh Bob.

89
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,600
Just like a penguin in bondage boing.

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:30,380
You know on X Day, Neegie will return to us all the greatest tapes that we ever recorded.

91
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,800
Praise the Neegie.

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,980
Which he has been keeping.

93
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,680
Praise the Neegie.

94
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,900
Oh God that's so good.

95
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,140
Neegie has been keeping all of our lost recordings in a special vault.

96
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,640
You hear that?

97
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,620
Will all be returned to us on X Day.

98
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,980
Oh that's so glorious.

99
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,660
Janer will get his 8mm films back.

100
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,420
Oh.

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,420
You know your first show will come back.

102
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,780
Actually I never did lose anything.

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,880
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,860
As long as you saw them Bill.

105
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,460
Things that were mailed to you.

106
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,140
You know that you never got around to looking at.

107
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,700
Uh huh.

108
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,260
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second.

109
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:13,980
What about events that I next taped that never were taped?

110
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,860
There's a thing called the.

111
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,340
The new program.

112
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,920
The thought that you imagine very vividly doing.

113
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,180
This is too damn confusing.

114
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,640
I'm getting out of here.

115
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,460
Will then be done.

116
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,480
They will have been done.

117
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,480
When you want to do a wonderful new show.

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,000
That show will materialize in your hand as it takes.

119
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:28,660
Yeah the new program.

120
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,320
We.

121
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,760
Have.

122
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,980
Escaped.

123
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,520
From.

124
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,120
Your.

125
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:37,960
Pants.

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,580
The hell.

127
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:40,920
Escaping.

128
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,320
From.

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,660
My.

130
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,040
Deep.

131
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,240
My.

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,260
Head.

133
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,840
In.

134
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


136
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


137
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


139
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:45,840


140
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,340
The.

141
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,340


142
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,600
Are.

143
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,540
Gripping.

144
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:47,980
But.

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,720
They're.

146
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,440
Slipping.

147
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,060
And.

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,640
They're.

149
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Clipping.

150
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Cause.

151
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm.

152
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:52,980
Dripping.

153
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,740
Well.

154
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,620
That's.

155
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:55,820
That's.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,200
That's.

157
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,520
The.

158
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,220
Yanagi.

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Is.

160
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,400
Related to the.

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,960
Oshitashi.

162
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,700
Which you often get.

163
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,320
You know.

164
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,440
When served with the wasabi.

165
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,420
Yeah.

166
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,720
And.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,060
And.

168
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,420
It's.

169
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,900
It's in conjunction with the uni.

170
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,760
And the yanagi.

171
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,600
And the hiroshi.

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,100
And the inaka.

173
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,340
And the wasabi.

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,100
And the wasabi.

175
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,300
Yeah.

176
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,820
And the wasabi.

177
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,460
All these things.

178
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,800
You combine them.

179
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,660
These things become combined.

180
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,500
For the normals they become combined in sort of a slurry shop.

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,940
We subgeniuses luckily will get the fresh human soul sushi as it were.

182
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah.

183
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,780
On demand.

184
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,580
On demand.

185
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,900
Sushi on demand.

186
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,440
24 hours a day.

187
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,440
Even in Cleveland.

188
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
TOmana

189
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,400
The most popular sushi sushi market here in Minnesota.

190
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,400


191
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:04,400


192
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:15,360
And I'm riding alone by my own in a land of sand and stone.

193
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,260
I'm living in Arizona.

194
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,220
I'm living in Arizona.

195
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm living in Arizona.

196
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,520
I'm living in Arizona.

197
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,740
I'm living in Arizona.

198
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:12,740


199
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:12,740


200
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,940
I work with my hands in a land born free.

201
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Living in a white house in Canyon Deshaye.

202
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,720
And what I take, I give to living in me.

203
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,860
Oh, when it's scissors-toothed, I'm a man of my word.

204
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:30,860


205
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,700
And when it's rivers, it's through your eyes, you see that?

206
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,840
No, Jack's right?

207
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,860
And you'll see your state of mind will sow its seed.

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,040
And what what what what what what what.

209
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah.

210
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,620
I'm a man.

211
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
I work with my hands.

212
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,580
I work with my hands.

213
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,740
Living in castles made by the sand.

214
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,260
And I'm riding alone.

215
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,180
Out on my own.

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,680
In a land of sand and stone

217
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm living in Arizona

218
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm living in Arizona

219
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm living in Arizona

220
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm living in Arizona

221
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm living in Arizona

222
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,880
. . .

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000


224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000


225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,640
. . .

226
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:51,100
. . .

227
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,920
. . .

228
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,960
. . .

229
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,100
. .

230
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,600
. .

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:10,860
. .

232
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,320
. .

233
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,960
.

234
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,140
.

235
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,820
.

236
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,920
.

237
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,640
I'm living in Arizona

238
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,020
I'm living in Arizona

239
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:30,860
. . .

240
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm living in Arizona

241
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,960
I'm living in Arizona

242
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,260
Come on, Mom.

243
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,760
Come on, Dad.

244
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,140
Dad, I got to go into space, Mom.

245
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,760
I got to go into food again.

246
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,280
I got to go into space.

247
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,280
Come on, Mom.

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,880
I'm never coming home.

249
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,880
I'm never coming home.

250
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
We're going to give you one more little song.

251
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,700
Hey, this year at Starwood,

252
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,800
we are Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

253
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,480
and we'll be playing in the Puffer Dome

254
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,440
from midnight to 3 in the morning tonight.

255
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,540
On Friday night at Starwood this year, yeah.

256
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,960
Friday night.

257
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,880
We'll be puffing it all night in the Domo.

258
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,620
In. Beamed in.

259
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:30,860
Beamed in.

260
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,020
And from the pleasure ships.

261
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,260
Holographic images only, please.

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,440
A lyric little song.

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,180
Perhaps maybe a child's nursery rhyme.

264
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,340
Perhaps a little didgeridoo song from an aboriginal.

265
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,920
A little song that a child would sing with me.

266
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,100
Swing his eucalyptus leaves on his head.

267
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,960
And make a crown of thorns for himself

268
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,580
to become the aboriginal messiah.

269
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,940
And save the red rocks from these and that

270
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,860
and this.

271
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,900
And those cars going by.

272
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,340
And that toxic polluted swamp over there.

273
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,280
And those red glowing rocks over there.

274
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,100
And that meteor falling through there.

275
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,480
We can't even comprehend what might have been.

276
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,640
We can't even think about where we might have gone.

277
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,920
It all takes too long.

278
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,440
Just keep your eye on the red rock.

279
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,920
Just keep walking by the river.

280
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh, that's so pretty.

281
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,940
It made everyone weep.

283
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,240
In the moon.

284
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,820
Meet them sleeping inside.

285
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm touched.

286
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,900
You've been touched so many times you're as soiled as a bad pair of underwear at the bus

287
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,300
station.

288
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,040
Please don't touch me again.

289
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,320
I'll try not to.

290
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,600
They make me say things.

291
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,360
They make me do things.

292
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,280
Hit me.

293
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,840
Hit me.

294
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,720
They make me wear the moon pants.

295
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,040
They didn't make you do any of that, man.

296
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,860
Ah, but the moon billies wear the shaggiest moon pants you've ever seen.

297
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


298
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


299
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


300
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


301
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


302
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


303
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


304
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


305
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


306
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


307
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


308
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:00,860


309
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,500
They're made for the mean men and they're packed with all kinds of strange ideas.

310
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,300
I'm afraid those shaggy things aren't pants, Dave.

311
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,200
Those are moon dogs.

312
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,800
I thought they were the bad ideas sheeping out of their legs.

313
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,600
The bad.

314
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,340
What are we going to do about all the bad ideas?

315
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,980
We can rebuild him.

316
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,820
We have the technology.

317
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,200
One pill makes you larger.

318
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,840
And one pill makes you stronger.

319
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:30,840


320
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,660
The world ends Sunday week.

321
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,440
I like the way that sounds.

322
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:36,940
A big deal.

323
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,920
World ends Sunday week.

324
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,480
End of week.

325
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,380
If we make it we can all suck up to the sound of love.

326
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,480
For more enjoyment and greater efficiency, consumption is being standardized.

327
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:00,560
Okay, I'm going to look for ways to express concretely love to passion.

328
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:00,820
Love to passion.

329
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,340
Passion.

330
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
You're kind of like the frog and the prince guy.

331
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,400
That you've got this super being inside of you which is imprisoned in this evil flesh.

332
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,600
And you keep struggling with this evil flesh so you can become a god.

333
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,800
But most people don't and they become like kind of petty devils that go from one low

334
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,140
comedy to another with the rats dangling out of their pants.

335
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,760
It's a stinky word because there's no law and order anymore.

336
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,100
It's a stinky word because it lets the young get onto the old.

337
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,460
Oh, thank you God.

338
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, it's no order for an old man any longer.

339
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,540
I think it's the only church I know of where a preacher willingly exploits himself for his own...

340
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,040
I'm doing it for Bob.

341
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,260
For Bob's...

342
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,040
Well, yeah.

343
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,540
We can clear this up really.

344
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,340
It's no different from any other religion in that respect.

345
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,340
We'll cheat anybody.

346
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,500
We can clear this up.

347
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,340
The whole thing is a gigantic...

348
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,460
It's one of the greatest, most gigantic cheats that humanity has ever conceived of.

349
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,140
Praise Bob.

350
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,760
Praise Bob.

351
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:01,940


352
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,020
Oh, Princess Wee, did you do your tale and song?

353
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,640
Oh, no.

354
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, we can play it in three different keys and do it real fast.

355
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,580
Let's do it.

356
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:11,580


357
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:11,580


358
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,300
We'll do it right now.

359
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,220
Because it's getting late.

360
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,580
Is it going to be in a key?

361
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,520
The show ends in half an hour forever and ever.

362
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,220
Yeah.

363
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,800
But unfortunately, as you said, it goes on and on and on forever and ever.

364
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,060
On.

365
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,280
And once again, we must remember to keep our focus as we project out there.

366
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,440
After the ball.

367
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


368
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


369
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


370
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


371
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


372
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


373
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


374
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


375
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,440


376
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,580
And once again, we must remember to keep our focus as we project out there.

377
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,560
I don't know exactly if you'd call it the there.

378
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:31,720
We got it.

379
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,080
It exists simultaneously in so many different places.

380
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Have you hit Tim?

381
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,640
Yeah.

382
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,040
No, that's the rectal thermometer.

383
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,880
Put that thing down.

384
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,260
Yeah, I need to sing.

385
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,600
Okay.

386
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,700
This is the last one.

387
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,780
Listen to this bleep-up.

388
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
Okay, now I made sure I was not in tune.

389
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,040
Beatles songs out the window, huh?

390
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,800
I got a little preview of this earlier.

391
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,340
Oh.

392
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,740
There, we'll start over.

393
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,100
Okay, you better start again because we have to...

394
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,480
Back it up, man.

395
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,900
Back it up.

396
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,020
Back it up.

397
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,520
We have to sing.

398
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:57,960
Back it up.

399
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,000
Back it up.

400
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,280
Back it up.

401
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,260
Back it up.

402
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,680
Beatles songs out the window, bleep-up.

403
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,300
I heard it.

404
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,400
All right, here we go.

405
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,660
There was the pop record.

406
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,600
Shut up.

407
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,240
Shut up.

408
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,520
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

409
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:21,200
Picture yourself afloat in the cosmos in a pleasure ship vessel of your own design.

410
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,260
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly because you're not in tune.

411
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,260


412
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,260


413
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,180
You're so incredibly high.

414
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:45,300
Smell of dangerous officers appear on the shore waiting to take us the next day.

415
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,560
Climb on the deck with our heads in the clouds and we're gone.

416
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,280
Looney's will not die with Simon.

417
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,800
They won't be able to make it.

418
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,260
Their hands are shaking.

419
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,080
Looney's will not die with Simon

420
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,220
Looney's will not die with Simon

421
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,640
Picture yourself in your own private garden

422
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
With lobstery trees and fresh figgy pies

423
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,280
I didn't like the figgy, I thought it was a frog

424
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,540
Nobody calls you to answer but dronely

425
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,160
The girl with calliope signs

426
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,920
More pleasure saucers appear on the shore

427
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,580
Waiting to take us on an extra

428
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,560
Climb on the deck without a deck

429
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,800
And we're gone

430
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,020
Looney's will not die with Simon

431
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,220
Looney's will not die with Simon

432
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,360
Looney's will not die with Simon

433
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,020
Why?

434
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,360
Ah

435
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,080
Picture yourself all asleep in a fountain

436
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,980
Where chaco tyrannosaurus' leave kisses behind

437
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Suddenly someone comes by and awaits you

438
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,740
And if all the children fall asleep

439
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:36,760
Then these neighbours about to catch the man

440
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:36,760


441
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:36,760


442
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,260
Looney's will not die with Simon

443
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:54,960
He'll dream of happily ever after

444
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,520
Looney's will not die with Simon

445
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,260
You just have to figure out for yourself.

446
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,580
Everyone gets the time they deserve.

447
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:43,420
And everyone gets that destiny they choose.

448
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,680
I know you ordained for genius, and you know exactly what that means.

449
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,360
I know exactly what that means.

450
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:04,080
But for those of you who are somehow yet unsaved, there are nine more holy and complete days where the post office will be open.

451
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:13,340
And if you don't know what to do, call one, nine, six, nine, and ask.

452
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,960
Operators are standing by.

453
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,320
But we, we, that's me, are not standing by.

454
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,240
Bye.

455
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:30,020
We is ready, and we will greet you as you board the pleasure ship.

456
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:46,320
With both horn lights flashing brightly, we even will place the lei around your neck, kiss you on the cheek, and send you on your merry way into the escape vessel.

457
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,600
But for now, we out.

458
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,940
We out.

459
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
P.S.O.

460
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:53,700
We out.

461
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,080
We out.

462
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,540
We out.

463
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,440
We out.

464
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,280
We out.

465
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,500
We out.

466
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,500


467
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,500


468
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,420
And you get your own free Wee-Bell.

469
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,560
We out.

470
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,620
Oh, wow.

471
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:02,940
Oh, wow.

472
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,160
Isn't that weird?

473
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,360
No.

474
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,400
That's not the Wee-Bell.

475
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,860
The Wee-Bell is a wee-bell, honey.

476
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,660
She means wee-bell because, not because...

477
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:12,980
Oh, man.

478
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,400
So, I always wait because she says, wee-bell.

479
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,820
Right there.

480
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,060
Oh, man.

481
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
She always says wee-bell.

482
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Oh, wee.

483
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,400
Simple, simple.

484
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,340
El did, oh, al did, al did, we...

485
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,340


486
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,340


487
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,340


488
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
There are hands sticking out of the walls.

489
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,540
When the bush came, we had to hide and think about when Bob would come and liberate us.

490
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,360
And put us in little tiny pleasure ships about the size of this pack of girl right here.

491
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,860
You see, we had to shrink because our heads were so big from staying in the basement.

492
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,700
But he did compress us.

493
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,980
Yes.

494
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,560
Well, I can't wait till the subgenius exhibit opens in the new Disney world.

495
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,320
You know, now, don't start counting your chickens before the hatch, Bleepo.

496
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,800
Well, they promised me a job 50 years ago before I was born.

497
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
Well, me too. Me too. Most of us.

498
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:18,640
But St. Palmer Vredes speculated that, you know, what if on X Day, the exes, you know, the sex goddesses from Planet X arrive?

499
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
In saucers.

500
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,920
Saucers.

501
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,980
The size of little tiny shirt butts.

502
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,780
And they fly around hovering like gnats in front of our faces going, well, get on board. Get on board.

503
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,300
And then what do we do?

504
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,540
And then they, you know, get tired of waiting and they fly away and fly away and fly away.

505
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,560
Do not abandon your post. There is no danger of radiation leakage.

506
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,880
Why is it so hard to get out of here?

507
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,800
Why is everything all right down here?

508
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,520
Why are you waiting?

509
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,140
We will pull you to sleep.

510
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:01,080
That accident over in Red Sector L destroyed another 63 personnel, giving them a total of 242 lost to our 195.

511
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,820
Keep up the good work and prevent accidents.

512
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:15,100
John and Yoko, Jimmy, Leary, Rosemary, Tommy Smothers, Bobby, Dylan, Tommy, Cooper, Derek, Taylor, Norman, Mailer, Allen, Ginsberg, Hara, Krishna, Hara, Hara, Hara, Krishna.

513
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,900
All we are saying.

514
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,360
Is give me some time.

515
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,980
Now sing it for the Senate.

516
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,660
Oh, God.

517
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,520
All we are saying.

518
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,540
Is give me some time.

519
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:47,180
Personally, I like to think of myself as the most sweetness and light new age, love oriented subgenius.

520
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,540
And I know that the 33,000.

521
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,780
Saucers of Planet X will line up from North Pole to South Pole across this globe.

522
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,940
Let the world turn under it.

523
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,280
And loonies will not die.

524
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,220
For Simon with Simon.

525
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,320
They will have nothing to do with Simon.

526
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:14,080
Loonies will fly, arise up, up, up above the atmosphere.

527
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,220
Far, far as they depressurize, their heads will swell.

528
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,540
Even the poor and the weak.

529
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,260
Even the innocent loonies who don't know of Bob.

530
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:30,680
Like balloons, they will swell as they depressurize, floating ever higher up out into the stratosphere,

531
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,980
the Oana sphere, the DNA-o-sphere, the Devo sphere.

532
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:44,540
And finally, the most furthest out from the solar system, surrounding like a great bubble

533
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,120
the solar system, the We-o-sphere.

534
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,440
And it's really weird.

535
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:49,520
It's really weird.

536
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:49,520


537
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,700
It's really weird out there.

538
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,220
But there can be other creatures in this alien environment, hunters.

539
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,180
Hunters are fast and maneuverable.

540
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,380
They eat the floaters, both for their organic molecules and for their store of pure hydrogen.

541
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,140
But there can't be many hunters, because if they destroy all the floaters, they themselves

542
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,020
will perish.

543
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:17,040
Give birth to the little onion-headed boys, the little onion-headed boys and girls, with

544
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,320
such pale skin.

545
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Made for hunting.

546
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,660
They've got a tail, 2011.

547
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,540
articulate fish.

548
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,180
Partифor dark-headed physicians.

549
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,340
The faces of civilization.

550
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,340


551
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,360
Activ Chaos, watch stateword woman of science.

552
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,940
Well, he looks like important in his case.

553
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,780
How creating of...?

554
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,520
Why I'm unique.

555
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,760
And do you mislead or becomeandel of it?

556
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,520
Well, I think, I have a sub-dimension.

557
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm an hyvinon of technology.

558
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:45,600


559
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,860
I know the rule of wide environments and gusts of wind.

560
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:47,920
So I share interests withmetropl aimful digitalaciego.

561
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,260
Pretty simple.

562
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:48,600
And then you do what, what?

563
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:48,920
Who knows that I need!

564
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:48,920


565
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:48,920


566
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,520
So I've gotten to live and learn the day routine more.

567
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,100
The time you're out of the night

568
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,500
Step into the sun, step into the light

569
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,240
Each day to get more

570
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,200
The most glorious place

571
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,320
On the face of the earth

572
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,180
Or the sky

573
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,240
Hold on to your breath

574
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,300
Hold on to your heart

575
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,460
Hold on to your hope

576
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,360
March up to the gate

577
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,440
And feel it all

578
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,840
Open

579
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,800
Open

580
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,600
Speaking of swinging like carts of stink,

581
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,900
did you get the email and hear about the dreams

582
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,680
of like Toto with a space helmet?

583
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,640
You haven't heard of a lick of a dream like that?

584
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:30,960
No.

585
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,040
Of dog sex with Judy Garland in a space...

586
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,260
The helmet and everything?

587
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,840
I had that.

588
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,980
I didn't actually have the dream, I had the actual sex.

589
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
The dog sex with Judy Garland.

590
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,760
So you were Toto in the space helmet?

591
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,260
Well, actually I was...

592
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,480
Can I say doing?

593
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,160
I was doing

594
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,500
something.

595
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,200
Toto and then Toto was doing Judy.

596
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,540
She was...

597
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,020
It was a little three-way thing.

598
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,580
It was fun.

599
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,520
Little is right.

600
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Well, yeah, I mean...

601
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,140
I'm surprised to hear that about you, Bleepo.

602
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,960
Well, let me tell you, I mean, the dog was never the same after that.

603
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,180
Let's just say he had to wear a special little bag after that.

604
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,600
But I don't...

605
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,780
I use my dog as a special little bag.

606
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,340
I'm not proud of that, you know, because I'm not into animal abuse.

607
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,420
I like that one better.

608
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,340
I use the little dog as a special bag.

609
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,160
Right.

610
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,060
Big dog.

611
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,660
I saw that.

612
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,400
I saw those dogs.

613
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,240
Those dogs are the funniest lawn ornaments I've ever seen.

614
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
I got to say that.

615
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,600
Well, especially when I turned the blood spray on.

616
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,780
Yeah, coming out of the derby hat.

617
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,440
I love that.

618
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,420
The first time I saw it, I thought it was like a Laurel and Hardy thing.

619
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:38,820
And then I...

620
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,360
Instead of chocolate, I thought it was like chocolate, but it was real blood.

621
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,320
I thought, which was wacky?

622
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,740
You know, with the old film holograms with the dog thing.

623
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,620
The nose and the chocolate, it was just too...

624
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,040
I'm sorry.

625
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm sorry.

627
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm sorry.

628
00:29:50,620 --> 00:30:00,360
The devil, Mr. Douglas, I have found is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes.

629
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:12,580
And it is with great assurance that I can tell you that Lucifer, son of the morning, is no more.

630
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,840
You mean if I smoke that, it's the same as if, as if I was a colleague?

631
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,040


632
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,000
Plain common sense may tell you that you're caught in a rut of faint or futility.

633
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,140
You mean if I was a colleague?

634
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:39,200
Plain common sense may tell you that you're caught in a rut of faint or futility.

635
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,700
Do they ever forget or forgive the whippings and the harsh, strict words of command?

636
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,220
I wonder.

637
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,200
I wonder.

638
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,440
I wonder.

639
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,240
How can you forget or forgive those over and above you?

640
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,540
Those tall, silly dictators.

641
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Mommy!

642
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,140
Daddy!

643
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,980
Where are you?

644
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,560
Peekaboo!

645
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,300
Something's going to happen.

646
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,580
And I wanted to say goodbye.

647
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,240
What's going to happen?

648
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,340
Something wonderful.

649
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,480
Do you think time's really going to be shorter?

650
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,060
After X day?

651
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,360
No, it'll be much longer.

652
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,880
Depending on where you are.

653
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,640
But, you know, it's like pretty soon.

654
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,760
I would say by July 6th, several of us will have caught on to the 25-hour day.

655
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,620
Yeah, but this is what I want to talk about.

656
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,540
Why not the 36-hour day?

657
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,220
Why not the 72-hour day?

658
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,400
I haven't heard talk about time control in years.

659
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,280
It's been a long time since anybody talked about it.

660
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,180
Well, that's because we've been using time control on you, bleepo.

661
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,820
Your hands are distended.

662
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,200
Well, chance is right.

663
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:31,440
We're facing down the barrel of the last five minutes of the last greatest radio moment of Earth Farm 1.

664
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,640
We're four minutes from that orgasm, Stan.

665
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,300
No, we're about seven minutes from that ultimate, final, final, that final, final excommunication.

666
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,680
We're beating up to the countdown.

667
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,600
And the final squirt.

668
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,360
The great ooze.

669
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,740
We're whipping it in a frenzy until it's all gone.

670
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,580
It's coming.

671
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,040
It's coming.

672
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,040
They're coming to get you.

673
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,260
And I don't mean they're coming to take you away.

674
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,620
I mean they're coming for you.

675
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:08,400
They're coming to join with you, to commingle with you, to become you.

676
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,380
I like that one quote of yours in the magazine there.

677
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,580
When in doubt, eat pussy.

678
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,520
What is your name?

679
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:16,940
I'm.

680
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,140
I'm.

681
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,040
I'm.

682
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,240
I'm.

683
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm.

684
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,220
I'm.

685
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,520


686
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,140
I'm.

687
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,360


688
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:26,700
I'm.

689
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:26,780
I'm.

690
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm.

691
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:26,800


692
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:26,800


693
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,460
Did I say that?

694
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,200
Well, then, pussy.

695
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,860
Pussy.

696
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,280
Pussy.

697
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,060
I think that you can't say that.

698
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,260
Did I say that in that magazine article?

699
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,140
Yeah, and you said something about you can't, an anus, you can't use your anus in a medicinal way anymore.

700
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,800
I didn't say anything about that.

701
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,260
I can easily believe that other quote.

702
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,780
Well, that's the time thing again.

703
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,480
Somebody said that.

704
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,380
I believe Bo said that on the show that your anus can only be used in a medicinal fashion.

705
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,800
And if you laugh at it, you're in some big trouble.

706
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,800
Hey, listen, we've got four minutes left.

707
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,100
And I would reiterate what Chaz just quoted.

708
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:10,800
If I had much others, I'd say if I had somebody who's going to say, Reverend Stang, what is your final statement to the youth of America, to the humans who've been left behind?

709
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,040
What is what do you have to say as your most?

710
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:15,960
I think it's a critical.

711
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,620
Your one moment.

712
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,300
And I would have to repeat once again.

713
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,880
Pain.

714
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,560
No more.

715
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,100
When in doubt, eat.

716
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,520
Puss.

717
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,880
We are not men.

718
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,740
But although I felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me, still, I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression.

719
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,660
And gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice.

720
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,560
The songs of the sun.

721
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,220
I believe they're trying to pray to the exes, but praying is not going to do them a lot of good.

722
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,260
A lot of things can happen.

723
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,620
The vortex gets much bigger.

724
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,800
Stop wondering what happened to me by now.

725
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,340
If you go that far, that fast during the vortex.

726
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,760
A bunch of geometrical.

727
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,680
Bumps are going to start appearing on your skin before you even get there.

728
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:32,840
And so they have a clean up there as a clean up ritual, I guess, before a lot of the inductees or the young savages will be allowed to have their skin scraped so they can, you know, at least breathe right when they're on the escape fence.

729
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,780
Is this the law?

730
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,120
None shall escape.

731
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,860
That is the law.

732
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,120
Never, never, never, never, never, never.

733
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,720
Never, never, never, never, never, never.

734
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:45,740
Never, never, never, never, never.

735
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,140
Never mind.

736
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:46,880
Never mind.

737
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,500
Never mind.

738
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,540


739
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
They are complete.

740
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
There's no clothes on the pleasure ships, is there?

741
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,520
If they want them, they grow them.

742
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,420
I guess it's with some of them newer models and stuff,

743
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,480
all you have to do is think of like maybe a nice pair of checkerboard pants.

744
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,120
As soon as they grow them, you could want them to not grow them,

745
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
and it would disappear.

746
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,140
It would be this endless cycle of them growing clothes

747
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,380
and themselves willing the clothes and you willing not the clothes.

748
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,180
I guess staying really did kind of help bring about a very awful world for all of us.

749
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
It's just this constant fluctuation.

750
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,960
Yeah, between a bunch of different minds wanting their different ego ideas of what they want, you know?

751
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,680
I am here to protect you.

752
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,540
You have nowhere to go.

753
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,480
You have nowhere to go.

754
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,580
You are a true believer.

755
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,140
Blessings of the state.

756
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,500
Blessings of the masses.

757
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,000
It could be hell.

758
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,420
It could be hell.

759
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,100
Subgenius hell.

760
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,640
Subgenius hell.

761
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,380
There is no hell.

762
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,380
There's just endless, endless lines of more or less pleasure and a lot more pain all the time, really.

763
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,960
There is no hell.

764
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,220
There is no Bob.

765
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,240
Well, I happen to know there is a Bob because he's standing right over there.

766
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
He's sitting there, smiling.

767
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,060
Just like the smile on the dog's face.

768
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,100
What's interesting to a dog?

769
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,820
To hunt.

770
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,900
To kill.

771
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,660
To hunt.

772
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,260
To hunt.

773
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:28,080
From all the tales of the West, we'll remember best Corporal Rusty and Private Renton Tim.

774
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,780
Nobody has done this for them or to them.

775
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,380
They have done it to themselves.

776
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,800
They are a slave.

777
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,540
You know what it is?

778
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,480
In short, they are a slave.

779
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,600
They're a slavery.

780
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,400
They need to be free.

781
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,740
They need to be liberated.

782
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,580
Uh, uh, you know.

783
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,760
They need to be liberated.

784
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
Uh, uh, you know.

785
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,820
Uh, uh, you know.

786
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,100
Bob doesn't care whether you brush your teeth or whether you shave your legs or whether you...

787
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,420
Or whether your dad's the heat.

788
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:56,940
Yeah.

789
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,080
He doesn't care.

790
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,500
He doesn't care if you're packing a big old colostomy bag from a surprise you had somewhere in a hillbilly bar.

791
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,080
He doesn't care.

792
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,660
Or a .44 Magnum loaded with big hollow point bullets ready to...

793
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,920
No, sir.

794
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,940
As long as you got...

795
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,080
Take down Africa with one shot from this pleasure ship.

796
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,440
Which can magnify the bullets in the size of the state of Oregon.

797
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,280
But since we're all into drumming, we wouldn't want to take out Africa with one shot.

798
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,600
We'd probably aim for Antarctica.

799
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,000
But, uh, I like penguins.

800
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,060
Ye who read are still among the living.

801
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,920
But I who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows.

802
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,200
For indeed strange things shall happen and secret things be known.

803
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,880
And many centuries shall pass away.

804
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,120
Ere these memorials be seen of men.

805
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,900
At the end of the rainbow, you'll find a pot of gold.

806
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,920
At the end of the story, you'll find it's all been told.

807
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:08,620
But our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend.

808
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,560
And it has a story.

809
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,520
And it's a story without any end.

810
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,640
Unless we're so stupid as to destroy ourselves, there are going to be people exploring those worlds.

811
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,700
There are going to be human habitations on those worlds.

812
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,520
We're going to be moving out into space in the next century.

813
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,320
We're on a little time delay here.

814
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,900
We're broadcasting live from Brushwood.

815
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:39,700
And it's airing just a few minutes later via the internet at WCSB in Cleveland.

816
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,860
And, uh, that's what's happening.

817
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,060
Tonight.

818
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,700
Yeah.

819
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:44,940
Yep.

820
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,700
And we're watching all kinds of people from many, many walks of life.

821
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,080
Every different type of...

822
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,720
They've kind of set up a little booth here for us.

823
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,880
A little window booth like they do at the big TV station.

824
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,200
People are going to hang around the Universal Date Wire.

825
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,320
The invisible date, date, date.

826
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,600
Yeah.

827
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,720
Which is actually going to be hovering right over the jam site for Saturday in the afternoon.

828
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,060
To allow the jammers and the other unfortunate ones...

829
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,300
Which consist of Einstein, Secret Orchestra, again.

830
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,680
And whatever drummers show up.

831
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,240
We're going to be drumming for the Earth.

832
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,580
Saturday is going to be the last, uh...

833
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,140
I'm so sorry.

834
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,640
The last drumming to the Earth.

835
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,380
The last...

836
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,340
We're going to bid farewell to the Earth Saturday afternoon at the, uh...

837
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,840
With a happy, clappy, pounding sound.

838
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,340
The Greek Amphitheater.

839
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,540
We'll be singing the Strophe and the Anastrophe.

840
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,700
We'll be performing Antigone in the afternoon.

841
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,400
Uh, but I don't think any of the players from the Iambic chorus will be there.

842
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,460
Not the Baraka?

843
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,220
No.

844
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,860
Or the Koya Naskatsi.

845
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,060
No, those people will all be taken into, uh, Native American subterranean worlds to have their manicures and toes nails.

846
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:53,060
The life out of balance is about to be balanced.

847
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,120
Yep, it had to happen someday.

848
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,280
And better that it happened someday than some other day.

849
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,060
Some day.

850
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,420
Some other day.

851
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,660
Next day.

852
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,480
I still get gripped with, uh...

853
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,980
It's a great vibe.

854
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,080
...plasmas, or spasms of fear.

855
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,920
And, uh...

856
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,680
Thinking that, uh...

857
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,180
Convulsions.

858
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,280
Well, I don't know if them ships is really going to be there.

859
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,180
They're going to be able to pull us up.

860
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,540
Now, what if Stan gives us the Kool-Aid and...

861
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,740
Well, he pointed that out.

862
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,720
Yeah, he pointed it out.

863
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,160
You know, Stan could be a black-off guy trying to get a bunch of us, the subgeniuses, so that the, you know, the other bad guys could...

864
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,760
Yeah, delivering us.

865
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,620
Right, to them.

866
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,700
Saying, here, here's the choice ones.

867
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,760
Chomp, chomp.

868
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,260
Or the, uh, the pleasure ships might come down and they're the size of a mosquito.

869
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,000
Yeah.

870
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,460
And there they are hovering right in front of your face going, come on, get on, get on board.

871
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,020
Yeah, I...

872
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:47,300
And there we are, all paid up, dues-paying members, and there's a little mosquito spaceship going, come on, let's go.

873
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,240
Well, that thought might have been precluded by the infinite worlds theory, wherein some...

874
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,640
There is a galaxy, supposedly, a completely self-contained galaxy the size of a grain of sand.

875
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,480
And since this is possible, it is probably happening.

876
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,780
So, therefore, there could be many, many, uh...

877
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,320
Like Stan predicted also that...

878
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,880
I can't deal with the possible.

879
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,920
It must be happening.

880
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,260
You know.

881
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,120
The possibilities?

882
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,540
Yeah.

883
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,820
There's just so many of them.

884
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,180
I mean, who knows who's gonna show up on X-Day?

885
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:15,440
And they all happen.

886
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,920
Not just a little teeny bug craft.

887
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,920
Every thought that people have...

888
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,080
What if the big guys show up first and don't even see the planet?

889
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
You know what I'm saying?

890
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,720
Yeah, right.

891
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,400
They're so big.

892
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,160
It's like they look at, they look at, where's the planet?

893
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,960
Yeah, where's Earth?

894
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,880
We're down here, man!

895
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,340
It's supposed to be here somewhere.

896
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,960
The charts say Earth's right here.

897
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,360
And we'll be, we'll be this tiny dust speck.

898
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,120
They won't even...

899
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,580
Yeah, and they...

900
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,220
You know, smaller than a mote of dust.

901
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,040
And they mistake it for like, you know, just a mote of dust.

902
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:42,460
Yeah.

903
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,300
They don't even see it.

904
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,600
They were expecting some big guys like them, you know.

905
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,780
Right.

906
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,200
They don't even comprehend it.

907
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,020
And there we, yeah, you're right.

908
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:49,840
There we are down there.

909
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,060
Hey!

910
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,360
We're down here!

911
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,160
And then right in the middle of it, you got the black op guys trying to figure out who's

912
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,380
gonna...

913
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,680
They wanna get on there, see?

914
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,120
They wanna make their own deal.

915
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,040
They wanna get off on time and stuff.

916
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,960
You think a bunch of goons and spies who know this is gonna go on is gonna let it go on

917
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,180
and they're not gonna get on there?

918
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,520
No, no, man.

919
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,200
Oh, they're not gonna get on there?

920
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,420
They're not gonna get on there.

921
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,720
The spooks are definitely here tonight.

922
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,680
Yeah, the spooks wanna get all their people on there.

923
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,940
Yeah.

924
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,940
Sure.

925
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,060
A pure white race probably.

926
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:16,720
Who knows?

927
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,200
And they think, yeah, they have to do all this other stuff, but all they have to do

928
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,540
is become dues-paying members.

929
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,640
And that's it.

930
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,280
That's it.

931
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,260
They don't have to go around with their surveillance.

932
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,000
They have to make some big conspiracy out of it.

933
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,260
Right.

934
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:27,640
Yeah.

935
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,680
They're spending...

936
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,860
Look at how much money they're spending in surveillance.

937
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,880
How many gray cars did you see on the edge of the campground this morning when all they

938
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,700
had to do was just walk up with 30 bucks?

939
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:36,960


940
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,440
Yeah, blow three bucks and...

941
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,200
Have fun.

942
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah.

943
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,260
Smoke some frappie.

944
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,720
Yeah.

945
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,320
That's all it takes.

946
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,960
There's not much to it.

947
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,360
We're not talking rocket science here.

948
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,980
Well, we are, but not in any form that you would understand.

949
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,700
Don't worry about it.

950
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,240
Or even us.

951
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,820
We don't know how this whole thing works.

952
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,040
Like I said before, I don't know how a great amount of this whole endeavor is gonna happen,

953
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,940
but I know my little part of it.

954
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,200
I know how to make my little part of this whole thing, and I know how to make my little

955
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,980
part of this thing work, the whole rupture, and all that, and I guarantee you...

956
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,280
You won't say all this because of me.

957
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,460
It's the latest thing in nuclear fission.

958
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,560
Nothing like this has ever been exploded before, and we're gonna be pretty darn close.

959
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,560
I know you're leaving, babe.

960
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,200
Goodbye, so long.

961
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,720
I hope someday somebody listens to your song.

962
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,180
Those bright lights never ever turn on.

963
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


964
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


965
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


966
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


967
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


968
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


969
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


970
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


971
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


972
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,180


973
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,380
Spell your name, it's true

974
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,960
Maybe a change of scene would be the best for you

975
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,280
So long, babe

976
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,700
So long, babe

977
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,960
So long, babe

978
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,020
So long, babe

979
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,900
When in doubt, eat pussy.

980
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,600
At the center of your pregnancy

981
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,300
Sex

982
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,560
Sex

983
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:22,560


984
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,940
Is another dimension

985
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,800
Sex

986
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,480
Sex

987
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,160
Sex

988
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,160


989
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,520
In another world

990
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,220
I find a power of movement

991
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,580
That's a good one

992
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,420
Long time

993
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Long time

994
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,260
Long time

995
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,520
Will I have no intention

996
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:21,340
Sex, not with nobody

997
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:21,880
Girl

998
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,800
I tried and I tried

999
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,060
I will

1000
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,840
I tried

1001
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,180
I tried

1002
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,060
And I didn't

1003
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,900
And I didn't

1004
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,300
Ah, I'll Daddy

1005
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,780
Well, I have no potential

1006
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,360
I'm in another dimension

1007
00:47:41,740 --> 00:48:04,340
I've been in another dimension

1008
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:17,520
I'm in another dimension

1009
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:41,420
I'm in another dimension

1010
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,020
The next day never happened pill

1011
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:06,740
Yeah

1012
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,740
That you trip on for 50 years

1013
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,380
Yeah

1014
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,360
What if

1015
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,960
What if

1016
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,200
What if

1017
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,260
What if

1018
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,900
Dot dot dot

1019
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,800
If dot dot dot question

1020
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,860
If what

1021
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,700
What if what

1022
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,540
Were if

1023
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,780
Were if

1024
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,520
Were if

1025
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,460
If were

1026
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:31,760
At

1027
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,680
With

1028
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,560
What if

1029
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,060
Were

1030
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:34,340
If

1031
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:34,940
Were if

1032
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,540
Were if

1033
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,040
Were if

1034
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,680
Were if

1035
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,400
Were if

1036
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,400
Were if

1037
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,020
Cave

1038
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,100
The beginning was the end

1039
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,160
Of everything, my friend

1040
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,200
That was a premature ejaculation, though

1041
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,520
Awesome

1042
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,540
It was before and after

1043
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,300
The ape regards his tail

1044
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,420
He's stuck on it.

1045
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,420
Have I ever had multiple orgasms?

1046
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:12,140
No, not in my recollection.

1047
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,940
You will soon, my friend.

1048
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,660
Very soon.

1049
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,180
All that stuff.

1050
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,620
The real X-Day behind the X-Day.

1051
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,020
The Sword of Destiny.

1052
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,420
It's kind of like the real Mardi Gras behind Mardi Gras.

1053
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,580
Yeah, like who's the real Rex?

1054
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,560
Where's the real magic happening?

1055
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,680
Yeah, it's not happening in the boneyard somewhere down on...

1056
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,360
It's not happening in outer space.

1057
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,340
On rude apple heart.

1058
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:51,900
The real magic doesn't happen in outer space, kids.

1059
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,100
It happens in a little microcosmic world in inner space.

1060
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,060
Magic.

1061
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,640
Are you...

1062
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:11,120
Let's speak to the Brushwood fans here.

1063
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,140
Just randomly...

1064
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,100
We're out there practicing their magic right now.

1065
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,140
Let's just take...

1066
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,160
Forget about the people in Cleveland.

1067
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,500
Forget about the people in other parts of the world.

1068
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,920
You want to pick us up here as we just roll along?

1069
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,840
We'll just walk out there?

1070
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,020
Yeah, all right, here, let's go.

1071
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,520
Let's take the microphones.

1072
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,280
What should we hit first?

1073
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,720
You want to go where they're selling all the froth?

1074
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:33,560
Or you want to go...

1075
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:33,560


1076
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,360
Where they're selling the magic?

1077
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,960
Drums, or...

1078
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,660
No, I want to go watch the magic.

1079
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,160
Oh, there's people, I guess, off over by those blue tents.

1080
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,880
Hey, have you seen Ivan Stang?

1081
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,520
Hey, hey, you dressed in that white...

1082
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,160
Gosh, look at that outfit.

1083
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,600
It's like white polka dot.

1084
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,400
The arms are 40 feet long.

1085
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,580
That person's arms are 40 feet long.

1086
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,740
I want to watch you guys.

1087
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,800
Wow.

1088
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,020
How you doing, man?

1089
00:51:59,360 --> 00:51:59,880
Look at that.

1090
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,440
That's pretty cool.

1091
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,720
Look at that chick over there.

1092
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,160
Yeah, baby.

1093
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:03,560


1094
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,940
The day glow paint all over her.

1095
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,740
Wow, look at that, dude.

1096
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,140
Nice little...

1097
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,580
Her little things are...

1098
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,160
Yeah, over that way, there's this weird glow coming from just over the hill.

1099
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,540
Actually, let's just follow the glow, man.

1100
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,100
That's how we said it, you know.

1101
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,140
Let's put these mics down.

1102
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,340
Not worry about this right in the shot.

1103
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,600
Look, it's getting bigger.

1104
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,560
There she is, man.

1105
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,940
The chick I was telling you about.

1106
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,580
Oh, wow.

1107
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,960
The one they were tearing.

1108
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,700
Wow, she's...

1109
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,200
Look at how tall she is now, though.

1110
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,840
Man, she's like a 30-foot woman.

1111
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,540
Man, one pill makes you smaller.

1112
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,260
Yeah, I was...

1113
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:38,800
One pill makes you tall.

1114
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,000
She took the tall pill.

1115
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,780
I don't want to take no more of these pills.

1116
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,220
We all took the small pills.

1117
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,140
I took the...

1118
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:45,980
Uh...

1119
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,380
I took all the pills.

1120
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,260
Oh, man, what's going to happen to me?

1121
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,200
You didn't eat the mushroom, too, did you?

1122
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:52,920
Yeah, I took...

1123
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,540
Name it, what'd they give me?

1124
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,200
I took it all.

1125
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,280
The hamburger, the mushrooms on the hamburger...

1126
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,040
You better just remember what the doormouse said.

1127
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,360
...the green pills, the yellow pills...

1128
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,880
Eat the hamburger!

1129
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,760
Take your hand!

1130
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,620
Take your hand!

1131
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,040
Take your hand!

1132
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,040


1133
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,120
What if the rockets don't come?

1134
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:14,840
Ah, don't worry, they're coming, all right.

1135
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,980
Ain't nothing gonna happen to spoil my plans, baby.

1136
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,120
I figured it all out.

1137
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,660
It's time we told you, son.

1138
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,480
We're not going home.

1139
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,040
This is where we'll live from now on.

1140
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,220
But what about the rockets?

1141
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,660
What about Ohio?

1142
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,480
More of what they want will be wherever we are,

1143
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,480
because we'll want the same thing, too.

1144
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,540
Um, we'll come back.

1145
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,260
We'll have misery, son.

1146
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,360
Only we'll have bliss this time instead of misery.

1147
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,040
Exactly, my friend.

1148
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,160
Dave has spoken,

1149
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,340
Leepo has spoken,

1150
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,700
Chaz has spoken,

1151
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,860
Stang has spoken,

1152
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,440
and we have spoken.

1153
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,100
We have spoken.

1154
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,240
This is the end.

1155
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:00,000
And yet, perhaps the end is really a new beginning.

1156
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,580
A new beginning for all of us.

1157
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,280
Because if we can start again the same way we began,

1158
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,360
then it'll all be simple.

1159
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,460
We'll have a chance to redo all of those things that we weren't able to do before.

1160
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,820
We can get it right this time.

1161
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,560
That's right.

1162
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,380
Can you imagine what it's like to go back and make it all right again?

1163
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:30,860
It'll be like doing third grade all over again, only knowing everything that you know now.

1164
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,720
No more knocks on your head.

1165
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,720
No more kids picking on you.

1166
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,520
Driving you down and making fun of your funny name.

1167
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,320
You will be as unto a god.

1168
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,400
A pair of shoes and a new account.

1169
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,340
You'll have everything you want.

1170
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,680
The water stops its flow.

1171
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,160
You'll be safe at the end of a high sea.

1172
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,900
You can stop and start again.

1173
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,300
There's no place you can go.

1174
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,680
You're as close to a god as you will ever be.

1175
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,760
Take me, love me, and be what you'll be.

1176
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,700
Be there then.

1177
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,740
And I'll love me now.

1178
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:12,180
I want to thank everyone who loves me.

1179
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,260
Where's my wallet?

1180
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,860
I want to thank Reverend Stagg,

1181
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:20,100
and many other chows, and me, and everybody.

1182
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,620
We'll see ya!

1183
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,600
Goodbye, Mom!

1184
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,760
I'll see you on the flip-flop, man!

1185
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,900
Goodbye, Dad!

1186
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,700
Catch you on the saucer!

1187
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,260
I'm out of here!

1188
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,660
I'm outta here!

1193

tutrtuok

1194
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,720
I'm so sorry!

1195
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,300
Are we done now?

1196
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,680
Not yet.

1197
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1198
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:58,680


1199
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,520
Earth is finished.

1200
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,920
We're going to blow up our rocket and start all over.

1201
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,460
See if we can't build a better world up here.

1202
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,180
Then he lifted his eyes to the deep ocean sky,

1203
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,520
trying once more to see Earth

1204
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,860
and the house he had always called home.

1205
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,820
But Earth was too far away,

1206
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,960
and the house was now only a heap of radioactive rubble.

1207
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,560
Only one wall remained standing,

1208
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,880
and within the wall a voice spoke again and again and again.

1209
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,620
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

1210
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,780
if mankind perished utterly,

1211
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,560
and spring herself, when she woke at dawn,

1212
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,860
would scarcely know that we were gone.

1213
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,440
That we were gone.

1214
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,840
That we were gone.

1215
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,580
The whole world is waiting,

1216
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,680
for this will decide the fate of civilization,

1217
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,420
all humanity.

1218
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,880
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here.

1219
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,640
Attention please.

1220
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,420
Four minutes to bomb time.

1221
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,260
Then close your eyes,

1222
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,480
and tap your heels together three times.

1223
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,540
And three times.

1224
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:23,540


1225
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,320
Think to yourself,

1226
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,740
there's no place like home.

1227
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,840
There's no place like home.

1228
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,580
There's no place like home.

1229
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,780
There's no place like home.

1230
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,500
Stars are my home.

1231
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,860
Stars are my home.

1232
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,100
Stars are my home.

1233
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,640
The world of...

1234
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,320
...dimension X!

1235
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,480
A googolplex is just as far away

1236
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,140
from infinity as is one.

1237
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,700
Well, infinity, you don't want to argue with infinity.

1238
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,480
What?

1239
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,920
It's not a number.

1240
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,340
It's a state of consciousness.

1241
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:05,780
Isn't it?

1242
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:05,940
What?

1243
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,620
Come on now, let's not try to think like three-dimensional beings.

1244
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,000
What?

1245
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,640
Let's try to think like two-dimensional beings.

1246
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:12,860
What?

1247
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,880
In a binary world.

1248
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,480
Yes.

1249
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,460
Let's...

1250
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,140
Ah...

1251
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,560
That's what it's going to be.

1252
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,920
What's that super excited that is?

1253
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,000
Mis하하?

1254
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,680
Is it a relaxing atmosphere filled with

1255
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:42,720
rhythm?

1256
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:44,320
What can I do for that?

1257
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,320


1258
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,320


1259
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,840
Because I'm aware of this.

1260
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:53,520


1261
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,160
It's another day.

1262
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,740
Look for it.

1263
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,440
Look for it.

1264
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,500
Watch the sky.

1265
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,060
And the waves.

1266
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:21,880
Yeah.

1267
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,760
The waves of hot jams.

1268
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,100
The waves of the molecule atomic.

1269
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,720
My tears.

1270
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,020
One.

1271
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:33,220
One more.

1272
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,700
One more.

1273
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,080
One more.

1274
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,040
