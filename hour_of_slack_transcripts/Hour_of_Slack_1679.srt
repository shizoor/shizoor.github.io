1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,420
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,500
subgenius power of SWAT

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:24,160
Ah yes dear friends, I can scarcely believe it myself, but we're finally on our way back to Ohio

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:33,460
and Wisteria campground and 21X Day and off of this planet. So meanwhile we're

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:41,220
gone and we are providing you with memories of previous X Day drills. This

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:49,580
was from hour of slack number 951 around 2004 and it features all the same people

7
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,400
who will be at 21X Day. Praise Bob!

8
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:07,340
Yes friends, well you know according to subgenius prophecy, the space monster

9
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:16,600
Jehovah One told mystic salesman JR Bob Dobbs that the world would end for

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,400
everybody except subgenius cult members at 7 a.m.

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,220
on July 5th.

12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:37,800
Well my friends, we still aren't really home yet from the New York celebrations of X Day.

13
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,180
Our minds aren't home yet. So you might as well consider this a live X Day show.

14
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,820
Even though the event itself, July 5th was weeks ago.

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:12,980
We've lost a lot of commons since the day dissoxation of Xbox One because all

16
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,680
so out there are still crazy people.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,160
Guess for a better directly and when we're here today with Toy世 and Jay Toy and

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,460
our grandads fighting that sociedad-

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,500
so am I sure we're going to fill it and show our homies their daddy didn't beat

20
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,520
him to a death over something playing in ten minutes and he watches it while heтор

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,260
which would teach him to quit.

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,140
All right friends, we're always behind after X Day because we blow everything off.

23
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,100
Bob's Lifetime Funhouse and the WCSB show in Cleveland.

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
Dr. Sinister's.

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,200
And we'll start with the KPFA Puzzling Evidence show, friends,

26
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:43,700
with Dr. Howell at Puzzling Evidence and Philo Drummond's X-Day Report.

27
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,720
Yes, everyone's somewhat world-weary here.

28
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,580
Because you know what?

29
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,540
These fine young folks have just returned from X-Day,

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,800
and they're coming back in their triumphant post-X-Day parade now.

31
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:03,700
They're somewhat bedraggled and debauched, and that's to be expected.

32
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,220
But good Lord, how clean they are.

33
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,040
Absolutely sparkling clean.

34
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,280
Their skins shine with a peculiar iridescence.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,140
And, well, it almost seems to steam with the heat.

36
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,400
Given by warmth and moisture.

37
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,420
Oh, they're not there. Jingle your...

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,620
What marvelous sights one sees at X-Day.

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,900
But one thing we did see, of course, was when we assembled at 7 o'clock a.m.

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,460
We're trying to talk to Philo Drummond down on the field.

41
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,000
He is there, and we will be connecting with Philo Drummond momentarily.

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,140
It was at X-Day that we...

43
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,320
We gathered at 7 a.m. on July 5th of 2004.

44
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,120
And as we waited in the shade of the main pavilion,

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:12,880
a band played, and then all eyes went to the zenith of the sky

46
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,820
where a huge, round, glittering shape rapidly lowered down,

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,300
expanding inside.

48
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,260
And I think you heard...

49
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
Blotting out the light.

50
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,220
With an enormous, metallic humming, like the ripping of a glass.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,220
Or the buzzing of innumerable bees.

52
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,180
Long, telescoping legs extended, and...

53
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,820
Hear that bee in the background? He was just buzzing, buzzing, buzzing.

54
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,880
Well, you know, the main theme now is, for the whole of the audience,

55
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,480
is they want to know what happened the next day.

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,680
Well, I'm telling you.

57
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,400
And so then the ramp came down, and...

58
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,560
Well, a lot of people.

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,200
They want to know what happened the next day.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,500
They keep asking that question.

61
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,840
Now, next up on Monday, July 5th, at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,

62
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,200
our Earth will be at athelion,

63
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,780
which means that it will be at its farthest point away from our sun for the entire year.

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,980
Almost 3 million miles farther away than it was when it was at perihelion,

65
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,020
its closest, last January 4th.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,540
And then, get ready for a super...

67
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:20,940
Super goody.

68
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
Super goody.

69
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,220
All right, Atlanta.

70
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,800
Perhaps we have something for you here.

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,260
Yes, perhaps. Who knows?

72
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,640
It's one of those things that, like this church, it's wild and unpredictable.

73
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,840
We are going to attempt to...

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,520
We are going to attempt to...

75
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,480
We are going to attempt to get a live update from X-Day.

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,280
From Brushwood, from Ground Zero, 7 a.m., July 5th.

77
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,700
That's where the smoking's going to start.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,560
It'll spread outward from there.

79
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,760
All right, well, let's try to punch them in.

80
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,980
Let's see if this thing's working.

81
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,040
Hello, do we have Brushwood?

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,860
Atlanta to Brushwood, over.

83
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,860
I think we're being jammed at the source.

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,780
Uh-oh.

85
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, my God.

86
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,500


87
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,500


88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,500


89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,220
You don't think they did it, Jonestown, already?

90
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,120
There's something.

91
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,160
Suzy, I don't know if you can hear me, but here at X-Day number 7, it is a complete catastrophe.

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,620
I am watching the fire eat away at the very heavens right now.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,260
It was a terrible tragedy, the pipe of fog that we had in the fire circle

94
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,160
whenever the burning cross finally fell.

95
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,740
Oh, what the pipe?

96
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,920
Well, it disgorged a little gift for all of humanity

97
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,400
and is currently burning down everything that we ever loved.

98
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,800
I knew it was going to be good.

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,140
And yet we somehow feel much more cleansed for it.

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,580
And now, with more details, is the Reverend Ivan Singh on site.

101
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,140
Oh, no, that crummy...

102
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,660
It's a perfect success if death and destruction is...

103
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,120
Suzy, are you there?

104
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,720
Yes, yes, I'm here, but you can't hear me.

105
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,580
It's a nightmare, and yet it's...

106
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,440
It's like heaven.

107
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,220
It's like a Jack Chick comic come to life.

108
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,400
It's what every X-Day is supposed to be.

109
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,680
Surely the saucers will be here.

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
Oh, damn it, damn it.

111
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:31,560
What?

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,660
Oh, my God, it's silent.

113
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,280
The police are coming.

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,000
We're going to have to...

115
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,720
We may not be able to be on for long.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,400
Hold it.

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,860
Hold on.

118
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,380
I've got to do this.

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,000
What?

120
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,700
Get out.

121
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,780
Suzy, hold on just one second.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,660
We're just kind of...

123
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,720
No, get away from me, you goddamn...

124
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:47,840
Get out.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,660
Get out.

126
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:48,740
Get out.

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,200
You're a friend.

128
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,100
You can't...

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,800
You can't...

130
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,760
You can't stop...

131
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:02,780
Oh, well, there goes our connection.

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm afraid we've lost them.

133
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,280
Have we lost...

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,540
Hello?

135
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,140
Hello?

136
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,240
Uh-oh.

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,140
Okay, so that's what's going on at Brushwood.

138
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,300
I knew they'd be having a great time without me there.

139
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
Damn it.

140
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,260
It sounded like they were all bleeding.

141
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,700
Pretty good.

142
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,480
I think that term would be hemorrhaging.

143
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,020
They were hemorrhaging slack.

144
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,180
They were hemorrhaging slack.

145
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,180
And it was such a hemorrhage of slack that they couldn't hear our unslacked voices.

146
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,860
And, man, I really need that sort of stuff to bathe in.

147
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,660
I can't find virgins anymore.

148
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh, no, you can't find a good virgin these days.

149
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,820
Well, virgin on the ridiculous, but they don't go for the technical virgins.

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,540
Ah, it's starting.

151
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,500
The floppy boot.

152
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay, now we...

153
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,960
We started...

154
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,500
Then the X-Day parade kicked off.

155
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,260
This is inspirational.

156
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,580
To be here at the X-Day parade, at the 2004 X-Day celebration, while we wait for the saucers to descend.

157
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,220
It's a beautiful, great day.

158
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,100
And we also are on our...

159
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,480
Clear sky.

160
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,860
No sign of a saucer yet, but we're all hoping and waiting.

161
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,140
Except, of course, for Philo Drummond, who decided to stay at home in his bed, reading the National Review.

162
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,680
But the rest of us are...

163
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,300
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,240
Is that something that we see up there in the sky?

165
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,620
A glittering round?

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,060
It is.

167
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,100
It's the saucer.

168
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,060
It's coming down.

169
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,540
Oh, this is just great.

170
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,900
The crowd is really reacting.

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,420
Look at their enthusiasm.

172
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,340
And the saucer now makes its way through the float parade.

173
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,980
Look at those great little cut-out characters of space aliens on top of the saucer.

174
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,400
Don't those...

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,580
Those aren't cut-outs.

176
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,380
I believe they're made out of roses.

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,740
They're actually razor-thin aliens.

178
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,340
Razor-thin and razor-thin.

179
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,360
Two dimensions.

180
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,360


181
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,360


182
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,360


183
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,360


184
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,360


185
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,760
They're sharp, I might add.

186
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,000
That's right.

187
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,460
You wouldn't want them to make a...

188
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,000
You don't want to stroke those aliens on the edge or cut your hand.

189
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,340
I don't want to stroke those aliens at all, Philo, but it may be that I'll have to.

190
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,460
It may be that we'll all have to.

191
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,560
You'll have to.

192
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,160
We all have to stroke the aliens.

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
Since it's going to be a new day and a new world since we've been visited by our visitors from afar.

194
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
You have to stroke the aliens sometime.

195
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,620
You can depend on me, darling.

196
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,420
Well, I better the aliens have a stroke.

197
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
I do depend on you to help me stroke the alien.

198
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,440
All right.

199
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,800
I think we've stroked this alien thing for all it's worth.

200
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,140
Isn't that a dance like shock the monkey that somebody did?

201
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,260
Stroke the alien.

202
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,860
Okay, if you say so.

203
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,060
Wasn't it cha-cha-cha?

204
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,940
They have nice cities.

205
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,060
No, it wasn't.

206
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,740
Yeah, well, they do have nice cities.

207
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,800
It's hard enough to do these dance moves.

208
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,060
They're half underground, half above ground.

209
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,680
Yeah, this is when the saucers show up over you, these guys' heads.

210
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,760
I was strolling through the park one night

211
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,460
And oh, I was in a hurry

212
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,460


213
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,700
Oh, I felt so blue

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,140
When I heard a little boy say

215
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm so lonely too

216
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,660
Then I turned around to look

217
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,660
And to my surprise

218
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,500
A little space girl said

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,440
They're crying right before my eyes

220
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,740
Stepping up a little closer

221
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,180
To see what I could see

222
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,020
She said

223
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,340
Mr. Earthman

224
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,460
Will you please marry me?

225
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,680
I said, why no, I couldn't do that

226
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
Well, that just wouldn't be right

227
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,760
Cause you and me

228
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
And me and you

229
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,080
We don't even look alike

230
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,640
Cause you've got four arms

231
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
The better to hold you

232
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,260
Three lips

233
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,960
The better to kiss you

234
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,240
Three eyes

235
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,160
All the better to see

236
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,960
I can really rock and swing

237
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,460
Cause I've got more of everything I've got

238
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,420
Oh, Mr. Earthman

239
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,180
Will you marry me?

240
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,040
Then I said, what will people think

241
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,100
When we go strolling by?

242
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
Why, they'd not only laugh at us

243
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,820
They'd lay right down and die

244
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,340
Then they'd put you and me in jail

245
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,380
There we would be

246
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,760
And the people, they'd come from miles around

247
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,960
Just to look at you and me

248
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,260
Cause you've got four arms

249
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,940
The better to hold you

250
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,980
Three lips

251
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,720
The better to kiss you

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,880
Three eyes

253
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,920
All the better to see

254
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,720
I can really rock and swing

255
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,220
Cause I've got more of everything

256
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,120
Oh, Mr. Earthman

257
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,920
Will you marry me?

258
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,760
I said, this ain't gone far enough

259
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,940
I've had enough of it

260
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,860
She said, please, Mr. Earthman

261
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,240
Will you marry me?

262
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,000
Just one little kiss

263
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,940
I said, okay, okay, okay

264
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,320
But then you, oh, wait

265
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
But when I finished kissing her

266
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,860
I had this to say

267
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,300
Oh, you've got four arms

268
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,920
The better to hold you

269
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,020
Three lips

270
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,720
The better to kiss you

271
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,940
Three eyes

272
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,920
All the better to see

273
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,700
I can really rock and swing

274
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,240
Cause I've got more of everything I've got

275
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,140
Oh, Mr. Earthman

276
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,060
Will you marry me?

277
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,840
Why, sure!

278
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,120
A thanks to Artemia Salina

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,020
for sending that one in

280
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,580
and now, Reverend Carter LeBlanc

281
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,780
live at Brushwood.

282
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,180
No, no, no, no, no!

283
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,860
So, it's X Day

284
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
It's almost X Day

285
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


286
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


287
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


288
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


289
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


290
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,240


291
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,620
it's uh let's see how far are we anybody got a countdown calendar going how many more minutes

292
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,920
till the end of the world no i didn't think so nobody really even seems to be paying attention

293
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,840
i think everybody is kind of suspecting the same things that i'm kind of expecting

294
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:22,020
which is uh we got sold out you know i mean we really we really kind of got screwed you know we

295
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:30,840
were told saucers 1998 they make up all these excuses that seem to justify you know the absence

296
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:40,020
of saucers but the simple truth is the saucers seem to have passed us by

297
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,820
there are some people who are not going to be able to get to the bottom of this

298
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:41,820


299
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,720
people after after uh 1998 that came to stang and they were i think really upset about that

300
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,580
and uh and and and a lot of those people a lot of people didn't come back actually uh which is fine

301
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,020
because really maybe those are the people that got ruptured they got uh you know they got taken

302
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,400
away because if there's one thing that we really don't need here in the church of the subgenius

303
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,480
it's a true believer

304
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,200
you

305
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,220
, i mean you know we don't really need any uh

306
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,780
i mean we don't really need any true unbelievers either because i mean belief and disbelief both

307
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,400
mean pretty much the same thing you no longer are accepting new ideas about a certain issue

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,660
and uh

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,960
so so what what i'm what i'm seeing here is that uh that that something special has been given to

310
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,820
those people that lost faith you know those people have been given to those people who have lost faith

311
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,780
and they're given a gift is a gift called suspicion and disbelief you know anytime any of those people

312
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,420
that have walked away from the church of the subgenius anytime they go to another another

313
00:15:53,420 --> 00:16:00,260
religion or another spirituality or another another form of self-indulgent uh you know

314
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,900
self-gratification that we like to think of as religion but it's just really justification for

315
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,800
our actions anytime somebody goes somewhere else to find a place to live in a place of self-gratification

316
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,660
they're going to find something else somewhere inside their mind they're going to be thinking

317
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:24,680
they're going to be thinking is this just another scam is this just somebody else making money off of

318
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:32,540
me is somebody else getting rich off of me just like just like when i gave all that money to the

319
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:40,000
church of the subgenius those people have been given a gift it's called disbelief you know the

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,800
conspiracy pays you when you're a believer you're a believer you're a believer you're a believer you're a believer

321
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,500
well probably i mean compared to how well the church of the subgenius pays you uh i've i have

322
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,620
worked for both and i can tell you that the conspiracy pays you real well to do work that

323
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:01,860
is guaranteed to be forgettable that's what it's all about and so you you're faced with the problem

324
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,000
of do you want the pay or do you want to do the work that is useful and will be remembered and uh

325
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,640
friends what we'd really like

326
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,860
to do is you know neither one why why why do we have to do either one bob said we should be rich

327
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:25,260
without equally rich without working boy that would be fair wouldn't it wouldn't that be so

328
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,420
fair if everybody was equally rich without working well friends you have to make that choice are you

329
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:40,240
enough of a subgenius to to declare july 5th monday normally a working day as your

330
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,780
religiously

331
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,940

you're in this right blues why do you have to stash them under the toilet they're all taggy

352
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,540
i can't even take a shower

353
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,780
Spit them out! Come on! Some of that's for an actual emergency!

354
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,960
Let me go! I don't want to live anymore!

355
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,700
Get your head out!

356
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,260
Oh, damn!

357
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,560
No! Get out!

358
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,660
Oh, man!

359
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,860
Oh, what gives? Does Freaky Friday fall on a Monday this year?

360
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,540
This post-X Day Suicide Blues thing is my shtick!

361
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Bite me!

362
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:31,360
What fools we were to think that we would get to go on some divine killing spree and crush all the pink boys with our alien powers.

363
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,660
We believed Stang.

364
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,500
Stang?

365
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,740
We did believe Stang.

366
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,580
That's what he said. I bought into it.

367
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,380
I bought into it. I sent in my money.

368
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,040
Well, so you really bought into it. Like, literally.

369
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,400
The only kind of bot that counts, baby.

370
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,180
Alright, baby.

371
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,180
Not to Bob. We were young, dumb, and full of...

372
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,000
Fun.

373
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:57,820
Yeah, that's what we were. We were bright-eyed, and I can't spoil the end. You all know what happened.

374
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,080
What do you think?

375
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,660
But about, just listen in, in about ten minutes before X Day, we actually started alibying.

376
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:14,940
Alright, fine. Yes, I'm a little bitter. Yes, I understand that the conspiracy made the calendar. And it's not 2003. Who knows what year it is? It could be 1005.

377
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
Well, how do we know they got July 5th right?

378
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,140
And X Day could be at any second. I'm aware of that.

379
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,060
Does Ted Man make an appearance on the telephone during the show?

380
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,720
Of course he does. Of course he does.

381
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,500
Oh, that's wonderful. I don't think you people have enough Ted Man in your lives.

382
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,800
He has a... He's calling us from the observatory.

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,140
Right. Oh, he sees the alien who wants to be his friend, and I think they have sex.

384
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,160
I believe they do.

385
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:34,840
Oh, that's wonderful.

386
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,100
And there's some people who got some science guys, but hey, you're gonna hear it.

387
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,400
This show has been stalinized for quality.

388
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,720
WCSB, you're on the air.

389
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,780
I got lost on the way to the station.

390
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,620
You got lost on the way to the station?

391
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,860
Oh, no, that's right. We already did that show.

392
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
Yeah, you already did that show, man.

393
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,800
Only we didn't get to do that show, but we did that other show.

394
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,720
We need help on X-Air for it, because I'm stumbling.

395
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,400
We got lost in the station.

396
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,720
We got lost on the way to Planet X, man.

397
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,220
The tables say we'll turn around. Planet X will soon be found.

398
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
How could you get in a place... How could you get lost in a place so plainly, so clearly formatted?

399
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,100
Right in front of you, the holograms are everywhere.

400
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,020
If you get lost, all you have to do is wave your fingers in front of your eyes.

401
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,440
Bobby's no there yet, he passed.

402
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,100
Pink boys, they're all aghast.

403
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,980
Yeah.

404
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,060
He's the slack man.

405
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,640
That's why their armpits are so hot.

406
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,680
It's so sad that when you...

407
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,820
You expect to be ruptured and evaporated up into the escape vessel,

408
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,880
but it doesn't happen for another year, so you go home,

409
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,240
and in spite, you start up your lawnmower and rupture your grass.

410
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:50,920
If I had a million little grass souls that my excess pleasure saucer played by my lawnmower,

411
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:57,500
I'd spend all morning sucking those little souls up into that escape vessel.

412
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:57,840
Hold for a second.

413
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,160
Now they're on their way to the city dump, which will double as Planet X for them.

414
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,560
Can you guys...

415
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,860
Listen, we gotta take a break here.

416
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,440
I hope you guys hold the line for just a moment.

417
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,500
The wind breaks.

418
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,340
Alright.

419
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,420
This isn't over the edge.

420
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,580
No, but it's over the line.

421
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,280
You crossed that line.

422
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,700
Ah, man, can't we just go back to have things like they used to be?

423
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,100
Can't we all just get along?

424
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,860
That was cool back then.

425
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,420
No, we can't, man, because the world ended, man.

426
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,320
Like I heard last week, the world ended, man.

427
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
And you died, man.

428
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,440
Yeah.

429
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,080
Well, it didn't actually end.

430
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,840
We thought it was going to.

431
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,460
The big UFOs came.

432
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,440
We thought it would, but something happened and prevented it from ending.

433
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,260
No, it actually did.

434
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:47,260
We all received a mental block later, a piece of forced conditioning, which was...

435
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,000
Whenever you see this picture...

436
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,320
Ah, yes, you see this particular picture, it brings one out of the trance of oblivion.

437
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,900
What picture is that?

438
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
I can't see the monitor from over here.

439
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,680
Show it.

440
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
Is that the X-Day picture?

441
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,180
It's a stereoscopic picture of what happened.

442
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,400
I already made a CD that made a million bucks off what you guys were doing last week.

443
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,580
Wow, invasion.

444
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Invasion of Earth.

445
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,820
But it's really too late to do anything about it, so I don't even really want to get in trouble by talking about it.

446
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,440
Now, what was the other highlight of your experience at X-Day, Dr. Howell?

447
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,700
The other highlight?

448
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,980
Other than, you know...

449
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,060
The green hair.

450
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,740
The beautiful naked women.

451
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,340
Come on, man, don't step on the Rice Krispies.

452
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,820
That was just one of the many highlights, of course.

453
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,180
Don't step on the Rice Krispies thing!

454
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,800
I got it.

455
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,960
Here it comes.

456
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,820
Actually, I enjoyed the easy camaraderie of my comrades in arms in the barracks.

457
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,980
Blah, blah, blah.

458
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,720
For man must know that he hath broken his covenant,

459
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,040
and he shall soil thy loincloth with the fear of the Lord.

460
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,040


461
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,740
The fear of Jehovah, for Jehovah is the God of wrath.

462
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,500
Step away from the bowling ball.

463
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,160
I think I saw the staying person light the fuse for the end of the world.

464
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,280
Light the fuse.

465
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,920
I think I saw it.

466
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
A mulberry stalk.

467
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
That's what you say you saw.

468
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,200
Well, he bent over, and something came out of him, and then...

469
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,060
Ew!

470
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,320
And then everything started shaking, and he was running past me, away from this area.

471
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,640
That was just his psyche that came out of him.

472
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,980
Why would anyone want to leave beautiful...

473
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,220
Uh-oh, he's releasing foul gases.

474
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,400
Yeah, something like that. And then we were running.

475
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,180
Apparently, Bob came and did something to all of us.

476
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
There's Reverend Say.

477
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,040
Something did come out of him.

478
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,320
He changed us somehow.

479
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,420
Reverend Stang.

480
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,780
Ew!

481
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,400
What are you doing up so early, Reverend Stang?

482
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,600
Oh, we...

483
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,980
Somebody burned the whole campground down.

484
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,360
Oh, no.

485
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,060
Yeah, I tried to...

486
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,040
Jesus, no!

487
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,300
But we were already gone, so what difference does it make?

488
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,160
Well, I was trying to go back there for the love and peace that happens at Brushwood,

489
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,700
and that whole campground had been burned down by the...

490
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:25,920
...

491
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,480
...subgeniuses of the blast.

492
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,320
All the trees were denuded and black and ash.

493
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,560
Once again, the subgenius Bobbies have ruined everything else.

494
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, you know what that was? You guys, you didn't listen to me years ago.

495
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,280
That's what we would have called prop wash from the UFOs.

496
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,640
Those landing brakes they have just scorch everything, including the little non-normals.

497
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,040
Right, and they don't care. They're just aliens, you know.

498
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,660
They don't even see them.

499
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,720
I'm not wearing any pants.

500
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,740
Well, why would you have to?

501
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,400
Exactly.

502
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,780
In these modern times, no one needs to call themselves a cypher or a stranger.

503
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,820
Especially not on the radio.

504
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,540
Oh, tell that to my sunburn, LonesomeCowboyDade.

505
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,400
Yeah, I got a little sunburned the next day, too, actually.

506
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,320
I don't think it was the sunburn. I think it was the...

507
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,260
It wasn't the sun. It was the saucers hovering overhead.

508
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,400
And when you get in the path of that afterburner of theirs, which is a special...

509
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,380
It's a special graviton emission...

510
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,260
There's protons and stuff.

511
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,660
Well, it's got a couple different principles working in the saucer.

512
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,620
The things that keep the saucers aloft.

513
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,060
One, of course, is the graviton emission.

514
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,560
Right.

515
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,700
You can use the sunburn.

516
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,480
Well, actually, the hog is pain in the buttocks.

517
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,160
The other one, of course, is the...

518
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,000
So, if you got a saucer burn, you also got a multiple contusion going on in your skin.

519
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,560
Well, a caster pressure was showing off a sunburn in the shape of Jesus.

520
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,620
It was an anti-sunburn.

521
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,880
It was like the Jesus was formed by little spots that weren't burned.

522
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,960
It was a reverse Jesus sunburn.

523
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,660
I think it was going to a buttock.

524
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,500
The body cursing at Parleray Biker Place before you attended the festivities.

525
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,640
And that's about it, Stang.

526
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,580
I think you're kind of ruminating over what might have been.

527
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,400
But there were a lot of people who had actual saucer burn on the buttocks.

528
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,520
I mean, not...

529
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,880
In America?

530
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,680
Maybe 700.

531
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,800
That's a lot, right?

532
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,800
Well, we had a little bucket of hell and a little bucket of heaven.

533
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,100
So, you can put your feet in either one at the same time.

534
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,740
Get a bucket of heaven.

535
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,800
But, yes, after the drag...

536
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,280
What did we do after the drag king?

537
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,740
Queen.

538
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,440
The drag queen and king balls.

539
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,100
Now, weren't there a million psych-a-freak-a rock-and-roll rock-out rock bands?

540
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,040
That's right.

541
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,340
We had a great...

542
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,320
It was the Acid Corpse played...

543
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,200
I guess that was the first night of band nights.

544
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,340
But what about the Swinging Love Corpses?

545
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,240
Well, that's their name.

546
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,100
That was their name.

547
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,760
We had the Swinging Love Corpses.

548
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,260
Three members of the Swinging Love Corpses melded with four members of the...

549
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,260


550
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,320
The Amino Acids.

551
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,740
So, the Amino Acids provided the bass and the drums and the tenor.

552
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,100
I don't forget what kind of...

553
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,720
It wasn't a tenor, but it was maybe a baritone guitar that that one guy had.

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:17,220
And then we played sax and guitar and trumpet and violent things.

555
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,320
Good.

556
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,480
This is us playing more 우리 year.

557
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


558
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


559
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


560
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


561
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


562
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,480


563
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:41,760
Watch out.

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


565
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


566
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


567
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:41,760


568
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,520
See you later.

569
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,040
Bye-bye.

570
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,160


571
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:44,780
Bye-bye.

572
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:44,780


573
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,240
Somebody out the window.

574
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,740
clarity of the world, the candy, the ci****.

575
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,500
Oh, yeah.

576
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,760
Uh- basicname...

577
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:51,760


578
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:51,760


579
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,240
I don't want to be away until the week, depends...

580
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,240


581
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:10,020
This is what you'll find .

582
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,940
I said oh baby

583
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:34,080
I said oh baby

584
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,160
And then ever so gently

585
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,000
Ever so nicely

586
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,420
With so many sexual overtones

587
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,800
You looked over at me and you said

588
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,320
Baby

589
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,960
And I knew right there

590
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,340
That's when I knew

591
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,440
This is the way you said baby

592
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,860
Baby

593
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,000
Here's the way you said baby

594
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000


595
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,740
Here's the way you said baby

596
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,600
Not so much a B part

597
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,720
But a baby part

598
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,440
Here's the way you said baby

599
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Baby

600
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,960
You couldn't just say baby

601
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,080
You had to say baby

602
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,620
What is that?

603
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,720
What's that baby?

604
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,720
Boy, won't be afraid

605
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,720


606
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,060
Girl, threatened

607
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,320
You got it when you met me

608
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,900
You you was trying to start

609
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,000
Everything but a stay

610
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,820
You you now you said baby

611
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:05,820


612
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:05,840
Baby

613
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:05,840


614
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:05,840


615
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,140
With so many sexual overtones

616
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,140


617
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,820
You could only say baby

618
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,000
Cause you were trying to think

619
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


620
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


621
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


622
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


623
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


624
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


625
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,000


626
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,740
Helloerrr Home!

627
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,460
That's a little number we've been working on called Bay Bay.

628
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,940
We was on drugs.

629
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,140
It felt good.

630
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,180
So then after the Acid Corpse played,

631
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,720
and we played for an hour and 45 minutes,

632
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,020
which only seemed like 20 minutes to me.

633
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,320
It was just like being in heaven.

634
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,200
It was such great anti-music and wonderful mystery jazz

635
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,780
and great sort of like space bug surf jam stuff.

636
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,060
Space bug surf jam.

637
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,300
Come on, everybody.

638
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,460
It's going to be a surf jam.

639
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,280
So after that, let's see.

640
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,440
I guess after that, we just partied until like it was 1999,

641
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,780
until about 2 or 3.30 in the morning, 4.30 maybe,

642
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,940
and then we'd go to bed.

643
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,020
And then we would toss.

644
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,260
And then we'd toss and turn fitfully as the three most thunderous snorers.

645
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
Suicide man wants to know something.

646
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:51,380
Oh, I just wanted to know if the show was still on.

647
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,400
No, we're not on the air anymore.

648
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,200
Hey, what happened to you, suicide man?

649
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,520
Are you on drugs or something?

650
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,360
I feel a little strange here.

651
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,060
You feel a little slowed down to me.

652
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,180
Okay, concentrate on the reality we're throwing out to you.

653
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,040
All right.

654
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,600
Look out.

655
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,880
Hey, man, get out of the way.

656
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,020
You got to get out of the way.

657
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,780
Come on.

658
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,540
The reality will run you around.

659
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,560
It's like a tank.

660
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,860
Let me dust you off.

661
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
It's like a fast tank.

662
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,460
It's a fast tank with wheels instead of tracks.

663
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,640
I'm just going to tell you what.

664
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,160
Straighten up or fly right.

665
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,440
You can lead a horse to water.

666
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,380
You can't make him drink.

667
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,480
So what's your point, dude?

668
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,060
You're sitting on your point, right?

669
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:36,960
You're sitting.

670
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
You're sitting on it right now.

671
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,140
Admit it.

672
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,620
We were just discussing a strange fellow who claimed to have died,

673
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,360
but is still alive to plague us today.

674
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,280
You have never seen such sights.

675
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,360
Your heart has never felt such emotion,

676
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,080
such sorrow, such joy.

677
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,040
You will be uplifted.

678
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,760
And never have you seen such freaks of nature.

679
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:16,040
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

680
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,020
Come and see.

681
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:27,140
See little Feodor and Hvaluska.

682
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:27,840
Ah!

683
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh!

684
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,500
Oh!

685
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,200
Oh!

686
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,940
Oh!

687
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,420
Oh!

688
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,520
Oh!

689
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:32,600
Oh!

690
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,240
Oh!

691
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:36,480
Oh!

692
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:36,620
Ah!

693
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:36,940


694
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:36,940


695
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:36,940


696
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,280
I just sit here watching squirrels.

697
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,440
They have much more fun than me.

698
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,060
Sometimes they run around all day in circles.

699
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,360
They bite and squabble, then they lick their wounds.

700
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,680
At least they seem to have a purpose.

701
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,260
My mind's always clogged with leaves,

702
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,940
like silly, stupid advertising jingles,

703
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,460
and themes from TV shows I do not like.

704
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
I must not go out the front door

705
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,600
I could get hit by a car

706
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,120
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling

707
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,280
There's perfect safety high up in the tree

708
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,080
I know I'm bad to just sit here

709
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,220
I should not be so afraid

710
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,620
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction

711
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,940
It might be the wrong one,

712
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,300
so I'll stay here.

713
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,760
They tell me of self-improvement

714
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,100
And someday could even have a job.

715
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:30,920
Then all right, I'll stay here.

716
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:30,920


717
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:34,620
I would have become just like the squirrels.

718
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't see how I could accomplish that.

719
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,160
First, I'd have to choose a direction,

720
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,840
like which tree I should start to climb.

721
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,400
They all seem to be up to the challenge.

722
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,600
I just take whatever's given me.

723
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it.

724
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:14,860


725
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:14,860


726
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:14,860


727
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,800
So I'm okay here just watching squirrels,

728
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,800
though the soundtrack could be much improved.

729
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,820
Those silly, stupid advertising jingles,

730
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,880
and themes from TV shows I do not like.

731
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:45,660
But it wouldn't hurt to get into the elseworld,

732
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:45,660


733
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:45,840
I

734
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:45,840


735
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,260
Schicksal still my favorite.

736
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,240
My name's Dan Gleger.

737
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm from the Philadelphia, Texas,

738
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,220
you can find me on Twitter.

739
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,480
I dressed up, and it's not easy to remember me.

740
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,840
You know there are times I think about my救 mortee.

741
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,160
Wah wah wah wah wah!

742
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,220
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!

743
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,860
Brr!

744
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,860
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!

745
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:13,800
Wah!

746
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,820
You know, haha, I like him.

747
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,060
He's silly.

748
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,740
Ah!

749
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,080
The audience doesn't think that's very funny.

750
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,920
I mean, they do think that's very funny.

751
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,700
They're laughing their heads off.

752
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,040
Look, they love it.

753
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,860
Old rape a man.

754
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,680
Old rape a man.

755
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:57,660
See, I know people that say it's impossible and completely antithetical to the concept to think that a man could be raped.

756
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,480
That he wouldn't do it willingly.

757
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,660
But he would do it happily and enjoyingly.

758
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,620
Joyfully celebrating the...

759
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,360
This is the effect of X-Day, folks.

760
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,580
This is what happens to the mind once it's brainwashed.

761
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,680
Yes, thank you, thank you.

762
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,540
Once you spend your entire time in the bachelor's cabin with a crude, raucous joke.

763
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,940
What?

764
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,660
We did manage to spend some time at the Frop, at Dr. Frop's, uh...

765
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,860
We used to just call it...

766
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,060
Oh, so yeah, what was the entertainment like?

767
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,040
We just called it Frop's Place.

768
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,040
Oh, what about all the bands that play?

769
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,100
Well, there was the amino...

770
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,960
The amino...

771
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,060
The amino acids.

Blood doorway to financial heaven!

778
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,360
He is the one real shortcut to slack!

779
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,560
But the amino acids were actually almost uh, shut, you know not shut down.

780
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,140
And there was little Theodore.

781
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
Really? Oh, great.

782
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,920
Yeah, little Theodore was there.

783
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,820
So why were they almost shut down?

784
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,440
Why would they pretend shut down?

785
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,640
Oh, I was just saying they were almost blown away

786
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,280
by the band the previous night.

787
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,580
They were blown away.

788
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,300
The jam band kicked,

789
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,140
literally kicked the posteriors

790
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,080
of all the individual subs in their family.

791
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,140
Boy, were they sore.

792
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,680
Was it with a big leather boot?

793
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,340
With a big leather boot with red straps.

794
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,100
Big leather hobnail boot with red straps.

795
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,080
Well, now, would you like to say

796
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,580
for our listening audience

797
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,240
just who were some of the famous subgeniuses

798
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,040
present at this earth-shaking event?

799
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,740
Well, let's see.

800
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,620
We did have...

801
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,960
Well, we had you. You were there.

802
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,720
Well, you're right. I was there.

803
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,140
And not only that,

804
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,180
I think I saw Reverend Two Beans there.

805
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,540
Yeah, Two Beans was there.

806
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,220
Let's see, who else was there?

807
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,640
There was Doc Frop.

808
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,880
And Dr. Pissall.

809
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,440
Dr. Pissall.

810
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,580
Dr. Pissall.

811
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,440
Yes, Sister Decadence.

812
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,040
Magdalene and Jesus, of course.

813
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,640
Yes, and thousands and thousands

814
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,340
of other famous and semi-famous...

815
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,380
Where did all these bobbies come from?

816
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,180
And yet to be famous.

817
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,860
That's what he's talking about.

818
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,640
I think all the grapes.

819
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Bob Toberfest.

820
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,060
What they do is they cut their hair

821
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,660
and then dye their heads purple.

822
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,960
Having something to do with

823
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,360
attracting the sun for Bob.

824
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,920
Hey, I think that's a good idea, Reverend Howell.

825
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,120
Maybe we should have a Bob Toberfest.

826
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,660
Uh, yeah.

827
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,740
I get it.

828
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,720
Bob Toberfest.

829
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:02,900
Would you come, caller?

830
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,420
That'd be awesome.

831
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,000
Can we have some beer there?

832
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,760
Would you come, caller?

833
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,840
We could find...

834
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,340
Could you bring some women?

835
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,460
Yeah.

836
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,620
Okay, good.

837
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,520
Sounds like you have a lot there.

838
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,480
You know, they're like smaller versions of us.

839
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,720
Okay, what notes do we play on this song?

840
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,880
Okay, this is Betty Blows.

841
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,800
Betty Blows, part one.

842
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,140
This is a little symphony

843
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,880
we've been working on for a while.

844
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:31,920

For his appearance is so marred

899
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,060
Nond human semblance

900
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,220
And his form beyond that

901
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,460
Of the sons of man

902
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,020
And his form beyond that

903
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,720
Those who are over men

904
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,480
Who have followed my almighty word

905
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,640
Shall be the minister of the angelic host

906
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,600
They shall speak for them

907
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,080
And my prophet who smiles

908
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,760
Shall be among them

909
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,740
And shall advise them

910
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,340
Well I'm sorry to have to call you on a normal phone

911
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,980
From somewhere else on earth

912
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,600
And I'm sorry that you're there on earth to call

913
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,120
Yeah how does it look from up there?

914
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,740
I'm sorry Bob let us down

915
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,020
I'm sorry okay I'm sorry

916
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,020


917
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,180
I'm sorry yeah but you get to be on the ship

918
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,520
You don't have to be sorry

919
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,180
We're gonna do it again next year

920
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,280
Hey by the way were you number one in line

921
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,740
Like your ticket says every year at the gate

922
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,180
Um I'm number one in line

923
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,480
No actually we use a double

924
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,620
Because I'm the one filming the line

925
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,300
So technically

926
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,160
There's always a sacred filmer

927
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,120
And they always think that the sacred filmer

928
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,060
Is not really an artist

929
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,840
That's right I don't recognize it

930
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,340
It's both a blessing and a liability

931
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,280
Have you looked at any of the footage yet?

932
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,600
Yes yes and the

933
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,160
The bashing of the Christ

934
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,780
Not to be confused with the

935
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,760
Mashing of the Christ by Negative Land

936
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,040
But our

937
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,840
Our competition for their short

938
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,400
Subject should be

939
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,540
Should really look good

940
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,700
We got plenty of footage we really hurt Jesus

941
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,120
Bad

942
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,180
Did you kill him like Holy George?

943
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,600
He's still alive being a Merovingian

944
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,100
And we so

945
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,700
Basically everything that way is great

946
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,400
For next year we'll have another Jesus

947
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,420
The campground will grow back

948
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,620
The pagans will

949
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,140
Recuperate and the subgeniuses

950
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,560
Will return everything they've stolen

951
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,320
Once again

952
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,120
Wow is the little fake Bob okay?

953
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,420
Yeah that's the funny thing this was the

954
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,800
X day when the thieves

955
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,620
Returned what they had stolen

956
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:36,660
Great

957
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,060
And asked me to thank them

958
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,080
Oh thank you for

959
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,180
Doing that for three years

960
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,420
That is a strange phenomenon isn't it

961
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,320
But the thing is back where you are on that planet

962
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,320
They return them

963
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,060
Here they just keep them forever

964
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,860
And gloat in their living rooms with their two friends

965
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,240
Yes yes

966
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,480
We all know about that

967
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:56,780
Music

968
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,200
Music

969
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,400
Music

970
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,540
Ghosts and ghouls and

971
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,440
Wearing black

972
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,460
The cross

973
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,880
On no one there

974
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,900
To come back

975
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,360
Music

976
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,480
Eternal

977
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Glimmerful

978
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
Pristine

979
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,660
Slash

980
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,920
I've looked at death

981
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,660
This way

982
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,220
Music

983
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,880
Now it's just

984
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,700
A boring

985
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,400
Pain

986
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,580
You get all stiff

987
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,680
You've lost

988
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,760
The game

989
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,620
And to think it's your

990
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,660
Best chance

991
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:56,440
When it does ya no damn good I've looked at death from both sides now

992
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:08,380
From cool and gloomy and still somehow It's death's illusions I recall

993
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,820
I really don't know death

994
00:51:38,380 --> 00:52:08,360
I really don't know death

995
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,900
I really don't know death

996
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:54,980
I really don't know death

997
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,260
I really don't know death

998
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,760
I really don't know death

999
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:38,360
I really don't know death

1000
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,660
I really don't know death

1001
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:38,360
I really don't know death

1002
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,360
I really don't know death

1003
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:23,300
I really don't know death

1004
00:56:40,660 --> 00:57:08,360
I really don't know death

1005
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,100
I really don't know death

1006
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,980
I really don't know death

1007
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,140
I really don't know

1008
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:11,800
Why don't you, Doug?

1009
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,020
Why don't you, Doug?

1010
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,180
Why don't you, Doug?

1011
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,180
Why don't you, Doug?

1012
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:38,340
Why don't you, Doug?

1013
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,100
Dog of Soggett said at about 6 and the Merc is moving up.

1014
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,460
It's weird.

1015
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:51,340
Well, the Merc is moving in and as you know, it's getting closer to that time in the schedule

1016
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,840
when puzzling evidence has to shut the special Captain Fox and say...

1017
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,240
How does America handle a headache?

1018
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,580
I'm proud to be on a Mercantile.

1019
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,420
Well, that's true.

1020
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:03,800
And so are we all.

1021
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:10,020
Well, as we stand on that spotty flag after our long history and our climb up from the

1022
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,920
primordial ooze to our present eminence as prominent American subgeniuses...

1023
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,560
Yeah, I'm going back to the ooze, man.

1024
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,980
You should go back to bed.

1025
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,180
You're going to go up to your special chamber and...

1026
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,100
My oozing bag.

1027
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,160
I'm going to climb back in my oozing bag and go back to sleep.

1028
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,620
Good night, Dr. Stang.

1029
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,720
Kill them all.

1030
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,080
Let Bob sort them out.

1031
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:38,100
For in his sorting is not the high E-pollution.

1032
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,680
That's the most arbitrary of judges.

1033
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,000
Oh, my.

1034
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,740
So here are the engines of the oncoming ships.

1035
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,620
Finally, they're landing.

1036
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,340
No.

1037
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:51,900
Oh, no.

1038
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,800
That was another...

1039
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,180
Another drill.

1040
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,000
Damn.

1041
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,180
Well, we'll certainly have luck.

1042
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,940
You know the drill.

1043
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,080
Christ, Bob.

1044
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:03,640
Hello.

1045
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,680
Is Bob Dobbs there?

1046
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,620
I'm the little guy who lives in the corner.

1047
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,640
Bob Dobbs, you there?

1048
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,760
Hello?

1049
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,860
Oh, you bastard.

1050
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,740
I'm going to kill you one day.

1051
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,960
