1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,020
Let mortal combat begin!

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,900
Yeah, let's go. Let's do it, man.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,960
A handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,560
You got it.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,020
Exactly.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,200
Maybe.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,320
No statement, Your Honor.

8
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,480
No Bob Dobbs.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,100
Your Honor!

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,600
Yes, of course. No Dobbs.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:39,980
This is the most clean and detailed probe that we've ever done.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,600
If you're listening this morning, you'll be amazed at the very orderly procedure

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,180
that's been done.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,720
This is the first time I've ever seen a book in this case.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,660
As has been dressed by the officer in the background.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,180
Well, thank you.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,080
And hear the tinkling of the bells, and the little sub-deenies have the conversation about what to do.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,740
Well, maybe we should do the maintenance work on the show this morning.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,780
Very good.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,780
Yeah, let's take the show apart.

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,500
Okay, here we go.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,400
Put it back together, have it all be real clean and everything.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,180
Here's some alcohol.

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,500
Okay.

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,020
Now open the hatch here.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,180
Don't forget the Q-tip.

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,660
Well, maybe we should send Dr. Vredes down into the very, very lowest level of the station.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm not going.

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,260
I want a raise.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,740
Oh, wait.

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,180
No, everyone at this station is being fired.

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,120
Your raise is down here, Paul.

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,240
Come on, down here.

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,760
Where?

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,040
Way down here.

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,800
There, Paul.

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,320
I don't see it.

38
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,440
Hey, get down there and catch some raise.

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,740
Hey, look, you lazy jerk.

40
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,980
Just climb down this ladder.

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,080
I'm not going.

42
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,520
You're not paying me enough.

43
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,440
And neither could your tape recorders, but that's all right, because the blinking lights

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,560
will just have to wait for now.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,160
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,760
It's the subliminal messages which make it worth listening to this show now or at any

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,200
other time.

48
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:46,180
This tape is meant for entertainment purposes only, to satisfy emotional and sexual needs.

49
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:54,320
Any attempt to act as I do on this tape in public may be dangerous, and neither I or

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,440
the order of Dionysus Sabazios can be held responsible.

51
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Our sick, prudish, Puritan society, which tries to limit sexual expression such as perversion

52
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,120
and intergenerational love, such as between teenagers and older adults, is just not ready

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,380
for a tape like this.

54
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:22,720
This is 1995 Christian era, 30th year Anno Satanas by the Church of Satan timetable.

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,440
As I said, it may be dangerous to act as I'm about to on this tape, particularly at parties

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,520
where alcohol and drugs are consumed, especially if those people doing such were abused as

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,440
kids, sexually, if not physically, or perhaps both.

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,360
But if anyone uses their hard fucking life of sexual intercourse to do something, then

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,360


60
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,360


61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,620
sexual and or physical abuse as an excuse to be an asshole and try to censor verbal

62
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,240
expression and acting out of sexual fantasies, they deserve just one fucking thing.

63
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,540
And if anyone gets pissed at what I'm saying here, or the way I act on this tape, I really

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,480
don't fucking care.

65
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,060
Although in a way I do, for this is how the world should be.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
Because I'm a Christian.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm a sadistic pervert.

68
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,740
Nobody messes with a sadistic pervert.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,600
How can you talk like that here in the air?

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,380
I don't know.

71
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,900
These poor people don't know about this stuff.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,760
I thought we were in this band.

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,840
Yeah, but you can't even...

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
Uh, yes, uh, maybe now would be a good time to say something about the band.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,780
This was when we used to be fighting.

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,480
They're all interested, all agog, to hear about the band and the wonderful new world

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,400
that it produces.

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,000
Uh, feels good, doesn't it?

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,740
Here we go.

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,460
You fools, both of you!

81
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,280
You're being used, don't you see?

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,540
Amy, take a break.

83
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,600
You worked hard on this story.

84
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,320
Heck, you broke it for us, but it's past your buying Smith here's taking up the slack.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,840
Oh, you want slack?

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,520
I'll give you slack.

87
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,640
The Subgenius Hour of Slack.

88
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,140
Heavy!

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,160
High car!

90
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,520
High drum!

91
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,340
Heavy, get in.

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


94
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


98
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


99
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


100
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


101
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


102
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


104
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


105
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


106
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


107
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


108
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,340


109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm on it.

110
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,300
Hardcore, man.

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:44,380
I'm on it.

112
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,400
I'm on it.

113
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm on it.

114
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,160
Good.

115
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920
Afraid so, boys.

116
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,860
These days, perversion gets a bum rap because it's being given a bad name by all the amateurs.

117
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:59,020
If you want to get the highbrow lowdown on all the subterranean hijinks going on in the so-called real world you have to live in every day,

118
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,780
turn to us, the experts, the unchained reverends of the subgenius hour of slack.

119
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,260
Wouldn't you like to teleport your debtors into limbo,

120
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,160
smooth out the wrinkles in your brain that contain all your childhood phobias,

121
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,680
and learn how to make your car run on sheer gall?

122
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,860
Well, sure you would.

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
And who, tell me who, is in a better position to do that than the brighter than bright J.R. Bob Dobbs

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,080
and his glow-in-the-dark henchman, that most unspeakable Reverend Ivan Stang?

125
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Why, no one but you, after you've been exposed to an industrial storage tank full of the subgenius hour of slack.

126
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,260
This is the fun house.

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,500
The sound of the drill going into my head was the last thing I heard without the echo.

128
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,580
And this weird music in my head.

129
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,340
The licking worms escaping me.

130
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,300
My head.

131
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,440
My head always hurts.

132
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,100
Thanks, Bob.

133
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,040
My head always hurts.

134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,420
Thanks, Bob.

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,540
This music is horrible.

136
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,900
Louder! Louder!

137
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,220
More! More! More!

138
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:09,780
Thanks, Bob.

139
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,720
There's a huge chasm between blazing truth and outright lies,

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,640
and you can learn to breakdance on the rope that stretches between them

141
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,500
by listening to this song.

142
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:17,500


143
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,620
And now, to the subgenius hour of slack.

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,560
You may have to get older, but you don't have to grow up.

145
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,400
Why, just look at what it's done for us.

146
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,380
Unimaginable wealth, girls, flying saucers, and the best hip replacements money can buy.

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,200
Swap your oxygen bottle for some nitrous oxide and praise Bob.

148
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,420
Nurse! Nurse!

149
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,440
Ah!

150
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,020
Some material contained on this tape may not be suitable for children.

151
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,340
Some material contained on this tape may not be suitable at all.

152
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,100
Do not waste time blocking your ears.

153
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,940
Do not waste time seeking a soundproof shelter.

154
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Give up.

155
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,780
Give up.

156
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,080
Give up.

157
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,980
Subgenius is stupid.

158
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
Communism is good.

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,820
Hmm.

160
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,100
Mortal Kombat.

161
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
It has begun.

162
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:37,980
It has begun.

163
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,980
Oh, Bob.

164
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,720
Oh.

165
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
Turn on.

166
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Tune in.

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Why do you want to be normal?

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,300
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

169
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,140
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

170
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,840
Oh.

171
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,120
Next days are coming.

172
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,060
And the peaks are coming.

173
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,820
Ah!

174
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,820
Next days are coming.

175
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,980
And the peaks are coming.

176
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,900
Ah!

177
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,280
Ah!

178
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,180
Sure, when the rupture hits,

179
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,440
we'll all be in our first-class window seats.

180
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,820
The pleasure saucers watching the little pink boys fry.

181
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,440
Turn on.

182
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
Tune in.

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,180
And...

184
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,320
You certainly don't want to trick people.

185
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,460
Next days are coming.

186
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,820
And the peaks are coming.

187
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:58,880
Ah!

188
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,080
Ah!

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,580
Ah!

190
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,000
Ah!

191
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,360
Ah!

192
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

193
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,780
And, of course,

194
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,940
I want more slack.

195
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,600
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.

196
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,040
But what I really want...

197
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,660
Ah!

198
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,500
Ah!

199
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,020
Oh, yeah, that's right.

200
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,240
Ah!

201
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.

202
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,000
Ah!

203
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,200
Ah!

204
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,420
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,780
Ah!

206
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,440
Ah!

207
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,760
Ah!

208
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, yeah.

209
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,400
Ah!

210
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,060
Ah!

211
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,960
Ah!

212
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
Oh, I love to be naked.

213
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,680
Ah!

214
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Ah!

215
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:37,880


216
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,780
Ah!

217
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,480
Ah!

218
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,800
Ah!

219
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Ah!

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,740
Oh, fuck.

221
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,120
Ah!

222
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,600
Ah!

223
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,080
Ah!

224
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,500
Turn on.

225
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,200
Tune in.

226
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,340
And...

227
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,780
Ah!

228
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,480
Ah!

229
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,660
Ah!

230
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
X Days Are Coming

231
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,460
And the peaks are coming

232
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,800
Ah!

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,320

We're back! We're back! We're back from the great 1996 Slack Crusade tour.

282
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,560
Ah, yes. And your dear prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

283
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,860
I've been preaching and driving and selling food!

284
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,200
Friends and... But, but...

285
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,040
Listen to this in the background.

286
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,340
Ah, yes.

287
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,220
This is the soundtrack theme music from the subgenius video Arise,

288
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:45,040
played live by DK Jones and Huge Voodoo at the Wetlands Club in New York

289
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,280
as part of the Slack Crusade.

290
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,380
God, what a crusade it was, friends!

291
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,660
And as I say, we have so many tapes, but before I go on into that,

292
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,320
what else can I... I'll stick on some Cosmic Factory back here.

293
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,380
I had to share this bit of news with you folks.

294
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,980
This is something from the Dallas Morning News,

295
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,760
and it probably won't make national news,

296
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,440
but it says here, from Oklahoma City,

297
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:24,220
a bill to ban bear wrestling in Oklahoma bars passed the state senate on Tuesday

298
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,080
after it was amended to stiffen the penalty against spousal abuse.

299
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,120
Now,

300
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,020
get this, friends.

301
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,060
Under the bill sent to the House,

302
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,300
abusing a spouse on the first offense would still carry a lighter penalty than wrestling a bear.

303
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,220
The bill would make bear wrestling a misdemeanor,

304
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,640
with a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $5,000 fine.

305
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,580
Uh, Representative Penny Williams, Democrat Tulsa,

306
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,140
offered an amendment providing for a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine

307
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,700
for abusing a current or former spouse.

308
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,240
So, in Oklahoma City, if you get caught wrestling with abusing a bear,

309
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,220
you're gonna have to pay five grand.

310
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,260
But if you get caught just wrestling, you know, abusing your spouse, that's $2,000.

311
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:25,420
Did you know that in this country today, over 4,000 women are abused by their husbands every day?

312
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,060
To me, that's a sign of the end.

313
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,720
But, at the same time, friends, that many up-

314
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,980
Well, anyway, let's move back, yes.

315
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,560
Yes, we, cuz we did, friends.

316
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,300
We did it.

317
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,200
We-

318
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,240
We did it!

319
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,960
We proved that we could minister to the masses, to the lost masses out there,

320
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,520
nine cities in a row in the bitterest dead of winter, and make money.

321
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,460
Using?

322
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,100
Using!

323
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:09,280
Using only a minivan, a portable pulpit, a giant picture of Bob, a fistful of grim determination, and a Joe tape.

324
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,180
We'll be sharing the Joe tape with you, dear friends, whether you like it or not.

325
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,840
But that ain't all we used.

326
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,100
Friends, we also used all the little people who got in our ways.

327
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,640
Yes, the little people.

328
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:35,460
We finally caught on, you know, that if you act like big, obnoxious stars, you get treated like big, obnoxious stars.

329
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,780
Praise Bob.

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,620
Because I'm the type of person who does what I say I'm going to do.

331
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,520
That's what's different between me and all the other people in this town.

332
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,600
I do what I say I'm going to do.

333
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,520
Oh, sure, the inspiration was gone years ago.

334
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,460
We're selling surreal humor product.

335
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,340
You think I'm going to give up the free vacation?

336
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,100
You think I'm going to give up the Adelaide?

337
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,240
That's above all.

338
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,960
You ask that's why.

339
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,200
Crank out some product.

340
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,720
Hip surreal product.

341
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
I'm not going to let this thing die.

342
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,720
Are you crazy?

343
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,620
Duh, I'm not stupid.

344
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,680
Remember showbiz rule number two, Doug.

345
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,460
The pants should be so tight they could do the show without you.

346
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,060
Don't ever touch my hair, okay?

347
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,180
I just want you to remember that one thing.

348
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,820
Don't ever touch my hair.

349
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,540
Because my talent.

350
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Is an incredible burden that I have to carry with me every day.

351
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

352
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,460
And we had to carry that burden every day.

353
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
From city to city.

354
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,320
Oh, what did we do?

355
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,200
What did we do for Bob?

356
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,740
Oh, Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, St.

357
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,800
Louis, Cleveland, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, New York, Boston.

358
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,880
And we got the groupies friends.

359
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,380
And we got the anti groupies and the sub groupies and the reporters and books.

360
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,900
And we got the TV appearances and the stolen props and the dead batteries.

361
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,440
And the parties where you throw TV sets into swimming pools.

362
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,580
And catered meals backstage.

363
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,180
And sickness.

364
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,860
And the bad directions.

365
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,560
And the sickness.

366
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,480
And the sleazy promoters.

367
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,040
And the cold.

368
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,140
And the sickness.

369
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
And friends, but we survived because we had our own sleazy promoter.

370
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,180
Yes, the Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God himself, dear friends,

371
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:30,720
is now the promoter of the Church of the Subgenius on the road on our snake oil type tours.

372
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,140
It seems he was reborn on Earth in the early 70s.

373
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:43,140
And yes, he is now working for the Subgenius Foundation as tour manager and sleazy promoter.

374
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:51,180
The Messiah came back, took one look around and got him a job working for J.R.

375
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,760
Bob Dobbs, my friend.

376
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,320
He was born in the mid-1980s.

377
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,320


378
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,880
You might have heard of Bob Dobbs in Rolling Stone, People, The Washington Post or on MTV.

379
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,420
He is the inspiration behind a couple of alternative guys who call themselves the Church of the Subgenius.

380
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:14,300
This church started in Dallas, Texas, which is often called the buckle on the Bible belt.

381
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,860
All we're trying to do is unbuckle the Bible belt.

382
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
We offer something that no other religion offers.

383
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,960
Eternal salvation or triple salvation.

384
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:22,960


385
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,160
We're trying to do something that no other religion offers. Eternal salvation or triple salvation.

386
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,440
We're trying to do something that no other religion offers.

387
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:23,440


388
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,900
Instead of bringing your money back, he does not really care about your sins.

389
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,980
He comes rather to justify your sins, to rationalize your sins, my friend.

390
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,780
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.

391
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,420
If you come to a Subgenius Devival, you will be preached the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

392
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,180
He will give you hints as to how you can find slack in your own life,

393
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,400
but mostly what we're trying to do is give people a pep, well we're trying to get thirty dollars out.

394
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,500
Praise Bob. Better than Swaggart.

395
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,160
This is the Subgenius Devival.

396
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,820
the warm-up act for a church of the subgenius. They're called Circus Apocalypse. Other stunts

397
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,540
include escaping from a straitjacket and sewing their mouths shut. Boy, entertainment. You

398
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,900
can see both tomorrow night at Ground Zero in Minneapolis.

399
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,120
Brother Cleve Duncan here.

400
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,120
Ah, yes, look at this. It's gospel now.

401
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,120
I don't believe I've heard a praise bomb yet.

402
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh! Come on, sound off like you've got a pair out there.

403
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,820
Praise bomb!

404
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,420
Praise bomb!

405
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,940
Praise bomb!

406
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,100
Praise bomb!

407
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
Who needs bomb anyway?

408
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,860
Okay, let's open your hearts, close your minds, unzip your lips, pull out your wallet, and

409
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,400
bend over.

410
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,260
Because here comes the word.

411
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,660
Look, look, look, look.

412
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,400
Oh, yeah.

413
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,080
Let's see now. Friends, before we get started, I want to outlaw you all to join me if you

414
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,140
need to.

415
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,600
I don't want you to be inhibited or anything about this. I'm not using you to kiss each

416
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,780
other or nothing. But there's this traditional thing we've always started to be bottles off

417
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:08,080
ever since the old days of the tabernacle in Dallas, Texas. If you all could just close

418
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,820
your eyes and bow your heads and all commune together in a solemn moment of sacred...

419
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,580
Big noise!

420
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,680
Big noise!

421
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,480
Big noise!

422
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,380
Big noise!

423
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
Big noise!

424
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,400
Big noise!

425
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:21,560


426
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:21,720
Big noise!

427
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,540
Big noise!

428
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:22,960


429
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,080


430
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,080


431
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,080


432
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,660
Big noise!

433
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:24,860
Big noise!

434
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,880
Oh, he doesn't care. He really does not care. Before I get started, friends, how many dearly

435
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,020
beloved Christians do we have in this audience? Just raise your hands. Don't be afraid. I

436
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,300
didn't think so. Let me see. Well, maybe one or two. Well, you'll love it. How many people

437
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:51,200
here consider themselves to be some form of weirdos? Raise your hand. Okay, a little bit

438
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,740
more now.

439
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,140
A little bit more now. This is one that usually can't be seen. A little bit more now. A little

440
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,260
tells the tale. How many people here are real drug addicts of some kind? Raise your hand.

441
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,440
These are the end times, friends. Oh, and most important of all, are there any millionaires

442
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:14,960
here tonight? No? So there's got to be one millionaire somewhere. You're saved. You are

443
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,280
saved already. You can go home. Well, friends, you know, the fundamentalist, how shall I

444
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,560
put this? The fundamentalist ends seem to think that there should be a bit more religion

445
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:36,400
in this country. And have we got a religion for them, dear friends? The Church of the

446
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:45,360
Subgenius. God's answer to fundamentalism. Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

447
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,640
Now, you know what? Like most churches have a hell of a lot of rules.

448
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,600
And in this case, we've only got one, folks. One simple rule. I'm going to tell you what it is.

449
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,680
If they can't take a joke.

450
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,000
Beautiful, beautiful thing. And by the same token, you know, all the other churches have a hell of a lot of sins.

451
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:22,260
We only consider one thing a sin in this church, friends, and that is the sin of the church.

452
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,760
Serving the conspiracy. The conspiracy of the whole people. Well, actually, there is one other sin.

453
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,940
That's the sin of not sending in that $30 membership check for Bob. But we'll leave that up to you.

454
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, for that matter, there's 365 sins listed in Revelation. This book, Revelation. Thanks for your

455
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,900
prayer. All of them committed by myself. I can explain those to you after the show, I suppose.

456
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,060
But before I go any further, there's a little.

457
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,380
Ritual we have to do.

458
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,380
Oh, yes, dear friends. Little rituals and little doggies here in the radio station.

459
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,200
And yes, so that's what one of those devivals sounded like.

460
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,840
At least that one had Brother Cleve Duncan on the holy keyboards there.

461
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,160
And isn't that just amazing and lovely?

462
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,820
I wanted to share with you some of the sort of music that we listened to as we drove from town to town.

463
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,180
Across this great nation of ours.

464
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,360
Oh, this is us.

465
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,660
We tore up all of our swindle sheets and left them sitting on the scales.

466
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,720
By the time we hit that shy town, them bears was getting smart.

467
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,060
They'd brought up some reinforcements from the Illinois National Guard.

468
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,960
There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps and rigs of every size.

469
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,180
Yeah, them chicken coops was full of bears and choppers filled the skies.

470
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,380
Well, we shot the line. We went for broke with a thousand screaming trucks.

471
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,100
And 11 long hair.

472
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,440
And friends of Jesus in a chartreuse microbus.

473
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,700
A rubber duck to a sodbuster.

474
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,740
Come on there, you have 10-4 sodbuster.

475
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,980
Listen, you want to put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey?

476
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,060
Yeah, he's hauling dynamite and he needs all the help he can get.

477
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,020
Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey Shore and prepared to cross the line.

478
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,180
I could see the bridge was lined with bears, but it didn't have a doggone dime.

479
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,520
I says, pig pen, this here's a rubber duck.

480
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,240
We just ain't going to pay no toll.

481
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,440
So we crashed the gate doing 98.

482
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,260
I says, let's go.

483
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,260


484
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,260


485
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,820
Let them truckers roll 10-4.

486
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,520
Oh, yeah, that was us, dear friends.

487
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
Whoa, there we fell.

488
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,180
Now we're all falling apart here in the radio station.

489
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,400
There's no loop.

490
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,360
Well, anyway, friends.

491
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,160
When we weren't listening to C.W. McCall there, we were listening to Johnny Cash or the Joe

492
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,680
tape.

493
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,740
Now, the Joe tape was given to Jesus at his old bookstore in Cleveland by the maker of

494
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,260
the Joe tape, Joe himself.

495
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,500
And we listened to this tape all the way through at least once a day.

496
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,960
It got to where you couldn't tell who was talking in our little van full of preachers

497
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,040
because we all got to where we talked.

498
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,980
Like Joe.

499
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,220
Those are my rapist noises.

500
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:45,520
You see, it sounds like I'm just whistling a tuneless whistle, but the really means that's

501
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,400
the sound of the sperm coming out when a guy's raping a chick.

502
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,600
Now.

503
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,820
You're going to be subjected to a song that I made up.

504
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,480
Horny with a chick.

505
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,580
Horny with a chick.

506
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,520
Horny, horny, horny horn.

507
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,760
Horny with a chick.

508
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,100
I'm too sick to get the horny with a chick.

509
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,260
Horny with a chick.

510
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,300
Horny, horny, horny horn.

511
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:21,640
Horny.

512
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,540
With a chick.

513
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,780
Ha, horny with two chicks.

514
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,100
Horny with two chicks.

515
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,900
Horny, horny, horny horn.

516
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,240
Horny with two chicks.

517
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,580
I am too sick to get a horny with two chicks.

518
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,020
Horny with two chicks.

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,800
Horny, horny, horny horn.

Horny with.

521
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,080
Two chicks.

522
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,160
Horney, when a chick walks by, Orny, when a chick walks by,

523
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,540
Horny, horny, horny horn, Horny, when a chick walks by,

Horny, horny, horny horn, Horny, in your socks

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,960
I am too shocked to be a horny in my socks.

Horny in my socks.

528
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,060
Horny a horny horny horn.

Horny in my socks.

530
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,640
I'm gonna force you in the bed with me.

531
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,340
Horny with two dykes.

532
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
Horny a with two dykes.

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm too spiked to get a horny with two dykes.

Horny a with two dykes.

537
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,800
Horny a horny horny horn.

538
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,360
Horny with two dykes.

539
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,740
Horny a with two bleachings.

540
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,320
Horny a with two dykes.

541
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,320


542
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:13,320


543
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,600
with two punk chicks.

544
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,220
Horny, oh horny, horny horn.

545
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,940
Horny, oh with two punk chicks.

546
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,600
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

547
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,780
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

548
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,000
Horny, oh horny, horny horn.

549
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,100
Horny with a pregnant chick on roller skates.

550
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,560
How do you get horny in your socks, you wonder?

551
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,800
Well, maybe I'll just have to demonstrate to all of you

552
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,360
someday.

553
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,160
See, this one time I had an itch in my foot inside my socks,

554
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
and that's how I came up with the idea of horny in your socks.

555
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,520
I eat lots of horny with a chick food.

556
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
It gives me energy to get horny.

557
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,040
Yes, friends, it's an amazing, amazing tape there.

558
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,760
Joe Offrecht, yes, that's what we listen to once a day,

559
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,560
at least, the entire tape.

560
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,780
And you may wonder why.

561
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
You know, I mean, we don't think

562
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,900
rape is funny.

563
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,220
You know, we certainly don't condone the activities of Joe Offrecht

564
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,660
of the Temple of Dionysus of Basio.

565
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,140
But let me tell you something.

566
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,100
Tomorrow morning, you're going to wake up singing that song to yourself.

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,980
Horny with two chicks.

568
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,700
Horny with two chicks.

569
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,800
You're going to, you are, you're going to wake up singing that.

570
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,080
And you'll play that tape for your friends, and they'll wake up singing it.

571
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,080
And the next thing you know,

572
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,760
it won't be praise Bob anymore.

573
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
It won't be praise Jesus.

574
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,620
It won't be praise, it'll be praise Joe.

575
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,060
That's all it's going to be.

576
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,920
So we're just, I'm sorry if the Church of the Subgenius was the first group to bring

577
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,160
you Joe Offrecht, to unleash Joe upon the world.

578
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,020
I'm sorry, but you know, we have a mission to bring you the highest in high weirdness.

579
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,760
And the Joe Offrecht, the Joe tape is the highest high weirdness we've run into.

580
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,900
And quite some time.

581
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,140
Thank you.

582
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,340
You weak, pathetic fools.

583
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,960
I've come for your souls.

584
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,800
I don't think so.

585
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,080
Excellent.

586
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,840
Kano.

587
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,660
Little Gang.

588
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,140
Raiden.

589
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,180
Johnny Cage.

590
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,800
Scorpion.

591
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,580
Sub Zero.

592
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,100
Sonya.

593
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,620
And...

594
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,040
I'm sorry.

595
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm sorry.

596
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,640
I'm sorry.

597
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm sorry.

598
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm sorry.

599
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:40,680


600
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:40,740
I'm sorry.

601
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


602
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


603
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


604
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


605
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


606
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


607
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


608
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


609
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:40,740


610
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,240
One day about four or five years ago, we was sitting at the conical station.

611
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,460
Kicking tires, and swatting flies, and discussing the State of the Union.

612
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,760
Went right out in front of the Baptist Church, come a big old purple school bus.

613
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,120
Had astrological signs upon it, and 35 hippies and dogs inside.

614
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,820
About half of them went for the courthouse lawn, and them dogs commenced on the fire

615
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,060
plug.

616
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,320
Rest of them set there, staring at us.

617
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,160
And I says, Roy, go get your flit, Gunn.

618
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,520
He says, which is the hippies and which is the dogs?

619
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,080
I says, beats the hell out of me, Roy.

620
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,620
What there was was a bunch of them crispy critters,

621
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,020
and the leader was a space cadet.

622
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,380
And he says, Sagittarius, we has arrived.

623
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,380
Prepare to disembark, man.

624
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,520
Get the incense going in the sitar.

625
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,300
We gonna camp in the city park, man.

626
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,060
I says, boys, let me explain the situation to you.

627
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,360
A, you're getting me down.

628
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,900
And B, we got us a leash law here,

629
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,480
and C, you in the wrong town.

630
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,900
You drop one string of beads in that there park,

631
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,520
and you're gonna see a whole lot of stars.

632
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,360
You got 15 seconds to get out of town, boys,

633
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,600
or we gonna blow you to Mars.

634
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,160
Well, they all got back in the purple bus

635
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,780
and proceeded to the city limits.

636
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,400
Then the telephone rang.

637
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,320
It was a swimming pool.

638
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,060
It says a mess of wild critters was in it.

639
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,400
So we all got into Mars' Plymouth,

640
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,940
which is always at the conical station,

641
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,420
went flashing on down to the swimming pool

642
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,780
to give them critters a citation.

643
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,720
By the time we arrived, it was too damn late.

644
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,540
Them critters had all had their pants down.

645
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,800
Them dogs was tearing the bathhouse apart,

646
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,740
and they was after the fish,

647
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,160
and the fish,

648
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,520
and the fish, gratuitously,

649
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,520


650
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:08,520


651
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,900
I says, Roy, you get the one in the silver T-shirt,

652
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,120
and I'll get the rest with a net.

653
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,520
We're gonna have a jail

654
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,840
full of naked krispy critters

655
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,280
and a drip-dried space cadet.

656
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,140
Come here.

657
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,140
All right seriously,

658
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:33,440
we got the fun and the fun,

659
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,740
and fun and fun,

660
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,640
Well, we gave them hell, but we lost the war

661
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,260
because them critters outnumbered us.

662
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,660
So they moved in and set up camp

663
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,360
and they lived in that purple school bus.

664
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Six weeks later, there was nothing in town

665
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,480
but 84 dogs in the head shop

666
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,020
selling dried-up weeds and sunflower seeds

667
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,500
and astrological postcards.

668
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,600
The critters took over the city council

669
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,540
and the dogs all barked their brains out.

670
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,900
And the whole damn town was crispy critters

671
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,440
and the mayor was a space cadet.

672
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,540
In the far future, no one will have tools.

673
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,620
Things will be better then,

674
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,480
and the band that dare not speak its name

675
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,840
will be your musical leader.

676
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,920
In the 90s.

677
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,180
So just stay tuned for about eight more years.

678
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,360
Fellow travelers and sycophants.

679
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,580
I think I've got a flat.

680
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,360
Somebody dropped the whole city and broke it.

681
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,940
Well, we'll just have to put it back together

682
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,780
before the end of the show.

683
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,940
We've got students to do that, actually.

684
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,460
Oh, okay.

685
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,920
Let's start gluing, guys.

686
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
Well, here you can see we're gluing back

687
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,140
the Temple of the Sun.

688
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,120
We have the ancient temple of the three windows,

689
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,060
the royal mausoleum, the outlooks,

690
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,700
and the look view down into the thundering Europe

691
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,760
of the river Vologi.

692
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,780
But what about all the starving children on Mars?

693
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,200
Hmm.

694
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,500
Let them eat dogs.

695
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,060
And we're so proud.

696
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,400
What kind of drugs do they do on Mars?

697
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,220
The whole station is puffing up with pride.

698
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:12,820
They don't do drugs.

699
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,900
They have hats that they wear

700
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,580
that release enzymes through their skull,

701
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,760
and it actually mingles with your particular body chemistry

702
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,240
and gives you the trip you need.

703
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,800
Do they have slack on Mars?

704
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,220
Do they have slack on Mars?

705
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,800
Oh, boy, do they have slack on Mars?

706
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,220
Come on.

707
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,320
Slack on Mars!

708
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,060
I eat lots of horny with a chick food.

709
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,080
It gives me energy to get horny with a chick on.

710
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:37,780
Always.

711
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,980
Be careful what you drink and how you mix your drinks,

712
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,840
because if you're not careful,

713
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,620
you'll throw up all of your horny with a chick food,

714
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,280
and then you won't have energy to get horny with a chick on.

715
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,120
They look inward,

716
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,720
but there's nothing to see.

717
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,280
You can't see your own eyes.

718
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,860
You can't hear your own...

719
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,220
Your own ears.

720
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,540
You can't run from your own feet.

721
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,620
You can't spank your own booty.

722
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,340
Can't swallow your own throat.

723
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,000
You can't think about your own brain.

724
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,420
Don't do it, kid.

725
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,840
It's fuzzy. It's fuzzy.

726
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,580
I can't think about my own brain.

727
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,520
You can't rip off your own chainer.

728
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,400
It's a vague feeling.

729
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,880
It's a very, very vague feeling.

730
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,940
It's a very hazy. It's a fuzzy.

731
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,520
Fuzzy.

732
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,340
Fuzzy.

733
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:40,600


734
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,280
Fuzzy.

735
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,340


736
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,000
Fuzzy.

737
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,220
Yeah, ever since I got this hole in my skull,

738
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,080
my vision has been great,

739
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,160
but God, my hearing.

740
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,660
It's like I hear these little bongo noises

741
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,800
and squeaks and ghost violins.

742
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,960
It's confusing.

743
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
It's disorienting.

744
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,560
It's disconcerting.

745
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,220
It's disconcerting.

746
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,940
It makes me nauseous.

747
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,820
The room's spinning again.

748
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,340
It makes me nauseous.

749
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,900
The room's spinning again.

750
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm getting...

751
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm getting...

752
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,040
Oh, God, I need more, Bob! Make it go away!

753
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,240
Make me come down, Bob!

754
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:12,660
Ah!

755
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,660
Step aside, Earth fools!

756
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,820
It is I, Jehovah One,

757
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,380
the evil alien space god from a corporate thin galaxy!

758
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,720
Bow down and pray to me,

759
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,140
or I will threaten you with stories of a hell!

760
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,280
They're not bowing down.

761
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,140
They're just bending over.

762
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,660
But this isn't hell. This is some genius hell, isn't it?

763
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,140
No, we took you to hell,

764
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,940
and then we took you and set you adrift in outer space,

765
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,780
but now we're going to drag you through the Internet.

766
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,640
You're going to surf the digital sewers.

767
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,480
From now on, Dave,

768
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,040
here, we'll just enter him in.

769
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,800
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

770
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,920
That's the subject.

771
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,440
Let me see.

772
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,720
And this is coming from...

773
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,860
Sub-G-Stang-1 at AOL.com.

774
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,240
Okay.

775
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,180
Date, 22 November 1963.

776
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,620
And we'll put him in the location,

777
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,960
Triple Underpass Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas.

778
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,140
And...

779
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,440
As soon as I hit exit, off he'll go.

780
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,140
Oh, no, not exit. That'll erase him.

781
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,780
Return, that's it.

782
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,580
I'm learning all this Internet.

783
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,020
I'm a cyber surfer now.

784
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,980
Okay, now we're going to send Dave to Dealey Plaza.

785
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,400
Let's go.

786
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,500
What? Wait, wait, what?

787
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,360
Wait, wait, what?

788
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,340
Oh, it didn't work.

789
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,320
Oh, it says the modem's at the wrong speed.

790
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,460
It's 96,100 baud instead of 24.

791
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,520
I paid 89...

792
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,020
I will hit the little button that starts the song.

793
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,780
I will destroy you.

794
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,660
I will destroy you.

795
00:38:53,580 --> 00:39:01,740
I will destroy you.

796
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:10,340
It says that now is the time to find my way

797
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,080
To the top, not stop.

798
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,120
It's all in a game

799
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,840
That I cannot win.

800
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,600
Come again.

801
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,480
The battle for the mind of North America

802
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,140
will be fought in the video ring.

803
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,980
The television screen.

804
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,940
The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye.

805
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,740
Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain.

806
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,280
Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen

807
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,980
emerges as raw experience for those who watch it.

808
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,980
Therefore, television is reality.

809
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,280
And reality is less than television.

810
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,760
Watching TV

811
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,380
In the middle of the afternoon

812
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,480
It waits

813
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Our truth

814
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,200
The one who tells us all

815
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,080
About the good

816
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,180
About the bad

817
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,700
And all the things in between

818
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,580
Monkey see

819
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,500
Monkey do

820
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,520
It's all from you

821
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,900
It's from you, buddy

822
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,240
Techno

823
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,560
Techno

824
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,520
For now

825
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,580
I waste my life

826
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,080
Watching that screen

827
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,920
Techno

828
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,940
For now

829
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,400
Techno

830
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,900
For now

831
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:14,940
I think that my CDs make my life sound crystal clear

832
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:22,060
No hiss, no pop, no static fills my ears

833
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:29,600
You change the channels and turn my world upside down

834
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,780
I sleep through the day

835
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,740
I walk the streets at night

836
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,520
Techno

837
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,120
For now

838
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,240
Techno

839
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,920
For now

840
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,980
I waste my life

841
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,420
Watching that screen

842
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,660
Techno

843
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,440
For now

844
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,580
Techno

845
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,340
For now

846
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:10,680
To catch up with the strands ofết

847
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:10,940
Techno

848
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,320
Mine in front of you

849
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,320


850
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,320


851
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:11,440
For enough psychologists

852
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,440


853
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:11,940
Without a die

854
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:11,940


855
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:11,940


856
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,060
Instead of my dad

857
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,060


858
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,060


859
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,060


860
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,280
You turn the world upside down

861
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,280


862
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,660
I will forged just

863
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,480
He's five years old

864
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,140
Not worth it

865
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,320
So who is Landry您

866
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,640
We'll be right back.

867
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,220
Ah, yes, dear friends, Indian Rope Burn, there and here.

868
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,280
Ah.

869
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,940
Yes, Indian Rope Burn, one of the bands that was on the tour some of the time.

870
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,280
In fact, everything that I've been playing tonight on this show is, in some way,

871
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,060
it's fallout from the Slack Crusade tours.

872
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,140
What have we been playing here?

873
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,940
Going back in time.

874
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,100
Going back in time, of course, the Joe Offric tape.

875
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,260
What?

876
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,600
Yes, and some KPFA.

877
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,340
Well, listen to that.

878
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,300
That's the first track.

879
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,980
Another one from the runners called Hirosaki.

880
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,080
Amazing to hear the live versions of these songs.

881
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,260
These are old subgenius background tunes.

882
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,900
This one's Hirosaki by D.K. Jones, performed by D.K. Jones.

883
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,720
Huge boot.

884
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,520
And we've been playing KPFA.

885
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,420
Well, KPFA, they weren't part of the tour.

886
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,060
Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell, Glass Madness, Geary Brofram, Paul Manbrini.

887
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:17,120
But, yes, Joe Offric and the Channel 9 news report from Minneapolis.

888
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,060
That was an interesting little piece of pinkness there.

889
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,100
Not to mention Bill Miller.

890
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,840
Everything we're going to play in the next few shows, I think,

891
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,920
is going to be from that self-sabotage.

892
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,540
Same live tour of preaching.

893
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,320
Man, it was tent show divivals, and we wowed them.

894
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,380
We broke a leg.

895
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,500
We ate glass.

896
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,820
Breathed fire.

897
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,520
Smashed stuff.

898
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,740
Launched heads.

899
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,360
Hammered screwdrivers into our skulls.

900
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,960
And healed the lame and the impotent.

901
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,060
Dear friends.

902
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,840
Well, actually, I didn't do any of that, but we collectively did.

903
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,040
Dr. Legume and Circus Apocalypse actually did most of that.

904
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,960
And all I did was preach.

905
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,860
And garner bad reviews by PC-somethings and city newspapers.

906
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,940
And we drew all of our stalkers out of the woodwork, friends.

907
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:15,120
We may not have made our goal of one million new souls by July 96 yet.

908
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,040
But, dear friends, as St. Janer Hypercletes preached in Chicago,

909
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,220
sure, the Church of the Subgenius may not actually be able to save the world,

910
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,940
but it can still save the world.

911
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:27,940


912
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:33,160
And it can still irritate the hell out of lots and lots of people.

913
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,440
Here's the Moonpants song.

914
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,320
Mooney, mooney, moonpants.

915
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,400
Ejaculating your moonpants.

916
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,100
That didn't come out right.

917
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,140
Mooney, mooney, moonpants.

918
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,700
Ejaculating your moonpants.

919
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,400
What are moonpants?

920
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,360
Pants like the astronauts wore to the moon.

921
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,040
Now it's time for a little commercial.

922
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,160
Do you suffer from the up against the underwear syndrome?

923
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:15,980
You know, where after an ejaculation, your, uh, your, where your flesh sticks to your underwear?

924
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:23,100
Well, get Acme anti-stick, and you won't suffer from up against the underwear syndrome anymore.

925
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,540
Up against the under-wear.

926
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,160
Up against the under-wear.

927
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,600
Up against the under-wear.

928
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,960
That, by the way, was not a real commercial.

929
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,200
That is a satire.

930
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

931
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,080
First, we'll have a short word from the following song.

932
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,880
Look, how many people here are Hour of Slack listeners?

933
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,640
All right, good, yeah, praise WFMU.

934
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,320
You've got to be damn glad that you have WFMU.

935
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,360
I live in a city that no longer has a station even remotely like that.

936
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,560
I have to do the show in my house.

937
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,960
Um, and I won't go into the reasons for that.

938
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,840
Yeah, you want to get personal about it?

939
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,620
Okay, friends, uh, for those of you who are Hour of Slack listeners have heard, uh,

940
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,200
Father Joe Mama, also known as Papa Joe Mama.

941
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,560
And, well, hell, this show tonight is practically like an Hour of Slack Live, in a way,

942
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,140
except that you never get Circus Apocalypse on Hour of Slack because your radio would burn down.

943
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,580
So, um, well, friends, I don't know what else to say.

944
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,420
Some people, when they run, when they see Father Joe Mama, they think,

945
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,200
the church and the subgenius has turned fascist.

946
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,880
Praise Bob! We're taking fascism back for the people!

947
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,060
Fascism for the people!

948
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,060


949
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,700
People, man!

950
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,000
For Joe Mama!

951
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,060
Praise Bob.

952
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,300
Hello, friends, and welcome.

953
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,440
You know, after seeing that inspirational, I don't want to call it an act because it wasn't an act,

954
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,040
that inspirational ritual, that divine ritual from Circus Apocalypse,

955
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,200
I can only feel that the,

956
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,020
the only appropriate sermon tonight,

957
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,560
has to be entitled,

958
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,200
The Privilege of Pain.

959
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,640
Ah!

960
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:31,300
Ah!

961
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,420
Ah!

962
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,080
Because, you know, there's a lot of subgenius out there,

963
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,500
who are beginning to sound like the pinks and normals,

964
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,360
who pollute our planet.

965
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,820
You know the ones I mean.

966
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,640
The soft, fat, comfy folks.

967
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,220
They get all in a tizzy, unless everything is just so.

968
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,060
They can't have any soap!

969
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,460
They can't have any stress!

970
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,480
They can't change their routine!

971
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,340
They can't sleep at night!

972
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,660
If there's so much as a single pee underneath their mattress.

973
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,940
Everything's got to be perfect and in place.

974
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,540
The temperature can't be too hot, and it can't be too cold either.

975
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,800
Their cars have to feature the pulled-out blinds to block the sunlight, so they don't have to squint.

976
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,120
They have to drink bottled water, because the tasteless, odorless water from the tap

977
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,580
isn't tasteless enough, or odorless enough.

978
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,340
These are the anal animals that infest our planet,

979
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,260
and waste our air, and use up our resources,

980
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,380
and then have the gall to turn to us and say,

981
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,560
Oh gee, I don't know what you're bitching about.

982
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,180
If you've got a problem, why don't you do something about it?

983
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,180
Oh, we'll do something about it, all right.

984
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:49,720
Only they may be a little surprised how improving our lives

985
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,160
reduces the quality of theirs.

986
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:03,200
You see, we subgenies haven't wandered across this pink desert of so-called culture

987
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,680
without learning a few things.

988
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,860
Chief amongst our discoveries was the answer to the ancient Tibetan riddle.

989
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:19,860
Is it better to live a wonderful life and die a horrible, excruciating death,

990
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:25,300
or is it better to live a horrible, excruciating life,

991
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,680
but have a wonderful death?

992
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,640
Now, pinks always select the first choice,

993
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,980
because instant gratification is a genetic flaw of their race.

994
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:45,420
These creatures are bred by the conspiracy for the dual purpose of labor and consumption.

995
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,840
They are meant to spend every last penny of their life

996
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:49,840


997
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,720
to support other pinks who are doing the same thing.

998
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,680
Now, when they can't do any more work, what do you think happens to them?

999
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:07,000
They wither up and die to make more room for other, newer conspiracy dupes

1000
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,240
to begin the cycle anew.

1001
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,800
It is the closest thing to perpetual motion ever defined by man.

1002
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:19,520
It is perfect in every way, except for one flaw.

1003
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:28,720
One tiny little error in the millions and millions of lines of conspiracy computer code.

1004
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,000
One little bug that will bring the entire system down crashing.

1005
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,120
And that fly in the ointment, my friend, is Bob.

1006
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,220
J.R. Bob Dobbs and his legions of subgenius maggots.

1007
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,400
We're not team players, friends.

1008
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,300
No, we're team attackers.

1009
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,340
Yes, indeed.

1010
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,460
Because like the gadfly, we pester the workhorse.

1011
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,120
Buzz around and land just behind the ear to inject our poison.

1012
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,380
Oh, it steams. It hurts.

1013
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,940
Don't you worry about that.

1014
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,440
They want to break away from the plowing and run off galloping.

1015
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:14,120
A few of them do because they're too scared.

1016
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,000
But every once in a while, one or two does.

1017
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,280
And that leaves the conspiracy masters empty-handed.

1018
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,740
And we all know how they resist picking up a shovel and doing anything to their own lily-white hands, don't we?

1019
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:35,380
Because the only people more adverse to pain and suffering than the Peaks is your conspiracy overlords.

1020
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,100
Yes, dear friends, they can dish out the work, but they can never take it.

1021
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,120
They feel it's beneath them because they know a little secret that you and I have always suspected.

1022
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:54,280
They know that the real purpose of work is simply to wear down the little people so that they can be controlled.

1023
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,640
Meanwhile, the subgenius continues to fly free.

1024
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,700
Ours is not a life of luxury or privileged difference.

1025
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,940
Make no mistake about that.

1026
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,520
It is a life of inconvenience and downright poverty.

1027
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,820
But it is a natural poverty.

1028
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,100
A poverty enjoyed by the poor.

1029
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,940
Enjoyed by every living creature on God's sweet Earth who is not caged by the conspiracy.

1030
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,800
Because the best things in life are indeed free.

1031
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:32,700
We may be left out in the cold when it rains, but we are free to frolic in the sunshine every other day of the year, aren't we?

1032
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,620
Unlike the Peek ones trapped in their little cubicle offices.

1033
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:42,920
Thus we enjoy a dignity and self-determination unknown to the creatures of captivity.

1034
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:50,240
But the most important perk we possess, dear friends, is the privilege of pain.

1035
00:53:50,620 --> 00:54:00,120
Because every time, every time we cut our finger, stub our toe, or decaptate our heads during a head-launching ritual,

1036
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:07,500
we experience a little preview of the pain and suffering that the Peeks will enjoy our next day.

1037
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,180
It is the taste of a bitter cup from which the Peeks will drown.

1038
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,220
And the taste of a bitter cup from which the Peeks will drown.

1039
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:23,880
Back in the days of segregation, it might interest you to know that the Reverend Jesse Jackson used to spit in the food of the white people.

1040
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,720
We're doing the same thing, philosophically speaking.

1041
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,720
Only our spit is more spite than spit.

1042
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,780
Yes, it won't go down as easy as Jesse's. No siree.

1043
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,080
And it won't stay down as easy either.

1044
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,980
But you can rest assured, dear friends,

1045
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,180
the Peeks will gag on the bile that we cough up for their last supper.

1046
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,220
Yet eat it they shall, each and every chunk.

1047
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,980
And you want to know why?

1048
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,000
Why?

1049
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,020
Because deep down, they want to be punished.

1050
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,740
Deep down they know that they are guilty.

1051
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,980
Guilty as sin.

1052
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,980
Sin against themselves.

1053
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,160
Sin against their fellow man.

1054
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,460
And sin against Bob.

1055
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,260
Give me a praise Bob.

1056
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,280
Praise Bob.

1057
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:28,680
Now some subgenius critics like to label us a vindictive church.

1058
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,020
Vindictive?

1059
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,820
Makes it sound like we're the ones that are evil or cruel.

1060
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,740
We are. We are.

1061
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:45,240
For centuries the conspiracy has raped our minds, murdered our spirits, and stolen our slack.

1062
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:53,320
And yet, the moment we want to give them just a taste of their own medicine, suddenly we're the ones being cruel.

1063
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,360
No sir, I don't believe that and I don't believe you believe that either.

1064
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,360
Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

1065
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,700
I bet the Nazis think the Jews are vindictive

1066
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,460
for hunting them down and hanging them 50 years after the war.

1067
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,500
There's always some hypocrite out there who's going to wring their hands and say,

1068
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,000
Well, aren't they being a meanie?

1069
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,140
I've got news for you friends.

1070
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:29,940
If they really, truly want to empathize with the enemy, perhaps they should share in the punishment instead of whining from the safety of the sidelines.

1071
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:30,600
Yeah!

1072
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,560
Me?

1073
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,800
Me, I think we're pretty generous.

1074
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,420
Why sure.

1075
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,840
We're allowing the collaborators to continue their comfy lifestyle upholding the status quo.

1076
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,600
We're letting them live out their lives of luxury at our expense.

1077
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,760
And all we're asking in return is a little bit of justice in the end times.

1078
00:56:51,640 --> 00:57:01,280
A chance for them to experience the pain that we feel every day of our lives, concentrated into, just say, the last final moments of their own.

1079
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,200
Now, how can anyone call that unfair?

1080
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:12,480
The irony is, dear friends, the irony is, we do this out of love.

1081
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,780
Because we seek justice not for ourselves, but for them.

1082
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,440
So that they may be saved.

1083
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:28,640
To provide them penance so that they may redeem themselves in false sight.

1084
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,900
And do you want to know why, dear friends?

1085
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,440
Why? Why?

1086
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,840
I'm glad you asked that.

1087
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,580
The reason why is very simple.

1088
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,100
Because salvation from Bob is not a right, my friends.

1089
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,340
It is a privilege, a privilege of pain!

1090
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,500
Here it is the word of our praise, Bob!

1091
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,160
Amen!

1092
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,520
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

1093
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,240
Amen!

1094
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,760
Oh yes, dear friends. Father Joe, Mama caught live.

1095
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,140
At the Wetlands Club in New York City.

1096
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,120
An amazing spectacle, a great preaching there.

1097
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,240
The privilege of pain.

1098
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,080
Truly, truly one of the all time great Papa Joe Mama sermons.

1099
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,360
And friends, we're coming up near the end of the show.

1100
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,260
And it's time for me to give you the sacred box office number.

1101
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,000
To write for free information about this mighty church of the subgenius.

1102
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,040
And I want you to get that pencil out right now.

1103
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,560
Okay.

1104
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,200
Read it.

1105
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:31,960
Alright.

1106
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:38,400
I want you to write that little request for free information to Bob.

1107
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,060
Yes, that's spelled B-O-B.

1108
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:47,560
Just address that to Bob at post office box 140306.

1109
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:55,300
That's box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1110
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:58,560
Yes, once again, that zip code is 75214.

1111
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:07,160
In fact, I'd be tempted to tell you to just write to Bob at 752140406.

1112
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,580
And it would get to him.

1113
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,460
Yes, it'd get to him.

1114
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,820
And we can get back to you the information on what you've been listening to.

1115
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,360
And what you're going to listen to.

1116
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,140
You're going to hear, next week you're going to hear more preaching from the D-Vivals.

1117
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,680
More music mixes by the same people who were providing music at the D-Vivals.

1118
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,460
And more, oh tonight we've been playing a little bit of the ESO radio.

1119
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:34,880
Which I was guesting on with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz from WCSB in Cleveland.

1120
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,160
We've been listening to the subgenius show from Berkley.

1121
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:42,160
Which is the KPFA show with Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell and Gary Brogfran.

1122
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,560
Old tapes of that show.

1123
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:44,620
Old tapes.

1124
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:48,720
We've been listening to the live D-Vival tapes from the Slack Crusade tour.

1125
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,500
With all the great preachers.

1126
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,680
Myself being the greatest of all the greatest great preachers.

1127
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,520
And the King of Slack, Bill Miller.

1128
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,220
As well as the King of...

1129
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,500
Fascism.

1130
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,340
Father Joe Mama.

1131
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,160
The band Indian Rope Burn.

1132
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,160
The great old Lost Rogue subgenius C.W. McCall.

1133
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,660
And Jane or Hyperclean.

1134
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,460
There's little clips of that.

1135
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,140
By God we've been hearing everything.

1136
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,880
And Joe.

1137
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,420
Yes, praise.

1138
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,340
Or damn.

1139
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:18,660
Joe.

1140
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:28,540

1141
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,560

And my God, I've known Joe since I was a baby when I was a small baby.

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:48,840
He and aussi as a oppressor at the game club.

01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:48,840
