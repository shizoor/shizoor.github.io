Excuse me.
Yes, well now, had you been alive at 3am on the 3rd of autumn and switched on your wireless, you would have heard this.
It wasn't much of a program, was it?
If you had tuned in at 9 o'clock, you would have heard...
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.
Excuse me.
I don't like what he's doing, Pat, I don't like it.
We ought to have a meeting about it.

down the pike and you'd best be ready to swim in it.
Now, tonight's hour of slack, number 215, is going to be a real good old-fashioned black-eyed
pea-eating, Bible-thumping, hoo-ah-down in celebration of Bob's eardrums as well as the
New Year.
In fact, it's not really even New Year's in Texas right now as I say this, but as you
listen now.
Now, it isn't the New Year right now, not unless you're listening in Texas where it's
New Year's Eve.
In fact, it's always New Year's Eve for everybody except me since I'm not actually in the studio
tonight.
I'm at home pre-editing this show yesterday because I don't want to go into work on New
Year's Eve.
I want to party and I suggest you do too.
And with that in mind, for that matter, we don't even know who you are.
So instead of preaching the words, the words of Bob tonight, we're just going to play
music.
But not just any music, nay, but the music of noise and sound effects and like driving
head-on into a plate glass window at 90 miles an hour with Doctors for Bob turned up all
the way.
And you're broke, Fran.
Brand car stereo.
Okay.
Oh, just some party sound.
It's, Bob will be in there because Bob will be the pleasure and the pain that your eardrums
feel.
It's what you might call Dob's house music.
And unless you're listening in your car, I suggest that if you possibly can, listen to
this show.
This is a subgenius radio ministry that is designed strictly for the pleasure of starting
from the outer ear in to where the nerve centers for both ears meet a small pocket of flesh
brain tissue, which will in fact, if you use the headphones or listen on good stereo separated
speakers, shall be able to hear you.
Be ripped in pain by the music.
Because what's coming up is an ear raping tidal surge of slack full noise music.
And Dob's league chaos.
And you need the headphones for protection in case the sound waves splash too hard against
the inner ear.
Okay.
It's a tape edited show.
There's no one in the studio and you can't call us.
And we don't even care about your prayers.
We're not taking them because we're out partying.
But do not worry if the show appears to make no sense or to make no mention of Bob because
if it did make sense, it would not be of Bob.
Indeed, though this is not very explanatory hour of slack, I do think that it will nevertheless
be.
In fact, it's the first time in my life that he has become one of the most cherished by
our group and my e-pop JR Bob Dobs himself.
The logrin and push in andÎãà and Bob and the sake exciting to enjoy √Ä large and

Synthesizer bass on track three.

Oh, you won't want to miss this, Arnie.
It reminds me of my school days in England.
You know, I don't want to miss this.

You have to be awfully cruel to be kind.
I'm a modern man, you will agree.

Once upon a time there was a little girl called Little Red Riding Hood.
She lived in a small village on the edge of the forest.
She was a little, stupid goat.
And her father raped her.
And she raped her four times a week.
But she was innocent and pious.
And she loved her parents very much.
She had sun-dressed hair, eyes like olives, and a upper-body that was unimaginable.
Every Sunday she would go out with her grandmother.
She would wear

Well, I'm sure I'm forgetting something,
but what you've been listening to,
has been the soundtrack of Baron Munchausen, of course, Roger Rabbit.
And what's been tying all the little bits and pieces together
are the sound effects music of Negative Land,
specifically off of Negative Land, a Big Ten 8 Place album.
There were bits by the Gyuto Monks,
some Russian Cathedral liturgical songs,
stuff from the Plunder Phonics material from Mystery Tapes,
that was the Michael Jackson dab piece,
DK Jones, Byron Werner,
and bits from a whole lot of albums that we've been getting in from Wax Tracks Records.
Clips from the bands Pankow, La Muerte, KMFDM, Young Gods,
Mark Mothersbaugh, well, that was ours, not Wax Tracks,
Weatherman, and Mussolini Headkick.
You can!
Of course.
