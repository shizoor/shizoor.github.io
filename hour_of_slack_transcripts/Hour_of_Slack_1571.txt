And no one but me
I'm not giving a chance
I am a cry
I am sad
Would you mind if we do that inside?
Please.
He lo-lo-ve-s me.
...Even survive.
Leaving me lon-le-s still.
Your ... supply will never drop off, don't you understand?
Did you ever read about a frog who dreamed of being a king?
When they became one?
It's too hideous.
But except for the names, a few other changes if you talk about me.
The story is the same one.

I've got an emptiness deep inside.
And I've tried it won't let me go.
Do you understand?
I'm not a man who likes to swear.
But I never cared for the sound of being alone.
I am I said.
There's no one there.
And no one heard me all night.
Even the chair.
I am a cry.
I have said I.
And I have lost it again.
He will survive.
Leaving me lonely still.
I have given red corpuscles enough to fill the frigate.
Do you understand?
I'm not a man who likes to swear.
But I've tried it won't let me go.
It's too hideous.



It's too hideous.


And I've tried it won't let me go.
It's too hideous.
I have given red corpuscles enough to fill the frigate.
I am the well true good at swallowing
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll just start singing.
What kind of song?
Whoa, what's going on here?
You know, it's not all Chris, you know.
What do you mean?
Really?
What's Chris?
Oh, so nice.
All right.
And that's Chris.
Oh, my God.
Chris, what's up?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
No wiggle room.
Go.
Location.
It's time to go to the next place!
What?

You're back!
Oh my god!
I'm back!
What is that?
He doesn't know what he's doing!
This is so unique!
I'm getting hooked on this!
I'm back!
Oh, yes, dear friends.
And welcome to our Slack number 1,571.
That's how many we've done since 1995.
1995, and what we just heard was Rural War Room, the strange, strange band from Little Rock with our friend Donovan Suitt and St. Byron Warner.
And any bands that we play, I'm going to try to pronounce their name clearly because we've been asked, how do I get this stuff?
How do I pay?
How do I pay for this stuff?
One guy said, okay, you've forced me to become addicted to the Rudy Schwartz project.
How can I give him money?
Well, I can't tell you because a lot of these folks don't do their own fulfillment, nor is their stuff exactly for sale.
All I can say is use your internet and Google them.
Rural War Room.
Did that mix?
The last 10 songs by them I've played on the show.
It was called The Modern Age.
Each one is a different version of The Modern Age from their album, The Modern Age.
Before that, there was an instrumental that was happy sounding, but crazy and kind of Zappa-esque in its weirdness level, if not style.
And that was by The Psychoskeletons, our friend Reverend Basil.
And The Psychoskeletons albums are all on SoundClick.
I think that's it.
SoundClick.
Yeah.
That horrendous cover of I Am, I Said was by the Rudy Schwartz project.
And Schwartz is spelled S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.
That's actually not really his name.
And the very first song we played, Thought Patrol, which was somewhat Devo-esque, was by a band called The Fart.
Fantastic Plastics, which we did see along with Rural War Room, come to think of it, at the last devotional held here in Cleveland by the devotees of the band Devo, I think.
Didn't Reverend Mark have a birthday recently?
And he's got a big art show opening at the MoCA.
You can go have a MoCA with Mark at the MoCA.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.






















Yes.
Yes.
Mark Mothersbaugh show.
We went to a show last night, Princess We and I did.
I don't get out much, but she does.
And we saw the band that's playing the music in the background.
We went to the Spaces Art Gallery where there was kind of a CD release party and concert for this CD called Sons of Time by Ron Slabe and Halim El Dab.
And we've played Ron Slabe's electronic music on the show in the past.
He's a regular performer at Starwood.
And friend.
And Halim El Dab is a famed composer.
That's him in the background.
Listen.
That's Halim.
That's Halim.
Halim is Egyptian.
He's a great musician.





In fact, he's a Pharaoh.
And he's not a young man.
He's, I believe he's now 3,092.
Yes.
The last time I had a long chat with him, he told me that he was one third man and one
third God.
Yes.
And he didn't tell me what the other third was.
And I presume that that was microorganisms in his...
Because we're all one third microorganisms.
We're all microorganisms in our guts.
There's a lot more of them than there are of each of us, anyway.
There's only one of me, but there's 18 billion little flora and fauna down there inside my
tummy.
Indeed.
Anyway, and even Pharaohs, I guess.
But yeah, Halim El Dab has been around forever and he inspires us all to be around forever.
His name is spelled in an unusual way, El Dab.
Sounds kind of like a name.
It's a name that's like Bob Dobbs, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
Halim El Dab.
Like we say, there's no prob with El Dab.
No prob with El Dab.
El Dab spelled backwards is still Bad-leh.
And Halim is also known to his Fremen followers as Moad Dab or the stud.
And so keep your eye out.
There's...
It's...
Oh, I was going to read what Halim said about this music.
Yes.
This is great.
Liner notes.
Liner notes.
Yeah, the liner notes in this are fabulous.
Okay.
I'm trying to delete.
The sonic expression of the album helped me discover my resonance.
I am walking, suspended in time on different spheres.
Surrounded by clouds.
Birds fly all around while I travel strange seas.
Rising and falling between the crests and troughs of the waves.
I am propelled and ejected into the newly undefined space only to be examined by an
alien intelligence who came on a silent wind in response to the ancestors' voices.
I poorly say I am quick, mark my horses with axes of anguish.
And Ron Slabe said...
... These recordings represent an oral dichotomy.
Acoustic versus electric.
Field recording versus studio.
Analog versus digital.
Ancient versus modern.
We as artists walked the thin line between the extremes, weaving in and out, as if drunk
on the paradoxical juxtapositions between them.
And while I'm going to basis已经 humble how some things of this daily routine on the

My buddy, Bhim, ArWeem, lives it.

And, yeah, pretty crazy, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now, I'm going to fade that down, although I could fade it back up again any minute,
because I have a rant to do, not by me, because I'm not, I've just got too much slack
to do these kinds of rants myself anymore.
But this is something found by Reverend, the good Reverend Roger of Tucson,
found lurking on his hard drive a year or so ago.
I've got just the perfect music for it.
The government has been screaming at me for my whole life
that crackhead Godzilla is on a business.
He's a slander and he's screwing our collective crap royally.
When I was a young man, Godzilla was a communist.
Later, he was a drug-crazed maniac.
Then, he was a madman in a turban.
Then, just a little over ten years ago, the government came out and told us the truth.
As Pogo once said, we have met the enemy and he is us.
In short, I'm now told that I am the enemy.
That if I talk about it, I'm the enemy.
If I talk about the Constitution, I should be watched closely.
If I oppose the endless wars we get in,
I'm to be put in a dossier and hassled at every opportunity.
It turns out that after all these years, I am Godzilla.
And, dear friends, you could be Godzilla too.
Yes, the government and the electorate that puts up with them is really that sick.
But, if I'm Godzilla and I don't want to go to reptile jail,
or some camp in Guantanamo Bay, or the Arctic,
oh, you didn't hear that from me,
then I'm going to have to be Godzilla in disguise.
Everything, metaphorically, of course, falls down,
catches fire, and sinks into the swamp,
and no giant lizard to be seen.
Call me the enemy, will you?
I'll give you the enemy, you swine,
and I will not rest until I've penetrated you with my gigantic dinosaur appendage.
In your ear hole!
I was content to sit by and stack up my pitiful pile of filthy lucre.
I was content to run my mouth about you bastards, but leave it at that.
I never even got off my arse about the camp x-ray thing, or even Abu Ghraib.
But as the great Saint Vince once said,
if they do it for you, they'll do it to you.
And he was, of course.
Utterly correct.
Everyone believed him, him being a holy man and all,
but we didn't really believe it.
So now there's armored vehicles.
Lots of armored vehicles in Tucson.
Who the hell needs armored vehicles here?
It's too hot to riot,
and I don't see the ghost of Erwin Rommel leading the DAK out of the Santa Ritas anytime soon.
I see buses without windows,
and the name Wackenhut on the side,
and small letters.
Windowless buses taking people from one prison to another.
What are they guilty of?
Arizona has a fairly low violent crime rate.
So how do they have so many people that they have to move three or four buses a day?
Oh yeah, they're shipping people to the facility south of Tucson,
where we store the worst and most violent offenders for being caught with a pocket full of sunshine.
Bear in mind, they're stacking them.
Six to a two-man cell in that place.
This isn't so much punishment for being caught with some weed or some happy pills
as it is a warning to the rest of us.
Stay in line or else go to hell before you even die.
And that can be arranged too.
All of this may make me sound like an anarchist.
I am not.
I am in fact a bit of a statist.
But a statist who is mad at the state in the same manner
as a libertarian would be mad at pay cops if they suddenly robbed him.
Is the libertarian going to get another gang of pay cops to arrest the first gang?
Good luck with that sucker.
Same thing applies here.
Try to get the government to control itself.
It hasn't really been able to even pretend to do so since the Reagan administration.
So, how can you beat them?
Well, you can't.
The most you can do is make them miserable.
Get a little of your own back.
Find ways to torment your local state and federal government.
Not threats.
They know how to deal with threats.
Actually, I can't tell you any of his suggestions.
Look for creative ways to turn their paperwork against them.
Prank call the local Wells Fargo bank managers.
You're a pack of creative bastards.
I imagine you could come up with a trick or two.
The thing is, it's not just Congress and the president you see.
It's the entire system.
Every squirrely little bastard.
Every bastard with an ounce of pretend power.
So, be Godzilla.
A compact, quiet version of him.
A velociraptor-sized model.
Eat what you can, burn the rest, and grin through your six-inch fags.
And this is signed, I remain, or kill me, the good Reverend Roger.
A real man made of help and a real prosecutor made of wrestling.
You have your freedom

In this sequence, Gulliver, he's been taken care of by some giants,
but he doesn't quite know how to deal with their bathroom situation.
There's this giant mistress, a gigantic woman, let's guess that she's about 80 feet tall.
She set me on a table where I showed her my sword, all bloody,
and wiping it on the lappet of my coat, returned it to the scabbard.
I was pressed to do more than one thing which another could not do for me,
and therefore endeavored to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the floor,
which, after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself further
than by pointing to the door and bowing several times.
The good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what I would be at,
and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden where she set me down.
I went on one side about 200 yards, and beckoning to her not to look or follow me,
I hid myself between two leaves of sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.
I love the way he puts all this.
I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the like particulars,
which, however,
insignificant they appear to groveling vulgar minds,
yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and imagination,
and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private life,
which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of my travels to the world,
wherein I have been chiefly studious of truth,
without affecting any ornaments of learning or of style.
Well, I...
I think the last thing I want to do is to go to bed.
I don't think the lady doth protest too much.
I don't think he runs, well, yeah, he does run into a little bit more bathroom struggle
when he falls in among the yahoo's or yahoo's,
which are what we would now call humans, dear friends.
The yahoo's are prodigiously nimble from their infancy.
However, I once caught a young male, of three years old,
and endeavored,
by all marks of faith,

tenderness to make it quiet. But the little imp fell a-squalling and scratching and biting with
such violence that I was forced to let it go, and it was high time for a whole troop of old ones
came about us at the noise. But finding the cub was safe, for away it ran, and my sorrel nag being
nearby, they durst not venture near us. Because, you see, horses are the civilized creatures on
this land, and the humans are the animals. I observed the young animal's flesh to smell very
rank, and the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.
I forgot another circumstance, and perhaps I might have the reader's pardon if it were wholly
omitted, that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow
liquid substance all over my clothes. But, by good fortune, I was able to get it out of the
house, and I was able to get it out of the house. And, by good fortune, there was a small brook hard
by, where I washed myself as clean as I could, although I durst not come into my master's presence
until I were sufficiently aired. And by what I could discover, the yahoos appear to be the most
unteachable of all animals, their capacities never reaching higher than to draw or carry burdens.
And, friends, you know, if you act like a dumb person, they'll treat you as an equal.
Yet I am of the opinion this defect ariseth chiefly from a
perverse, restive disposition, for they are cunning, malicious, treacherous, and revengeful.
They are strong and hardy, but of a cowardly spirit, and by consequence, insolent, abject,
and cruel. It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous
than the rest, whom they yet much exceed in strength and activity. So there's Jonathan Swift
on humans, and especially redheads.
Hear that, Susie? Now, let's, uh, I know what she's saying.
I'm not really a redhead.
Okay. Oh, uh, he, he also, that, in the very third of the Gulliver travels, um, travels,
he goes to the floating island of Laputa, where, um, everyone is an expert. And last week we read
as a physician, he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a
physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a physician, and he was a
cure him of colic. Uh, he ran into other advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall say
something when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is called among them the
universal artist. He told us he had been 30 years employing his thoughts for the improvement of
human life. He had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities and 50 men at work.
Some were condensed.
Injor.
Chris is aiest.
All right, so when sport went wrong, white folk would.

And she'sím gitget it.
Yes, implant your handСТO hey.



was wanted for a imitation.
She gonna died right?
She gonna die at the像
Loud been telling us.
She's are.
The artist himself was at that time busy upon two great designs, the first to sow land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which I was not skillful enough to comprehend.
The other was by a certain composition of gums, minerals, and vegetables outwardly applied to prevent the growth of wool upon two young lambs, and he hoped in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom.
I think he must have succeeded at that, because I look around our kingdom and I see quite a few naked sheep.
Really?
Well, I see a lot of...
...of sheep, and their nakedity offends me.
Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering plots and conspiracies against the government.
He advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected persons their times of eating, on which side they lay in bed, and with which hand they wiped their posteriors.
To take a...
...strict view of their excrements, and from the cull-hour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs.
Because men are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent as when they are at stool, which he found by frequent experiment, for in such conjunctures, when he used merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering them.

But in the case of murdering the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green, but quite different when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the metropolis.
Hmm.
So, uh, there's a lot to be learned there from your little poopies there, Fran.
I suppose so.
If you, if you really know your stuff.
As it were.
Well, we're still hearing the, um...
...the lovely, lilting...
...tunes of Sansa Thyme in the background.
That's, uh, what is that little instrument that African piano...
Kalimba.
Yeah, the little kalimba.
It's...
They're both, they both play kalimbas, but...
...they use a lot of extra stuff.
Yes, they do.
Some echoey stuff.
And, uh...
Some little tablets, too, and other electronic devices.
Well, they have a big stack of iPads.
I mean, it's like these little, tiny, primitive-looking instruments.
And, and a turtle!
A turtle shell!
Mm-hmm.
Just like the one I almost ran over a month ago.
Mm-hmm.
Same kind of water cooter.
But it was, it was an empty shell, but it had a microphone attached to it, so you could blow, I guess you'd blow into it or make kind of a...
...turtle shell sound.
All those electronics and a turtle shell.
Rural War Room is like that.
They have all these electronics, and then, and then in front of Byron is a bunch of noisemakers, including, uh...
...a kite.
...a coyote call.
That was my contribution to the band.
And, uh, yeah, there's some strange bands out there, friends, that's for sure.
I'm in one.
Princess, we and I are in a band.
We're, we're in Doctors for Wotan.
We're gonna be performing at, uh, X-Day.
Sure.
Not at Starwood.
No.
No, they don't, they don't have doctor bands at Starwood.
No.
No.
Just X-Day.
Unless we did one in the Pufferdome.
That's still up in the air.
That's true.
I could just bring all our fart pianos and hand out...
toy musical instruments
and have everybody in the puffer dome
become the band.
And me and Philo can sit, and you can sit in the audience
and watch the audience play our
band music.
Sounds like a plan.
That's the one
good thing about
doctor music, subgenius doctor music,
is you can do that.
You can get up on stage
and start
pretending you know how to play your instruments,
but you start seducing
the audience into coming up on stage,
or at least grabbing instruments.
After a while, you get it set up
to where the whole audience is up on stage
and you and your buddy
who were supposed to be in the band
are sitting in the audience
twiddling your thumbs and checking
the recording levels.
The editor of
Performance Art Magazine
in the 80s saw that happen
at the Baltimore World Subgenius
Convention and decided that we were the most
advanced performance artists
ever, even though
quote, none of them
even went to art school.
We're real proud of that.
And I wrote a column for
Performance Art Magazine about performance artists
of the kind that you didn't usually
think about, like professional
wrestlers, professional
preachers.
These are performance artists
that bleed for their art
friends.
For real.
Well,
Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave
couldn't call in tonight because
he was sick.
Dave.
Friend, send your
powerful alien healing
rave vibes out
towards Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Yes.
I'd give you his email or his
Facebook page, but I can't because I don't think
he has any of that stuff.
Just rush them swiftly to
the place that you
know is Dave.
Right. Yeah.
The place that you know is Dave.
The place that you know is Dave.
And Dave will get your vibes.
And hopefully he'll heal swiftly.
Well, what else
do I have on this CD in the background?
Hey, when you don't have
Dave, you just use puzzling
evidence cuts. And I have
a really nice stretch of
blabbering by Dr. Philo
Drummond and Dr.
Hal on the Puzzling Evidence Show
from about six months ago, I think,
that I found really interesting
when I listened the other night.
We'll see. Maybe we'll get to the end of it and hear
some more Rural War Room.
Praise Philo. Praise Dr. Hal.
But first, just to get away
from all the voices and talking,
we'll, in theory,
be playing
one of those little one and a half minute
pieces by Reverend Jimmy
Ryan.
Where's Jimmy?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.



What about if we had Professor Challenger
and Professor Quartermain together
in the same story?
That was done in the League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen. Oh, no, no. Challenger wasn't
in that, though, was it? No, they put Alan
Quartermain there. He's not a professor
so much as a big game hunter.
That's right. That's right.
Professor Challenger might have gotten
along better with Doc Savage, who actually, uh, was a professor.
Actually, what, did have scientific achievements.
Oh, yeah.
Who's the, was it Quartermain?
Who was the, no, who was the character
that was in
Five Million
Miles to,
you know, not so far, I think.
You mean, uh,
Catermass. Catermass. That's
who I'm thinking of. Quartermass, yeah. In the, uh,
the Catermass
experiment. And also the one
where he goes to, uh, they, yeah, where they
find the ancient, uh,
thing that's causing the noise in the middle
of the subway. Yes, that so-called
Five Million Years to Earth. Five million
years to Earth. Known in England, where it
originated as Catermass and the Pit.
That's a good movie. Have you
ever seen Enemy, is it
Enemy from Space, the second
movie? That's the rarest one
of the series where aliens
have taken over this industrial
installation in England and their
huge alien blobs are
growing in vats in this giant factory.
No, I don't remember that one.
It's a pretty good one.
Catermass in it, too. Yes, it does.
It's his second outing.
The first one is, um,
The Creeping Unknown.
Where a spaceship crashes
and the guy gets out and
morphs into a huge monster which
pulls up in Westminster Abbey.
These were based, these movies were
pretty good. They were based on teleplays
that were even better by
Nigel Neill that everybody in England
watched when they were on.
For one thing, there wasn't much to do in England
after the Second World War.
About the only entertainment was
to watch these things
on TV. They made a sensation.
And so, because of their
popularity, they made the movies
based on those. And the movies kind
of lost some of the subtlety
and interest that was in the
teleplay. Hey, I hear a caller trying
to come up out of the caller pool. I wish
I could hear him. I know he's there. Maybe
they're listening to... Is there a caller?
Hello, caller.
No, it's a lost
cause. We'll never hear that caller.
But it's comforting to know that
they're actually there. Still trying to get
I think they take care of each other when they're in the pool
together, you know. They pad each other on the back.
Try to keep each other afloat
and not drown, you know.
Give each other a crust of bread.
A crust of bread, a
jug of wine.
And they hold hands during
a non-violent die-in.
Yeah, that was the Professor Quatermass.
That's what I was thinking of, yeah.
Played in two of the movies by
Brian Donlevy.
Yeah, the one with the
London Underground and the Martian spacecraft
buried. Yeah, he wasn't in that one.
That had influenced human evolution.
I liked that one.
That was a good story. Yes, it was.
It was actually a good story. It was well done.
Because the...
It was a crashed Martian spaceship.
Oh, there he is.
Is this how you use the
divine gift of being able to be heard
on the show?
He's kind of
broke. That's difficult to understand.
Yeah, it's so broke
it can't be fixed.
Well, um...
Do not try to fix it
and do not mess with Texas, man.
Dr. Howe, we know you.
You're a good man.



We got your name. We got your number.
We got your number.
We got your number.
Okay, well then send me some plastic dinosaurs
or a couple of chicks
so I can purchase them myself.
But send them on the other show because this show here doesn't take money
except for KPFA, which you can send any time you want.
Well, I'm not giving out a name. I can't give out an
address. You know, I can't really
make that sort of decision. No, you can't do that.
But if you listen
to Dr. Howe's show,
Why won't you just...
If you just listen, if you just listen,
it's even worse if you just listen.
And when you listen, you can just concentrate
on what you hear.
Visualization
We're in a sports-to-earth policy here.
Yes. I'll teach you
the secrets of the truth. What do you think we burn
those bridges for so that we're
setting fire to the earth and the bridge gets on
fire and just now everything
goes downhill from there. It's a
conflagration. You shall learn that which cannot be unlearned.
A powerful theory as well.
I have a powerful theory of...
If Paul Paul came and he had to swear, you know...
It's gone. What would happen
if the Power Pack kids
met the Powder Puff Girl?
Yeah.
You know, it is the power. It's not Powder Puff.
Oh, okay. It's Power Puff Girl.
But they go to powder their nose all at the
same time. Yeah, they use the almond
brake heavily in that...
their theme song.
The role of
George Edward Challenger has been played
in the movies by
Wallace Beery, Claude Rains,
John Rhys-Davies.

In the late 80s, I was, you know, pretty much coked out to my gills all the time, pretty much.
Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much all the time.
I didn't watch any TV during the 80s.
Too much to do with Cyrus Vance and other fancy pants characters.
During the Jimmy Carter and James Earl Carter administration in France,
they did the special dance with Cyrus Vance.
I'll have some proof of that next time, though.
Because I'm not going to go on just a wing and a prayer and a hope and a dream
and a wink and a nod.
There's one motor gone still I must carry on.
It's got to be something more solid than that.
I've got to have something I can chew on, something we can sink our teeth into,
something with some substance to it, something that we know when we swallow
that it's going to hit our belly with a big resounding...
Whoa!
Whoa, watch that.
I don't know what kind of sound it makes, actually.
I don't have a microphone down there to measure properly.
Now, if you're ever swallowed by a giant snake, there are some things that you ought to consider.
I'm glad that guy didn't go through with that experiment.
Did you hear about that guy that built a suit so that they caught an anaconda
and they were going to...
He built a suit that was a crush-proof suit, and he was going to allow the anaconda to swallow him.
But the anaconda doesn't crush you once you're inside.
And then, once he gets in, they were going to then make the anaconda regurgitate.
They've been known to do that.
But the problem is that the actual gastric chamber, the stomach of the anaconda,
has acid in it so strong that it'll dissolve your feet while your head is still conscious.
It was a metal suit they were in.
He'd done all his research.
They can dissolve anything.
They can dissolve bones.
They finally got up to the point where they built the suit.
He was ready to go with it.
And then somebody thought, maybe the anaconda doesn't want you to do that.
Yes, exactly.
How about the anaconda?
And they had second thoughts at the last second.
But they went through the long...
You know, they had a whole show on it.
It was just ridiculous.
Did you...
You know, there have been survivors of creatures eaten by the anaconda that are vomited out
and they're simply coated with mucus because they haven't yet entered the gastric chamber.
But once you start being dissolved, there's no way out except through the...
other end of the anaconda as a puddle of mush.
Did you ever see the movie Anaconda featuring John Voight?
Because at a certain point in the movie, John Voight is vomited out of the anaconda
and covered with mucus, he lands with a plop and then he winks at the audience.
It's extremely disturbing and, well, you'll just have to see.
What do you mean, winks?
Was the winking the disturbing part?
Well, he's...
He's a bad guy.
He's eaten by the anaconda.
Then it throws him up and he comes out as this mucus-covered blob, but he winks like,
yuck, yuck, this messed with your head, didn't it?
Yeah.
I'm going to switch.
I'm not sure what they talk about after that.
That's Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Hal Robbins on the Puzzling Evidence Show
recorded off of KPFA Berkeley back in them days.
I've got one last cut.
I was going to play it before we go home.
It's another rural war room cut that should make you lose your mind if you listen in headphones,
especially.
This one's from their CD called Soviet Life, which had three announced cuts, Soviet Life
Yesterday, Soviet Life Today, and Soviet Life Tomorrow.
However, there was a bonus track that I...
I think was Soviet Life Subgenius or something.
That's what I'm going to play now.
This is Rural War Room.
Thank you.
Oh, and you're listening to The Hour of Slack being produced at the beautiful studios of WCSB in Cleveland this particular night.
You can find more information from subgenius.com.
Great thought.
What did you want to tell us about the upcoming reality of Soviet Life?
I think Waltім K offenses have been very expensive these days.
But I would like toruck in and test on them and see if it's enough right now.
Also, just a bit of a partager there.
Like I mentioned, we've been sending over $5,000 of solar energy to wspu-
We had a low eid money cover- remember?
Because there had been huge Allies standing over us.
That's où we need to do it.
