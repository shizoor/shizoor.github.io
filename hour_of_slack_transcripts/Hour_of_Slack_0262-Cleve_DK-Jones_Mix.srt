1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,580
For men on the go, it's not what's in the pipe.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,940
It's the pipe itself.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,980
The Bob Dobbs Classic Meerschaum, hand-carved by the finest craftsmen in Malaysia.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,320
This and other fine Bob Dobbs smoking accessories

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,760
cast a spell of their own for the discriminating smoker.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,360
Bob Dobbs pipes never go out.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,340
Of style.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,400
Available at Kmart, Walmart, Target and Hypermart.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,620
Too much church air.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,900
I'm expanding my air.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,460
It's... it's...

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,740
Praise...

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:45,740


14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,520
And welcome to the Sergius Radio Ministry.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,120
Order of Church.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,220
Christa!

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,560
Yeah. Now, before we really get going with the sermon here,

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,320
I'd like you all to share something.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,220
That's something we've done in Texas and Arkansas for many years.

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,980
It's just to kind of make people understand the solution.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
The solemnity, the profundity of the whole thing.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,680
Lower your heads and we'll share a sacred moment of noise!

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,640
Can't go, can't go, can't go!

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,860
All right!

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,800
Ah, there we go!

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,380
Now I see some people are into it!

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
These people have slack!

29
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,900
The sound itself, it... it has a stink to it.

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,940
It's bad!

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,580
Ah...

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,440
Who's gonna job that greyhound, children?

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,800
Greyhound!

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,720
Who's gonna job that greyhound, children?

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,100
Greyhound gone!

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,260
Son of God, cut your middle to the middle!

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,680
Greyhound gone!

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,600
Move as an every-born-a-savior!

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
Greyhound gone!

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,840
Always drive 55!

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,000
Ah!

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,560
Almighty Father cries first command!

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,100
Greyhound gone!

44
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,120
Horned cops in a lucky track!

45
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,540
Greyhound gone!

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,820
Mary and Joseph wade at the station!

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,080
Greyhound gone!

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,420
They're hitching a ride to the Holy Nation!

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,040
Ah!

50
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,520
There's no smoking or chewing on the bus to Jerusalem!

51
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,620
There's a virgin Mary!

52
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,520
Prayin' on the old dentist boy!

53
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,880
We snagged the old breakin' hole!

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,940
He did burn us, she did!

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,720
We're talking to fires!

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,420
And I'm coming down for the man!

57
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,260
He's gone!

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,820
Hat-coil plan is headed for the border!

59
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
And they're running like hills from a federal court order!

60
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,260
Full ahead!

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,600
Exact change for the law!

62
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,000
And the police!

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,360
Three Hail Marys and on your knees!

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,720
Take it to the bridge now!

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,280


66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,340
Ah!

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,560


68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Ah!

69
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:42,880
Ah!

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,720
Ah!

71
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:46,660
Ah!

72
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,100
Ah!

73
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,380
Ah!

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,160
Ah!

75
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,320
He's gone!

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,600
He's gone!

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,600


78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:58,600


79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,980
W're going to spelling all her name on the register!

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,520
Ah ah!

81
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,420
Ah ha!

82
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,420


83
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,420


84
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,440
Brother Dollar and the boy on the White Horse!

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,980
Did you so ya anyway?

86
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,560
I have a little small thing to tell you!

87
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,180
A jive 꺼

88
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,620
It's thick

89
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,400
It hardened and lips weren't soft

90
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,720
I'm hanging on your desk for weeks, tell me you don't break it for me.

91
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,540
The influence is with our best advice, and I'm calling God for a thing.

92
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,620
He's gone.

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,500
He's gone.

94
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,860
He's gone.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,100
He's gone.

96
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,920
He's gone.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,900
He's gone.

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,280
And there's a subgenius down here with a bomb strapped to his chest, so you goddamn

99
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,860
well better enjoy it or he'll kill all of us.

100
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,080
He is Bob, ready for fun.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
He wears a smile.

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Everybody run!

103
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,480
Yep.

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,260
The damn bomb.

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
The decks are all running, dear friends.

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,200
That wonderful song that started the show out was Greyhounded Jordan by my brother Cleve

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,160
Donut Duncan.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,740
I think his best song yet, making it perhaps the greatest song ever recorded.

109
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,060
Praise Cleve.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,900
A lot more Cleve coming up tonight, so hang in there.

111
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,800
And from now on the first words I want to hear out of your filthy sewers is praise Bob.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,620
Let me hear it.

113
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,940
Praise Bob!

114
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,580

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,860
Praise Bob!

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Dear Bob, my life has changed completely.

117

my life has changed completely

131

because of your ministry.

132
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,340
Bob needs an order to pursue his plan

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,480
for world domination.

134
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,620
I say, Bob

135

136
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,020

Here's another one.

138

Bob is the only drug. That's the only drug. You can't come down from Bob.

This is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

168
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Spreading the seed word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

High E-bopt of the church of the subgenius.

172
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,220

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,220
Well here we are at Columbia University's Halloween Spook House.

193
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,300
Recognize your voice man.

194
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,300
Hello.

195
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,680
You are.

196
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,200
He's a radio guy.

197
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,420
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,260
Dude, he's a radio guy.

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,680
I heard about it.

200
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,940
That would be you.

201
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,340
I've read that book.

202
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,040
I'm kind of one of the...

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,240
You gotta explain something to me.

204
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,740
Has Bob seen your $20, my friend?

205
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,000
Then you're still king in the eyes of Bob.

206
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,020
A king boy.

207
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,680
You got your year, $20.

208
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,260
You would earn you a seat.

209
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,320
Well, anyway, as I was saying,

210
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
some people think the church is like

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,660
some sign of the end times,

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,060
the mockers that will come at the end times,

213
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,000
and those people should be damn glad

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,280
we're helping to fulfill biblical prophecy.

215
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
To us, who've been with the church a long time,

216
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
it's a mystery.

217
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,460
We don't know what the hell this thing's gonna turn into.

218
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,400
If we did, it'd be boring to us.

219
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,700
It founded...

220
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,960
The church actually was founded in 1953

221
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,180
by that man, J.R. Bob Dogg.

222
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,940
Hey, Bob!

223
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,660
Bob founded his church

224
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,260
when he discovered that there was a conspiracy,

225
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,480
a conspiracy of normals

226
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,100
robbing away the slack

227
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,620
of the true subgeniuses

228
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,180
as opposed to human beings,

229
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
mere humes, as we call them.

230
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,240
It's sort of a do-it-yourself religion.

231
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,080
Bob founded his church

232
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,360
not on a rock,

233
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,580
but rather on sort of a shifty,

234
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,000
shifting sandy beach

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,240
of rock.

236
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,080
And it's a church of hypocrisy.

237
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,240
Every church must have its fair measure of hypocrisy.

238
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,360
And certainly we've got more,

239
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,400
we dole out more of it than anybody else.

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,240
Like I said, it's a non-organization

241
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,800
for non-joiners,

242
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,260
which makes it a little bit difficult

243
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,480
to raise funds at times.

244
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,720
But the point of it is that all subgeniuses,

245
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,440
people say,

246
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,880
well, what the hell is a subgenius?

247
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,060
There's no definition. They're all different.

248
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
That's what it means.

249
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,520
There is no typical subgenius.

250
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,840
If any two are alike,

251
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,780
one must die.

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,280
The only thing

253
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,260
that the subgeniuses have in common

254
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,420
is that they have nothing in common

255
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,720
with the conspiracy.

256
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,060
What we're trying to do

257
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,080
is tempt sinners

258
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
away from the devil.

259
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,160
Because Bob is a better tempter

260
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,740
than the devil.

261
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,460
However, where they go after that,

262
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,200
it's up to them.

263
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,720
The subgeniuses believe

264
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,420
in the God that doesn't want you

265
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,380
to believe in it.

266
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,680
And one of our missions,

267
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,840
the headquarters is in Dallas, Texas,

268
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,020
what they often call

269
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,620
the buckle on the Bible belt.

270
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,300
What we try to do is

271
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,460
unbuckle the Bible belt

272
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,560
so that its pants may drop

273
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,260
and it may gaze unflinching

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,760
upon its own private desire.

275
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,960
It's a war, dear friends!

276
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,840
It's a war against the normal!

277
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,180
And we aren't just the regular

278
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,120
kind of mutants we're talking about here.

279
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,840
These are more like the monsters.

280
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,440
The monster type of mutants.

281
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,900
It's the humans versus

282
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,160
the subgeniuses.

283
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,700
And the ironic thing is,

284
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,040
in the early days of the church,

285
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,580
80 million years ago in fabled Atlantis,

286
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,320
we helped to design the humans.

287
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,620
Probably our biggest mistake!

288
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
So, friends,

289
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
as I said, you know,

290
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,340
the fact that Jesus smoked

291
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,440
Chesterfields even though they didn't exist

292
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
2000 years ago,

293
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,340
is an example of our faith.

294
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,700
You don't use your mind

295
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,580
to think about your religion!

296
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,980
You just feel it! You feel it in your heart!

297
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,560
Bob sold it! I smoked it!

298
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,820
That settles it!

299
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
It's a question of faith!

300
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,240
This is like the sorrow

301
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,020
of world religions

302
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,840
putting those two C's

303
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,260
on both cheeks!

304
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,920
The bloody marks on the beefy seat

305
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:10,780
of the conspiracy!

306
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,340
It's like the Robin Hood of world religions

307
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,360
robbing from the lost,

308
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,480
who were mostly thieves to begin with,

309
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,420
and giving to the saved!

310
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,940
And if you, my friend, can make it,

311
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,140
can buy this book of the subgenius,

312
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,240
that videotape

313
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,680
on sale for only $30 today,

314
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,540
if you can make it

315
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,160
to the jungle encampment in Dobstown, Malaysia,

316
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,620
if you can survive

317
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,220
the acubating, the excrementation,

318
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,000
the pyroflatulation,

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,120
and the head-launchings, my friend,

320
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,380
you will be a weapon for Bob!

321
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,400
A weapon for J.R. Bob Dobbs!

322
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,780
A minister of Bob, praying for slack!

323
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,000
You and your subgenius fools

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,740
shall never defeat me, Bob Dobbs!

325
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,500
Oh, no?

326
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,980
Then have a taste of my

327
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,240
stark fist of removal,

328
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Dr. Conspiracy!

329
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,700
Neegie's henchmen won't get any slack

330
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,220
when they face Bobco's new

331
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,760
Bob Dobbs action figure

332
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,340
with flying rocket fist,

333
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,560
flamethrower pipe,

334
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,260
and magic briefcase!

335
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,600
Too much is always better than

336
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,880
not enough when you collect

337
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,900
the subgenius universe!

338
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,580
Bobmobile not included, batteries

339
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,520
and some assembly required, action figure

340
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
sold separately from Bobco!

341
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,520
I am

342
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,560
a subgenius!

343
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,500
And

344
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,580
by that threat you will touch

345
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,080
what falls to this grade of man!

346
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,120
My power wasn't given to me

347
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,600
in exchange for prayer

348
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,420
or meditation,

349
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,840
I paid for it

350
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,680
in cold, hard American dollars!

351
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,400
Salvation you get for free

352
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,000
is worth just that,

353
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,300
doesn't you, queer?

354
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,320
Of course, your money

355
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,640
ain't worth jack anyway!

356
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,900
The conspiracy says to that

357
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,640
but a very important element

358
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,380
of your soul adheres

359
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,020
to those otherwise worthless,

360
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,220
unborn and unborn

361
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,220


362
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,440
The conspiracy says that

363
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
Bob needs in order to pursue

364
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,880
his plan for world domination.

365
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,920
I say, Bob

366
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,200
guides my hand in all things

367
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,980
and pays me off

368
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,280
in pure slack!

369
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,260
So I say to you

370
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,600
whips, you fools,

371
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
you dupes, you pigs,

372
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,400
give me your money!

373
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,640
You won't need it in the future!

374
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,800
The future offers you

375
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,140
naught but destruction!

376
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,800
You know what I mean?

377
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,180
I mean, I!

378
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,180
I dare you

379
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,780
to kill me!

380
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,420
I need to be, I mean,

381
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm one of the good guys!

382
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,560
My cards shall prevail!

383
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,520
Let out the crazy

384
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
man inside you, he knows

385
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,140
what's what!

386
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Smile when you call me a fanatic!

387
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,580
Or you say, me,

388
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,900
primate! Me,

389
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,540
overman!

390
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,620
You think I'm dumb, but you are blind

391
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,840
to the conspiracy that runs your life!

392
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,640
And you have your geniuses

393
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,200
running things for you

394
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
and you think they're gonna make things safe and simple!

395
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,700
And I'm gonna make things

396
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,760
safe and simple and easy for me!

397
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,140
And the entire

398
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,540
sub-genius race!

399
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,640
Even if it means wiping out

400
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
your sick society in total

401
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,180
with no more sentiment

402
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,140
involved in swatting the blind!

403
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,700
All this that we might survive

404
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,980
the end times!

405
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,240
You know why?

406
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,640
Because I am, I am,

407
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,020
I am, I am

408
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,200
a sot-tee!

409
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,880
I say, all you blow-dried,

410
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,580
white-wired, sipping designer

411
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,760
jean-clad, French film watcher,

412
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,380
walkman, toting hip-wimps,

413
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,460
a few house-coated inquirers,

414
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,940
a caravan-reading, trailer-in-camp,

415
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,540
bar-shopping, hair-curl, motorheads,

416
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,040
cock-holsters, all

417
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,280
you dupes! The corporate

418
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,380
big-money, oil-exploder,

419
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,540
tree-killing, land-raping, food-freezing,

420
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,040
desk-warmer, tri-laterally

421
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,440
establishmentarian

422
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
foe-hunting, back-stabbing,

423
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,580
poverty-spreading, farm-wielding,

424
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,600
meringue-heading, pencil-necked,

425
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
eraser-headed, politicals!

426
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
Kill the conspiracy!

427
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,820
Kill them and eat them!

428
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,520
Kill them and eat them!

429
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,380
And f*** their wives!

430
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,700
Who do you think you are?

431
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,820
What do you think you're doing?

432
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,040
Do you think you got it good?

433
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,380
Well dispose of those illusions!

434
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,320
Dispose of them all right now!

435
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,520
Because on July 5th, 1998,

436
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,700
at 7.30 in the morning,

437
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
you shall be judged!

438
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:58,020
You shall be judged!

439
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,860
Calculating alien races!

440
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,920
From your own!

441
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,680
If you don't want to

442
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,400
f***, you won't escape

443
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,200
their scrutiny!

444
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,700
You will fry!

445
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,960
Well we will party!

446
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,480
Bottle of Thunderbird, I'm gonna

447
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,180
get down and do it right in

448
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,200
Nazian Dirty!

449
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,300
You know why daddy?

450
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,240
You know why?

451
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,700
I'll f***!

452
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,240
Now some of you Christians out here

453
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,260
may be getting a little upset at what I'm saying

454
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,700
but I'd like to remind you that the founder of your religion

455
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,140
was not quite so

456
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,240
squeamish as some of you!

457
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,220
Yeah!

458
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,500
Let's go!

459
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,700
Let's go!

460
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,760
Let's go!

461
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,920
Let's go!

462
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,100
Ah yes dear

463
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,380
friends, this is

464
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,060
your host and

465
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,720
good prayer partner

466
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,220
Reverend Ivan Stank.

467
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,420
And uh

468
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,880
the amazing

469
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,460
rant that you heard

470
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,760
just a little while ago

471
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
was a

472
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
heavily censored version

473
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,040
of uh

474
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,240
of Brother Cleve

475
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,480
Duncan's testimonial

476
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,140
with background

477
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,360
sampled music by

478
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,440
Huge Voodoo

479
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,840
uh

480
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,340
more on that in a minute

481
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,420
I'm really sorry

482
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,920
about having to put cuts

483
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,000
in that rant

484
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,400
where the taboo verbal expressions

485
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
were excised

486
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,680
you may or may not have noticed

487
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,420
but you know

488
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,800
until the

489
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,540
prudish word fearing

490
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,180
conspiracy is defeated

491
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,380
well you know we're not allowed

492
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,080
to play certain words

493
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
because of the

494
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,500
assumption in some quarters

495
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,180
that some words

496
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,060
can actually

497
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,100
harm you

498
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,380
more than the images of

499
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,200
rape and violence

500
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
shown pretty much all the time

501
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,060
on television

502
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,840
uh

503
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,440
someday these things

504
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
will change under Bob

505
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,700
now

506
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,340
almost all of the rest of this

507
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,740
show

508
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,860
was uh recorded

509
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,980
uh this weekend

510
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,740
it's almost all material

511
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,920
recorded this last weekend

512
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,080
last weekend in New York

513
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,360
and New Jersey by myself

514
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,160
Reverend Ivan Stang and uh

515
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,460
especially the Reverend

516
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,740
Dr. D.K. Jones

517
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,440
as well as his

518
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,000
friend Reverend Bruce Grant

519
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,880
before

520
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,940
during and after a

521
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,280
subgenius revival at Columbia

522
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,140
University

523
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,860

524
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,700
D.K. Jones uh

525
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,620
is uh

526
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,060
a subgenius musician you'll be

527
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,100
most familiar with

528
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,300
uh I guess from his score

529
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,500
for the subgenius video Arise

530
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,360
and in fact uh

531
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,100
the music that'll be coming up

532
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,720
and that you've heard some of already

533
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,260
uh the stuff with

534
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,340
preachers sampled bits of

535
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,160

the more linear instrumental

539
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,460
background music such as

540
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,240
the stuff behind us right now

541
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,400
is by D.K. Jones

542
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,520
and myself believe it

543
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,800
or not but mostly D.K. Jones

544
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,320
I would like

545
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:26,480


574
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:56,480


575
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:26,480


576
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:56,480


577
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:26,480


578
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,560
,

579
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,160
so that's that's our background track

580
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,580
yeah what I need

581
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,680
at 16

582
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,100
what I need to do is

583
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,460
I don't know what I'm

584
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,640
this is soundtrack for cleave walking home

585
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,240
lighted

586
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,260
yeah let's put this

587
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:54,600
the lonely cleave walking home

588
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,380
lighted night

589
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,540
he's had

590
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,880
one too many

591
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,880
and suddenly

592
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,040
he ran into the brick wall

593
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,280
oh my head

594
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,960
what happened

595
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,820
where am I

596
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,080
the last thing I remember

597
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,000
I was trying my first

598
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,260
hit of

599
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,240
frop

600
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,300
oh what has it done to me

601
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,020
and

602
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm

603
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,360


604
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,800
I never should have joined that

605
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,380
church

606
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,100
it was

607
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,760
it was Bob

608
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,820
Bob

609
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,380
there's only one thing

610
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,060
left to do

611
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,180
I must

612
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,440
kill

613
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,140
Bob yes yes

614
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,600
that's the answer

615
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,840
it is

616
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,300
my duty

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,180
to kill

618
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,000
Bob

619
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,220
I must

620
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,320
kill

621
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,320


622
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,820
the

623
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,420
devil

624
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,420


625
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,780
come

626
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:02,780


627
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,040
kill

628
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,760
me

629
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:07,980
I

630
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,980
will

631
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,300
kill

632
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,360
me

633
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,360
Harvest what you can and what remains because tomorrow you'll be empty and alone.

634
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,320
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

635
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,420
Don't have a house, can't pay the rent.

636
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,140
We live like we believe it.

637
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:25,360
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

638
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:53,760
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

639
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,340
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

640
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:54,920
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

641
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:23,940
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

642
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:55,340
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

643
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:25,320
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

644
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:47,700
I feel like I'm doing just the nothing.

645
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,900
It somehow sends, I don't know what it is, but it just works so well for Sylvia.

646
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:05,100
But what happens when that loose, easy, so-called tramp is your own sister?

647
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,820
I wouldn't want to lie now.

648
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
How did Bob strike his first million?

649
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,440
When a man like you paid a dollar for one of these bumpers,

650
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,800
or ten dollars for this amazing poster,

651
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,480
it's true.

652
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,660
It's true. Bob's church was built on a ten dollar bill.

653
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,120
And it's ridiculous to think we're going to give it away

654
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,160
just because a bunch of lazy mutants think they own the planet.

655
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,140
Bob?

656
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,280
There are a lot of different ways.

657
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,960
How about getting a copy of the Economicon?

658
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,500
Is that spells?

659
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,460
Oh, we can't know.

660
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,660
If every Hobart or Pink Boy had one of those,

661
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,900
there'd be so damn many old ones and guardian demons coming up out of it.

662
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,980
So are there any rituals?

663
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,600
You'd be like ghostbusters over here.

664
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,160
Yeah, he's a warrior.

665
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,060
I'm a dragon.

666
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,740
I can't roll.

667
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,220
Uh, I'm casting out a false prophet.

668
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:56,980
Bob?

669
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,180
Yeah?

670
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,800
Doug Quaid is here to see you.

671
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,660
Yeah, I'll be right out.

672
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,360
Okay.

673
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,560
Now, help me out here, Doug.

674
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,180
You were interested in a memory of, uh...

675
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,260
Buy and be saved!

676
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,800
Give unto Bob that which is Bob's.

677
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,380
Render unto him that which...

678
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,920
before he renders you like a...

679
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,860
pink boy in a slaughterhouse.

680
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
I swear.

681
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,860
What are you?

682
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,060
Uh...

683
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,740
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,

684
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,380
if outer space is your thing,

685
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,740
I think you would be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.

686
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,900
No, I'm telling you, Doug, your brain will not know the difference.

687
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,920
And you're gonna love this, Doug.

688
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,040
We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.

689
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,880
So, what's your choice?

690
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,280
Is it your first trip?

691
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,520
Mm-hmm.

692
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Good evening, Doug.

693
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,440
Hey, Paul, what do you want for Christmas?

694
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,800
Benny, what were you doing launching that bleeding hat on a Thursday?

695
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,480
Why was you wearing them big green straps?

696
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,560
You know you should not do that, Benny.

697
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,240
Take it easy, Doug.

698
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:19,860
Okay.

699
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:21,680
Doug?

700
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,640
Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.

701
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,460
Doug.

702
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,400
Doug, there's something I want you to know.

703
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,040
You were the best assignment I ever had.

704
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,620
You wouldn't shoot me, would you, Doug?

705
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,620
After all we've been through?

706
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,060
If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself,

707
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,600
and you've got a wet towel wrapped around your head.

708
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,980
No, no, we're sorry, Bob.

709
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,840
We didn't mean it.

710
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,440
We didn't mean it to...

711
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,340
We won't call you anymore, Bob.

712
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,020
Please don't drop that bomb on us.

713
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,680
No, Bob, don't do it, please.

714
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,080
When's that bomb gonna get here, Bob?

715
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,460
I already filled up my will.

716
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:10,940
Oh!

717
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,460
Oh, it was just a little one, Bob.

718
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,960
Me, gee, Bob.

719
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,800
Fuck Bob.

720
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,000
Where in the world can me, gee, be?

721
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,560
Niggy?

722
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,140
Where is to, Niggy?

723
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,460
Where is to, Niggy?

724
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,260
Niggy?

725
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,660
Where is to?

726
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,180
I know you are there, Niggy.

727
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,580
You're not going to get me this time, Niggy,

728
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,680
because I have the gun, and the diamonds,

729
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,460
and the map, and the documents,

730
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,500
and I have the device.

731
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,980
Yes, I have the device.

732
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


733
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


734
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


735
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:49,980


736
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,500
And you are foiled finally, Niggy.

737
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,940
Niggy?

738
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,060
Where did you go?

739
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,480
Where did you go, Niggy?

740
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,840
You can't fool me this time, Niggy.

741
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,360
I signed the papers already.

742
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,940
You can...

743
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,480
What?

744
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,140
No!

745
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,260
What is this?

746
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,080
The... the tapes.

747
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,240
The blank.

748
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,540
The documents, they've fallen to dust.

749
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,500
The negatives.

750
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,540
What about the negatives?

751
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,200
They're... they're gone.

752
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,360
They're gone.

753
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,680
I had the negatives.

754
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,640
I had the device.

755
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,840
I had the girl, the gun, the map.

756
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,620
But... but...

757
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,180
But, Niggy has them now.

758
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,300
I should have listened in the temples of the old ones

759
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,400
when they told me.

760
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,620
They told me that for every Bob particle

761
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,640
there must always be a...

762
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,080
a Niggy particle.

763
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,680
Why didn't I listen?

764
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,640
Oh... oh, the... the pain.

765
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,880
Kid's sake, I could have had it all.

766
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,180
I could have had everything, but...

767
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,000
but Niggy has it now.

768
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:13,400
Ah.

769
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,360
Finger down.

770
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,320
I'm not going to get the formal training for coming over, man.

771
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,020
I skirted him.

772
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,360
As many as I can.

773
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,820
Sure.

774
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,880
I skirted the... the formal training.

775
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,740
I sort of came in at a level.

776
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,200
Oh, man, I... I laid the first cornerstone.

777
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,820
It was a human skull.

778
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,400
A human skull, not a subgenius skull.

779
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,360
A big difference.

780
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,080
Have you ever seen,

781
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,880
Have a Nice Day spelled out in skull of normal people?

782
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,760
It's a... it's sweet.

783
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,420
It's kind of neat.

784
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,160
Or Save the Earth spelled out in the chopped off arms

785
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,820
of... of, uh, Peruvian peasants.

786
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,940
It's a joyful sight.

787
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,100
It's key, man.

788
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:57,500
Yeah.

789
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
It's... it's so neat.

790
00:41:59,060 --> 00:41:59,220
Yeah.

791
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,780
It's like the new age.

792
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,440
Don't be afraid.

793
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,160
Don't want to...

794
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,600
Don't want to hurt you.

795
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,320
Shh.

796
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,260
It's all right.

797
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,180
It's okay.

798
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,340
Come on out.

799
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,700
Come on out.

800
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,340
I got her.

801
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,100
Ow!

802
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,040
Here.

803
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,420
Watch her.

804
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,080
Don't let her go.

805
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,280
She's coming to kill you.

806
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,400
What?

807
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,540
She laid out here.

808
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,780
Where'd she go?

809
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,900
She's coming down the bottom.

810
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,980
Down the what?

811
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,260
Down here.

812
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,540
Here.

813
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,020
Here, here.

814
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,260
That's the issue.

815
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,780
Keep back.

816
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,400
Keep back.

817
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,240
Don't scare her.

818
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,380
Grab her, man.

819
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,260
We're gonna lose her.

820
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,060
Damn it.

821
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,320
Don't be afraid.

822
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:02,140
Okay, un storied.

823
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:11,660
There we go.

824
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,680
The

825
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,860
I don't know if this situation has ever happened.

826
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,080
I would kill an animal.

827
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,840
I would, I would, I would kill an animal.

828
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,260
Wait. No you don't.

829
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,740
It's okay.

830
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,700
You're gonna be alright now.

831
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,060
Shh.

832
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,080
Shh.

833
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,300
Easy. Easy.

834
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,240
It's gonna be okay.

835
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,360
It's alright. You're gonna be okay.

836
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:57,100
You know there was this woman in line ahead of me at the post office this morning.

837
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:04,180
She was wearing that new Connie Dobbs perfume, you know?

838
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,880
And, yeah.

839
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,260
And, there were a lot of new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new.

840
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,900
And, I don't...

841
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,200
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know.

842
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,500
It's too late now, baby.

843
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,020
The time...

844
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,620
Has already begun.

845
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,460
I...

846
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:35,100
I don't think I can...

847
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,280
Where is our lucky groom and poor pathetic bride?

848
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,260
The poor martyred bride.

849
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:34,280
Let's see, I guess if y'all would see Brandy and Glenn.

850
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,880
If y'all could stand.

851
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:37,780
Yeah, right there.

852
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:38,880
Woo!

853
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,080
I'm more used to preaching in tents.

854
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,400
Ah, yes.

855
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,520
Hey, if Reverend Sun Young Moon can marry

856
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,240
thousands of people,

857
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,740
thousands of people who've never even met,

858
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,320
then a Church of the Subgenius short-duration marriage

859
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,220
could be the answer.

860
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,360
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

861
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,780
this is one thing you can do as a subgenius minister.

862
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,380
You can do legal weddings.

863
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,820
You can also do the short-duration marriages.

864
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,880
This certificate here,

865
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,240
produced by Reverend Buck Naked in Dallas,

866
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,140
can come in very handy.

867
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,440
Because the short-duration marriage can last for an hour,

868
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,880
a night, a week, a year, whatever.

869
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,240
And the divorce,

870
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,080
divorces are cheap.

871
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,140
They come with the certificate.

872
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,660
All right.

873
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,820
Anybody else want to get married tonight?

874
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,740
Step right up.

875
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,140
Get your holy short-duration marriage certificate here.

876
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,680
Test your mettle and win the little lady

877
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,820
a rubber Snoopy doll.

878
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,340
Guaranteed, friends,

879
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,480
to absolve and sanctify

880
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,700
all otherwise illicit couplings.

881
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,040
Free short-duration divorce

882
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,220
if you're not completely satisfied.

883
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,540
All right, now you two stand together

884
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,400
and face me.

885
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,800
I like that.

886
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,440
All right.

887
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,000
Let's be solemn now here.

888
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,380
Do you, Glenn,

889
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,380
take, swear to tell the truth,

890
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,800
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

891
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,960
and tell, so help you Bob?

892
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,060
I do.

893
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,120
Do you, Brandy,

894
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,460
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

895
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,700
and nothing but the truth, so help you Bob?

896
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,120
Yeah.

897
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,240
All right, good. Okay.

898
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,460
Now, how long do you wish for this period of sanctified couplings to last?

899
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,780
One year.

900
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:27,780
One year?

901
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,760
Oh, yeah, that's right.

902
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,300
You told me that.

903
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,440
One year.

904
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,240
Me.

905
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,160
You sure?

906
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,820
All right.

907
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,680
Oh, yes.

908
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,520
Dearly beloved,

909
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,880
we are gathered here today in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs

910
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,800
and insert other deity names here,

911
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,700
any other deities,

912
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,880
to join this man, Glenn,

913
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,660
and this woman, Brandy,

914
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,000
in the bondage.

915
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,700
Of holy, of matrimony,

916
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,380
for better or for worse, but not for law.

917
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,680
Do you feel the spirit?

918
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,340
Yes!

919
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,440
Then put your hands on each other.

920
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,900
If there are any here who feel this man and this woman

921
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,140
should not be joined temporarily,

922
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,080
just hold your peace,

923
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,300
because we don't want to hear about it.

924
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,300
No, we don't!

925
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,400
No, we don't!

926
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,580
All right, now, put, hold tight, hold tight now.

927
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,500
Oh, lovely, lovely couple.

928
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,120
Do you, Glenn, take this woman, Brandy,

929
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,400
to be your lawful wedded wife

930
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,860
in short-duration subgenius matrimony

931
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,660
to have and to hold for richer or poorer

932
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,460
in sickness and kinkiness

933
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,220
for the next year?

934
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,920
Say, say, I do.

935
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,180
I do!

936
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,400
Do you, Brandy, take this man, Glenn,

937
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,180
to be your lawful wedded husband

938
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,420
in short-duration subgenius matrimony

939
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,560
to have and to hold for richer or poorer

940
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,140
in sickness and kinkiness

941
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,620
for the next year?

942
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,380
Say, I do.

943
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:54,880
I do.

944
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,760
All right.

945
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,660
Now, shake on it,

946
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,000
and say, it's a deal.

947
00:48:59,220 --> 00:48:59,500
Woo!

948
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,040
Right now!

949
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,120
Now, get out,

950
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,000
oh, he's not,

951
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,740
oh, yeah, we're not over,

952
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,600
we're not finished yet.

953
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,220
We got a really important part,

954
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,580
the symbolic part's coming up.

955
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,320
Get out the ring.

956
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,580
You do have a ring, don't you?

957
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,860
Oh, the best man,

958
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,140
the best man here,

959
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,320
let's give a hand for the best man.

960
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,020
Yeah!

961
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:15,360
Yeah!

962
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,720
All right, um,

963
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,140
we take this ring,

964
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,480
give that to, uh, to Glenn,

965
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,200
and Glenn, you, uh,

966
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,960
and she inserts, uh,

967
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,400
her finger into the hole.

968
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,820
We take this,

969
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,240
we take this ring as a holy symbol

970
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,280
of the estate of marriage

971
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,220
as well as of the pole going deep

972
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,700
into the hole repeatedly, obviously.

973
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,640
By the authority invested in me,

974
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,080
by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

975
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,280
in defiance of the laws of the state

976
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,240
and of nature,

977
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,180
I pronounce you man and wife

978
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,500
for the next one year.

979
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,280
You must,

980
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,820
you must now kiss each other,

981
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,460
right in front of all these people.

982
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,720
Praise Bob!

983
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

984
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,980
This is so romantic.

985
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:58,840
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

986
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,580
Take it off.

987
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

988
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,080
Praise Bob!

989
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:04,940
Praise Bob!

990
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:05,940
Praise Bob!

991
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,820
Praise Bob!

992
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,540
Praise Bob!

993
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:07,660
Praise Bob!

994
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,960
You are now duly authorized

995
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,400
and excused for sexual couplings

996
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,000
of any perverse and unspeakable kind

997
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,900
for a period of one year.

998
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,540
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

999
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,860
it is done, amen, and a women.

1000
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:22,960
Praise Bob!

1001
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,820
Praise Bob!

1002
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,320
Praise Bob!

1003
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,140
The felicity of all marriages,

1004
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,880
and of all the rock and roll music,

1005
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,700
is obviously a meaning

1006
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,100
by which the white man

1007
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,100
is purely driven

1008
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,240
I'm in love with a nigga.

1009
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,200
If you talk to the average teenager of today...

1010
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,840
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is...

1011
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,560
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is...

1012
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,920
The obscenity of...

1013
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:26,840
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like...

1014
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:41,820
If you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like...

1015
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,960
The first thing they'll say is the beat, the beat, the beat.

1016
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,460
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it.

1017
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,460
I know what it does to you.

1018
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,660
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

1019
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,580
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels.

1020
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,900
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

1021
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,780
I know the...

1022
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,520
The last position.

1023
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,260
The end.

1024
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:19,940
The beat.

1025
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,540
Well, if you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock and roll music that they like...

1026
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,320
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing it.

1027
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,540
If you talk to the average teenager of today...

1028
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,720
If you talk to the average teenager of today...

1029
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:46,780
If you talk to the average teenager of today...

1030
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,900
If you talk to the average teenager of today...

1031
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:48,900


1032
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:48,900


1033
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:48,900


1034
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:48,900


1035
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:48,900


1036
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:49,920
The savage teenager of today.

1037
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,040
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1038
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,100
The beat, the beat, the beat.

1039
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,180
The evil feeling that you feel when you sing.

1040
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,500
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing.

1041
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,660
The spirit of the living can't be the...

1042
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,680
Come out! I said come out of this body!

1043
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,980
Come out of those muscles!

1044
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,280
Come out of those bones!

1045
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,640
Come out of that heart!

1046
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,820
I said come out!

1047
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,100
I said come out Satan!

1048
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,620
In the name of Jesus!

1049
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,320
Go!

1050
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,060
The same I will!

1051
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,760
The devils of hell!

1052
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,920
Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing.

1053
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,100
I know what it does to you.

1054
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,480
I know the evil feeling that you feel when you sing.

1055
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,660
I know the lost position that you get into when you feel it.

1056
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:58,400
I know the future and the record that you bring the faith back along.

1057
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,740
Even someone who has a

1058
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,600
The voice in your head¢

1059
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:15,700
With a texture in Your heart.

1060
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:20,740
Now, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1061
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,120
Come out, Arthur. Come out of this boat. Come out of this boat. Come out of this boat.

1062
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,600
Come out of that horse. Arthur, come out. Arthur, come out.

1063
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,380
In the name of Jesus.

1064
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,800
Come out of this boat.

1065
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,400
Come out of this boat.

1066
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,280
Come out of this boat.

1067
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,200
That's a cold, cold kind of hell.

1068
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,320
Cold in here.

1069
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,180
Wish I could light this here pipe.

1070
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,000
They gave me all the frappy in the world.

1071
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,740
And it's too cold to light this pipe.

1072
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,520
Oh, Bob, where are you now?

1073
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,220
Why'd you leave me in the hands of me?

1074
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:20,400
However, Bob will offer you eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1075
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:31,820
Which unfortunately gives some the image in their minds of Bob standing in the gates of hell handing out $60 checks.

1076
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,440
Well, that's real funny.

1077
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,700
I hope you boys are having a good time.

1078
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:40,200
I bet you thought I was a good guy.

1079
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,840
I bet this old church thing of yours is gonna be big, big fun.

1080
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,180
Big barrel of laughs.

1081
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,900
Oh, yeah.

1082
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:57,780
I bet you thought you were gonna be some kind of high school lawyer with that Bob fellow of yours.

1083
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,220
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

1084
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,960
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

1085
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:09,820
Uh...

1086
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,320
It's, uh, what, $60?

1087
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,900
One for you, Smith, one for you, Jones.

1088
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:21,920
And, uh, don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

1089
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1090
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,340
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1091
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,680
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1092
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,300
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to

1093
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,480
Got your pencil ready?

1094
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:47,200
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1095
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:54,720
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1096
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,740
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1097
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,300
Ah!

1098
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:02,300
Ah!

1099
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,640
Ah!

1100
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,320
Ah!

1101
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:06,960
Ah!

1102
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,840
Woof!

1103
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:09,700
Ah...

1104
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,780
Wellman...

1105
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,820
Dennis locked me in this little box.

1106
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,920
I can't feel anything.

1107
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,260
I can't see anything.

1108
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,840
It's totally black.

1109
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,420
I have no sensation in my hands.

1110
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,300
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

1111
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,780
I'm just in this little box.

1112
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,540
He said I could talk to you.

1113
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,660
He said you know what to do if you wanted to help me.

1114
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,920
Oh, God, help me, Peter Wellman.

1115
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,760
I promise I'll...

1116
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,940
I'll pay you all the royalties.

1117
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:44,440
royalties that I didn't tell you about. And whatever you want. I mean, anything. Tevis,

1118
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:50,720
you can have Tevis. Just get me out of this box, Wellman. Please, no, no. Don't believe what Paul

1119
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:57,120
told you. It's all a lie. It's all a lie. Whatever I did, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me out of the

1120
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:03,860
box, Wellman. I can't. This is a bad show, Wellman. This is a real bad show.

1121
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:11,720
No. She says she'd almost rather see me in Tevis than in nothing at all. Bright, perky,

1122
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:18,360
almost psychedelic. The Tevis line of fine men's undergarments. Underwear you'll never change.
