1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to announce the next attraction.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,840
I refer to the subgenius, Cowboy Dave.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,340
What?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:27,560
Oh, yes, dear friends, and thanks for the donations to help Lonesome Cowboy Dave last week that so many people sent in.

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:40,300
Now, please don't hate me for this, but this hour of Slack, number 1,779, is going to be all me talking and, to some extent, ranting from last year's Starwood Festival.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,160
And Princess Wee sings near the beginning.

7
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:55,920
In the old days, I would have broken this up into sections and interspersed it with thematically connected songs or other clips, but I must not spend too much time on one show.

8
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,060
No.

9
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,940
I really need my time for more book creation, or at least book reprints, something.

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:10,060
Besides, this particular Starwood rant was especially rambling and didn't really have any kind of sane sections.

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,980
I was working from some notes, but not any kind of prepared speech.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Also, and this is true, Vermin Supreme's pony had just dropped a big load of horse hockey on the stage next to my pulpit.

13
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,960
As we were getting set up.

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,780
Yes, presidential candidate Vermin Supreme was a guest also, and we made friends and hung out, and he gave me a tie.

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,040
It wasn't really his pony.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,100
Some locals brought him a pony and a goat so he could illustrate his campaign promise of a pony for everyone.

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,820
And we just adopted three stray kittens, and I want to get back to staring at them playing.

18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,040
So here's my last year.

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,800
Starwood rant, uninterrupted except where old news has been removed.

20
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,800
Price bother.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,300
Here we go.

22
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:14,620
We can't promise you a pony in Church of the Subgenius, but you might get one of these if you're lucky.

23
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,300
And look, it works for all kinds of ways.

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,500
Boys, girls, things.

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,540
Things.

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,560
Things.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,500
Do you dare to see the thing called it?

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,900
Well then stand by for the subgenius devival.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,240
Okay, friends, first off, thanks for sticking around.

30
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,840
I know the pony is kind of a draw.

31
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,900
But, as I was saying, stick with the Church of the Subgenius long enough.

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,440
You won't get a pony.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,520
You'll get one of these.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,960
Only it won't be the stuffed one.

35
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,540
A prairie squid, we call them.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,580
They're endangered.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,700
Thanks to people like me.

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:23,460
But before we get going here, I'd like you all to join me in a traditional moment, a somber, sober moment of, a quiet moment of sacred noise.

39
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,880
Pace Bob!

40
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,040
Pace Bob!

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Pace Dad!

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,160
I am God Bob!

43
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh, yes, oh the power.

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,320
The power!

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,460
I love the...

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,180
And I need it.

47
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,240
I need the power.

48
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,260
But first, Princess We-Are-Do.

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,740
And I have a a little song for you that's about Starwood and XDEI.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,060
Or rather, the XDEI drills,

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,020
which are the festival just preceding Starwood and XDEI.

52
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,020
I'll be Mr. Douglas and you'd be Lisa.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,580
Okay.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,700
That actually matches.

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:12,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,900
Head acres is no place to be.

57
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,580
Conspiracy is not for me.

58
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,280
Bad jobs that like to break my back.

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm going to X-Day and letting Bob give me slack.

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,700
Starwood is where I'd rather frock.

61
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,160
All night drumming, let it never stop.

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,920
I just adore the pagan's best.

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,000
Stang, I love you, but X-Day's a sausage fest.

64
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,540
The slack.

65
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,480
Kick back.

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,660
The weed.

67
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,900
The mead.

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,760
Why not do both?

69
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,140
And take off.

70
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
All our clothes.

71
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,600
Geek acres, we are there.

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,080
Neck, neck, neck.

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:17,200
We're going to spare you our two-hour version of the Who's Rock Opera, Tommy, which we've changed to be about our dog, Buddy.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,300
You won't get to hear that this year.

75
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,300
It's not quite ready.

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,060
On this.

77
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,180
Last year's Starwood.

78
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,520
For personal reasons.

79
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,460
We're glad you're back.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:41,820
By the way, if they ever decide to do a workshop in how not to assist in a suicide, I can help with that.

81
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,460
Anyway, yeah, it's been two years since I've been here, and there's all these big changes.

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,560
In me.

83
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,180
In me.

84
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,560
And this is where I'm going to.

85
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm going to talk about what.

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,760
What really concerns people of my age and generation.

87
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,820
My health.

88
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,660
Medicaid got mentioned.

89
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,140
Yeah, I turned 65 last summer.

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,460
And suddenly, I was on Medicaid.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,520
Suddenly, I went from Hercules to weak and doddering.

92
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,840
An endless snowball of pain.

93
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,640
It's.

94
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
It's as if all the.

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,540
Thousand natural shocks that flesh is aired to hit every single cell in my body at once.

96
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,380
All thousand of them.

97
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,400
And there's a hundred billion cells.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,940
So that's like it.

99
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,540
A hundred billion pains of a hundred billion pains.

100
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,440
Including Alzheimer's, arthritis and allergies.

101
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,440
And that's just in the A's.

102
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,380
So I could use a prescription for some Vim.

103
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,460
But I have faith.

104
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,480
The next day will come.

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,840
Yes.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
X day.

107
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,460
The promised solution to all our problems.

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,280
And what?

109
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Where do we go from here?

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,720
Well, when X day comes, my friends, the down home for real people will still have jobs.

111
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,720
But it'll be the jobs they wanted.

112
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,340
When X day comes.

113
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,240
If you have a secret.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,500
Wish.

115
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,120
That secret wish will come true.

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,980
When X day comes.

117
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:37,840
There'll be peace on earth and goodwill among the remaining men and ladies and such because only the peace ones will remain.

118
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,740
When X day comes, the warlock will be wiped out by the peaceniks.

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:51,300
When X day comes, class division will be based only on tastes in bands or art, fashion, tattoos.

120
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,620
And everybody will know it's all just a bunch of vain bull hockey.

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,940
When X day comes, medical care will be better than on Star Trek and completely free and automatic.

122
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,440
Unless you want to be sick.

123
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:16,540
And when X day comes, love will permeate the universe and everyone will put up with each other's irritating habits with fantastic patience and equanimity.

124
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,600
The mind your own business police will make sure everybody.

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,680
Let's bygones be bygones and just stays off of your lawn.

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:38,600
But until X day comes, the subgeniuses will party and bull and party and bull and party and bull.

127
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,080
All apologies due to the law.

128
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
The last poets who originally brought that up.

129
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,220
Made those statements about it.

130
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,440
A less understood minority group.

131
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,740
And I do have actual serious things to say about the problems of the world.

132
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,740
But first, I want to share with you a funny little.

133
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,340
Well, I'm going to let you have a peek inside a secret subgenius forum called the Mature Gentlemen's Club.

134
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,620
It only exists.

135
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,600
On a like a non Facebook, non Google.

136
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,740
One of those secret telegram or Mastodon or something.

137
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,700
We have a bunch of those.

138
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:37,120
And this one is such an August and limited secret society.

139
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,160
Not the only people in it are me.

140
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,940
Philo Drummond, my partner and own name, Kenner by Philo's brother, the Mature Gentlemen's Club.

141
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,120
Anyway, the other day, Onan said that he had changed a line from our.

142
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,020
A classic old subgenius pamphlet pamphlet number two.

143
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,400
Only only a buck over there.

144
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll let him go for the prop.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,140
What's printed on it?

146
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,840
Just because we love you.

147
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,160
We don't really, but we like you anyway.

148
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,900
Onan said that he'd had to change the line about more.

149
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
This was advertising for us.

150
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,620
More hate and intolerance than even the moral majority newsletter.

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,800
And.

152
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,500
Onan had changed that to more hate and intolerance than even the Internet.

153
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,160
Philo said, yeah, that's a lot more relevant because the moral majority is defunct.

154
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
Onan said.

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,600
The moral majority hated as hard as they could, so I won't slight them.

156
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,720
It's just that the Internet hates more in a modern sense.

157
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,100
And we hate even more than the Internet.

158
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,500
We hate the Internet and ourselves.

159
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,980
And we hate the hatred of ourselves.

160
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
So it's complete and all encompassing.

161
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,160
Cleans the slate.

162
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,380
Philo said, I agree, but I no longer hate myself.

163
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,700
Onan said, well, the hatred of yourself, hatred won out.

164
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,500
Philo said, yes, I love myself.

165
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,800
But for all the right reasons this time.

166
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,920
His brother, Sphinx Drummond said, I used to love hating myself.

167
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,180
Onan then suggested a new.

168
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,820
Pamphlet.

169
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,740
I forgot to hate sales pamphlet number three, 45 a.

170
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,320
And then he mentioned that Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz project.

171
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
A few of you might be familiar with him.

172
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,380
Used to live in Portland.

173
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,340
He hated about as hard as anyone I've met.

174
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,760
He had to move to Canada to hate less.

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,500
That's not hard to imagine because he lived in Texas.

176
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh.

177
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,180
Yeah.

178
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,280
Yeah.

179
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,280


180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,280


181
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,280


182
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,280


183
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,280


184
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,800
Philo said, I tried loving myself for all the wrong reasons.

185
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,680
But that was ultimately unfulfilling.

186
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,180
Onan asked, who then is the hater?

187
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,820
And who is the hated in a dance of self-hatred?

188
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,460
He was.

189
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,680
And he made that sound like it was a Nietzsche quote.

190
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,400
But it's not.

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,280
He made it up.

192
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,000
Philo said, oh, it's the kids parade.

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,280
Oh.

194
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,860
Oh.

195
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,280
Oh.

196
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,200
They always step on my slack.

197
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:23,940
No, they don't.

198
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,180
They're part of the slack.

199
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

200
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,000
Go kids.

201
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,120
Reproduce.

202
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,900
You got to fill in the empty blanks.

203
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,940
There's been a lot of holes left in our population lately, friends.

204
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,900
And we need them kids up there to get to work reproducing and making more little pagans and

205
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,480
yetis and subgeniuses.

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,120
Absolutely.

207
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,120
You're going to get more than me.

208
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,060
Um.

209
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,060
Um.

210
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,080
Um.

211
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,200
Um.

212
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,880
Um.

213
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,000
And onan said.

214
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,800
You've seen.

215
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,840
I think my hate levels were strongly correlated to make testosterone level.

216
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,720
I think that is also true of my foreign.

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,980
Famous stinky feet.

218
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,860
And onan said, hatred alone kept your feet from stinking worse.

219
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:17,360
And so, and I said all that earlier hate talk is giving me a hate on.

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,780
I'm dancing with a hate on.

221
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,180
And Philo said, I'm filled with too much love, too much tough love to hate.

222
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,420
I say don't hate those you berate.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:37,720
And I said that my problem was I have too much kinder, gentler hate to feel tough love.

224
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,120
This is such a ball busting routine.

225
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,380
Philo came back with my love is as tough as a crusty old cowboy boot.

226
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,740
His brother said my love is sweeter than bobs.

227
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,840
Onan said it was so very important to me to hate well when I was a younger subgenius.

228
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,580
I made sure to keep the flames alive for today's younger subgenie.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,100
They need to know about the conspiracy, especially the conspiracy inside your mind.

230
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,480
To which Sphinx Drummond said my hate is prettier than heaven.

231
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:29,120
And Philo said my love is stinkier than a pair of four week old gym socks.

232
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,680
And now that those kids are mostly gone, I can go ahead and finish this up.

233
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
This will be censored for the radio version.

234
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,100
My love is so stinky it hurts.

235
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,100


236
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,100


237
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,140
My love has its own butt, said Philo.

238
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,040
His brother said my love is so hungry it eats its own butt.

239
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:58,420
That's why my love's butt is so stinky, Philo said, because it only eats other butts.

240
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,900
And I said I'm going to steal this whole spouting session and deliver it as a rant at Starwood.

241
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
Prophecy fulfilled.

242
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,520
To which Philo threw in one last...

243
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,740
Question.

244
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:23,580
If you were Keanu Reeves and you accidentally married an orangutan, would you let it watch you take a dump?

245
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,480
So there's some questions to ask yourself, friends, as you move forward through life.

246
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,660
I do have some immediate actual news.

247
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm going to tell you about the church and subgenius.

248
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,160
Number one, somebody made a movie about us and it came out really good.

249
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,840
We were...

250
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,880
Some...

251
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,840
Most of us were surprised.

252
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,760
I wasn't.

253
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,460
I had...

254
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,380
I really had faith.

255
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,580
And the director, Sandy Boone...

256
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,100
Sandy is the widow of an ancient subgenius who died a long time ago, but she never forgot.

257
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
And she started...

258
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,080
Well, she was smart because the true story behind it all is actually really interesting.

259
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,160
And we're not all going to be around to tell them stories forever.

260
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:34,100
There's a lot of people making movies about old weirdos and underground cartoonists and artists and such for that very reason.

261
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,480
And that's a good idea.

262
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,260
Furman's got a movie about him.

263
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:48,900
And we can't show the subgenius movie, which, by the way, has the very creative title of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

264
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,480
We can't show it because it's still in film festivals.

265
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,080
It was shown at South by Southwest.

266
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,860
The audience loved it.

267
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,340
I loved it.

268
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,900
Well, of course, I meant it a lot, so I would.

269
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,280
But, I mean, the other subgeniuses did, too.

270
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,240
And it was at the Disney.

271
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,340
It was at the Dallas Film Festival.

272
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Then the San Francisco Indie Film Fest.

273
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,600
And it just showed in Galway, Ireland.

274
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,020
I think Melbourne, Australia is coming up.

275
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,220
And then Montreal, Canada.

276
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,260
So some people think it's good.

277
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:29,000
And I believe that it will probably be on Netflix or something before the end of the year.

278
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,240
They still don't have a distributor.

279
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,860
I don't even have a copy.

280
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,640
But I think it's a better recruitment film than the one we did called Arise.

281
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,120
Available over there.

282
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,380
Arise is kind of preaching to the saved.

283
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,780
Only somebody who's already a subgenius can even bear the first 15 minutes of it.

284
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,580
And that's before it even starts.

285
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,420
That's just the instructions and warnings and caution labels.

286
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,340
So that is really good news.

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,340
And we're hoping to get lots of new blood.

288
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,600
We need that.

289
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,580
Meanwhile, Dr. Drummond has a subgenius television.

290
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,240
Channel.

291
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,920
It's a part of the OSI 74 network on Roku.

292
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,740
So you kind of either have to have one of those little Roku sticks.

293
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,880
They're about 30 bucks.

294
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,260
Or look at the same stuff on Vimeo.com for free.

295
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,020
He's playing not only our older films and shorts, which are available at the sales table over there.

296
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,920
But several different types of collections.

297
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,420
But also.

298
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,280
Weird lost underground collections of clips by weird collectors of weird clips.

299
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,280
Including the hypnotic eye, the late Joe Riley show.

300
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,500
And a bunch of other stuff.

301
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,700
It's really eye melting.

302
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,100
And if you aren't on drugs when you see it, you might as well be.

303
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
Because of what this stuff does to you.

304
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,120
So be careful.

305
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,560
Other news.

306
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,940
We started publishing books again.

307
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,560
We didn't stop.

308
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,840
We didn't start with a subgenius book.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,980
We started with a science fiction book by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

310
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,720
The great radio spouter.

311
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Kind of like my spouting buddy on Hour of Slack.

312
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:26,040
And you know, he has a very original way of talking.

313
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,780
That I usually don't really understand until I'm listening to the playback.

314
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm faking it during the shows.

315
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,560
In fact, I'm faking everything because I'm almost totally stoned deaf.

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,980
So whenever I act like I'm replying to something a person says, it's just a lucky guess usually.

317
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,600
But they don't expect sense.

318
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
So that doesn't matter.

319
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, and the last of all.

320
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,700
Anyway, yeah.

321
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,260
Neighbor World is for sale over there.

322
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,800
It's paperback.

323
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,560
You can hide it on your person even if you're in prison.

324
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,960
It'll roll up that paper.

325
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,200
It's a paperback type.

326
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,500
I've had to learn a lot more about that kind of thing lately.

327
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,780
But as Bob once said to me while worshiping Moloch, I only believe in two things.

328
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,140
Santa Claus and the fact that he doesn't exist.

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,260
That's the kind of wisdom you can expect from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

330
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,300
He also said, oh wait, you know what I really should do?

331
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,640
There may be a few people here who don't really know exactly what Church of the Subgenius is.

332
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, it took Sandy Boone an entire 90-minute movie to explain it.

333
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,060
She did a really good job.

334
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:51,120
And I think that a lot of people here will like the ending of it because it actually tackles that whole where do we go from here thing quite well.

335
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,060
If you're a MAGA hat wearing Trumpaloompa, you probably won't like the end of it.

336
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,940
I have friends who are Trumpaloompas.

337
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,800
Relatives.

338
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,220
And I actually understand where they're coming from.

339
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,720
They're coming from cartoon land.

340
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,380
But, yeah.

341
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,460
This book, I'm going to read a little bit.

342
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Normally I don't read from our books.

343
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,140
But this one's been out of print since right after it was first printed.

344
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,800
It was our latest one put together in 2006.

345
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,920
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack.

346
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,920
The Bobliotica.

347
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,060
The New Revolutions from Bob Dobbs.

348
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,940
The Church of the Subgenius.

349
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
Slack with a Vengeance.

350
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:49,900
After the Book of the Subgenius and Revelation X, finally comes the third testament of the living avatar of Slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

351
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,520
As Robert Anton Wilson said, this is one of the best of all the one true religions.

352
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,540
R. Crumb said, finally a religion even I can believe in.

353
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:08,240
And Mark Mothersbaugh said, Bob is the enema for a constipated society.

354
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,100
A masterpiece for those who can still laugh at the fact that nothing is funny anymore.

355
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:20,680
Now what that one guy in the previous panel said from the audience, basically going, you guys are just trumping.

356
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Off up here and selling your books, which I didn't quite get because nobody had mentioned anything about that.

357
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,180
I was trumping.

358
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,440
Because I knew that I'd get to do it for another hour or so.

359
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,460
I knew that I'd get to do it for another hour or so.

360
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:39,700
But as Voltaire said, don't go telling everybody else how to plant their garden until you've mowed your own damn lawn.

361
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,500
So, you know, we're kind of teaching by example.

362
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,020
And really my job is to keep a few geniuses from committing suicide.

363
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,380
Honestly, I really do believe that that's a lot of my job.

364
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:59,440
Is to just cut them some slack at a point in their lives when they need it at the worst.

365
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,420
And the reason I think that's a lot of my job is to just cut them some slack at a point in their lives when they need it at the worst.

366
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,780
But I believe that it's a good job is because I get a lot of letters saying that,

367
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,020
But I believe that it's a good job is because I get a lot of letters saying that,

368
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,820
not just to me but to the general sub-genius group in general.

369
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,060
—We have been able to somehow hit people at just the right time.

370
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,180
Sometimes it didn't have anything to do with our books—they just walked into a public restroom

371
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,360
sometimes it didn't have anything to do with our books—they just walked into a public restroom

372
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,380
intending to overdose themselves or something out of despair,

373
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:25,660


374
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,140
and there would be one of those stupid Dobbs heads stuck on the underside of a toilet seat.

375
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,260
and there would be one of those stupid Dobbs heads stuck on the underside of a toilet seat,

376
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,400
certainty.

377
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,460
just when they're about to drown themselves in there.

378
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,500
And the absurdity of that was enough to make them go,

379
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,680
okay, that's a sign.

380
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,020
God or Bob's going to kill me anyway.

381
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,560
I might as well let them do it.

382
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,260
They're professionals.

383
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,840
I'm an amateur by definition.

384
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,120
I'll probably screw it up.

385
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,140
There are times when it probably would be the best idea to kill yourself.

386
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,320
But check with me first.

387
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,340
There's right ways and wrong ways.

388
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,420
I missed last Starwood because of a wrong way.

389
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,440
Anyway, the publisher's advisory on this book says,

390
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,160
be careful who sees you holding this book.

391
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,580
The divine program from a source not of this world

392
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,180
can yet be known to mortals if they have enough money.

393
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,080
The bibliography on liturgies and gospels of the church of the subgenius,

394
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,280
the perfect self-validating philosophy.

395
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,320
That's amazing.

396
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,700
It's actually a joke because it pulls the rug out from under its own philosophies constantly.

397
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,620
There are self-validating philosophies.

398
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,820
And that's my friends, the Trumpalumpas.

399
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,260
They've got a perfect...

400
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,920
And it's not Trump's fault.

401
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,200
Trump's just a symptom.

402
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,540
It's been going on for a long, long time.

403
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,160
And very surprisingly well planned.

404
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,000
And of course,

405
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,680
the easiest thing to say is Fox News and fake internet news.

406
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,680
And yeah, thanks to the internet,

407
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,420
you can validate anything you want to believe.

408
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,540
You can find 10,000 other maniacs out there

409
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,360
that think that same wrong thought that makes you feel so good.

410
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,800
And that's the problem, if you ask me, part of it.

411
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,420
This is real.

412
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,340
Everything you know is true.

413
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,980
Bob is the priest.

414
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,240
This is the truth.

415
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,180
And down in very small print it says,

416
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,080
some animals were harmed in the making of this ecosystem.

417
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,760
So yeah.

418
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,120
I.e. the conspiracy thinks it can own everything.

419
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,760
We must stop them, even if it means owning everything else.

420
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,440
Trademark.

421
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,100
To this end, the followering zombobs,

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,660
trademark,

423
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,920
toiled day and night to implement this Dobbshead online system,

424
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,960
repentant,

425
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,460
entertainment,

426
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,780
a valiant attempt by dozens of subgenius artists and writers

427
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,400
to save those last few hundred thousand souls

428
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,940
from condage before the advance of X day.

429
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,980
I don't even remember most of this stuff.

430
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,240
I'll have to read this someday.

431
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,440
So there, if you're down in the trumps,

432
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,420
about President Cartman and his fans,

433
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,960
you know, I had a horrible day.

434
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,920
I had a horrible vision of Trump fans.

435
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,820
They're kind of like Howard Stern fans.

436
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,740
He is their testicles.

437
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,440
The loud man on the radio is their bobs.

438
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,020
Well, no, testicles.

439
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,820
They are nuts.

440
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,520
They have no bobs.

441
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,900
They follow this nut because he is the only way they can get their bobs.

442
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,460
Korea and Russia,

443
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,080
can do whatever they want.

444
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,840
They can just walk up and grab our country by the pussy.

445
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,100
And they grabbed the pussy.

446
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,680
One thing that came up towards the end of that panel discussion

447
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,940
heard on the previous hour of Slack

448
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,820
was the fact that the whole, not just the internet,

449
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:27,180
but all electronics could be shut down almost instantaneously,

450
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,400
either by the magnetic pulse from nuclear exchange,

451
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,160
or Mother Nature could do it.

452
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,140
Solar storms have happened in the distant past

453
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,020
that were strong enough to pretty much disable all electronics.

454
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,340
You'd have to remake everything from scratch,

455
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,580
which would take a long time.

456
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,220
We were talking about that.

457
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,580
Actually, that happens at the end of a wonderful movie

458
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,160
called Escape from L.A.

459
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,420
He pushes the button and shuts down all the electronics

460
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,820
and even all the,

461
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,020
then that vape pipe would go out, Fat Mandy.

462
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,780
Your vape pipe would go out.

463
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,680
The movie ends with him lighting a wooden match,

464
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,600
you know, old-style paper match.

465
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,260
When was the last time you saw one of those?

466
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,460
When that day comes,

467
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,220
25 years later, there won't be anyone left in America

468
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,340
but bikers and Amish.

469
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,820
Because they're the only ones who know how to live without all this crap.

470
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,820
And 25 years after that,

471
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,160
the entire population could be described as Amish bikers.

472
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,880
And if that's the way it goes,

473
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
that more power to them.

474
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,320
I've ended up with an odd little big man kind of life.

475
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,340
I was raised a fairly pampered little white boy in the 50s

476
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,080
with not a rich family,

477
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
but a middle-class family.

478
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,480
My dad was a lawyer.

479
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,260
But then after I left home,

480
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,540
I ended up living on Lakota Reservation in South Dakota

481
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,880
for two years.

482
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,680
First as a documentary guy, but then as a school teacher.

483
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,460
We hung around because I kind of liked it there.

484
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,940
Although I didn't,

485
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,140
we didn't know until we got back to Dallas

486
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,180
just how twin peaks we had gotten

487
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,640
living in that tiny rural community.

488
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,040
And Indian reservations,

489
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:33,780
or in this case the Sechangu Oyanke Reservation, Rosebud,

490
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,900
it was extra weird and creepy.

491
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,100
That was where I learned that

492
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,640
I can't see a UFO when everybody else can.

493
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,540
I can't see a ghost when everybody else can.

494
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,660
The damn UFOs and ghosts came in and abducted me and hypnotized me,

495
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,540
so I'd always think that that kind of thing was just a dream,

496
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,560
a night-hack dream.

497
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Or, you know, sure there's unexplained things going on,

498
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
I don't question that.

499
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,920
I just question the explanation people have for them.

500
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,500
Why do we have to know?

501
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,840
Who said we have to know what the purpose of life is?

502
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,620
It didn't come with an instruction book

503
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,020
until the book of the subgenius!

504
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,200
Yeah, okay, I lived in an Indian reservation,

505
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,840
and I lived in a mostly Hispanic, Mexican neighborhood in Dallas,

506
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,120
real low income,

507
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,180
for 20 years.

508
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,380
And then I lived in a really poor black neighborhood in Cleveland for a long time,

509
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,160
and now I live in a middle class, really mixed neighborhood.

510
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,120
That house is still for sale, by the way.

511
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,140
It's really nice.

512
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,000
It's of historical significance.

513
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,500
Subgenius Foundation operated out of there for 25 years,

514
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,940
and of course it's got to be haunted,

515
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,960
but that doesn't do me any good!

516
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,180
I can't see them!

517
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,660
Anyway, my dad died in his big house on this ranch.

518
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,900
It's not really that big of a house,

519
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,220
but it's a big ranch.

520
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,060
It suddenly became mine.

521
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,120
And I never thought that I could live in rural Texas,

522
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,180
especially not my wife and her mom,

523
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,520
who are much bigger libtards than me.

524
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,280
She's really a peace activist,

525
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,700
although I've tried to teach her about human nature.

526
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,440
I kind of have wrecked it for her, I think.

527
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,660
But the horrible political news from Texas,

528
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,200
I mean, I would sit there in Cleveland every morning

529
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,260
and read the stuff from Texas that was going on,

530
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,060
and it's just, I thought, I could never go back there.

531
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,320
I mean, it's just too primitive.

532
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,820
Well, when your feet are on the ground,

533
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,100
and you've actually been there a while,

534
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,700
it's totally different than the,

535
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,930
the city monger Facebook reader's view of rural America.

536
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,570
We sophisticates like to laugh at stuff

537
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,530
like the Creationist Museum in Kentucky,

538
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,290
the one that's designed to be an exact replica of Noah's Ark,

539
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,930
but they can't get flood insurance for it,

540
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,190
and they've already had it wrecked by flooding,

541
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,210
and it was paid for by the taxpayers.

542
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,790
Church of the Subgenius isn't even a nonprofit group,

543
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,970
because we don't think that your taxes should go to a religion

544
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,150
that you might not support.

545
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,350
Plus, we wouldn't be able to get away with it.

546
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,890
But we have a Creationist Museum in my little small town,

547
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,290
Glen Rose, Texas.

548
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:42,310
There's a Creationist Museum that is so fantastically stupid.

549
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:44,850
It's wonderful.

550
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:51,110
Oh, God, you feel so superior walking through there

551
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,950
and looking at these very obviously fake dinosaur tracks

552
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,990
with a fake human track in the middle of it.

553
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,590
Oh, that's where the pre-Adamic man was fleeing the deluge.

554
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,850
And the dinosaur was faster.

555
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:03,870
It went through there first,

556
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,890
then the humans landed in there afterwards.

557
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:08,990
Then, of course, the deluge came and turned all the sand into rock

558
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,990
and made the Grand Canyon,

559
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,810
just to trick them science peoples.

560
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,830
Well, we're fighting back.

561
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:23,030
I don't have bumper stickers on my car in rural Texas

562
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,730
or in urban Cleveland,

563
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,170
but we fight back quietly.

564
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,350
I'm designing a rival for the Creationist Museum.

565
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,930
It's called the Destructionist Museum,

566
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,810
the Destructionist Evidence Museum and Sanitarium

567
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,910
in Glen Rose, Texas.

568
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,230
And we already have unearthed and have on display

569
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,790
a collection of these things.

570
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,290
We have fossil skeletons

571
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,590
from the Cretaceous period of prehistoric devils.

572
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,430
We have a fossil skeleton of a robot

573
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,290
from 100 million years ago.

574
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,050
We have a gray alien skeleton.

575
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,010
We think he's responsible for the robot.

576
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,070
And two cave subgeniuses that we're calling Adam and Eve

577
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,490
because, you know, that's what people want,

578
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,190
but it's really Adam and Steve.

579
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,350
And the wreck of Noah's Ark,

580
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,730
which actually did sink at the site

581
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,690
of what's now the Paluxy River.

582
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,150
There's not much left of it, but that's it.

583
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,090
Only a superstitious, gullible idiot

584
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,830
would think it was in Turkey on Mount Ararat.

585
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,630
We have ghost dinosaur tracks,

586
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,410
the tracks of ghost dinosaurs,

587
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,950
which by definition are blurry.

588
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,130
We also have solid live dinosaur tracks.

589
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,830
They're a little blurry too,

590
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:51,550
but the ghost dinosaur tracks are really clear as such.

591
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,750
And of course, we'll have road signs

592
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,030
all up and down the road,

593
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,750
Burma-shaped style, you know,

594
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,470
turn around, you missed the thing,

595
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,790
only $5, do you dare,

596
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,050
man eating chicken, all that.

597
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,510
Oh, and we have a,

598
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,410
we even have a little novelty,

599
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,070
ejaculope.

600
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,090
Those are real creatures, by the way.

601
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,290
People think that's some rural legend,

602
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,530
jackalopes or ejaculopes.

603
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,550
But this one has,

604
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,530
it's like you pull its little mounted stuffed penis

605
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,310
and it dispenses fortunes.

606
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,110
And they are real fortunes.

607
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,050
So far they've been uncannily

608
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,990
Twilight Zone-like.

609
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,230
So anyway, if I lived entirely in the Internet,

610
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,610
I would think that rural America

611
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,530
was composed of caveman,

612
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,430
chagladites,

613
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,110
and of course, about half of rural America

614
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,250
is just as urban America is.

615
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,250
Heck, I'm,

616
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,050
I've got a lot more Neanderthal blood

617
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,410
in me than most people.

618
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,910
My DNA test showed, so

619
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,290
I'm not proud.

620
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,370
I'm real proud, actually,

621
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,510
of that very fact.

622
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,090
But you start seeing this,

623
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,490
well, the polarization has been

624
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,250
worse than I've ever seen it,

625
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,690
and I actually have been a news hound

626
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,910
since I was a kid, practically.

627
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,870
And I've never seen it this bad.

628
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,570
And it's like rural versus urban.

629
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,890
City people think the country people

630
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,570
are just all dumbasses.

631
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:27,010
And believe me, the country people think

632
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,050
that city people live in hell holes of crime.

633
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:34,170
You can't go out anywhere at night

634
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,970
without somebody trying to mug you.

635
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,710
And there's morphodites everywhere,

636
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,810
just humping on each other in the streets.

637
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,950
Actually, that's true in both places.

638
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,270
It always has been.

639
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,470
You know, they just,

640
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,790
yeah, yeah, there's been cow

641
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,410
of all kinds out in the woods.

642
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,370
You know,

643
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,630
the Baptists just don't brag about it

644
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,210
as much as the city people do.

645
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,170
But I've, you know, I've ended up,

646
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,090
I know why they voted for Trump.

647
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,490
And it is because they lived in a cartoon world

648
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,290
composed of Fox News and the Internet,

649
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,490
and just everything they know

650
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,170
is what their friends say to them.

651
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,330
That's just as true of a libtard such as myself,

652
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,150
except for the fact that I'm aware of that,

653
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,130
and I really try hard to,

654
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:31,090
number one, I will not watch news

655
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,430
on television of any kind.

656
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,950
I've never watched The Daily Show

657
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,390
or The Rachel Maddow Show.

658
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,250
I've seen clips of whenever subgenius was mentioned.

659
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,670
But I deliberately just read everything.

660
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,230
Consequently, I can't pronounce the names

661
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,670
of half the new presidential candidates correctly,

662
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,470
but I remember more details about why I would want to.

663
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,050
The country people get really tired

664
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,710
of being depicted as Cletus,

665
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,930
or, you know, some buck-toothed yokel

666
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,930
in cartoons and movies,

667
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:05,750
and that happens.

668
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,470
And city people, of course, laugh at their

669
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,670
cartoon-like ideas of what liberals cite each other.

670
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,430
You turn on the radio or the TV,

671
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,790
and for some reason,

672
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,270
the most popular shows are full of lies,

673
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,270
and yet their fans call everything else

674
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,890
the lane-stream news or main-stream news.

675
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,710
Now, I thought Rush Limbaugh

676
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,390
was like the most popular radio personality,

677
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:39,330
and Fox is the most watched news network.

678
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,910
Who's the main-stream?

679
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,250
Suckers!

680
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,130
You know, good God!

681
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,730
Get your head out of your...

682
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,690
That's like the people calling each other sheeple,

683
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,050
or, you know,

684
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,030
oh, that person's just not woke.

685
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,570
I hate crap like that!

686
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,850
They're just put-downs for somebody who's just

687
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,330
practically saying to you

688
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,110
you just don't like their approach.

689
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,430
You know, woke, what does that mean?

690
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,010
Oh, awakened, enlightened,

691
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,030
according to me and my friends

692
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,830
who sit around reminding each other all the time

693
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,910
that we believe all the right things.

694
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,830
There's nothing wrong with that,

695
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,670
unless that's all you ever do.

696
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,450
You know, I mean, go ahead and light a candle

697
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,870
for those poor people in the concentration camps

698
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,530
on the border,

699
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,450
but are you sure that's the best place

700
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,130
to light that candle?

701
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,950
Isn't there a little more than just, you know,

702
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,090
saying, look, I'm on the good guy's side?

703
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,570
No, no, not unless you actually get off your ass.

704
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,290
But first, Bob's first rule of magic,

705
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,370
get off your ass.

706
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,370
Absolutely the basic.

707
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,550
Magic is real if you follow Bob's rules.

708
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,570
Get off your ass.

709
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,690
Watch your ass.

710
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,710
Wash your ass.

711
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:02,830
Your ass.

712
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,290
I actually got that one from Red Fox.

713
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,430
Anyway, you know what I'm saying.

714
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:10,110
It's not all face-f***ing buzzards

715
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,270
and feral rednecks

716
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,350
in the rural lands.

717
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,970
And the things that they keep telling me

718
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,910
that liberals say,

719
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:23,570
I've actually almost never heard anyone say,

720
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,830
except those right-wingers

721
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,370
saying what liberals say.

722
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,350
Don't believe anything

723
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,430
you see or hear or read.

724
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,290
Wait a minute, that's not very hopeful.

725
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,630
But here's what is hopeful.

726
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,870
Stereotypes are evil.

727
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,830
Stereotypes are the dumbest thing in the world.

728
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,050
And that whole thing about duality,

729
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,930
it's a lie.

730
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,290
Why not both?

731
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,970
Why not all three, four, five, or six?

732
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,330
You know, I mean, there's room for everything, obviously.

733
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,330
And except for, you know,

734
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,790
taking away other folks' slack.

735
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,130
There's not really room for that.

736
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,830
But that's the, you know,

737
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,430
we're not PC, either,

738
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,490
by either definition.

739
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,990
If we think something's stupid,

740
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,670
we'll just come out and say it's stupid.

741
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:15,370
As Bob said, though,

742
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,990
but we're only hurting the feelings of idiots.

743
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,250
That could include, I mean,

744
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,070
idiots?

745
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,170
Isn't that, I mean, that's an ugly term.

746
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,650
Morons.

747
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,830
We prefer subgenius.

748
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,210
It's much more politically correct

749
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,790
and empowering, you know.

750
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,830
But yeah.

751
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,090
Sheeple is what sheeple call sheep.

752
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,150
Hipster is what hipsters call hipsters they don't like.

753
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:52,470
And woke is what sleepwalkers call themselves.

754
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,550
Otherwise, they would know better than to brag like that.

755
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,350
If you have to tell the world

756
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,910
that you're a stable genius,

757
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:02,810
you're probably an unstable moron.

758
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,150
And I've heard this said so many times.

759
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,430
Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man,

760
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,250
a dumb man's idea of a smart man,

761
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,250
and a poor man's idea of a rich man.

762
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,030
And that all kind of sums it up.

763
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,530
For me, it's kind of a cartoon,

764
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,210
as he said,

765
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,530
but I'm president and you're not.

766
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,230
Uh,

767
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,330
people take things at face value.

768
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,190
But they pick the wrong face.

769
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,810
Oh, there's supposed to be the right face.

770
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:35,710
It's supposed to be up there,

771
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,750
but it's too bright.

772
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,150
The fish face!

773
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,190
It's a face-based religion, my friends.

774
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,070
We are here to, uh,

775
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,170
well, anyway.

776
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,550
I'll get to a real rant now.

777
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,270
It's hard for me to write a proper pissed-off rant

778
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,570
because I actually did achieve slack.

779
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,070
Relatively.

780
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,970
I've got it pretty good.

781
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,790
I started out this rant complaining about my

782
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,050
rheumatism and everything,

783
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,330
but actually, I'm still alive.

784
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,030
And I got old, but not bitter.

785
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,830
I'm not really that crotchety about things.

786
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,610
Unless, you know,

787
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,550
my back hurts.

788
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,410
But the younger kids are,

789
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,870
still have that fire in their bellies.

790
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,890
And this is a rant,

791
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,490
I'm going to end this with this rant,

792
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,370
by Reverend Baby Bear,

793
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,890
who is a young woman,

794
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,330
I think she's still in Columbus, Ohio,

795
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,550
somewhere.

796
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,170
And, uh,

797
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,350
she was going to deliver this

798
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,970
at that Winter Star Ball

799
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,790
that our friend A.J. died at.

800
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,830
And she got there ready to deliver a comedy thing,

801
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:50,110
and man, it was not the place to do a comedy thing.

802
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,630
But A.J. would,

803
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,230
always wanted to hear that rant too.

804
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,790
So hopefully he is listening in.

805
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:01,070
And maybe Dr., my friend Dr. Leguim is,

806
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,010
and Dr. Dark and Heath.

807
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,490
It's been a really bad, really bad year.

808
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,370
The, uh, men from Planet X have been coming every year,

809
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,830
but they, they just take a few of us,

810
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,250
or they take pieces of us.

811
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,950
Like my immune system,

812
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,770
my morals, my, uh, energy.

813
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,250
Okay, anyway, Baby Bear rant.

814
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,530
Listen up, you yetis.

815
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,590
I've got a subgenius bone to pick with you.

816
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,590
How many of you are paying attention?

817
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,830
How many of you can actually put down the fork,

818
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:35,590
or the controller, or the remote,

819
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:38,770
or the computer mouse for five dobs-forsaken minutes

820
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,390
and listen?

821
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,790
How many of you can scream?

822
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,090
Can you hear me scream?

823
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,530
If not, you certainly aren't paying enough attention.

824
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,510
You couldn't possibly be paying enough attention

825
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,690
to your surroundings

826
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,590
if you aren't on the verge of screaming

827
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,130
every second spent in this modern,

828
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,450
blasphemous cacophony of anti-slack.

829
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,630
We are trapped in the damn bizarro subgenius world.

830
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,330
Isn't it obvious?

831
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,370
Doesn't it seem a little too perfectly aligned against us,

832
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,210
as if it was all created to be the oil to our water,

833
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,350
the kryptonite to our Superman,

834
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,250
the stiletto heel to our waterbed?

835
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,670
If it doesn't seem that way,

836
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:25,130
then you haven't been paying any attention.

837
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,150
But you're in luck,

838
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,870
because Bob doesn't care that you pay attention.

839
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,290
He only cares that you pay your money.

840
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,690
But is that really enough?

841
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,350
Thirty-five dollars once to the foundation,

842
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,130
subgenius foundation,

843
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,530
for a lifetime's worth of art and music and bulldada?

844
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,750
Like any good salesman,

845
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,150
Bob included some fine print in his contract.

846
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,030
Sure, thirty-five will get you a seat

847
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,430
in the nosebleeds of the saucers

848
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,730
and your own little rinky-dink planet.

849
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:01,910
No pick-up service included,

850
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,710
supplies are limited, act now, then wait for X day.

851
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,770
But is that really all you want out of life?

852
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,490
To be a spectator, to be a looky-loo,

853
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,770
to rubber-neck the bounties of life

854
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,410
from the comfort of your armchair,

855
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,950
to soak up the effort and creativity

856
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,870
of other yetis like a sponge,

857
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,130
like I'm doing now?

858
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,130
Is that really going to bring you down?

859
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:22,490
Then you slap.

860
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,390
Ain't no one ever died wishing they'd have tried less.

861
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,510
No one ever died regretting how much fun they had,

862
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:32,690
unless maybe that fun killed them,

863
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,970
and if so, Bob speed to them.

864
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,790
There's no shame in living yourself to death,

865
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,450
but in order to do that,

866
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,490
you have to get up and live.

867
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,010
This ain't no Sunday church picnic,

868
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,270
and it ain't the damn buffet line.

869
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,970
We don't want to get your asses

870
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:52,730
in the pews.

871
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,050
We want them jumping out of the pews.

872
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:58,130
There certainly ain't no stadium seating,

873
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:02,070
cushioned chairs, and no damn VIP section.

874
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,850
This is the religious pit,

875
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,670
and we don't need permission to mosh our asses off.

876
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,850
We are the demonstrably monstrous.

877
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,690
We are the incredibly incredulous.

878
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,930
We are a pack of vehement behemoths.

879
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,090
Our fervor leaves them out in the cold,

880
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:25,850
but only until X-Day,

881
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,570
when we put the heat back out on them.

882
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,090
We want you out of your seat.

883
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,290
We want to see you live and die on your feet.

884
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:35,850
So you know the drill.

885
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,150
X-Day's a-comin'.

886
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:41,050
So get off your ass and show you're worth something.

887
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,170
Praise Bob.

888
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,950
Praise Reverend Baby Bear for saying that wonderful rant.

889
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,550
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.

890
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,490
Or writing it.

891
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,950
And I guess now it's a Q&A.

892
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,130
I skipped over the part that I usually do

893
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,990
where I read from the Starwood guidebook

894
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,530
and make fun of all the corny or interesting

895
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:05,130
or funny workshop names out of context,

896
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,950
but they weren't really all that outrageous this time.

897
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:11,910
There were some pretty funny ones,

898
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,710
but I left them in my briefcase.

899
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,130
Well, I think another dev said,

900
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:18,410
Gene,

901
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:21,030
Professor Chaz started saying,

902
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,730
you know,

903
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,250
are we really going to sit around and wait for aliens

904
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,390
to give us a whole new planet?

905
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,250
No, not really.

906
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,010
We're already on a spaceship.

907
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,330
Let's just swab the decks of the one we're on,

908
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,210
keep it ship-shaped,

909
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,730
build your own ship,

910
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,630
mow your damn lawn before you tell somebody else

911
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:37,770
what to plant in their garden,

912
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:38,790
you know,

913
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,870
and praise Bob.

914
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,310
And mind your own business or we'll kill you.

915
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,910
And we all get to go to that bonfire tonight.

916
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,570
So that's pretty slapful.

917
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,670
I no longer carry those torches.

918
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,750
I used to be in part of the parade.

919
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,650
The one time they let me and Princess Weed lead it,

920
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,550
we went the wrong way.

921
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,290
But it turned out to be the right way

922
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,170
because the original right way was so muddy,

923
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,130
everybody would have died.

924
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,830
So, yeah, our accident, as often happens,

925
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,230
turned out to be good luck for everybody.

926
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,450
So, but we won't be around to save you this time.

927
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,110
I won't.

928
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,470
She will.

929
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,570
No, there's got to be questions.

930
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:28,950
Of some kind.

931
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,370
Maybe not.

932
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:33,490
How are your disorders on secret power?

933
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:37,610
Okay, now, I really am deaf,

934
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,570
so somebody's going to have to translate that down the...

935
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,170
How are your disorders on secret power?

936
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,290
Oh, oh, that's right.

937
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,210
Oh, you must have read the...

938
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,110
The Indian program book.

939
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:51,190
That's right.

940
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,030
Where did I...

941
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,130
How did I skip over that?

942
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,150
That's odd.

943
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,130
Oh, yeah, there it is.

944
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,690
Yeah, the conspiracy, the normals,

945
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,150
they try to put you down

946
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,410
because of your superpowers.

947
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:10,050
But, you know, some of us know how the X-Men feel.

948
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,290
We may not have very valuable powers.

949
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,270
You know, they may be pretty half-assed powers,

950
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:22,910
like the power to send a fax just using your voice.

951
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,610
My daughter could do that.

952
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,510
Or the power to go...

953
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:34,170
I have obsessive-compulsive talent, I think.

954
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,550
I mean, it certainly has helped my job situation over the years.

955
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,190
I actually kind of like doing mindless,

956
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,730
either manual or mental labor,

957
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,490
as long as it's tedious and repetitive enough.

958
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,550
Thank goodness.

959
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,230
Some people go crazy from having to do that.

960
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,450
Well, it's my...

961
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:54,810
It's...

962
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,050
Yeah, the conspiracy could say I'm on a spectrum or something,

963
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,910
some spectrum or another.

964
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,590
Yeah, it's my superpower.

965
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,030
I can concentrate better than the rest of the dumbasses.

966
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,810
I can keep working when there's a baby squalling.

967
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,670
Oh, no, that's my baby.

968
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:13,210
Shit.

969
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:16,590
I never should have left it on the oven.

970
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:23,030
We have a friend who's on some spectrum,

971
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:25,950
and he can't talk, really.

972
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:32,590
He can get his needs across with certain grunts that we can translate.

973
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,830
And he spends a lot of time moving his head like this,

974
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,330
which is his way of getting high, I think.

975
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,010
I don't know what his power is good for,

976
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,190
but I think he's got a lot of power.

977
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:43,190


978
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:44,470
But it's got to be good for something.

979
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:51,070
He can arrange remote controls in certain specific orders

980
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,930
that no one understands.

981
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,170
It's not by size or color,

982
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,790
but they have to be exactly that way.

983
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,550
Sooner or later, we're going to get some message from aliens

984
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,790
in crop circles or I don't know what.

985
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:08,190
He'll be able to translate it.

986
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,110
Maybe.

987
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,390
Maybe that's his...

988
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,170
That's the only thing he can do.

989
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,750
That and fold boxes.

990
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:15,950
You know, it's all...

991
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,230
Don't let him tell you that it's a mental illness.

992
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,870
There are such things,

993
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,770
but you'll know those when you see them.

994
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,350
They're not fun.

995
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,690
They're not funny at all.

996
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:34,330
Crazy isn't just eccentric.

997
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:35,990
And...

998
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,210
Yeah, any other questions?

999
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:41,710
Well, come on.

1000
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,450
Something about Santa Claus?

1001
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:45,850
Uh...

1002
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,230
Ghosts?

1003
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,670
What color are your underwears?

1004
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,250
What color are my underwear?

1005
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:53,790
Yes.

1006
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:54,930
Which one?

1007
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,310
I've got three.

1008
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,630
The one closest to your man flesh.

1009
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,250
I think it's green.

1010
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,390
But it didn't start out that way.

1011
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,010
Earlier this week, I think it was white.

1012
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,530
So, you know, that's a...

1013
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:12,970
Why not both?

1014
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,430
It's green and white?

1015
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:16,570
It's this duality thing.

1016
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,430
It's just stupid.

1017
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,690
So, are you saying that subgenius should have trinity for underwears?

1018
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,630
Do we all need the outer, the inner, and the in-between?

1019
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:34,370
No one cares about any subgenius' underwear except the subgenius who has to sleep with

1020
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,830
that one.

1021
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:42,150
So, in closing, when will the subgenius foundation be releasing a line of underwear that is

1022
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1023
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1024
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1025
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1026
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1027
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1028
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1029
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1030
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1031
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1032
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1033
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,150


1034
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,110
of lingerie.

1035
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,890
Oh, when we get a little bit more successful.

1036
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,190
Actually, we do have underwear.

1037
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:49,730
If you look at our

1038
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,730
Cafe Press store, which is

1039
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,970
different from the store

1040
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,270
there,

1041
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,630
there are, in fact,

1042
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,570
dainties and

1043
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,070
lingerie

1044
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,890
that are either for the Bob

1045
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,810
or the Connie of the family.

1046
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:07,210
Or both. Why not both?

1047
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,070
Bob can wear a Connie. Connie can wear a Bob.

1048
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,970
A lot of them do it that way.

1049
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:13,890
I quit

1050
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:15,710
trying to understand other

1051
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,910
subgeniuses a long time ago.

1052
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,690
I just had got to

1053
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,130
accept them the way they are.

1054
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,970
I may dislike them and avoid them,

1055
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,130
but still, I'm not going to try to understand

1056
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,450
them. That's pointless.

1057
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,150
It's

1058
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:31,930
actually a fun little

1059
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:32,810
club to be in.

1060
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,730
A lot of us met our

1061
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,870
true Yeti mate.

1062
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,850
Either in subgenius or

1063
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,030
because I was coming to Starwood.

1064
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,510
There's been a lot of

1065
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:44,990
miscegenations and

1066
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,330
matings between pagans and

1067
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,230
subgeniuses and crossover.

1068
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,530
And the children, oh my god,

1069
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,630
they're so weird. Their eyes

1070
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:55,690
glow and they can make you

1071
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,490
do anything they want you to do.

1072
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,090
Yeah.

1073
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,170
I've got three grandsons now.

1074
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:04,910
So,

1075
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,750
there'll be more. There will be more of them.

1076
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,550
We had to

1077
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,270
replace some stangs.

1078
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,890
But the kids are doing a good job

1079
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:15,270
at that.

1080
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,410
So, friends,

1081
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,190
we'll see you at the bonfire.

1082
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:22,910
Whatever happened to that

1083
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:23,230
pony?

1084
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,870
Are they giving free rides on that

1085
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,410
poor...

1086
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:30,970
Oh, good. I feel so sorry

1087
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:32,490
for those beasts of burden.

1088
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,770
All I want to do is get back

1089
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,770
to my dogs. I haven't seen my dogs

1090
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:38,970
in two weeks. That's all I can really think

1091
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:39,230
about.

1092
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,210
Tomorrow.

1093
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,850
Tomorrow night.

1094
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,810
Friends, thank you very much for coming.

1095
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,130
what's the band tonight?

1096
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,290
Daddy Longlegs?

1097
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:54,070
Gypsy Funk Squad.

1098
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,050
Oh, they were here last year, right?

1099
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,270
I missed them.

1100
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,930
No? Well, I don't know.

1101
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:04,630
Yeah, last year was a crappy Star Wars.

1102
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:05,450
Stan wasn't here.

1103
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,470
Hmm.

1104
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,130
And a magic show by Will Bradshaw.

1105
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,190
So, yeah, I got to clear off of here.

1106
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,230
Oh, by the way,

1107
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,890
even though we're permanently

1108
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,510
moving to that little ranch in Texas

1109
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,750
with goats.

1110
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,770
A lot of goats.

1111
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,350
Despite that,

1112
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,250
I'm storing this pulpit

1113
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,550
right here at Wisteria.

1114
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,430
And our other decorations

1115
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,250
are all being stored

1116
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:36,890
permanently for the first year

1117
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:38,990
here, because I'm not planning

1118
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,870
to use this damn thing anywhere else.

1119
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,130
But we'll be...

1120
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:42,930
We'll be here every X day

1121
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,010
and every Starwood, I'm sure.

1122
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,770
One way or another.

1123
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,270
So, thank you.

1124
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,990
Well, we don't have any choice

1125
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,870
with Starwood,

1126
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,150
because you and Joe swore

1127
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,890
to Jeff Rosenbaum

1128
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,170
that it would keep going.

1129
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,490
So, you don't have any choice.

1130
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,070
I just hope it doesn't

1131
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:08,970
keep losing money.

1132
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,690
Because now I'm financially liable.

1133
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,150
How did that happen?

1134
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,590
I'm the skeptic.

1135
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,510
I'm the one who doesn't believe

1136
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:20,850
in magic or ESP or any of that crap.

1137
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:22,790
And I'm married to it.

1138
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,150
How did Bob

1139
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,450
trick me that way?

1140
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,950
Why didn't my friends warn me?

1141
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:33,590
Okay.

1142
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,190
Enough is enough.

1143
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,410
Praise Bob.

1144
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,950
Let there be slag.

1145
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:41,770
Slag.

1146
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,310
Thank you, Starwood.

1147
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,450
This July, it'll be a virtual Starwood

1148
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,190
with performances and workshops

1149
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,510
streamed on video.

1150
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,830
And X Day 23

1151
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,510
will be like that, too.

1152
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,910
Stay tuned using the

1153
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,790
subgenius.com events page.

1154
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,470
Oh, and the box of hundreds of T-shirts

1155
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,410
and bandanas should be here soon.

1156
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,810
And then, boy, howdy,

1157
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,350
do I have my slack work cut out for me.

1158
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,890
Praise Bob.

1159
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:42,090
Praise Bob.

1160
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,190
Now, the county health department

1161
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,310
says it's seeing the highest air quality

1162
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:47,690
readings it's ever recorded.

1163
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,130
For people who are vulnerable.

1164
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,250
Vulnerable people include pregnant children

1165
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,050
and anyone over age five.

1166
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,190
A Denver court has heard from the turkey.

1167
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,170
She testified that she

1168
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,450
groped a former turkey,

1169
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,230
grabbing her and lifting her turkey skirt.

1170
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,110
This turkey says

1171
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,050
it is unclear whether German turkeys

1172
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,050
are strained, and Germany has warned its

1173
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:10,250
citizens about turkeys after a German

1174
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,070
turkey was arrested last month.

1175
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,030
In Berlin.

1176
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,710
The Dow is 2198, 25,

1177
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,070
22, 2126.

1178
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,070
The turkey says

1179
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,390
this is PR news.
