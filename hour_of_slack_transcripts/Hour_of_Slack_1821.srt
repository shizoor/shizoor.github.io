1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,840
Hey Jill here, Aerosmith, Fleetwood Mac, Bon Jovi, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:30,140
Yes, Brian Adams, Bob Yip, Sub Geniuses, their pets, Bluebirds, and all of their worldly goods.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,180
Because friends, you can take it with you when you're a Sub Genius, sure.

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,060
A throne of gold can be yours.

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,420
You can take off and get it on.

6
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,400
Yes, yes, yes.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,100
Yes, yes, yes.

9
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,640
Yes, yes, yes.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,560
Don't bother me for a while, I'm busy.

11
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,460
Stupid idiot.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,440
You know, it's just occurred to me we really haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,660
I blame myself.

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,460
So do I.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
I have no sense worrying about it now.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,840
Why worry?

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,140
We are...

18
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
We are...

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,620
We're home.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,720
We're home.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
That sounds like caterwauling dying people.

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,600
We are home.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,260
We're home.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
Bob.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,080
Bob.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
Bob.

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,040
Bob.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,480
This is brand new because nobody remembers it from them.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,100
If you didn't buy it.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,360
I'll continue.

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,020
I know it's hardly delete.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:17,780
It's gonna take, I'm gonnaコmpletely

33
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,020
all impacting something, is what I use.

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,780
Give me a thousand bucks and let's get secretly hot and grab a

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:18,780


36
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,060
Like

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,100
it's

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,140
permanent happiness.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,440


40
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,820
Oh, this episode is nothing at all like any recent episodes, or old ones for that matter.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,800
It's almost entirely created by the Cleveland weirdo named Sheridan, who I've never met, incidentally.

42
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,860
He wanted to give me a break and maybe show off a little bit.

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,060
So he did two whole shows, of which this is the first.

44
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:52,340
There'll be a break in the middle for rare Just Unearthed songs by Nenslow and The Swingin' Love Corpses.

45
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,360
But now, back to the media barrage of Sheridan.

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,020
We have to take some baby steps to ensure that we have backup plans in place, right?

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,060
Hello?

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,940
Hello?

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,460
Hello!

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,600
Wow, your connection is terrible.

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Hello?

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Hello?

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:11,840
Hello?

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,320
Hey.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Wow, your connection is terrible.

56
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,900
Your connection is terrible.

57
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,260
Yeah.

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,480
Five, six, seven, kick front.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,300
And, and up.

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
Keep the knee left.

61
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,500
Five, six, seven, to the left.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,440
And, kick front.

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,780
Move the shoulders.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Keep breathing.

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
Front and up.

66
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,240
And up.

67
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,600
Keep it going.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,020
Yeah!

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,780
Two, and a half.

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,580
One, and a half.

71
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,580
Two, and a half.

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,160
Release it.

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,680


74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,680


75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,680


76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:52,680


77
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,780
Three.

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,140
Two, and back.

79
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,140


80
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,240
And two, and one.

81
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,400
three.

82
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,220
Two, two, and one.

83
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,240
Three, two, and one.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240


85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240


86
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240


87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240


88
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,240


89
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,660
Setting up.

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Very good.

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,720
Good job.

92
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,880
here and i'm the one who has to work

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,760
um hold on wait it's is it any better no it's not besides preaching slack he also

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:46,100
provided warnings he's been warning us that all this was going to happen since 1953 and in fact

95
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:52,980
his most succinct and true prophecy was it's going to be a bummer man

96
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,740
life is

97
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,760
Let me, let me, what about now?

98
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,320
We're about to save.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,900
Uh, okay, hold, hold on.

100
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,300
Let me, let me, what about now?

101
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,880
We're about to save.

102
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,160
Uh, okay.

103
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,380
We're about to save.

104
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,680
Uh, okay.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,560
Hold, hold.

106
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,620
We're about to save.

107
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,940
Uh, okay.

108
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,860
Hold, hold.

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,600
We're about to save.

110
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,940
Uh, okay.

111
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,240
Hold, hold on.

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,800
Okay.

113
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,120
Hold, hold on.

114
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,440
Uh, okay.

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,620
We're about to save.

116
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,960
Uh, okay.

117
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,360
Hold on.

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,020
We're about to save.

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,660
Okay, hold on.

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,000
Bob said in 1953, it's going to be a bummer, man.

121
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
We'll be right back.

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
We'll be right back.

123
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,280
One, two, three.

124
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:16,080
One, two, three.

125
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
We'll be right back.

126
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,900
As Bob said, for the first time last week,

127
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,260
it sucks to be born every minute.

128
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,600
Coming to get you, Barbara.

129
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,380
Coming to get you, Barbara.

130
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,240
That was completely new, and in fact, training was needed.

131
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,320
We have one more first we'd like you to try.

132
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:33,000
The levels of energy storage we have achieved are some of the same order of magnitude as those in supercapacitors.

133
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,940
Oh my gosh.

134
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,800
We will not be held back in our efforts by any kind of law or moral principle.

135
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,560
Oh, yes, indeedy.

136
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,000
Lately, there's been violence in the streets.

137
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,140
The moon is full, but hearts are dark, Dolores.

138
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,280
Danger in every stranger.

139
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,400
You may...

140
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,720
This is not a rerun.

141
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,560
RUN!

142
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,600
RUN!

143
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,540
We just did a can of did-a-dell, cops down there, all this game.

144
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,540
RUN!

145
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,700
RUN!

146
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,500
RUN!

147
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,740
This is more serious than any man's enemy in this damn naughty town.

148
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:33,920
RUN!

149
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:33,920


150
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:33,920


151
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
RUN!

152
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,620


153
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:35,620


154
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,080
Wh-Haa-

155
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,620
Hup!

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,840
This does not have any redeeming social value.

157
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,400
It's outrageous still.

158
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,660
Maybe I could make a good rock star.

159
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,180
Why don't you do something else for a change?

160
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,020
Get out of this house and make yourself a friend.

161
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,460
No!

162
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,180
Yes!

163
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,560
No!

164
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes!

165
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,380
No!

166
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,620
No!

167
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,400
Yes!

168
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,860
A dear friend's a...

169
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,160
I mean, if the flat Earth is real, then...

170
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,600
There's, like, some place getting, like, 20 feet of snow.

171
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,300
I don't know.

172
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,820
All right.

173
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,020
The Church of the Subgenius is a club.

174
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,940
For non-joiners.

175
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
That's okay.

176
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,640
It's your mind.

177
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,520
It's your brain.

178
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,780
That's the pure definition of privacy to me.

179
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,020
As Bob also said in the pre-scriptures,

180
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,160
there will be a long and hard time of false slack for the masses.

181
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,240
Until the very last breath you have, please don't ever come out.

182
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,600
OK, let's talk.

183
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,600


184
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,740
OK, I'll talk.

185
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:50,800
So what would you be, during your holiday?

186
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:50,800


187
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:50,800


188
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,880
Um, if you're gonna go for a harvest, these medcum comes into play.

189
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,780
Oh, has it?

190
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:52,780


191
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:52,780


192
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:52,780


193
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,320
Keep your business, please leave mine alone

194
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,300
Neighbor, neighbor, don't worry how I hurt my friend

195
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,160
Cause my success is driving you out of your head

196
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:28,540
Go around, door to door, talking about, about me, door to door

197
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,520
Send to your business and leave my affairs alone

198
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:45,340
Greetings and welcome to the premiere of the brand new show that we're calling, You Know

199
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,760
The premise is simple, we invite famous celebrities, musicians and authors on for a one-on-one interview

200
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:05,540
The very first time they say, you know, the interview ends and the next guest comes in for their turn

201
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:15,400
This process repeats until we're out of famous people and we begin interviewing the staff here in the studio

202
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:27,580
An added feature is that one half of our You Know point is awarded for each time the guest uses like instead of um

203
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,380
Beginning a sentence with so will be frowned upon but not penalized

204
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,620
So, we're ready for our first guest

205
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,140
Please welcome Miss, Miss You Know

206
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,300
remove cabinet

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:08,720
On the sibble

208
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,060
So, Matthew, can I call you Matthew?

209
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes.

210
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,080
Very good.

211
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:35,960
So, Mr. Matthew, how did it feel to be named Sexiest Man Alive by Two Wheel Bicycle Magazine?

212
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,960
Well, you know, I didn't...

213
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,660
Oh, boy, that was fast.

214
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,820
I'm sure there's somewhere else you need to be right now.

215
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,460
So long.

216
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:04,120
Our next guest is the famed African-American writer, Tom Nisey Coates.

217
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,920
Come on over.

218
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,220
Over, Mr. Coates.

219
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Thank you.

220
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,560
Thank you.

221
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,200
So, let's get right into the deep.

222
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,540
Do all black people think they can sing?

223
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,380
Yes, because they can.

224
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,820
Yes, it's like, you know, the first time you, like, talk to, you know,

225
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:41,600
your children in that, you know, sing-song voice for, like, the first time.

226
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,760
It's an immense, you know, great release.

227
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,080
I am overjoyed that you could be on our pilot episode.

228
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,060
I delayed the bell because you are so prolific with those words

229
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,940
that I just let you go.

230
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,780
I'd be willing to bet when you're thinking and writing

231
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,660
that you don't weave those words into every sentence of the page.

232
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes, but the first time I said, like, it meant similar to.

233
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,480
Nice try.

234
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,500
Bye-bye, Mr. MacArthur Genius.

235
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,940
The next guest is John.

236
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:35,940


237
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:35,940


238
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:35,940


239
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,500
Gene Simmons from the rock band Kiss.

240
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,280
Hello, Gene.

241
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,800
I'm warning.

242
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,360
How are you?

243
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,700
So, Gene, just how long is that tongue?

244
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,220
Wouldn't you like to know, babe?

245
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,380
Okay.

246
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm not going to wait for you to say,

247
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,720
you know, I just can't sit here and look at someone's balls

248
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,980
wrapped in shiny, tight, black leather.

249
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
Sayonara, Simmons.

250
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,240
Wimb.

251
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:35,780
Oh, next we have, uh, well, we have our cameraman.

252
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,520
Cameraman Curtis.

253
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,020
Welcome to the other side, Kurt.

254
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,660
Uh, uh, well, yeah, yeah, whatever.

255
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,100
So, my man, how are you?

256
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Well, you know, been better.

257
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,760
What the?

258
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,060
Curtis.

259
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,620
Curtis.

260
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:05,940
Curtis.

261
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,000
You are part of the crew.

262
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,080
You know the rules.

263
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,540
What is wrong with you?

264
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:21,460
The only thing I like about the show is the paycheck.

265
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,720
Am I done?

266
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,660
Can I go?

267
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,720
I have to polish my lens.

268
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,920
Well, it's a little bit of a mess.

269
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:35,920


270
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:35,920


271
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,000
Couldn't get any thicker.

272
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,080
I mean, what's there on top of that

273
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,320
lane?

274
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,460
Uh...

275
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,980
With this.

276
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
Thank you.

277
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,760
Thank you.

278
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,640
Thank you.

279
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,300
Thank you.

280
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,420
Thank you.

281
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,060
Thank you.

282
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,980
Thank you.

283
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
Thank you.

284
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,400
Thank you.

285
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,380
Thank you.

286
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,860
Your money back.

287
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,700
I am

288
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,060
the

289
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,440
most

290
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,800
The one everybody calls when it hits the fan.

291
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,720
Yeah, let's put it that way.

292
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:48,640
Hello and welcome to Psychopathic Psychiatric Assistance.

293
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,980
Please listen to the automated menu and choose from the following options that best fit your mood and or symptoms.

294
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:48,600
Please listen to the automated menu and choose from the following options that best fit your mood and or symptoms.

295
00:26:48,640 --> 00:27:18,620
Please listen to the automated menu and choose from the following options that best fit your mood and or symptoms.

296
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:30,860
He and his destructive forces take delight in causing tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and blizzards, falsely called acts of God.

297
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:38,540
They instigate wars, terrorism, assassinations, murders, rapes and every other evil act committed globally.

298
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,800
Though they dwell among the stars, they make millions of trips to planet Earth daily, traveling faster than the speed of light.

299
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,240
They attempt to depress, possess.

300
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
And oppress their victims.

301
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,940
Psychiatrists and psychologists are no match for these ETs in the battle for the mind.

302
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,500
Who and what are these ETs?

303
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,480
Who created them and why?

304
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,720
Can their existence be proven?

305
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,840
Can their attacks be repelled?

306
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,480
Soon a Star Wars battle will be fought among the planets.

307
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,320
And the headquarters of these...

308
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,620
This here is a song I just wrote.

309
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,540
It's been a hundred thousand...

310
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,600
And more family.

311
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,980
For a thousand generations.

312
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:30,740
If you could fly to Dobbs Town in a twinkling of an eye.

313
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:38,100
Do you think that you could ever get in to see that guy?

314
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:46,060
For the line extends forever in time and into space.

315
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,620
You could never get in to see that guy.

316
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:54,020
You could wait for all eternity and never see his face.

317
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,920
His pipe is always burning.

318
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,860
His teeth will always grin.

319
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,120
For he knows you are unworthy and wiltering in sin.

320
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,080
You think you're a subgenius.

321
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,420
But he knows you're just a dumb.

322
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
You'll never get out of hope.

323
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,420
Although you'll wait forever you'll never get hope.

324
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:35,520
There is no end to sorrow there is no end to pain.

325
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,660
There is no end to conspiracies that drive your mind insane.

326
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,080
There is no end to cruelty.

327
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,220
There is no end to greed.

328
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,920
There is no end to Bob Dobbs.

329
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,680
There is no end indeed.

330
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,300
If you could fly to Dobbs Town in a twinkling of an eye.

331
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:13,500
Do you think that you could ever get in to see that guy?

332
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:21,580
For the line extends forever in time and into space.

333
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:32,000
You could wait for all eternity and never see his face.

334
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,260
That was Nenslow, just unearthed, never heard before.

335
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,420
Next up, a swingin' love chord.

336
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,780
Bob Dobbs' piece that no one heard for 25 years.

337
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,480
The reggae version of Jumpin' Jack Flash.

338
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,900
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

339
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,820
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.

340
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,480
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.

341
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,480


342
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,480


343
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,120
And I howled at my boy in the driving rain.

344
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,520
But it's all right now.

345
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,140
In fact, it's a gas.

346
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,040
It's all right.

347
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,700
Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas, gas.

348
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,640
It puts you in deep sleep.

349
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,560
We can do anything if we just jumpin' Jack Flash on affected space.

350
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,480
Everything夏 살.

351
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,860
We'd like to say thanks for sharing your blues.

352
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,000
And on happy Mom, everybody.

353
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,980
I hope opportunity full of laughter and stories inform our fun years,

354
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,100
Well I was born in a crossfire hurricane

355
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:45,900
I was born in a crossfire hurricane

356
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,820
For the soul, right

357
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,780
Yeah man, it's alright

358
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,080
Yeah man, it's alright

359
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,980
I was propped up

360
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,060
I was worshipped and left for dead

361
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,760
I fell down on my feet

362
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,600
And I saw they bled

363
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,160
I found

364
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,700
At the crumbs in the crust of the bread

365
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,860
I was crowned

366
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,680
With a spark right through my head

367
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,980
But it's alright

368
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,540
I was crowned

369
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,940
At the crumbs in the crust of the bread

370
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,880
And I saw

371
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,180
It's alright

372
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,800
It's alright

373
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,060
It's alright

374
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,880
It's alright

375
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,520
It's alright

376
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,560
It's alright

377
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,260
It's alright

378
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,240
It's alright

379
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,120
It's alright

380
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,200
It's alright

381
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,920
It's alright

382
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,480
It's alright

383
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,980
It's alright

384
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


385
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


386
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


387
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


388
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


389
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


390
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:11,980


391
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,260
It's alright

392
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,560
It's alright

393
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,380

402
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,460
Oh well, looks like I have to place myself again.

403
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,360
Friends, these are shit.

404
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,900
Strange times, uh, that I sort of expected for much of my life, but not this way.

405
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,800
It's actually even more stupid than we expected.

406
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,060
Way more stupid.

407
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:30,960
But I guess that's the way of Jehovah One.

408
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,660
Uh, Bob can only continue to guide us through, and we can only follow Bob's lead.

409
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah, I mean, even when he's blindfolded.

410
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,740
So praise Dobbs.

411
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,720
And let there be slack.

412
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,300
¶¶

413
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,840
If you think back to some of the firsts you've experienced in life, some may have been stressful like a first job.

Is there a growing sense that um, or acknowledgement that this is happening?

428
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:18,680
Yeah.

429
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,400
Like is this so that, that is mainstream?

430
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,320
Stay with us, more news you can use, and more laughs, after these headlines.

431
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,700
¶¶ ¶¶

432
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,720
To my near right on CD players 1, 2, and 3,

433
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,020
I've got something ready to fire off of turntable number 2,

434
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,600
and I'm not sure what turntable 3 has to hold.

435
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,460
What is holding out for us? I don't know.

436
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I never know what's going on on turntable 3.

437
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,900
It's a very mysterious turntable. In fact, it's so mysterious,

438
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,700
it's not even located in our main air studio.

439
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,960
It's down the hall in a very dimly lit corner.

440
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,040
A lot of cobwebs going on in that corner,

441
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,020
and there's a mysterious odor like cat urine

442
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,540
or leftover beef-vegetable-stew mix.

443
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,780
It's right next to the ladies' restroom, in fact.

444
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,580
I don't know if that has anything to do.

445
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
It's got that peculiar odor.

446
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,240
And turntable number 3, I believe,

447
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,920
is located beneath the haunted tampon machine.

448
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,640
He didn't realize that he had accidentally started

449
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,000
during the eight-and-a-half-minute silence.

450
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,340
But that was okay with me,

451
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,420
because I really wasn't looking forward to that anyway.

452
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
I get stiff.

453
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,360
I miss you.

454
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,140
I used to believe that Bob could screw up that bad.

455
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:21,440
But if he does, I want a new false god.

456
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,340
I have a coupon.

457
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,660
Buy one, get one free.

458
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,960
But they're always out of stock,

459
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,200
and I don't want to wait

460
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,320
three hours for the rain check.

461
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,580
Then let your mind conceive

462
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,800
the falling

463
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,940
of the rains

464
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,140
and blossoming of

465
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,340
rainbow flowers.

466
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,480
Ah!

467
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,420
just won't hear them

468
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,460
No orante has gone,

469
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,460


470
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,460


471
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,460


472
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:15,460


473
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,640
anotherbare

474
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,800
I addall

475
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,400
Nothing

476
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,220
Just the house

477
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,580
Partice

478
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:37,580


479
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,920
minute passed quickly followed by another minute when suddenly a different minute passed followed

480
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,780
by another different minute and another and yet another further different minute

481
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,420
a minute passed i glanced at my watch it was a minute past this was it

482
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,880
is

483
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,980
um

484
00:42:52,600 --> 00:43:01,120
I recommend reading prescription bottle number three.

485
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,540
No resale.

486
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,520
Pink Facebook subgeniuses who can't even spell Bob right.

487
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,880
Need a light?

488
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,040
Light?

489
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,320
Don't touch the pipe, son.

490
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:27,120
You will burn in the fires of whatever someone put in the pipe to smoke it.

491
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,200
Devil is amongst us.

492
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,260
Stay back, boy.

493
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,160
This calls for divine intervention.

494
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:51,940
No.

495
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,160


496
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


497
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:57,760
No.

498
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,480
No.

499
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,200
No.

500
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,360
No.

501
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,080
No.

502
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,980
That's right.

503
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,660
Each one of the Bobs in the book sees.

504
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,220
Did you know that every picture of Bob has the power to view you?

505
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,040
Has the power to look at you and look into your very soul?

506
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,040
Every picture of Bob is not just an image, not just a meaningless, mindless graffito.

507
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,200
Those dots are alive.

508
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,540
Look at you.

509
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:37,060
Each of those dots pulses with unfathomable radiant energy.

510
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,940
Each of those Bobs next to those toilets all over the U.S.

511
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,860
You are really...

512
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,080
You are really lucky because you are now finally by accident being delivered from the false religion.

513
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,460
The biggest trick the devil ever pulled on you to the church of the subgenius.

514
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,880
The difference between you and us is that we have brains.

515
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,340
We have brains!

516
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,120
We have brains!

517
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,240
We have brains!

518
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,780
We have brains!

519
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,340
We have brains!

520
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:06,940
We have brains!

521
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,540
We have brains!

522
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,100
We have brains!

523
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,700
We have brains!

524
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,280
We have brains!

525
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,260
We have brains!

526
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,260


527
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,260


528
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,260


529
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,260


530
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:13,260


531
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,080
I can see brains, a brain!

532
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,320
I nobody ever thinks you have self-esteem orワ

533
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,560
I try to think that we are not spices.

534
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,180
We think that we are€»

535
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,440
I say I don't know you don't know me and I busy talking with you this whole time.

536
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:41,440


537
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:41,860
that was igual to my brain,

538
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,980
not stupid people.

539
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,000
You will pay to know what you really think.

540
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,580
Once upon a time, there was a poor child.

541
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,180
There was no father or mother.

542
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,940
Everything was dead.

543
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,900
You will pay to know what you really think.

544
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,740
As long as the music's loud enough,

545
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,200
we won't hear the world falling apart.

546
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,040
The world is dead.

547
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,460
The world is dead.

548
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,740
Imagine, inside a computer's memory,

549
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,540
there's this string of 13 light bulbs.

550
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,700
Light bulbs that IT people call bits.

551
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,880
Each one representing a different power of two.

552
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,200
So that first light bulb represents

553
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,660
two to the power of zero,

554
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,420
which is one,

555
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,960
because anything to the zero power equals one.

556
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,580
Don't ask.

557
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,000
Second light bulb?

558
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,200
Two to the first power.

559
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,040
Which is two.

560
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,220
Third bulb?

561
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,460
Two to the second power.

562
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:12,960
Four.

563
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,940
Two times two, four.

564
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,280
Four.

565
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,100
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

566
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,600
Okay.

567
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,460
Now, in order to represent numbers that aren't powers of two,

568
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,420
uh, all the computer does is turn on multiple bulbs at once.

569
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,920
A sequence of power of twos.

570
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,160
For example, when Maria got her third,

571
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,240
it turned on the first and second light bulbs from the first.

572
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,800
Because one pl-

573
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,480
When she got her fourth,

574
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,900
it turned off the first and second light bulbs,

575
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,440
and turned on the third.

576
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,420
Two to the second.

577
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,580
When she got her fourth,

578
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,920
it turned off the first and second light bulbs,

579
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,480
and turned on the third.

580
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,520
Two to the second.

581
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,240
Bulb.

582
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,280
Two to the fourth power.

583
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,620
Sixteen plus the first bulb.

584
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,280
Two to the power of zero.

585
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,160
One. Equaling seventeen.

586
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,080
And so on.

587
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,480
So, we knew that the result could be traced back to the-

588
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,700
Thirteenth bit flipping.

589
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,120
What we didn't know was what caused the bit to flip.

590
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:13,520
Okay.

591
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,460
What- What could cause this bit to flip?

592
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,760
No idea.

593
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,080
I'm sorry.

594
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,360
That's the way things go.

595
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,440
You know, we just simply had no proof of what caused the bit to flip.

596
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,720
We just don't know.

597
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,900
That's the way it, uh, it turned out.

598
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,500
.

599
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,340
We're most concerned is that the people can trust the electronic-

600
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,560
. We're most concerned is that the people can trust the electronic-

601
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,480
system and with this sort of problem.

602
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:42,880
.

603
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,960
We are not sure the people can trust the system.

604
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,100
No, no, they must be moral.

605
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,080
Nobody can understand this sort of vocabulary,

606
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,100
and I was confused with the explanation.

607
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,600
.

608
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,400
This phenomenon is extensively described in the specialized literature.

609
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,180
.

610
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,120
Yes, we did write that.

611
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:06,420
.

612
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:06,520
.

613
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,380
What- What- What- What were you referring-

614
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,540
through there nothing in particular

615
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:24,920
what's this why they not explain what's really happening what can we check who

616
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:33,040
can check who will check but I say hey wait I did computer science studies and

617
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,540
bits are not flipping what are they talking about so I need it to find out

618
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:49,160
blah blah they said yes if the cosmic ray touch your computer the right way at

619
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:57,720
the right spot it could change a bit from zero to one and my first reaction

620
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,280
was to see hey hey hey cosmic ray hey what a joke

621
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,600
yes when they

622
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,020
invest in the data they just don't know exactly what's going on but then they

623
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,320
I figured that they found out that it could have been cosmic rays causing problems.

624
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,840
I see.

625
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,120
Oh, okay.

626
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,420
This is not a rerun.

627
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,020
This is not a live broadcast.

628
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,320
Oh, no.

629
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,600
Iron Man is a way of life to millions.

630
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,340
Yet half of them don't even know it.

631
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:38,040
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

632
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,160
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

Hey, somebody over here.

637
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,240
So, you want some great stuff?

638
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:03,180
Yeah, I thought there's more where that came from.

639
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,220
What's up?

640
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:10,880
What's up?

641
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,100
Who's this?

642
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,740
Yeah, it's T'Gusta. You got any of your reaper?

643
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,120
What? Oh.

644
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,280
You got any reaper?

645
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,480
Uhh, just a second man.

646
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,500
Yeah...

647
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,460
Sweeney got pressure from below.

648
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,020
Sweeney got pressure from below.

649
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:27,800
Sweeney got pressure from below.

650
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,900
We don't have time for the artsy-fartsy-stuf.

651
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,180
We need a Clone...

652
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:31,700
Sweeney got pressure from below.

653
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,020
We need a free lesson.

654
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,260
Sweeney got pressure from below.

655
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:33,820
Who's this?

656
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,120
It's the Gus there.

657
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,020
Who...

658
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:36,580
Gus?

659
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,920
Gus... Gus who?

660
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,260
The Clark Baal?

661
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,480
Yeah.

662
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,680
We need a rumor for tul'un'

663
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,040

Sweeney got pressure from below.

667
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:11,960
Sweeney got pressure from below.

668
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,360
Guess who's coming?

669
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,780
Guess who's coming?

670
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,280
Who is he?

671
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,020
Just your favorite DJ savior.

672
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,860
Using inclusive beats that you never heard.

673
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,520
Meanwhile, Uptown, the DJ player.

674
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,780
Of course.

675
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,460
Of course, what I mainly do is just take the stuff that people send in and rip them off.

676
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,800
I don't know what to do.

677
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:05,960
There are subgenius operatives acting in complete Dobbs-approved secrecy at every level of society.

678
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,640
Great hits.

679
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,600
Great job.

680
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,880
What's wrong with you?

681
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:15,400
Get busy.

682
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,580
The truth never really fits.

683
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,440
Their childish agendas.

684
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,300
Because the complex is not really as simple as they are.

685
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,420
This is a great meal, Professor.

686
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,500
That's a great stew.

687
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,740
What's in it?

688
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,060
Oh, a lot of things.

689
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,280
Rattlesnake, solvita.

690
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:41,980
Chicken, corn, green peppers, chili, onions, uh, hair.

691
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,620
Well, it's an old recipe around here.

692
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,020
90% of the rubbish online.

693
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,640
We could fact check.

694
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,040
Anybody on the street could do in, you know, two minutes.

695
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,700
What the hell is that?

696
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,080
That's what, that's really the point of every religion.

697
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,460
That's the point we're all, that every true fanatic is waiting for.

698
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,520
I'm afraid that people will take me for somebody crazy.

699
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:32,560
We have the tools and techniques and the processes in place that can allow us to develop procedures

700
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,000
that will work, including with backup plans.

701
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,500
Ow!

702
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,260
You threw off my groove.

703
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,700
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove.

704
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,320
Sorry!

705
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,340
You were saying?

706
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,760
I will not share any of this.

707
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:48,760


708
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:48,760


709
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:48,760


710
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:48,760


711
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,240
I will not share anything with you.

712
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,500
We will not establish a relationship.

713
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,020
We will not have any meaningful dialogue.

714
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,860
And we definitely will not spend any quality time.

715
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:09,280
There's a picture of an alien playing ping pong with an adolescent or a young adult male

716
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,140
who happened to be masturbating while he's playing ping pong with an alien was on the

717
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,360
wall in the Ren's restroom.

718
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,880
What did the alien look like?

719
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,060
Tiny.

720
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:18,740
I don't know.

721
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,940
I don't know.

722
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,620
To be honest with you, I don't know and I'm going to do my best to imagine the

723
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:31,620


724
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,700
I am very sorry.

725
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,580
I hope you enjoyed the movie!

726
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,400
I worked with revitalizing my voice experience furiously so that many people will not have

727
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,840
to wait to purchase a voice at an event with me as an bikesista.

728
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:41,840


729
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:41,840


730
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,140
I'm looking forward to a party!

731
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:48,720
I can't wait to play, barbie!

732
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,920
You're afraid to do that again.

733
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,720
By golly, he did it.

734
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,340
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

735
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:48,700
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

736
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,720
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

737
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,720
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

738
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

739
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,820
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

740
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,800
I'm beginning to hate that guy.

741
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:09,560

I'm beginning to hate that guy.

743
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,000
Thank you, Sheridan,

744
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,460
for doing most of this hour

745
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:18,720
of socializing.

746
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:27,480
slack that was very weird by Sheridan. We are at subgenius.com. Praise Bob.
