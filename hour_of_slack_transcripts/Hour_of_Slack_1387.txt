Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
It's a form of sacrilege
It's a form of disconsecration of the vowel sounds made by your very existence
As you twizzle and twazzle DNA
As you weasel and wazzle your slimy way
Up and down and out of life
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient
And now it is time for us to conclude our visit
And reluctantly say
Hong Kong, the hub of the Orient
Thank you for joining us tonight
Now, I just heard in the room
A report that
The subgenius power of slashing
That is correct
To engage in this attack
That's correct
We have a number of individuals that have had girls from 15 to 25
Jeez
Why, what, why, what, why?
I have a list of about 20 of them
They're like 14, 15, 16
Any photos?
That's correct
You changed your cover
I started to work
Hello
And I don't mind telling you
It's no change for the better
Why, you're wearing a mask
I'll explain the mask later, Mr. Jackson
Now
It's fun time
I just can't understand it
Oh yeah?
Maybe it's just because you're stupid
Well, yes, Wally
Sure, punch yourself in the nose
No
No
No

rain
Not much

Do you want to choose a woman I talk to?


Do you look like self respect?
A little competitive


Well, Shen's first moviegery used to be very god dawg
So試기
Maybe but it's regulate
He's notorrwatching it
Just a mate on the canterall
Since I was a little kid
They've been the two best friends
That a man could ever hope for in this world
Now I'm a normal guy
And I work all day for my money
And I fear the good Lord like I know I should
I ain't no new age coot
But I gotta get this off my chest
And put this tragedy behind me now for good
I remember getting drunk
And I remember falling down
And someone laid me on a pool table
And I don't live too soon
Then through the blinding light
Two creatures stared into my eyes
As half a jukebox or a flying saucer
Spinned around the room
And I tell myself this couldn't have been
No member of the human race
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men
From outer space
Well it hit me like trouble
In the back of my head
Knocked me clean out of my shoes
And when I woke up, Lord
I wished that I was dead
I wish that I was dead
I had got off the case of those abduction blues
This must have been an abduction, Lord
Cause I don't know what happened
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue
And I think I'm gonna look crazy
But I know that it weren't them
Say this is the end of the world
Things that T.K. do and never do
Well when at last I woke
Both my legs they had been broke
Both my eyes were black
And my ears was ringing bad
I'd seen enough of nasty things
But this was the worst case
Of intergalactic relations I've ever had
And I tell myself this couldn't have been
No member of the human race
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men
Who were meant for my outer space
Cause it hit me like a shovel
In the back of my head
Knocked me clean out of my shoes
And when I woke up, Lord
I wished that I was dead
I had got off the case of those abduction blues
This must have been an abduction, Lord
Cause I don't know what happened
Hit me like a bolt out of the blue
And I think I'm gonna look crazy
But I know that it weren't them
Say this is the end of the world
Things that T.K. and her would never do
Himmy�
You'd do the same thing
You would never do


Exactly


What
There's no
There's
It's like a lot of
Some essential
Water of life
or something
And you don't
They can't
Then they take away
Oh, yeah
This thing
That was Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights, dear friends.
Flank Hoyt and the Swerving Headlights.
And you can learn more about Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights from swervingheadlights.com.
The collages were by Mr. Fernandinande Lemur.
He's fuzzy.
I guess he's not a reverend.
He's very specific about being a mister.
Well, speaking of DNA implants and so forth and moving this stuff around, he does have lizard skin.
I mean, a lot of people talk about the lizard people.
That's a conspiracy theory that a lot of people are real excited about.
It's kind of old hat for subgenius diehard old conspiracy theorists.
They make those guys wear old hats.
That's part of the whole conspiracy of it.
The DNA thing is implanted.
Is that what the old hat thing is about?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
Spooky.
Yeah.
Call something old hat.
That means the DNA goes right in your brain and changes you.
I think that's what it means.
Change.
Spare change, my friend.
Can you change your ways?
Can you quit telling yourself you're awake and enlightened long enough to realize you're still asleep?
See, I'm the automatic robot that goes around telling the other automatic robots to wake up.
I'm the automatic robot that goes around telling the other automatic robots to wake up.
But that's just what I do automatically.
You show them the pictures, don't you, Stang?
Yeah.
The pictures of the kneeling bodies, the scarce and astounding naked bodies,
of the people with, oh, yes, the old lady that was brought in a late-night dragnet,
whose face was rubber-hosed with a...
More precisely, I sell them the pictures.
Yes, you sell them the pictures on the corner side.
Underneath the street lamp.
It hurts, these pictures.
It hurts.

Well, it hurts.
Tell it to him.
He has fish head stockings on your head.
Hey, I got an interesting letter from a listener, Reverend Fenian,
who had just started listening to the Hour of Slack fairly recently.
Fenian.
About a year ago, actually.
About a year ago, he started listening to it on the Internet.
And what attracted him about it was the Oye guy.
He first started tuning in about a year ago.
When we were getting calls from the Oye guy...
You know what that is?
It's the sound of a poodle being sodomized.
Well, that was the thing.
We later found out from other DJs at the station that, indeed, the Oye guy was known...
A poodle sodomizer.
...as famous as Masturbating Sean.
Exactly.
That's the name that he's known by at the station.
And that Princess, we and I were right.
It is a mantra.
And he brought great disgrace on that name, too, by the way.
Well, he brought great disgrace on his name.
Well, it depends on how you look at it, Dave.
It's a life-saving mantra.
His name should be Shane.
Well, now then.
Some denominations, he gets a special award pinned to his chest.
Well, sometimes it's in the form of one of those IEDs, really.
Improvised Exploding Devices.
Friends, are you wondering what the hell this is all about?
Are you wondering?
Well, give up.
Stop. Stop it. Stop it.
The subgenius is probably the single most important organization in the 20th century.
Our function is quite literally to save the world.
No.
At least make the end of the world happen right.
Bob Love You.
Bob Love You.
No problem unless you find Bob.
You better find Bob right now.
Yeah.
The people really need to be able to understand things very quickly.
and the church of the subgenius, I think, confuses him.
Confusing, isn't it?
I want to remind you of the great words of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
I don't practice what I preach
because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.
Thank you, children, thank you.
Is there a typical subgenius?
Of course not.
The very thought is a blasphemy.
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common
is that they're all different
and they have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normals.
By definition, the church of the subgenius can't really exist
because it's an organization for people who are not joiners.
Eccentrics, unpredictables, true visionaries.
Let us observe a few examples using the hidden camera.
It was in the first 30 issues of 9-inch worm comics
and I think in 14 issues of 4.5-inch worm comics.
Is this man a subgenius?
It's a 7-Eleven comic.
Those aren't the comics about a 7-Eleven.
It's the adventures of a 7-Eleven.
They have a person that works a 7-Eleven
that just writes down everything that happens.
They draw a book and the whole comic is shaped like a big 7-Eleven.
It's three-dimensional.
They've got the idea from a flying saucer that was shaped like a 7-Eleven
that flew over one night.
It was a UFO believed to be...
A subgenius, obviously.
The speech patterns are unmistakable.
They share only the...
The quest for slack.
And the love of their beloved spiritual teacher,
the living avatar of slack,
J.R. Bob Dogg.
B.O.B.
B.O.B.
Bob.
I was getting messages in the back of my brain
as long ago as about 12 or 13 months.
And I just kept hearing the word Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob is everywhere.
Bob is bursting out all over the place.
Just look through any phone book in any city
and you'll get the same thing.
Bob's construction company.
Bob's marketing company.
Bob's factory.
Bob's auto parts.
Bob's automotive service.
Bob's learning local.
Bob's dentist.
And then down here we've got Bob's used furniture store.
I mean, he's like everybody's dad should be.
Bob is about as American as you can get.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.
Bob's TV.

There's no laughing matter.
I'm afraid he's determined to take us with him.
Even if it means force.
I'll handle this.
Hey, wait a minute, you guys.
Put your guns away.
No, Wally.
That's just what I'm gonna do.
Hello.
Hello.
We're glad you called us about masturbation.
You'll probably hear a lot of dumb and scary things
about masturbation from your family doctor.
Masturbation is touching and handling
your school nurse in a way that creates pleasurable sexual feelings for most people masturbating is
physically harmful now we like masturbation but if you masturbate it can be psychologically harmful
it could mess up your head in fact masturbation makes you go crazy or blind if this happens it
may indicate a serious problem the problem however is lack of masturbation punishing shots and it's
over a wet wet kiss baby well yes splashing our way on in yep in towards x day it has all been
encapsulated and brought into one mighty compaction unit it is ready for the force field to be enacted
it is ready for decompartmentalization and transplants
that's what they're doing with those people in iraq right those those prisoners of war
well i think it's a new like club or something like that and hey have you noticed everybody's
giving the thumbs up sign type an snm club yeah and everybody gives like the kind of wink and the
thumbs up sign like hey man i humiliated some i've noticed that according to the media the only
torturers and abusers are really hot looking girls young uh attractive especially red
headed girls well the one girl that they showed uh who was giving the thumbs up i i suppose her
excretory function was not correct or else she wouldn't have always wanted to do the old
proctology boogie with all those people i think that um you know you know the they uh they're
just following orders and they're being given orders by people who want to those soldiers to
be able to do it to them when they get back to dc yeah until they use their safe word or say maybe
if the fate of yin get them and some they want to do it to them and they want to do it to them
they're going to get the same kind of friendly treatment say for instance it might have a slight
muslim or arabic slant to it like maybe you know there might be little cuts and so forth and it'll
still be the same hot action you get everywhere across the world with the new gw bush world
engram under which we're stamped say hi baby i can't nowadays let's not be extremists
and go to prison let's not be extreme unctionists
because we're all headed towards the same purple necktie baby you know what i'm saying it's it's
like you're in jail whether you're even if you're out on the street you're still in jail you're
the man still got you as long as you're wearing a wristwatch you're in prison it's a slave planet
so well as you know it is nothing but a cell block but your arms a violent world
you wonder what you're eating do you think it is pork and beans
hahaha
yes there's pork and beans in it all right my friend but it is mostly
the substance of your own brain matter yes it's organ slush the tiny piece of
metallic fluids the apocantic fluids
excuse me we have recreated you and never mind dave do your neighbors consider you to be
different out strange do they give you funny
looks
wow they are incapable of giving looks my friends with the eyes ripped out of their
sockets and only the little oblong pills exposed what can they really see not the oblong pins
little tiny things for their own gratification they push back all the way in the head
you take the red pill and you stay asleep take the blue pill and you'll run around telling
everybody that you're more awake than the next guy
what which who would you choose w-what are you doing with your eyes you're not going



I took the red pill I took the square the octagonal yeah but it didn't I heard about people
that took the oblong pill in either one is red or blue not a good story it looks like
it there's a force field around each of them they made me take the pill that tell that
makes you tell everybody about pills they made me take the pill that that causes you
to go on and on and on and on about how you're more awake than some of your good friends

If you take this other pill.
But that's really just because you took the pill that makes you say that you're awake and alert and noticing the real world.
And, you know, it's like, it's the same thing over and over and over again.
One layer of the onion peeled away and it's still a damn onion.
There's nothing to do but fry it in the pan and hope you get a whooping in your titty-totty can.
Sit down, little man.
We have a message here.
It's encrypted, but you may be able to make out some of it.
And you're slated for some sort of, what do we call it?
That's the, no, that's the more erotic, neo-neurotic way.
Smell of frenulis?
Torture.
Torture.
Or as John Stewart, I heard John Stewart called it, freedom tickling.
One room at a time, buddy.
Freedom tickling.
Yeah.
Well, speaking of normals and everybody we hate, here's a song from the old Bonzo Dog Band about your neighbors.
Ha, ha, ha.
Yo, what we call me, I cross the fence.
I'm common sense.
I got a mouth of land full with a prize.
Won't that be nice?
And by the way, I'm your wife.
Your holidays were spent in Spain.
You went by train.
You'll go again.
Have you seen me bullfight poster on the wall?
Do you know?
The happy memory recalls.
It's a photograph of me and my son Ted.
That's me cousin with his achy on his head.
We booked in at our hotel just after two and met a family from Bradford that we knew.
Yo, what melody?
Yeah.
I think I'm on the brain pipe.
I'm a little extra crummy.
I think I'm on the brain pipe.
Oh, no.
Mama.
It longs for me.
Rodney's bass saxophone solo has promised.
I think I'm on the brain pipe.
Semi-detached.
Head up.
Semi-detached.
Semi-detached.
Semi-detached.







Oh mama.
Belongs to what?
I've a sister in Toronto who's a nurse.
And I've had a bit of bother laying turf.
It's life, not books that taught me all I've learned.
But if they're bothering my rice pudding's getting burnt.
Have you seen the new attachment on me drill?
I must have a cat put down because he's ill.
Hey, neighbor!
My pink heart of the green pine
I may change it for
My pink heart of the green pine
It's the same from you
I'm a woppy jelly, you're a paper bunge
I'm a sherry trifle, you're a chocolate sponge
You're a glass of paper hat, mine are face balloons
Whoops!
Here comes the spoon
My pink heart of the green pine
Separates me from the incredibly fascinating story of your life
And every day today, bent in all its might, you can teach us attention to detail
And was it a Thursday or a Wednesday or...
Oh no, it wasn't so, who cares anyway, cause I do not sew normal
If you're normal, I intend to be a freak for the rest of my life
And I shall baffle you with cabbages and rhinoceroses in the kitchen
In sets and quotations, from now we are six
Through the mouthpiece of Lord Gryffindor
To Snootles giant poisoned electric head
So go...
My poverty but not my will consent
I pay thy poverty and not thy will
Put this in any liquid thing you will and drink it off
And if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
Here is thy gold
Worse poison to men's souls doing more murder in this loathsome world
And these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
What is the taste of crunchy clusters?
Perfect forever
And it got in the spokes of the wheel and it choked it into
Death
Ah ah well I'll end it
No no no
It's the senate vote
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
No aye no no aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Back to the very beginning of the first part
No
Underneath annoyances starting with a petty, bastardly, tiny, menacing, and wimpy
Sculp overbearing all encompassing
I'm gonna remove the sinus here
Just pull that very gently
Just take out my left sinus passage here
Get the whole thing right out
I'm ready to have the third nostril put right in
Are you kids quit playing with your little third nostril toys there
Are you kids?
Third nostril openings
Third nostril opener toys
Yeah get away from the slurpee machine
And put the hands off the third nostril straffinator
All you peep-ups get off and run
Bonzo Dog Band did my pink half
My pink half of the drainpipe
Separates me from the tedious endless email from bobbies and numbskulls, idiots and well-wishers
Do-gooders and nimrods and numbnuts and jillybops
Now do well
That's what your fear is my brother
Now do well
Now do well
Now do well
Those who have nothing not more in mind than to do you ill, yes
Now do well
The destruction of the Reverend Ivan Stank
I have seen their writs
I have seen their manifesto-ay-ay-ay-ay
Hey, hey, speaking of weirdos and stuff
I've seen their
Hey, hey, hey
We've got a show coming up
That we can't, uh, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anybody but, uh, I'm not gonna say

But, uh, there is a subgenius devival
They should be made aware
They should be made some, somewhere
At, uh, on May 22nd, Saturday night at the Beachland Ballroom
It's, it's a touch of the old sarcophagus, you know, it makes you feel like you've gone and gone on
And you can't get back out and, you know, in here
Well, the girls are gonna be there
Reverend Nikki Deathchick will be
Snake it
And her nun snakes
Snake it
Will be applying the sp, the, the bonding
Spankings of, uh, guilt relief or guilt or something
I, I always get, I get religious things
I will be applying my own special brand of nasal pressure to the third nostril cruise
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
And, uh, those beautiful girls in the amino acids
They're a masked surf music band
Surf punk, uh, instrumental masked alien band
Who are actually beautiful girls underneath those masks
You wouldn't think it
Or beautiful goats, depending on which, uh, trend
Or which trans-vibrational level you come from
They never take the masks off and they look like men or, or something like men
Yeah, but they are goats
Beyond human semblance
I've seen their molecules evaporate
Beyond mere hums
I've seen the petri dish with the goat horn and the piece of magic eye
I, I, I know what they are
Oh, here they are playing in the background
Oh, Lord
I can hear them
Oh, Lord
Well, that's not the amino acids, but it's close enough
I think it's Robert Johnson about to sell
Bucca
That's a bad dream, amino acids
This is the Paul Bucca theme
This is the Paul Bucca theme
I didn't know they had theme music
Just a Paul Bucca
I'm just an old Paul Bucca to you
They call me Bucca
Silence is a bug
Just a Paul Bucca
Be quiet now
Put your hand on the thermometer
Oh, and that other, that Paul Bucca named Man Incorporated
The one man band will also
And that actually is a pretty impressive one fellow
How about the dopamine tyrants?
The beaters of serotonin which will come in a flood
Oh, the Minoan brain eaters
Yeah, they'll probably be there
Flood into your brains
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc who is the good subgenius preacher
As opposed to the rest of us
And, uh
Man
And the movie show
Oh, and the movie show?
Yeah, the movie show
And the nostril, uh, dripping
The nostril, third nostril openings
The mind-melting movie show
Yeah
The people in their shells and their concomitant gestures
Believe it or not, I, Scene Magazine called me up about that
About the gestures?
And quizzed me about this
Yeah, gestures
What, just what this lonesome cowboy Dave brain cell was going to do
Oh
In this big circus
Oh boy
Whether he was going to be jumping through hoops or
Or throwing himself into Bob's pocket
Or, uh, you know
Oh boy
I told, I told her that we were basically going to nail you up on a cross and tote you
around
Oh boy
And do a takeoff on that famous religion, uh, uh
I am from the Carolingian Brotherhood
I am a member of the Zul organization
And I do not believe in your bastard Nazarene, pale Nazarene Jesus
I went, oh
Oh, I do sometimes
You know when it serves
That's the scary part
When it serves my purple
If you know what I'm saying
Is that where we bring offerings of whipped cream, bowls of whipped cream down to your toes?
Little cherries too
Yeah, that's what I thought, yeah
Listen little pink, little normal worm
You didn't hire me last time I blessed you with a resume
Now I'm back to buy your company and close it down, demolish it, pave over the ruins
And forbid anyone to approach the site for ten thousand years
Cheers

Oh, I want some of that
Well it's really spicy
Well I want to go around here withカizen
And we will see you through the back door






How long are we meeting all there for?

60
It's, uh, you know, it's still just an unknown.
Subgeniuses must be chameleons ready to don at a moment's notice the disguise of the normal.
They will endure the polyester of the pink if that's what is required in order to earn their daily bread
and grab a little slack for whatever awful things they do at night.
If Dr. Jekyll is not allowed to surface on some rare occasions, Mr. Hyde will be captured.
The brain will start weapon down, you know, pretty much like one of those ancient birds.
You know, it's got the same kind of profile.
It just, uh, but if you can, uh, say, for instance, get your hand on the right kind of material,
like a quartz crystal or something like that, uh, it works just like a baby dog.
Yeah, it's a charm.
And I, I mean, it's a charm.
Some subgeniuses never for an instant cease to project a contrived hate,
indiscriminately despising everything,
everything normal.
But that's just another way of ignoring the vagaries of life in favor of some escapist formula,
some rule book.
It only proves they are normals because they haven't caught on yet that by definition,
half of what they call normal is actually stranger than them.
They just don't get in strangeness
because they can't tell the difference between bulldonner, stupid, and camp.
And here in our camp is Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
I am not in your camp, nor have I ever been a member of your cr-
You can't hide from normality!
You cannot hide from the all-seeing eye that peers everywhere.
There's a lot of happy campers around here, but no.
It's in the lavatories.
It's in the basement.
It's in the foot lockers.
It's over in the, uh, in the closet space there.
It's in the broom closet.
It's in the, uh, these, uh, where they put the cats and hoes.
It's over where they have-
War, friends.
War, war, war.
Huh!
What is it good for?
What's the use of dying if we're already gonna live anyway?
What is it good for?
Yes, sir, dunks are just-
Good God, y'all.
Absolutely nothing.
This will make friends for you.
Mars, the Roman god of war, played the drums for the ban war.
Hmm, alright.
Just because they're dunks.
That'd be sick.
Did you ever wonder about that?
No, I didn't.
I didn't wonder about a lot of things.
The mythical beast has always had a purely symbolic function.
And maybe somebody might say I wondered about the moon.
Representing the lunar and feminine aspect, and also through the rampant horn.
You know, sometimes you do a lot of thinking that-
The victory of the male over the female.
Might as well have never thought it over.
Did you ever think this sky was a great big blueberry pie?
Yeah.
It makes me hungry when I think about that.
Did you ever think, did you ever think the sky was a great big blueberry pie?
Yeah, and I wanted to stick it in my thumb and pull out a plum.
Well, you're right.
It is.
Bad, isn't it?
Um.
Shhhhh.
Crazy man.
Oh, that music in the background there was by Norrell Preff.
That, that killer guitar music.
That was, uh, Norrell Preff instrumental.
Norrell Preff is reachable at heavyconfetti.com.
We heard some music also earlier in the background by Hipsodic.
And this in the background is Ed Fred.
Ed Fred music, I think.
And they leave the earth, their troubles melting like lemon drops as they cascade over the
edges.
.

The episode bodys howling
Can you see anything different about this structure?
Yeah.
You notice anything kind of, knew or unusual?
There's, uh, lots of new things going on now.
What is that, man?
What is that?
I don't know.
But we can't let it get out until
Oh, man!
I can't believe we're, like, actually witnessing this.
It's a war between the dopamine um
Oh, man.
Each man have their own troops, their little vehicles, their fighting tanks, their mighty, mighty military robots.
Each and every one of them is a vessel designed by Satan.
But don't worry.
What?
The engine is going to go up.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, I just remembered something.
I've got a scary.
Scary thing.
I've got a scary thing.
A scary thing.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Well, what it is is, you know, over the years, those alt-binary slack creatures.
Where I scrape a lot of the sound for the hour of slack off of.
I see you scraping.
Alt-binary slack where you download the weird audio and the weird pictures from subgenius land.
Those guys have been cutting up little.
Little pictures of sounds for millions of years and have made tiny.
Funny, goofy, little fissures on the side of the statues.
That's only one side of the head.
The other side of the head is much more.
Genius.
Great.
You scrape up the bits.
Well, you know, these types do rip your brain in half.
You start.
They take the left.
Here and the right here and yank them apart.
And so just pay attention.

It's so jolly it makes me laugh.
It'll steal your soul if you let it.
It'll mess with Bob's coat.
Tasty prairie squid spread.
Salted and unsalted varieties available on the East Coast only.
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.
Crager shat piercingly.
It's a crazy awesome lady.
This is really amazing.
Ergo, those that refuse the program while a minority, if unchecked,
would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.
Bob!
Bob!

Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!

The following order is to be carried out immediately.
It's not a crutch, Dad.
It's something I've come to rely on to help me through life.
Praise Bob!
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ,
and since I've been listening to it.
I gotta have some slack.
Slack.
To the street, faster than any other leading,
Our advanced analyzer software helps you quickly sort through expensive diapers.
And our streaming data page enables you to size up body parts.
I'm going to bypass your forebrain and appeal directly to your amygdala.
Oh, don't grab me.
Okay, great.
Don't grab.
Ah!
This is civilization's jungle.
After the jackals of society have ruthlessly ravaged it, ending the world of decency.
I haven't had time for your kind of woman.
Don't touch me.
I can't stand you.
But all you're remembering is merely a series of sensory impulses which you now realize have no real definite connection with outside reality.
True.
But since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness before my fellow men.
Not in this life.
I've too much laughing to do.
Hurrah!
Unfair to kick a man when he's down.
Let's get him up on his feet.
Excellent.
He will not reveal his identity.
So for today, we're calling him Bob.
Men and women of all races and creeds pause to destroy the earth.
Because they saw such a mystifying sight.
I sometimes feel that I am impersonating the dark subconscious of the whole human race.
⁠—
Baaah-ba-ba-baah-b-b-baah-baah-baaah-baaah saaaahhhhh.
Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!
What's that? What's that?
Fantastic things have already happened.
And more are getting ready to happen.
This is because the planet on which you're residing has entered the space age.
You are a most unusual individual.
And decidedly in the minority.
Oh, another victim of confusion?
Decidedly.
Oh, that's crazy talk.
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.
Well, we're all pretty much, aren't we?
I'm sorry.
Do you think Bob is just a guy with a pipe?
Are you just a guy with a pipe?
Well, it's like a form of dialectic.
You know, you could divide the world into different cramps that you were talking about cramps before.
You could have some who believe that it's just a guy with a pipe.
And others who dynamically believe it's just a guy with a pipe.
You know what I'm saying?
Like when they say it, they look at each other and they're just like,
Yeah, man, it's just a guy with a pipe.
It's just a guy with a pipe.
You know, and in a special glimmer in each other's eyes, you know,
and they can give each other the high sign or different signs, you know.
To truly believe.
To truly let all brain cells die.
That must be glorious.
Well, that's our goal.
That's the goal of each and every individual aspirer or perspirer.
Anybody who wants to attain that certain secondary, I don't know what it is.
I guess you can read things when you don't really.
But, you know what I'm saying?
We all need this.
I know what you're saying.
We all need this.
It's in a manufactured need.
Must have slack.
Must have slack.
Must.
Must.
Must have slack.
Must.
Must.
Must have slack.
Must.
Must.
I'm slack.
Must have slack.
Must.
Must.
Yeah, when they buried the poor little guy, he was as bloated as a grape.
He had to use a rake to pull him out of the...
...pond.
He'd been swearing up and down he was going to do it all week.
He said if Bob didn't give him a call or he didn't get some word about that 30 bucks he sent that damn...
Oh, that 30 bucks.
Well, now you know.
He finally did it.
There he is.
He brought up his grave and put him in a shallow grave and had a beer and went down...
Yeah, baby!
Baby!
It's all coming down.
Civilization, that is.
Falling apart.
Falling to pieces.
You're part of it.
You're part of the problem, not the solution.
You're one of the tiny cracks, man.
You're one of the little fissures pulling the thing down.
You're one of the things, you know, reducing it to a common...
So do the right thing, man.
Go ahead and jump.
Just get it over with.
Yeah, get it over with, man.
Go on and get it over with, then.
It's so easy.
And your troubles will melt like lemming drops as you fall off the edge of that cliff.
So, so high up over the sea, it's a beautiful, breathtaking dive
a hundred feet down to the new beach and rocks below!
Lombada.
Ah, the Lombada, the dance of love.
Ah, eh, eh.
Eh, practice.
By Bob and Connie.
In the heat and feverish passion of their desire.
Oh, and you, too, can glean some of the sweaty, sheeny, shiny sweat off of their skin.
If you'll just do as your master Bob says and fetch the paper every morning, bring him
his slippers and his little pipe loaded, uh, for bear, and, uh, join us, humans, in our
subterranean time.
Bottles of love.
Oh, buddy.
Ha, ha.
You're gonna have to ripen first.
You're gonna have to be a little more, uh, a little more less.
Yes, you just have to lose a little bit of those, uh, excess brain cells you've been,
uh, tripping over, really.
That's it.
They're not much.
Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.

Lombada.
Lombada.
Lombada.




Lumbada.

What we're trying to say is dance the lumbaba.
Ta-da-da-dum.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
Lumbaba.
People could get involved with almost like a form of aerobics of, like, people want to
lose weight, they want to shed those unnecessary LBs, they want to bring the kilos down, and
yet at the same time, they want to bring their own architecture up.
So what do they do?
They run around little circles.
They get on those bikes and things like that.
Well, how can they reduce their brain cells?
How can we...
How should we say it?
How can we...
Lighten the load.
Lighten the load.
Lighten the load.
Up there where it's real heavy.
You know, a lot of people got fat butts.
A lot of people got a midriff.
A lot of people maybe got a saggy neck or something like that.
But how many of us, and I'm saying pretty much 90% to 100,000% of all of us,
have too much going on upstairs?
We've eaten too many psychic donuts.
And the psychobalk, that's an old world,
I didn't make that up.
Well, Dave, there's an answer.
There is an answer.
That's where break thinking comes in.
Bob teaches a technique called break thinking
by which you completely disconnect the mind.
This is also called a path to higher consciousness-lessness.
Can that help the bulges in my brain?
It's to create smooth noodle maps,
as depicted by Devo.
I love smooth.
Yes, to smooth the maps,
the noodles,
on your noodle,
to smooth down the corrugations,
which contain so many excess thoughts,
thoughts of unfairness and sadness that you don't need.
Smooth it down and have only simple, simple thoughts of happiness.
Smooth, they say, smooth.
Lisa, smooth.
One, two, cha-cha, bob.
Cha-cha, bob.
One, two, one.
Cha-cha, bob.
Blow the world up.
Cha-cha, bob.
Blow the world up.
Cha-cha, bob.
Blow the world up.
Cha-cha, bob.
Blow the world up.
Cha-cha, bob.
Oh, hang on.
Now, now, let's get away from that because nihilism is not where the,
this is not even really a church,
but nihilism is not where this organization is going from head to head.
No, who cares about Neil?
We're into Bob.
Who cares about Neil?
Neil Innes, perhaps, if we could hear his song.
That's a great, yeah, Neil Innes of the great Bonzo Dog Man, sure.
Sure.
Bonzoing again, but.
I'm going to be nihilist.
We don't need that kind of, we don't need the kind of destructive.
You can't stop me.
There's a slathery.
You know, some people are afraid of slavery.
We're afraid of slathery.
Like that one cosmic-minded guy was saying on the internet,
negativity is bad and positivity is basically good.
I don't know about that.
Actually, positive thinking is what got us where we are now.
Positively.
It's our own world.
No, I like square edges.
I like things that aren't too round and fuzzy.
That's right, Virgil.
That's right, 90 degree head.
It's time for you to wear off the top of those spongy boxes
and return your brain to its original condition.
It's all in the balance, you know.
Smooth as a noodle and paste.
Ignore or deny every reality.
Please.
Get the bigger picture.
As big as you fit some screen.
Big, big, big.
In your head.
It's too big for my head.
Señor.
God made me do it.
How often do you say that, friend?
Is he pooping?
Big for your head.
It's way too big for my head.
We have plenty more you can use for us.
Oh, okay.
Let me see some of those other ones.
Here we can see the planes bringing in the shipments of giant heads
for these poor bereft people, these humans down here with their small heads,
their empty heads, their sad, troubled heads seen so far down below us.
They look up at we who fly.
They look up at we who fly.
They look up at we who fly.

They look up at we who fly.
Birdmen, junior and senior birdmen soaring so high above them in our slack and our self-professed
superiority, yes?
For we have the megaphone and are able to profess our superiority so much louder than
all of the others.
So much louder than ever before.
That's what we mean by the conspiracy.
The bully.
That's right.
The jerk.
The ass.
The ass.
Pushing you around and never shuts up.
Well, that party didn't have to end that way.
No, it didn't.
So many re-sculpted bodies, so much unused barbed wire, so many belts and gas bottoms
and batteries that didn't fit in the wrong confusion holes, but that's their way of thinking.
Those silly muscle men.
How did they not...
Why didn't they...
They'll never, never know.
It's very simple.
Hi, embarrassing people stare at you without a face.
The face terrified me.
You just want to be normal.
Suck the blackhead.
Freeze, Bob.
You have consumed enough alcohol for one eight-pack.
It is wasteful and pointless.
Obey and live, or disobey and die.
I see no reason for violence.
If, however, you are confronted, you may resort to the use of hypnosis.
You know, God hates you.
Stay away from him.
Licentiousness, just unbridled, uncontrolled excesses.
That was something he invented.
And I say, as long as you're alive,
Joe,
don't make noise or whatever,
because we'll...
Freeze, Bob.
You shut up like hell.
That's utter nonsense.
The future is always nonsense
until it becomes the past.
The American people have now spoken,
but it's going to take a little while to determine exactly what they said.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid, Dan.
What's his name?
Bob.
Bob.
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't you worry about us, Lord.
We may blow a few holes in your ceiling from time to time,
but we give you fair warning before we blow up the whole house.
Yes, fair warning before X-Day.
We told you, July 5th.
This year.
This year might be 1998.
It could be 2012.
We have no idea.
It could be.
The records are all scared.
It could be.
But it seems like this is the year, is it not?
Yes.
This is the year in which the raptured or ruptured ones,
excuse me, I'm so sorry, I'm confused with the other,
but the ruptured ones are lifted up into space
and whisked off somewhere, God knows who.
That's what the fairy tale says.
That's what the fairy tale says.
It's what Bob said.
The actual mythos of the...
Well, I guess it goes back to Philodramond
and Reverend Ivory...
Ivan Stagg.
Ivory Stinks.
Ivory Stinks.
Ivory Stinkytool.
...description of his olfactory, what he gives off anyway.
But in the first place, what we find amongst many of these culties,
these Barbies, these followers,
is an extremely detachment, a disassociation.
An extreme...
A flat A-spec.
A flat A-spec.
Yes.
A null A sign on each one's forehead.
Each one waiting the ride to Venus and it never happens.
Yes.
But some return every year.
Then I thought, I could die doing this.
I guess that this is going to prove myself once and for all that I'm down for Bob.
I'll help him do anything.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Maybe that's all Bob is.
I'll say hello later.
Shut up about Bob, will you?
Go holly.
Go holly.
Just before Christmas, Bob followed through.
He walked into this bank north of Seattle and left with nearly $26,000,
which he stabbed...
...in a child's trick-or-treat bag.
Bob had good reason to smile again.
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.
Give me slack, you frickin' lunatic.
Stop, fucker.
I'm out of frickin' slack.
The lawless are on the loose,
making it necessary for law-abiding citizens to make their own law.
Yeah.
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.
See you in the new Jim Onyard TV.
Don't sass me.
Not only the marginally weird, but the entirely weird.
Oh, yeah.
Work them into the scope of the Church of the...
Right, right, right.
...Catholic.
Right, right.
So, yeah, we work them into the scope.
And some are made to wear the bellboy attendant hats and suits that look quite strange to some of the younger members.
It's a treat for some of the ones who've gone on, so to speak.
Some have the bonsai.
Some have shrunk quite, quite, quite far down.
Yes, yes.
You can hardly make them out without...
And then some have the elephantitis.
Yeah, well, those are the ones that are quite introspective.
You see what happens.
Yes, yes.
The more they think, the bigger their heads get.
And pretty soon, the calcium in the brain, not the brain, the...
The nucleus.
The nucleus.
That's what...
I have a question.
I have a question.
Is this show for, like, people who are on drugs?
Oh, I...
I hope not.
That is a hot-button subject.
I would hope that it would be the kind of thing that would replace the drugs, don't you see?
Exactly.
It's the repugnancy factor, Stang, is what we've been talking to.
Rather than merely an enhancement.
Listen to this.
Who needs drugs?
Well, you might need them as an enhancement for this show.
I don't know.
In order to make it more palatable.
You may need a...
Oh, poppycock.
Or a doggy bag.
Or a pair of hairy...
That's a bunch of boobies.
Or a swashly.
To give it the semblance of social value or...
Friends, if you want to know more...
It gives you definitely a feeling that your mind is being monitored by the...
Your mind can be further monitored if you will simply write for free information if you're interested in more about the Church of the Subgenius.
You can get some by mail from Bob at...
Well, actually, it's not Bob.
That would be ridiculous.
It's Jesus.
At...
Post Office Box 204206.
Austin, Texas.
78720.
That's the business headquarters, you might say, of the Church.
The second...
Or what is it now?
The fourth Megafist Temple Lodge.
The spiritual headquarters is, of course, here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.
You can send tapes and CDs and such like...
To me.
Reverend Stang.
At subgenius.com.
Post Office Box 181417.
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
What's ours?
It's...
4-4-1-1-8.
Yeah.
4-4-1-1-8.
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.
Hour of Slack.
Number 942.
There actually have been that many of them.
Although a few of those, I guess, were reruns.
The music in the background is the swinging love corpses.
The collage of noises that we heard were sourced from...
I got that stuff from all of the subgeniuses.
A special thanks to New Monet, Fernand and Andy Lemur, and Artemia Salina, I think, for a whole lot of that.
I organized them myself using the rules of chance.
And I'm going to...
Price Bob and stay out of...
Asleep.
Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
The professional pessimist.
In the past, he's been called the prophet of gloom and doom, the troubadour of trouble,
the disciple...
The disciple of despair.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Bob.
The unbalancing that happens when you work with these people makes you really question what you know reality is.
Mom, Mom.
Everyone wants it.
Mom.
Give me slack, you frickin' lunatic.
Stop.
Fuck off.
You're
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
I know nothing, nothing.
Doug's right, Virgil.
We are different.
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.
Even Doug Smith.
I'll admit, it's the good news, son.
Cry havoc and let's split the dogs of war.
My boy, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.
Sex, sex, sex, 30, 30, sex, sex, pay $30 and get six sex free.
Pills, pills, pills, bop, bop, pilly, bop, pilly, bop, those lads, those lads, those lads,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, zip it, bop, bop, bop.
Hey, you smoking?
No, but the pipe is.
Good.
Good!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, dear.
Thank you.
Apparently, Bob came and...
did something with all of us.
Stop.
My mind is going.
Stop.
My mind is going.
Stop.
My mind is going.
My mind is not my mind.
One look at them will tell you more
than a thousand words of mine.
Bob.
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show
and we're even more glad that some listeners
have donated enough to help us keep on going
for another couple of months.
Not just this show, but subgenius.com
and all the other archive sites.
But if you truly love Bob
and want some of that slack back to rebound
to you,
you should go to subgenius.com
front page or especially the radio page
or the catalog store pages
and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like
to be on the brink of total poverty
and we don't want any subgeniuses
to make their own situations worse.
But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference
even if it's only once a month
from enough of you.
Fifty bucks makes a big difference.
Even a little bit of money
makes an even bigger difference.
All we're saying is that
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs
if you don't pay Dobbs.
We also take checks and money orders
to subgenius foundation.
P.O. Box 181417
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
Thanks for anything you can do
to help let there be slack.
