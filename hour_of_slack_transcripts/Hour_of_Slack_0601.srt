1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Eh?

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,480
Eh?

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,460
Oh.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:06,980
Oh.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,800
Oh.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,100


7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,860
Oh.

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,400
Yes, baby!

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,980
It is time

10
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,620
once again

11
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,200
for that self-same

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,460
one and only

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,620
true hour of

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,180
slack number

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,120
601.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
That's right.

17
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,780
601 hours of slack

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,900
on the wall and painted

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,860
across the inside of

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,680
your cranium. Your poor

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,640
skull has had these

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,880
damn shows lining it

23
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,620
for weeks and weeks now

24
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,660
and there's not a damn thing

25
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,240
you, me, or

26
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,620
J.R. Bob Dobbs

27
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,500
can do about it.

28
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:53,840
Eh?

29
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,520
Heh heh.

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,600
Hey.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,060
What the?

32
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,760
It's time to be manipulated.

33
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,140
Brother, I want to tell you something.

34
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,040
The world is tired of dead preaching

35
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,980
preachers. Dead preachers preaching

36
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,280
dead sermons to dead congregations.

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,200
They're tired of cold

38
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,120
services and cold churches.

39
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,240
This world is hungry for

40
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,100
reality. They've had enough of

41
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,000
Hollywood. They've had enough of

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,980
Nashville. They've had enough of

43
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,980
show business. They're hungry for the

44
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,980
mighty power of the man that

45
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,580
walked the shores of Galilee

46
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,700
2,000 years ago and

47
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,580
raised the dead and cast out

48
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,400
devils and healed the sick.

49
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,420
And I'm here to tell you tonight that

50
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,340
Jesus Christ is still

51
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,260
raising the dead and healing.

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,720
I have my own

53
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,440
cheerleaders.

54
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,280
They're the sisters of

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,620
mercy. One of my main

56
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,500
cheerleaders just passed away, Mother

57
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Teresa. So now, pick

58
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,520
a religion. I mean, whose cheerleaders

59
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
do you want, really?

60
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,640
I'd like to

61
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,500
thank Satan's cheerleaders for being here tonight.

62
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,580
They have another gig to go to, but

63
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,620
before they do, they're going to

64
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,720
be taking up a collection for what is a church

65
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,020
without a collection. So,

66
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,520
and I think we're splitting it

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
50-50. Half of your proceeds

68
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
that you donate will go to

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,380
the Satan's cheerleaders

70
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,480
to do with what they

71
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,600
will, shall be the whole of the law.

72
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,860
And our money, of course,

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
will be donated to the home

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,560
for slackless children.

75
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,300
Half goes to heaven and half

76
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,280
goes to hell.

77
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,520
And our name, too.

78
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Nothing you can make any difference.

79
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,880
As Bob said

80
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,080
to L. Ron Hubbard,

81
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,860
Where are you?

82
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,220
I forgot the quote.

83
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,760
They may be pink, but their money

84
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,780
is green.

85
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,220
Say, why don't you

86
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,140
come with me? I'm off to see

87
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,720
the Wizard of Bob's in

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
Animal World City to

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,400
cut me some slack and

90
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,160
help you to get a brain.

91
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Well, please,

92
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,520
take me with you. Please, please, please.

93
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,640
Where are we going again? Italy?

94
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,080
Take me with you. Take me with you.

95
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,160
No problem. Something's got to

96
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,300
move this plot along.

97
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
Come on with me and follow the

98
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,600
yellow spit toad.

99
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,040
Ribbit.

100
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,660
I have to see the Wizard.

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,160
The long-holding Wizard of Bob's.

102
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,260
You are about to experience

103
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,780
the awe and mystery

104
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,820
which reaches from the inner mind

105
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,460
to the subgenius.

106
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Our

107
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,720
house.

108
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,940
What?

109
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,100
Stop. Stop. Stop.

110
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,260
This is a stupid religion.

111
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,080
Say amen.

112
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,340
Amen.

113
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,560
Next day is more than a day.

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,260
Next day is an event

115
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,980
in the life of all mankind.

116
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,080
Man.

117
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,140
Mankind cannot wait

118
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,000
for this incident to happen

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,680
or to merely unfold beneath

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
its tortured, twisted unicorn toenails.

121
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,660
Mankind must instead rise

122
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,480
to the challenge of X-Day

123
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,060
and meet lovely Beverly Smats

124
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,000
and Jerry Thorhead

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,040
along with Wanda Smits

126
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,580
as the tortured gasoline-attended woman

127
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,940
in the tales of X-Day

128
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,960
coming to a drive-in

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,600
somewhere south of Philadelphia.

130
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,960
Another man

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,280
doth gall!

132
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,080
A other man

133
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,400
doth gall!

134
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,840
The Stars will be right July 5th

135
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,680
1998

136
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,180
Discover your secret yeti heritage

137
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,760
before it's too late.

138
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,560
Surf the non-euclidean angles

139
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
of the Luck Plain.

140
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,560
Learn elaborate hierarchies of extra-dimensional deities with unpronounceable names.

141
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,600
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

142
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,080
For further details, send $1 to the Subgenius Foundation,

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,120
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214,

144
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,660
or visit www.subgenius.com.

145
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,820
And these things are coming and coming speedily.

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,040
We are near the very, very end of the church age,

147
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,840
and of course the Gentile time has already come to a close.

148
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
How are you dangerous?

149
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,460
You don't conform to proper thought patterns. You need to be scanned.

150
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,840
Well, neither do you, and you need to be scanned, too.

151
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,520
Oh, my goodness.

152
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,780
There's no accident that God has you on at this late hour

153
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,440
where decent people can't hear you except for those like me

154
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,280
that are forced to stay awake to feed their families.

155
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,980
What am I going to do with this animal?

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,860
Control, control, you must have control.

157
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,260
Control.

158
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Control, control, control.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Control, control, control, control.

160
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,800
Excellent, excellent.

161
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
I read you loud and clear.

162
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,040
Now then, you are to take this planet in the name of the Earth.

163
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,300
Hail family.

164
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Strong, strong.

165
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,760
...to pick out targets for in the United States.

166
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,860
Ivan the Targeteer will probably lay what we call lay down

167
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,760
a thousand of those on United States cities.

168
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,820
If you think about that, that means that almost every city in this country

169
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,100
with a population of 15 to 20,000 or more is going to have a nuclear weapon.

170
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,100


171
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,800
And we've been targeted on it.

172
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,620
Friends, you have to do it for yourself.

173
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,820
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

174
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,860
And what I'm doing, all of this, all this religion, it's just all religion is.

175
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
It's just a pep talk.

176
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,180
It's just a booster shot.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,580
You know?

178
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,700
And why, for instance, why are we here?

179
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,180
Why are you all here?

180
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,660
What the hell are you all here for?

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,480
We're all here.

182
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:23,640


183
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,580
Well, as you can hear by the divine heckling, friends, it's for the attitude.

184
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,900
If, if, more than anything else, it's not necessarily for the music, which, you know,

185
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,260
it's good, I guess, or the ranting, which kind of, well, the preachers aren't very good

186
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,660
looking, and, well, or the whatever.

187
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,580
You know, it is the attitude that you're, because there are, there's two kinds of subgeniuses

188
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,260
in this room.

189
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,520
What's it done?

190
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,000
The ones who, the ones who think it's clever and cool and they get the joke and that's

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,300
fine.

192
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,240
And those who really get it and truly believe.

193
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,100
Those who really do anything for that man, Bob.

194
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,680
It's a difference, and you can tell it when you spot, when you first start talking to

195
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,760
him.

196
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,880
You can judge a book by the cover sometimes.

197
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,140
You know, you can't tell by the way they look.

198
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,240
They're not good.

199
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,440
You can't tell by the look or how old they are, how fat or skinny they are, but you can

200
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:32,240
sometimes tell whether somebody has paid some dues, you might say, and, and who hasn't.

201
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,480
Who has TV consciousness and who has true slack consciousness.

202
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,080
Those who are making the effort to pay attention to the slack that is already there.

203
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,020
You are swimming in a sea of Bob's pills, and you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb,

204
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,560
and dumbless to detect them.

205
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,500
But it's all, it is all there, friends, as long, that's the key to it.

206
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:07,520
But we must not let the conspiracy turn it into Slackers versus Slack, or the can't-see

207
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,060
Bob versus the real Bob.

208
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,980
He tops the

209
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:35,000
whole bunch of new stuff.

210
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,500
Life is Full of Clchlag.

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,380
Wait!

212
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,380
We're by the Canary Islands, not too far from the Canaries.

213
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,820
I can even smell it.

214
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,440
Mmm, different than the Azores, much different, much more tropical.

215
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,240
Yes, this is where the big fat sardines are, the ones that fit in those cans as big as

216
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,640
a car.

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes, and soon we'll be so rich that we, that we'll eat napalm and, and, uh, sell imported

218
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,700
cheese.

219
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,340
Kennedy was never killed.

220
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,800
He was never killed.

221
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,160
Here's the deal.

222
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,920
The day before he was supposedly assassinated, he goes down to Cape Canaveral, the very day

223
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,380
before he's down in Cape Canaveral and gets a guided tour by the astronauts themselves

224
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,100
of the new rocket ships meant to take them into space.

225
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,320
And Kennedy was like so into this, man.

226
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,280
He was like, he was their total space cadet.

227
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,680
Oh, I have got to go now.

228
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,080
Yeah.

229
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,120
Please, please just strap me in.

230
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,740
I'm going to go down to Cape Canaveral and get a guided tour of the space.

231
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,740


232
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:47,740


233
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,300
And, uh, the, uh, the, whatever they did was staged.

234
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,280
That was just Hollywood.

235
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,760
What you saw in the films, it's all Hollywood.

236
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,700
So it was kind of like our dream of genie.

237
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,960
There was Jack in the one set in one place there and there was Marilyn Monroe and the

238
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,980
other one with the, with the little space helmet on.

239
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,060


240
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,360
There it is.

241
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,980
They were heading for the pleasure vesticles of the space testicles.

242
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,800
They're heading for the, they were headed for the pleasure vessels.

243
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,400
Matter of fact, as far as I know, they were, you know, given honorary mayor and queen

244
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,300
or something like that, you know, uh, to the pleasure vessels.

245
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:29,320
But unfortunately they're in a, an orbit around Neptune that they ran out of fuel and they're

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,160
just going to have to wait until after X day when the ships can pick them up along the

247
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,560
way out.

248
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,220
Yeah.

249
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,720
I remember you telling me that one time in a dream and there was one glitch in their

250
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,860
contract that had to keep fornicating for 30,000 years.

251
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,620
Yeah.

252
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,980
And it wasn't fun no more.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
In order to keep up the light speed.

254
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,380
Cause even if you're not going to be able to fly, you're not going to be able to fly.

255
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,380


256
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
They didn't have orgasmic pleasure.

257
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,820
They had to stop doing it.

258
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,340
You know what I mean?

259
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,480
That was the only thing that was different.

260
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,560
Nobody knows that I'm a pleasure ship.

261
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,420
Hey, I got an idea for something different.

262
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,320
Let's not do it.

263
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You know, the pleasure ships, they couldn't, they do travel faster than light and you travel

264
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,220
three, four or five times faster than light, which means you're actually going so backwards

265
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,260
in time that you were already not, you had already left before.

266
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,300
But only when Jack and Marilyn are having orgasms.

267
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,640
You know what?

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,140
And you can achieve, you know, five, six, seven times faster than light really depends

269
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,780
on how good Jackie is that, you know, night and after about the 35,000 tonight, you know,

270
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,580
things get a little, but since they've become the icons, they, you know, they like the job.

271
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,880
I've heard they like the job, but there's one bad part about it.

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,560
They got in this little window.

273
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,620
There's Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey.

274
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,980
I was on video tape and I'm doing it laughing and making rude comments.

275
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,380
Yeah.

276
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Shooting guns.

277
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,460
There's another hell they got to go through for their alleged affair.

278
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,720
Shooting guns in the room next door.

279
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,100
Happy birthday to you.

280
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,820
Mr. President.

281
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,720
Yeah.

282
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,160
All the cooking.

283
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:16,380
The cutesy Bob might tell some funny jokes, but the real Bob, the real Bob is a real Bob.

284
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


285
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


286
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


287
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


288
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


289
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


290
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


291
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


292
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:16,380


293
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,660
The real Bob won't even show up.

294
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,180
The real Bob will just be a picture of the real mom.

295
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,660
Anything else?

296
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,200
Kill it.

297
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:31,700
If somebody ever claims to be Bob Dobbs to you, Bob said, if, if you meet me on the highway,

298
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,380
kill me.

299
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,400
Reason being, if it's really Bob, it ain't going to hurt.

300
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,680
If it wasn't, Bobby's going to stay dead and good.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,200
.

302
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,200


303
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,500
.

304
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,500
So though it is true that we are now after 20 years, the official authorized anti-establishment

305
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,640
institution, yet at the same time, friends, we are looking for the, we're looking for

306
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,800
people who love to hate.

307
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,100
We are looking for the for real down hole people, the gamblers, whores, hustlers, players,

308
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,000
and pimps and bull daggers.

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,220
The down hole people, you know?

310
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,480
The for real people.

311
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,480


312
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,580
Cause those are the ones that have slack.

313
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,640
Friend, friend, do you pee?

314
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,020
Then you might be interested in what I have to say.

315
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,840
.

316
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,320
.

317
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm sure you're really interested in everything we have to say here, dear friend.

318
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,640
.

319
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,360
.

320
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,440
.

321
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,460
.

322
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


323
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


324
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


325
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


326
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


327
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


328
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


329
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


330
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


331
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


332
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


333
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


334
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


335
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


336
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


337
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


338
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


339
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,460


340
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,540
.

341
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,540


342
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,280
.

343
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,100
This new CD we got is really promising.

344
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,740
It's from Ego Plum.

345
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,920
That's the name, Ego Plum.

346
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:09,480
And we'll tell you more about Ego Plum in Los Angeles as time wears on.

347
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,780
.

348
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,360
No, I need something fancier.

349
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,840
Holy, holy, holy.

350
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Holy, holy, holy.

351
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,780
Holy, Lord Bob Almighty, dear friends.

352
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,600
I guess it's so good, again, to have the power.

353
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,640
The power.

354
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,420
And let me tell you what power we've been listening to at the very beginning of the show.

355
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,640
You heard the great Jimmy Swaggart.

356
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,420
You heard Jesus Christ collecting for the subgenius revival here in Texas, in Austin.

357
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,580
Our most recent show there in Austin.

358
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:20,020
You heard Einstein's Secret Orchestra and the Brain Rot Radio Theater and the Wizard of Bob clip.

359
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,920
You heard even more Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

360
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:36,640
As Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave delve deeper into the very bowels and up the little fleshy hole.

361
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,400
And all the way.

362
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,780
All the way through the murky, muddy crud of those tubes to X-Day.

363
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:54,740
You heard Reverend, in fact, Ear, Reverend Friday Jones in your ear.

364
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,600
With her pro subgenius rant number four, Discover Your Secret Yeti Heritage.

365
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,160
Nice, smoky voice, Reverend.

366
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:07,940
Reverend.

367
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,100
Miss Friday Jones, as doesn't she.

368
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,860
And plenty to back it up to, friends.

369
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:22,400
And little bits and pieces from the ancient subgenius media barrage number five, as well as number zero.

370
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,700
Both masters recently repaired by myself with a tape splicer.

371
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,340
And some clips from the recent Austin devival.

372
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,640
Subgenius devival sponsored by Fringeware.

373
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,520
In Austin.

374
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,060
Austin, Texas, where I just got back from.

375
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,880
Hey, why are you here?

376
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,860
And who is the real Bob?

377
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,020
And the electric guitar music we've been hearing up until...

378
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,820
Up until just that second.

379
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,920
Well, no.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
Well, you know, the old 70s sound kind of Hendrixian material.

381
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,820
That's from Mahogany Rush.

382
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,860
Frank Marino, Land of a Thousand Nights.

383
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,580
Lots of Einstein's Secret Radio.

384
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,960
Talking about Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

385
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,060
And how on X-Day we have to fornicate.

386
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:23,000
And friends, this music in the background is an amazing new CD we got from something called Ego Plum.

387
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,740
Now, not very much explanation.

388
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:36,460
I believe that Mr. Ego Plum composes this material mainly for films.

389
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,640
And, uh...

390
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,100
Animation and so forth.

391
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,960
The piece we're hearing in the background now is called Les Cirques Macabres.

392
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,460
Other titles include things like...

393
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,820
Well, let's just skip through them.

394
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,900
Now get this, friends.

395
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,180
Listen to this guy's stuff.

396
00:19:53,780 --> 00:20:00,280
The music in this video is a work of fiction.

397
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,280


398
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,960
It is intended to be a work of fiction.

399
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,140
It is intended to be a work of fiction.

400
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,600
It is intended to be a work of fiction.

401
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,720
It is intended to be a work of fiction.

402
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:07,720


403
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,700
In addition to that music is like one of the most historic films in the world.

404
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,300
Here we go for another one.

405
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,300
I know...

406
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,120
Well, this guy is part of a work because I know where this guy goes.

407
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,420
Now, make sure I'm all dried up.

408
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,120
I have to close two of them at this point.

409
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,120


410
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,440
Naturally, it goes on.

411
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:26,880
I have to.

412
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,460
Hmm.

413
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,640
Now this guy's stuff is showing some versatility.

414
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,260
Catch Clown Fever is the title of this little ditty here.

415
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,900
Here's an evening stroll.

416
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,320
It's rather reminiscent of Nino Rota, the fellow who scored so many of Federico Fellini's

417
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,980
films as well as many other things.

418
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,260
There's a very Rota-esque feel to these.

419
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,340
Which also, you know, I mean for younger people I guess they'd say, oh it sounds like Danny

420
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:18,960
Elfman.

421
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,800
Well, it's...

422
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,440
I don't know.

423
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,720
I don't know.

424
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,760
I don't know.

425
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:24,780
I don't know.

426
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:24,820
I don't know.

427
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,200
I don't know.

428
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,300


429
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,460
I don't know.

430
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,380
I don't know.

431
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,860
I don't know.

432
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,720
This guy's great!

433
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,560
Amputato is the name of this little piece here.

434
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,740
We get the coolest stuff in the mail, man!

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,660
Man.

436
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:51,940
Man.

437
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,320
There's that foreign film sounding stuff.

438
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,160
And it is film soundtrack music.

439
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,400
The CD came to with a...

440
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,540
Well, here, I'll read you the letter.

441
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,880
Dear friends, just as a glimpse into the subgenius foundation...

442
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,040
Well, this is a glimpse into the more glamorous and fun end of the subgenius foundation.

443
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,860
All right.

444
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,960
All right, friends.

445
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,460
And this letter from this person we've never heard from before.

446
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,280
Max Patlan of Ebola Music.

447
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,720
Ebola Music, which brought us the CD.

448
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
The ego plum.

449
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,360
The anthology of infection.

450
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,280
Poor reverend.

451
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,600
In a world where instrumental music usually means Yanni or Kenny G,

452
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,920
our label is breaking new ground in something we like to call uneasy listening.

453
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,360
We're very proud of the fact that our release has been so well accepted locally.

454
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:11,640
When kids who claim their favorite band to be the Dead Kennedys email us wanting to know more about ego plum and Ebola music,

455
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,640
we begin to feel we've tapped into something special.

456
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,160
Imagine.

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,200
Instrumental music.

458
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,640
Oh, this is like a form letter to...

459
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,220
Radio stations, but they did send it to the right guy.

460
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,920
Imagine instrumental music that actually appeals to Generation X

461
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,020
that isn't techno, ambient, or jungle, or some sort of retro lounge gimmick.

462
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,720
Ego plum is 22 years old and creating music like nobody else.

463
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,860
I'm sure it helps that he is part of Generation X and not some stuffy old composer.

464
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,540
He's just another punk.

465
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,060
With a sick sense of humor and talent spilling out of his ears, to say the least.

466
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,560
You know what?

467
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:08,260
My theory is that the guy who did the music also wrote this PR letter and has the fake front music company.

468
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,020
I did the same thing.

469
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,280
When we started the Church of the Sub-Jewish Friends, you know, Bob just kind of threw it in our laps.

470
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,440
He said, Reverend Stang, Viola, you boys now, just...

471
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,480
Look, here's the truth, the fact.

472
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,080
The fact is, you're...

473
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,840
You're tensing me.

474
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,420
The conspiracy exists.

475
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,040
And the world ends July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning.

476
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,680
Go for it.

477
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,300
That's about it.

478
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:44,480
And so we find, friends, ourselves as directionless as...

479
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,660
Well, no.

480
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,500
Actually, what I was about to say was...

481
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,760
And we've struggled in just...

482
00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:01,340
The same way for any kind of media notice as this fellow has with his form letter and his strange CD.

483
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,860
But it's a...

484
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,620
The difference between this one and most of them?

485
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,680
This stuff is really, really good.

486
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,660
Friends, Ego Plum may be reached at...

487
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,740
Got that pencil ready?

488
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
Email info at...

00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,840
EbolaMusic.com.

490
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,400
EbolaMusic is one word.

491
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,320
Just what you would think.

492
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320

493

You may write to Post Office Box 226-914.

That's 226-914.

496
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,440
Or Los Angeles, California.

www.EbolaMusic.com.

499
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:16,560
No, I don't care whether these kids are 22 years old or 102 years old.

500
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:16,980
They're...

501
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,560
Friends, we deal with some strange...

502
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,900
Characters in this church.

503
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
This old church.

504
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,100
This...

505
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,120
This magnet for the...

506
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,700
Fatally talented, one might say.

507
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,120
And also a lot of just complete screw-ups.

508
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,040
People with no talent at all that think they've got something on the ball.

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,160
And just need a sense of superiority because...

510
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,000
Basically, they're losers.

511
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,020
And you know...

512
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,300
I'm glad that we provide that sort of...

513
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,180
Haven for these souls.

514
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,940
Especially if they...

515
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,000
Send in their $30.

516
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,760
Thank you.

517
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,260
Stimulating themselves and clearing their debts.

518
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,060
I want him to figure it out for us...

519
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,820
At least it's my idea.

520
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,280
I don't ask for money.

521
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:51,840


522
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:51,840


523
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:51,840


524
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,540
political frase

525
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,620
i

526
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,040
Thank you.

527
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,000
Thank you.

528
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,400
Thank you.

529
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,300
Thank you.

530
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,860
Thank you.

531
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,640
Oh, I should mention that this piece is called The Happy Peasants.

532
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,020
What, what, what?

533
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,320
Oh, my God.

534
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,520
Tragic release.

535
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,040
Oh, my God.

536
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:29,240
There is an outhouse on a lonely hill

537
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Where you can moon the rising sun

538
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:45,260
And it was almost the ruin of a drunk lay boy

539
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:51,760
Who was guilty of too much fun.

540
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:01,700
The band had came home on a Sunday morning

541
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,600
Just before the break of day

542
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,840
My friend didn't know when he pulled down his pants

543
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
But a blue larder was there to help him out.

544
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:21,840


545
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,900
He stopped on the roof because that was all heful with.

546
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,160
A snotp 의� crisp stick

547
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,620
And Thanh Tienyong.

548
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:32,980


549
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,980
The spinning Adam made it beautiful.

550
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,800
Forget big aby and play you Regroo.

551
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,740
A larder.

552
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,120
It was made

553
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,120


554
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,120


555
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,420
Is

556
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:46,460
it

557
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:46,980
it?

558
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,820
All right.

559
00:32:51,820 --> 00:33:00,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

560
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:10,340
Well, he went to sleep, a forgotten man.

561
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,400
His race to the pot had been run.

562
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:33,200
And he told me later that he froze his eyes off when he woke up with the rising sun.

563
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:42,620
But worst of all, in the shivering cold,

564
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,220
he remembered.

565
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,100
The chore he had not done.

566
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,240
Adding in sun to injury.

567
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:05,180
There was no toilet paper in the outhouse of the rising sun.

568
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:15,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

569
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,860
That Quentin had the other day.

570
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:39,880
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,iro, oh, oh, oh, oh.

571
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,020
He said my Vaticano guy was blind.

572
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,020


573
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,480
He swung an bow as to the Warden of the Alliance.

574
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,360
And a sharp blow to hitherto reason.

575
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,360


576
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,380
Harryята won.

577
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:46,380


578
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,240
Son, get up, son.

579
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,120
Rise up, wake up, boy.

580
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,100
Don't go to sleep on that pot, man.

581
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,220
Freeze your ass off.

582
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,820
You could really get serious, you.

583
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,940
You won't be worth it for a week.

584
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,320
Get up, man, go to bed.

585
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
Get up, man.

586
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,080
Get up, kid.

587
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,440
It was nearly the run of this poor, drunk playboy.

588
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,620
He was guilty of having too much fun.

589
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,300
But none of it was in the house of the rising sun.

590
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,920
Friends.

591
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,520
Tom X.

592
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,140
I wish I hadn't been so rude to that guy when he walked up to me backstage at the Austin show

593
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,260
and handed me his CD.

594
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,100
And his tank.

595
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,740
I said, God, I feel, I kind of felt good.

596
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,240
It was a rough time for me.

597
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,680
But I feel like Tom and X, Tom X and I could probably, you know, could probably relate.

598
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,100
Cut.

599
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,640
Tom X is available at, last week when I ran that song by him,

600
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,380
I couldn't find an address.

601
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,800
On the CD jacket.

602
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,860
But there is one on the CD per se.

603
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,980
Which is, and I prepare you now.

604
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,560
Supernatural music.

605
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,180
Dedicated to the one I love.

606
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,700
The one I, Cyclopean, love.

607
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,720
The one I love.

608
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,580
Love.

609
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,260
Akashic Records.

610
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,400
5704 Parkview Trail.

611
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:04,480
Tom X at 5704 Parkview Trail.

612
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,120
Austin, Texas.

613
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,200
Texas.

614
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,920
Did I say that right?

615
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,220
Texas.

620
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,000
Huh.

696
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,160
suppose, oh, this man or woman will be equipped for the future. Yes, this new human will have

697
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:27,600
maybe seven eyes, maybe twelve nostrils, and three middle nostrils. Yes, yes.

698
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,560
There's no expense needed for that. Oh, there will be no expense, spirit, my beloved one.

699
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,900
When we all take the jump into the future, our fingers will become as long as those tendrils

700
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:46,660
of light. Our muscles will be like chicken wire. Our feet, oh, the things we'll do with

701
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:54,820
our feet. I think this is all madness, and I'm very, very frightened. Oh, don't be frightened,

702
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:02,660
child. Any walk into the future always has a few jittery moments. Once you put on that

00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,660
arcane suit with the seven silver scientific slash, seven, seven.

704
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:16,540
Seven, seven. You'll be one of us, and one of them, too. Oh, you'll be one with everything.

705
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,720
Wow, it sounds really exciting. Maybe I should just step up and do it.

706
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,840
That's right. Of course you will. We'll all step up and do it. Sometimes we'll step back

707
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,780
and do it. Sometimes we'll step aside. But we'll all be doing it with...

708
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,860
Many, many new digits and a brain that's as big as a car. We'll drive around in that

709
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,240
car, you and I, and the rest of us, too. In fact, in fact, well, I...

00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,820
He's so dashing. He's the kind of guy you really can just put all your faith into, you

711
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,040
know?

712
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,020
I have a hard time putting everything into perspective. I have a hard time keeping everything,

713
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,860
well, keeping track, so to speak.

714
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,100
Yeah.

715
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,920
Oh, so I once was a...

716
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:17,960
Yes, yes. I'm back, dear friends. Back from the damned. I was saved. I have saved myself.

717
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,800
We'll all save ourselves. You and you and you, well, you and you will save each other.

718
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:32,380
But the rest of us, we'll all save ourselves. And when we do, we'll take the Sky Chopper

719
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,260
into oblivion with our new hands.

720
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:50,780
They'll digitize together. All the extra digits digitize into one big hand-to-hand thing.

721
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,620
It's going to be amazing. Wondrous.

722
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:01,960
Oh, it's truly amazing. It is truly amazing, the things they've done here at the Michael

723
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,860
Sharts Agency.

724
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,680
You see, I'm...

725
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,960
One of our finest talents this year at the Michael...

726
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,780
Michael Sharts Agency was Miss Betty Pegg, whose hit song, I Wanna Be Your Romeo Baby,

727
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,220
sung in Urdu.

728
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,300
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

729
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,520
There she is.

730
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,100
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

731
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:32,720
It's going to flatten across the planet and embed it in each one of these platinum-based CDs.

00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,760
It's a message for each and every one of you.

733
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,020
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

734
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,540
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

735
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,760
A cosmic message.

736
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:37,940
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

737
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,980
A cosmic message spoken deep into the forebrain of each and every one of you.

738
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,680
It is what you need.

739
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,100
It is the expansion you've been waiting for.

740
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,780
The beta-increasement, the oxygen case, the blue, the purple, the orange, the colors.

741
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,740
Oh, it's great.

742
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,340
You're going to love it.

743
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,120
So don't forget to be your Romeo baby.

744
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,400
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

745
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,100
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

746
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,940
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

747
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,920
I wanna be your Romeo baby.

748
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,140
can till the love, baby yeah.

749
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,720
Come on.

750
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,460
Be your Romeo baby.

751
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,200
Come on, yeah, yeah.

752
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,420
I was a bashful cello one time.

753
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,380
I was bashful.

754
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,700
Thank you.

755
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,180
Thank you.

756
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,640
Thank you.

757
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:18,720
It was a new one on me, friends, on a new Hendrix compilation, an authorized thing called South Saturn Delta.

758
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,140
Is that the...

759
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:33,200
And this beautiful stuff in the background is, of course, once again, Ego Plum.

760
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,840
Ego Plum. I like this Ego Plum thing.

761
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:51,580
We heard also the Brandenburg Concertos No. 4, as done by Wendy Carlos, and Einstein's Secret Radio, The New Man,

762
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:02,480
as described by Alfred E. Newman, a.k.a. Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

763
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,180
And Princess Wiardo, I think, was in there with Chaz Smith.

764
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:15,300
On the 10997 ESO show, you never know what's going to come up next in this horrible day and age.

765
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,740
Thank you.

766
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:23,020
Well, if you're in Cleveland, then there is something I can tell you about.

767
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,360
There's a big devival Monday.

768
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,000
Lick my lips so I can talk right here.

769
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,520
Monday, October 27th.

770
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,340
At the Euclid Tavern.

771
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,220
Yeah, we got a big devival coming up in Cleveland.

772
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,860
Monday, October 27th at the Euclid Tavern with Dr. Legume.

773
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,860
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

774
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,140
That's right, we're just going to be doing it and doing it and doing it.

775
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,260
We'll do it right in front of your face. We don't care.

776
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,760
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I think I messed up for a minute there.

777
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,560
I'm sorry. Well, we do care.

778
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,200
But, um...

779
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,320
Yes, with Dr. Legume and Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

780
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:22,760
we'll also have the Lord of all creation, Jesus Christ, the Son of God,

781
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,980
and also Joe Offrick.

782
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:32,080
Joe Offrick, the weirdo that was rejected from the Church of Satan

783
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,500
because they felt like he made them...

784
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,140
look bad.

785
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,580
And so we put him in our shows.

786
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,200
And, um...

787
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,880
And, friends, if these shows go out on time,

788
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,100
then that's probably tomorrow night if you're in Cleveland.

789
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,180
And I'll see you there.

790
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:53,900
Whew!

791
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,480
Yeah.

792
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,420
We're also planning, friends, a...

793
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
an X-Day drill.

794
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,000
0.5.

795
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,500
Another X-Day.

796
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,000
X-Day drill.

797
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,920
Before X-Day.

798
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,740
You know, the world ends July 5th, 1998,

799
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,220
and we've been having these yearly drills every July 5th.

800
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,340
But we're going to have a halfway in-between one

801
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,880
on January 2nd through 4th, the weekend.

802
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,200
It's New Year's weekend, basically.

803
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,420
An X-Day drill, 0.5.

804
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,500
0.5.

805
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,600
And we don't know where it is yet.

806
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,940
So if you want to attend this weird, weird, weird event,

807
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,600
you're just going to have to pay closer attention

808
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,780
than you have been paying now, ain't you?

809
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,700
And, uh, that attention can be gleaned from...

810
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,820
Got that pencil ready?

811
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,740
Bob at Post Office Box 140-306-Dallas, Texas 7524.

812
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,640
That's right.

813
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,960
Once again, we can say that it is Dallas, Texas 7524

814
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,860
and Post Office Box 14.

815
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,260
I could get in real close and say

816
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:29,240
it's Post Office Box 140306-Dallas, Texas 7524.

817
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,820
That's right.

818
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,240
And this band at the background is E-Go-Plum.

819
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,780
E-Go-Plum.

820
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,760
It's a nasty band.

821
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,340
It's a nasty band.

822
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:02,380
It's a nasty band.

823
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:03,720
It's a nasty band.

824
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


825
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


826
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


827
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


828
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:03,720


829
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,020
P.O. Box 226914 Los Angeles.

830
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,560
Uh, uh...

831
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,880
90022.

832
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,800
Ego plug.

833
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,080
Cool band.

834
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,260
Ego plug.

835
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,440
Ego plug.

836
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,480
Ego plug.

837
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,580
Ego plug.

838
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,640
Ego plug.

839
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:33,660
Ego plug.

840
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:39,820
Ego plug.

841
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,740
Ego plug.

842
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,460
Ego plug.
