1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,760
This is blotched and blurred for dirt and stars.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,380
If you go outside right now and look up about 20 degrees above the northwestern horizon,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,060
you'll see a bright light in the heavens.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,260
No, you won't.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,820
This is what we call a celestial conjunction between the Pleiades and Uranus.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,880
No, it isn't.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,640
Shut up!

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,740
Yes, it is!

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,380
Uh-uh.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,940
Look, it's right here on the star chart.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,740
Well, the chart's wrong. The Pleiades are over there.

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,660
And I know where Uranus is because you've got your head stuffed up.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,020
Ooh, look, something's up there in the sky, Miss Werner Von Brownnose.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,480
Well, it ain't the freaking Pleiades, you scat.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,240
Oh, I've been taking enough crap off of you.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,040
Oh, you are.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,280
Oh, I've been wanting to kill you for some.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,420
Listen, this is the Galactic Hyperspace Planet Council.

19
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,320
As you will know, there were no plans for the development of the outlying regions of the Western Spiral Arm.

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,640
The galaxy required the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,360
I regret to be left with your planet is one of those in the schedule for ,

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,080
The process will take slightly less than two of your as I say. Thank you very much.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,660
Please spare me!

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,240
What is this?

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
the Arnold Report precipitated an avalanche of sightings

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,680
from cities, towns, villages, from every section of the country.

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,300
Look, there it is.

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,820
And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,460
This is an outrage.

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:54,220
And yes, dear friends, this particular hour of Slack number 1420

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,040
is actually an episode of Reverend Susie the Flusie's

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,440
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from beautiful WREK Atlanta.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,620
Praise Bob and praise Susie.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,100
Tell me, young man, what new reports are you getting

35
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,380
on unidentified flying objects?

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Flying saucers?

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Oh, they keep coming in every once in a while,

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,820
but we don't take them too seriously.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,260
Oh, no?

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,580
Of course not.

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,520
It must be amusing to a man in your line of work

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
to hear about all these screwball reports.

43
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,820
It is my firm opinion that these sightings

44
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,540
should be investigated most meticulously.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,780
You don't believe that these flying saucers actually exist, do you?

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,460
And how can you be so certain they don't, Mr. Chum?

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Well, I just don't believe it.

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,040
Our minds should be open.

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,480
And I know all subjects.

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,960
Wrong conclusions are usually the result

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,340
of lack of comprehensive analysis.

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Of course.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,740
Well, thank you, Doctor.

54
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,920
I won't take up any more of your time.

55
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,800
And I'll let you read the article before I send it in.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,640
Thank you, Mr. Chum.

57
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,400
I'll be looking forward to it.

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,020
You flee out of this world

59
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,220
When I'm gone

60
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,140
Looking at you

61
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,320
I hear

62
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,280
Out of this world

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,460
The music that no mortal ever knew

64
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,920
You're right

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,040
Out of a book

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,360
The fairy tale I read when I was so high

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,220
You're right

68
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,220


69
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,220


70
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,220


71
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,220


72
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,220


73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,160
No armored knight

74
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,540
Out of a book

75
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,600
Was more enchanted

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
By a lower life

77
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,280
Than I

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,480
Hey!

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,060
They cut me off!

80
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,860
They got my truck!

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,920
Oh, seekers.

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,600
Seekers?

83
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,760
Welcome.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Back to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,180
W-R-E-K Atlanta is back online

86
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,140
Just in time for X-Day, as we're calling it.

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,880
Oh, yes.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,900
I know the aliens were supposed to come down last year,

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,820
but hey, I can't figure out a bank book myself,

90
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,800
much less an alien civilization's concept of time.

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,660
Ah, hell.

92
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,080
Maybe it's some sort of

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,300
daylight savings error or something.

94
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,340
I don't know.

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
But no matter, seekers.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,780
Because I really feel it in my bones this time.

97
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,060
Yes!

98
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,040
Yes!

99
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,280
This time we shall escape into the stars

100
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
with our excess deliverers.

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,320
Escape into a bright new firmament

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,040
of joy and rapture

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,540
and endless, endless slack!

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,500
Oh, yes.

105
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,860
This July 5th,

106
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,020
I will finally be ensconced

107
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,340
in the brain-blistering embrace of Bob.

108
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh, yes.

109
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,160
Nestled in the warm lap of our savior.

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,800
Feeling that unidentified something

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,440
poking me in the butt.

112
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,840
Oh.

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,420
Just a consummation devoutly

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,200
to be wished, seekers.

115
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,840
Let's wish real hard.

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,040
Well,

117
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,960
there was something up there in that sky.

118
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:53,840
And if they were not,

119
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,300
they're not balloons.

120
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,300
I don't know what to think.

121
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,020
Oh, just give the great unwashed

122
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,360
a pair of oversized breasts

123
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,420
and a happy ending

124
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,140
and they'll oink for more every time.

125
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,340
Whee!

126
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,620
That a...

127
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,300
Whee!

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,700
That a get-out-now-boy.

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,040
Whee!

130
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,780
There were literally hundreds of cases

131
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,500
where Air Defense Command pilots

132
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,680
had attempted to intercept UFOs.

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,320
Very well.

134
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,820
Change course to intercept.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,340
Lieutenant to Uhura.

136
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Sound yellow alert.

137
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Aye, Captain.

138
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,780
Bridge to engineering.

139
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,620
Engineer and Scott here, Captain.

140
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,220
Scotty, we're heading for a violent energy disturbance

141
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,480
of as yet unidentified origins.

142
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,460
We may have to do some jumping about.

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,360
Stand by.

144
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
Ready back here, sir.

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,920
Good. Bridge out.

146
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,840
Range is still considerable, sir.

147
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,440
Full power on the long-range sensors, Mr. Solo.

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,840
Wide screen if possible.

149
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,260
Working on it, sir.

150
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,500
We're getting something.

151
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,140
What the...

152
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,500
Most remarkable.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,720
What is it?

154
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,940
The intergalactic laxative

155
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,400
will get you from here to there.

156
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,400
For cosmic constipation,

157
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,100
there's none that can compare.

158
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,240
If sitting is your problem

159
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
when you're out there in the stars,

160
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,140
oh, the intergalactic laxative,

161
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,980
the intergalactic laxative,

162
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,720
the intergalactic laxative

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,460
will get you from here to Mars.

164
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,220
I was talking with Mrs. Collins today.

165
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,120
She tells me her husband's cousin

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,640
works with a man who swears he saw a flying saucer.

167
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,260
Uh-uh.

168
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,980
I thought I told you that term was taboo in this house.

169
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Do you really think

170
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,000
they might be from Mars or someplace?

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,760
Look, honey,

172
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,100
don't you get like the rest of those screwballs

173
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,660
that I have in my hair all day.

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,160
You, too, can be a Martian.

175
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,920
Right on!

176
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,040
Every time some kid flies a kite,

177
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,260
50 different people see spaceships.

178
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,580
Come on, let's get to bed.

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
Baby, it bouts

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,500
building a palace

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,840
made out of diamonds, smiles, and miles

182
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,960
and all we've got

183
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
candy and stuff

184
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,540
and all that stuff

185
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,600
and all that stuff

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,600


187
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,820
all of the thing

188
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,560
we dream of

189
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,320
baby, it bouts

190
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,000
taking a spaceship

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
into outer space

192
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,760
land on a moon

193
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,360
space suits and boots

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
and everything

195
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,080
that's cool

196
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
They don't partake

197
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,300
like you and I

198
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,860
for beefy burger mush

199
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,600
their food is specially themed

200
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,420
Be prepared to dissolve into slush, absorbed by multi-fibers in the super diaper suit.

201
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,280
Otherwise the slush would trickle down inside the boot.

202
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,780
I'll never walk among the stars, nor glimpse the dark side of the moon.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,380
Never fly to distant Mars.

204
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll never walk among the stars.

205
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,400
I'll never float for weightless hours, or see the shining earth arise.

206
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,180
Live through any springs like ours.

207
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,920
I'll never walk among the stars.

208
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,720
Those men who venture into space see things I'll never see.

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,180
I'd like to be in their place, though I'll never be.

210
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,060
And as they move through the unknown, can't help thinking though I'm not going,

211
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,300
that I'll never be the same.

212
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,180
Since then.

213
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,300
I'll never walk among the stars.

214
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,780
I'll never walk among the stars.

215
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,120
Perhaps I'll walk among the stars and glimpse the dark side of the moon.

216
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,600
Then I'll fly to distant Mars.

217
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,660
Perhaps I'll walk among the stars.

218
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,760
Perhaps I'll float for weightless hours and see the shining earth arise.

219
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,440
Live through other springs like ours.

220
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,200
Perhaps I'll walk among the stars.

221
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,200
This town has always been my home.

222
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
I've never drifted far.

223
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,440
Much less had a chance to walk among the stars.

224
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
But earth still holds a dream I see.

225
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,180
There is space inside of me.

226
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,100
And a galaxy of people yet to know.

227
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,160
So...

228
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,140
Someday I'll walk among the stars and glimpse the dark side of the moon.

229
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,440
Then I'll fly to distant Mars.

230
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,420
Someday I'll walk among the stars.

231
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,540
Perhaps I'll walk among the stars.

232
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,540
Someday I'll float for weightless hours and see the shining earth arise.

233
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,960
Live through other springs like ours.

234
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,940
Someday.

235
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,620
Someday.

236
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,380
Someday.

237
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,820
Someday.

238
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,980
Someday.

239
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,260
Someday.

240
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:42,740


241
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,440
Someday.

242
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,960
Someday.

243
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,560
Someday.

244
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
Someday.

245
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,480
Someday.

246
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,540


247
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:53,800
Someday.

248
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,520
Someday.

249
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,360
Someday.

250
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,260
Someday.

251
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:00,760
Someday.

252
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeaaah.

253
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,300
Someday.

254
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Someday.

255
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:17,420
Someday.

256
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,480
Someday.

257
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:17,540
Someday.

258
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:17,600
Someday.

259
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:17,660
Someday.

260
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:17,720
Someday.

261
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:17,780
Someday.

262
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:17,840
Someday.

263
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:17,900
Someday.

264
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:17,960
Someday.

265
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,020
Someday.

266
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,080
Someday.

267
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,120
Someday.

268
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,280
Someday.

269
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,340
Someday.

270
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:38,560
As an example of the credible type of sightings reported by reputable, trained observers was the report of Captain Willis Sperry.

271
00:11:43,740 --> 00:12:08,540
The report of Captain Willis Sperry was reported by reputable, trained observers was the report of Captain Willis Sperry.

272
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,980
The operations officer. It appeared brown and white. The commanding officer. It could be seen plainly with the naked eye.

273
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,480
The statements were typed up for the necessary signatures as the interrogation concluded. There was one point on which there was some disagreement.

274
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,400
I hear you've been baking donuts.

275
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,120
Damn you!

276
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,080
Hey, boys will be boys.

277
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,980
Quiet, you awful man.

278
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,460
Look!

279
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,160
Well, there's my ride.

280
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,420
Group of objects in the sky. Machine identification.

281
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,260
I pulled over to the side of the road, stopped, got out, looked up and saw the objects.

282
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,800
There were about twelve of them in a rough formation proceeding in a westerly direction.

283
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,260
They were like nothing I'd ever seen before, although I'd lost some two thousand hours in the air.

284
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,440
They were identical in appearance.

285
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,040
How would you describe these objects?

286
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,540
Like two saucers. One inverted over the other.

287
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,660
I had no means of judging the altitude. It appeared to me to be about the size of B-29s at ten thousand feet.

288
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,120
So this thing was up there all the time, being observed by various personnel from airfields all over that area?

289
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,880
Correct. And they were seeing it.

290
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,300
We checked with our contract astronomer.

291
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,760
Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again!

292
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,200
We got a report that you spotted a UFO.

293
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,860
I didn't see any UFOs.

294
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,540
That's right.

295
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,500
You're right, miss. You didn't.

296
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,420
How long have you been in Air Force Intelligence?

297
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,380
Two years.

298
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,740
Ever come across any cases you couldn't solve?

299
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,040
We have unsolved cases, yes. Cases where good solid blips appeared and no known objects in the area.

300
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,900
Then, too, we have cases of fantastic speed.

301
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,580
Exactly what do you mean by fantastic speed?

302
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,460
I mean speeds greater than any achieved by man.

303
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,320
How much greater?

304
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,200
Thousands of miles per hour.

305
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,640
Thousands of miles? What's your idea of what they are?

306
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,200
All I can say is unknown.

307
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,260
You must remember that I've been restricted to only radar contacts.

308
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,520
I have no experience with visual contacts.

309
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,240
What do you think about the chances of these objects having intelligence behind their control?

310
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,940
All I can say is I have an open mind.

311
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,780
Why shouldn't the government just own up to the fact that there's something that comes and goes here?

312
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,640
Perhaps the issue is one of control.

313
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,620
If they have no control over what's happening, if they can't stop it, then they can't do anything.

314
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,380
Why would they want to admit that?

315
00:14:43,900 --> 00:15:01,760
The Air Force's interest in this problem has been due to our feeling of an obligation to identify and analyze to the best of our ability anything in the air that may have the possibility of threat or menace to the United States.

316
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,620
In pursuit of this obligation, since 1947,

317
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:15,420
we have received and analyzed between one and two thousand reports that have come to us from all kinds of sources.

318
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:27,040
Of this great mass of reports, we have been able adequately to explain the great bulk of them, explain them to our own satisfaction.

319
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:34,280
We've been able to explain them as hoaxes, as erroneously identified friendly aircraft,

320
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,600
as meteorological objects, as a kind of a threat to the United States.

321
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,020
As biological or electronic phenomena, or as light...

322
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,600
Jump for it!

323
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:58,760
However, there have been a certain percentage of this volume of reports that have been made by credible observers of relatively incredible things.

324
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,280
It is this group of observations that we now are attempting to resolve.

325
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:13,420
We have, as of date, come to only one firm conclusion with respect to this remaining percentage.

326
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:26,620
And that is that it does not contain any pattern of purpose or of consistency that we can relate to any conceivable threat to the United States.

327
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,260
We can say that the recent sightings are in no way connected with any theory that we have been able to find.

328
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,560
We have been able to find a secret development by any agency of the United States.

329
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:50,140
There are polls that say that young people in their twenties think it's more likely that they will see UFOs than that they will ever collect social security.

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,180
You will see! You will see!

331
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,840
I think you stopped them, Bob!

332
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,160
I did, Mom. I did, by course.

333
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,860
That's the fella that started it.

334
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,700
Well, we can't compete with that, but... but nothing!

335
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,860
People! People! Space monsters! This is going nowhere!

336
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,380
There's only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre.

337
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,620
Yes, um, I'm aware that Bob is doing some research on this also.

338
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,180
Yes.

339
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,180
And he is documenting the corporate and government connection with this.

340
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:22,360
And he's finding a connection of unmarked helicopters in the Chesapeake Bay area,

341
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,420
sometimes doing surveillance on abductees, and sometimes being seen in the same sighting as a UFO.

342
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,460
Have you also found these kind of phenomena?

343
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,020
Yes, I know Bob.

344
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,420
He's an unidentified flying object. You will see him in the air.

345
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:47,300
He's an unidentified flying object and you will drop your hands and stare.

346
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,220
You won't be afraid to tell your neighbors. They might think that it's not true.

347
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,260
But when you open up the morning papers,

348
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,220
you will know they've seen it too.

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,300
He will come back like he promised, with a price already paid.

350
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,440
He will gather up his followers and take them all away.

351
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,900
He's an unidentified flying object.

352
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,080
You will sweep down from the sky.

353
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,840
He's an unidentified flying object.

354
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,240
You will sleep, but will not die.

355
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,920
He's an unidentified flying object, coming back to take you home.

356
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,580
He's an unidentified flying object.

357
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,660
He will roll away your stone.

358
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,640
Music

359
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,460
And if there's life on other planets, then I'm sure that he must know.

360
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,040
And he's been there once already and has died to save their souls.

361
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,080
He's an unidentified flying object.

362
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,060
You will see him in the air.

363
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,820
He's an unidentified flying object.

364
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,100
And you will drop your hands and stare.

365
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:38,100
He's an unidentified flying object, coming back to take you home.

366
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,360
He's an unidentified flying object.

367
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,060
He will roll away.

368
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,140
He's an unidentified flying object.

369
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,140


370
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,140


371
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,140


372
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,520
You will roll away your stone.

373
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,760
Captain's Log,

374
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,740
star date 6134.6,

375
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,700
a mysterious time slowdown

376
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,980
we're experiencing

377
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,160
has affected

378
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,440
not only every crew member on board,

379
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,500
but all the Enterprise's instruments

380
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,920
and computer banks.

381
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,040
It's as if time itself

382
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,500
were winding down

383
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,520
and us with it.

384
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,720
Sensory readings

385
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,740
confirm my hypothesis, Captain.

386
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,180
The slowdown phenomena

387
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,080
did not initiate

388
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,040
until we came within

389
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,140
three light years

390
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,960
of that peculiar

391
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,300
high-density energy field

392
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,260
directly ahead.

393
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,640
You sure must come,

394
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,940
you smart bastard!

395
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,860
We're all going to die!

396
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,680
Colonel Goddard,

397
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,740
Chief of the Air Force

398
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,400
Photo Reconnaissance Laboratories,

399
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,340
reported that three of his men

400
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,380
flying a B-29

401
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,840
were tracking a weather balloon

402
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,520
over Georgia.

403
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,100
Oh, welcome, Seekers!

404
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,300
Suddenly, an unidentified flying object

405
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,080
appeared and flew alongside the balloon.

406
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,840
After a few moments,

407
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,980
the object dived

408
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,160
and made a pass at the balloon.

409
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,100
I said cut it out!

410
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,120
Then proceeded to disappear.

411
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,160
When the balloon was recovered,

412
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
it had a six-foot rent in it.

413
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,480
Colonel Goddard's men believed

414
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
this unidentified flying object

415
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,400
made the tear in the balloon.

416
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,520
Goddard vouched for his men

417
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
making the report,

418
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,620
stating that they were highly experienced

419
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,400
and reliable Air Force personnel.

420
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,340
The reason that we liked

421
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,900
to occasionally do a host

422
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,080
was for our own amusement,

423
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,200
but if there were a serious purpose,

424
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
more to keep the UFO field alive

425
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,940
during slack periods,

426
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,240
hoping that the public's interest,

427
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,840
or at least the UFO fans' interest,

428
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,400
would not slack off.

429
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,100
And since I at least felt

430
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,420
that there was a serious mystery

431
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,620
behind all this,

432
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,220
I didn't want to see the field die out,

433
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,000
and I thought it was

434
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,840
a good idea to keep it rolling.

435
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,140
Thank you, Bob!

436
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Thank you, Bob!

437
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,480
Thank you, Bob!

438
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,080
Thank you, Bob!

439
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,080


440
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,660
Thank you, Bob!

441
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,740
Thank you, Bob!

442
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,980
Thank you, Bob!

443
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,320
Thank you very much.

444
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,640
Out of the shadows

445
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,180
I see him at night

446
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,960
Jet black hair

447
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,460
and skin so white

448
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,540
Down by the river

449
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,840
where nobody goes

450
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,300
Watching how the jellyfish blows

451
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm not from here,

452
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,680
I'm from space

453
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,380
I don't belong in this place

454
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,240
When I have reached

455
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,740
my sixteenth year

456
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,940
I don't belong in this place

457
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:19,940


458
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:25,220
A vessel will take me out of here

459
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:36,960
A vessel will take me out of here

460
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,340
Into the house

461
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,900
with dogs living there

462
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,320
Mounds of dog hair

463
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,140
cover the stairs

464
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,920
Mother hides her dog hair

465
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,760
in her room with no light

466
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,660
Her hair jet black

467
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,220
Her skin so white

468
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,120
I'm not from here,

469
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,340
I'm from space

470
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,860
I don't belong in this place

471
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,920
When I have reached

472
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,420
my sixteenth year

473
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,740
A vessel will take me out of here

474
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:19,920
A vessel will take me out of here

475
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,000
A vessel will go where I second year

476
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,500
Randy turned sixteen

477
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,860
in a room painted black

478
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,720
picked up a guitar

479
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:49,920
kicked up a guitar

480
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
and let it be back.

481
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,860
Learned all his favorite leads by heart.

482
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,240
Did never hear the rest of the parts.

483
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,140
I'm not from here, I'm from space.

484
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,580
I don't belong in this place.

485
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,940
When I have reached my 16th year,

486
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,280
a vessel will take me out of here.

487
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,680
I'm not from here, I'm from space.

488
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,360


489
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't belong in this place.

490
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,260
I don't belong in this place.

491
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,780
I don't belong in this place.

492
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:58,780


493
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,400
Greetings, friends.

494
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,000
I am Uriel, and we are Unarius,

495
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,320
and preparing the Earth people for the great space fleet landing,

496
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,620
the starship landing.

497
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,440
Excellent.

498
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,940
Now the fun begins.

499
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,920
Excellent.

500
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:17,920


501
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,840
Excellent.

502
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,380
The lunar dust of Talon's moon drifted up in a small eddy,

503
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,240
disturbed by the vortex of transporter energy which swirled above it.

504
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,340
Seconds later, the dust of that moon was marked by Kirk's footsteps.

505
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,620
Kirk peered through the faceplate of his environmental suit

506
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,820
at what waited for him on the brightly lit lunar landscape.

507
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,340
Three more columns of sparkling light appeared.

508
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,360
Spock, McCoy, and Uhura.

509
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,280
Kirk heard Uhura gasp in astonishment.

510
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,960
Spock immediately held up a vacuum-armored tricorder.

511
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,320
Fascinating.

512
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,520
McCoy checked his own scanners in disbelief.

513
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,160
Then his voice crackled over the helmet speaker.

514
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,340
On the barren rocks and soil of Talon's moon,

515
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,620
beneath the blazing radiation of unfiltered sunlight,

516
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,040
and completely exposed to the hard vacuum of space,

517
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,440
there was life.

518
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,660
Kirk moved forward with long, low-gravity strides to meet it.

519
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,400
What he approached was obviously a base of sorts.

520
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,600
About twenty of the sleek, pinch-waisted shuttles

521
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,560
were hidden in the shadows of a rocky overhang.

522
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,400
The shuttles were stacked on top of each other

523
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,180
like a pile of kindling.

524
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,420
The overhang had protected them from direct overhead observation

525
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,000
by the Talon and the FCO.

526
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,880
Though Kirk couldn't understand why the rest of the base

527
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,900
had not been detected by the FCO's long-range scans,

528
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,820
nor had any scan detected the aliens.

529
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,240
And there were hundreds of them.

530
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,180
The aliens' black and silver segmented bodies

531
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,360
reminded Kirk of meter-long wasps.

532
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,740
But they moved across the lunar soil like spiders

533
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,940
on eight spindly silver legs.

534
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,840
Cautiously, Kirk and the rest of the landing party

535
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,520
edged closer to the creatures as they swarmed around their shuttles

536
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,240
and massed near several large silver and black domes

537
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,860
that were scattered on the rocky surface.

538
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,300
Uhura motioned toward the aliens.

539
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,780
Are they machines?

540
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,520
Kirk saw the communications specialist

541
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,900
working with a large flat computer board

542
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,400
with controls enlarged for use by personnel in protective gear.

543
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,180
Kirk was fascinated by the aliens' thin legs.

544
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,960
They seemed to be made of solid metal.

545
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,320
Are they some kind of artificial construct, Spock?

546
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,280
Organics built into a mechanical shell?

547
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,640
I see no indication of anything artificial in their structure, Captain.

548
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,700
I believe that these are living creatures,

549
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:23,320
either genetically engineered or independently evolved

550
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,100
to consume radiation and live in hard vacuum.

551
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,480
Sir?

552
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,060
It was Uhura.

553
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,100
I am picking up a great deal of low-level radio static,

554
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,380
and it seems to be coming from these...

555
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,180
things.

556
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,600
Uhura, is there any chance that the creatures are communicating by radio transmissions?

557
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,580
Why not?

558
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,840
I'll try to link up with one.

559
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,720
Uhura approached two of the creatures

560
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,320
who were stroking a small silverish bubble

561
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,860
that appeared to have sprouted from the ground.

562
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,900
Kirk leaned down to get a better look at the creatures.

563
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,220
Spock, any idea what those bubbles are,

564
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,580
or what they're made from?

565
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,440
The domes are composed of the same substances

566
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,000
as the alien creatures,

567
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:08,980
and their shuttles.

568
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,700
Spock glanced down at his tricorder.

569
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,620
Captain, I believe that we must be looking at different versions

570
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,100
of the same life form,

571
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,920
or at the very least,

572
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,240
different species who share the same evolutionary past.

573
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,280
Are you saying the shuttles and the domes are also alive?

574
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,780
Spock pointed his tricorder in the direction of one of the large black and silver bubble domes.

575
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,640
It was nearly five meters across.

576
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,260
Essentially, yes.

577
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,520
Odd.

578
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,060
Spock continued to read from his tricorder.

579
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,400
There also appears to be a pressurized atmosphere inside this dome.

580
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,340
Well insulated, and with a quantity of liquid.

581
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,240
Water?

582
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,140
Grr!

583
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,640
Ah!

584
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,640
Ew!

585
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,220
You may well ask now what becomes of liquid they consume.

586
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,180
A pipe is led from penis head to a unit in the room.

587
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,900
The water is recirculated, filtered for reuse.

588
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,000
In case of anti-gravity, it gets on the loose.

589
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,340
That's a relief.

590
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,120
Let's get out of here, guys!

591
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,940
Yeah, let's go!

592
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,580
Who?

593
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,840
Yeah, I hate getting wet.

594
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,240
I wonder which button to press now?

595
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,100
I don't know, but here goes.

596
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,200
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

597
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,080
Oh, another button, Billy!

598
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,460
The water's getting deep out there!

599
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,060
Yeah, I think we're starting to float.

600
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,600
Good to hit the right one this time!

601
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,420
I hope so.

602
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:49,980
Click.

603
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:56,720
Over ten years ago, extraterrestrial life beings of incredible love imparted a supreme gift to a woman in Houston, Texas.

604
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,260
They gave her the process for a transformational water to unfold higher spiritual awareness,

605
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,840
create greater mental and emotional balance, and cleanse the cells in the body.

606
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,060
Here is Fantasia, the gift from the stars.

607
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,400
Fantasia, just $79.95 for each lifetime dose.

608
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,240
Order now.

609
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,520
The commercial aspects of the saucer situation were not overlooked.

610
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,100
Alert businessmen and manufacturers came up with all sorts of oddities.

611
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,060
The practical joker moved in.

612
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,080
Homemade saucers of all kinds and descriptions began to turn up promiscuously.

613
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:39,980
Within a few months of the original saucer report, practically everyone in America was conscious of flying saucers.

614
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,720
This man in the saucer, can you describe him?

615
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,800
Well, sir, he was small and skinny.

616
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,400
His head was pointed, came to a very sharp point.

617
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,880
He had long, green hair.

618
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,360
His eyes were a sort of purplish red.

619
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,000
He had large ears which were formed like an antenna.

620
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,840
His teeth were perfect, but spread far apart.

621
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:15,900
And I noticed, too, a jacket of some sort of spun glass and bright red metallic hues.

622
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,460
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob.

623
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,080
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs.

624
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,680
Didn't trust him $20 worth.

625
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,120
$35.

626
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,880
Okay, fine. Fine. No skin off our teeth.

627
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,620
Pay lip service.

628
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,360
Wear that Bob t-shirt.

629
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,260
Be real hip.

630
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,380
But when those saucers come,

631
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:45,480
well, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus, as those great proto sub-genii used to say.

632
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,320
The dumbest nerd could get on the bus for $20.

633
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,740
Well, actually, those $20 don't count.

634
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,400
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade for.

635
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,380
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are, at least made it possible for their betters,

636
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,420
to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

637
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,220
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

638
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,860
Son of a bitch!

639
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,960
Have you been working on anything that would make sense of what happened here, ma'am?

640
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,380
Certainly, Mr. Scott.

641
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,160
Well, did you find anything?

642
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,020
I believe I said I am working on it, Mr. Scott.

643
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,260
Any chance of coming up with something in the next 30 minutes?

644
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:34,860
Hurry, Bob!

645
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,400
Spock's answer took Scott by surprise.

646
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,420
What? You mean that?

647
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,260
You'll have the answer that quickly?

648
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,120
From the center of the lab, another transporter chimed in.

649
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,360
It was louder than before.

650
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,560
Multiple beams coming in.

651
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,840
As I said earlier, Spock continued, I have been waiting for the others to arrive.

652
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,440
The more lurid sections of the press reported that fragments of Mantell's plane were found to be radioactive.

653
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:16,540
Some news sources reported that an autopsy revealed that Mantell had been killed by some kind of death ray unknown to our men of science.

654
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,040
These reports were false.

655
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,420
Because certain publications persisted in using a sensational approach in reporting sightings,

656
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,340
there were increasing demands from the public for an explanation.

657
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,000
However, the air force was not ready to respond.

658
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,320
The Air Force had already taken official cognizance of the flying disks.

659
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,180
Headquarters, United States Air Forces, issued a directive.

660
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,340
UFO is a bucket of sh**.

661
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,200
Whether or not you believe in spacecraft,

662
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:52,680
whether you are aware and conscious of the many, many thousands of higher intelligent super beings

663
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,280
that are projecting their love and their light and their intelligence to the Earth world,

664
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,320
whether you are aware of these so-called psychic happenings,

665
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:16,340
do, above all things, believe and be aware that we brothers all, one and all, and we number in the many thousands,

666
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,800
we are projecting to you with all of our hearts the infinite love that stems from the most high dimensions.

667
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,380
Once he realized that my mind was made up, he made another suggestion.

668
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,160
It was due to this casual suggestion that I walked right into the middle of the flying saucer story.

669
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,680
What's new on this saucer story, Al?

670
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,060
We have nothing on it.

671
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,580
Project Sign is closed.

672
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,380
The A.T.I.C. is no longer investigating these things.

673
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,160
How stupid can they get?

674
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,000
How can they drop an investigation when there are things going on like this Sioux City incident?

675
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,880
Look, George, I don't make policy around here.

676
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,480
I've got a job and I take my orders just like everybody else.

677
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,000
They insisted I make another call for verification with A.T.I.C.

678
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,400
I indicated to one of the reporters to pick up the extension and listen in.

679
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,740
Wouldn't it be grand if you and I could just go away forever?

680
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,240
Some enchanted land, you know, you and I belong together

681
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,920
Like birds of a feather

682
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,360
Come with me and take me by the hand

683
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,860
And you will fly away

684
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,520
On a magic-gun ride

685
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,920
You may have ten eye spots

686
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,400
And a shell made of chrome

687
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,900
You may consume giant tube worms

688
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,760
And cause sulfur pool in your home

689
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,540
You may live on a red planet

690
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,220
With twelve beautiful eyes

691
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,420
And beautiful moons

692
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,220
You may eat with tentacles

693
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,500
Instead of with spoons

694
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,940
We have a lot in common

695
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,660
Though it seems so long ago

696
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,500
We were once organic dust molds

697
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,160
Floating through space

698
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,060
Together in the cold

699
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,000
We are part of the same

700
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Galactic living family

701
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,920
You may be microscopic

702
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,400
And live with billions of your peers

703
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,820
You may be gigantic

704
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,300
And have elephant-sized ears

705
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,320
Your head may be all nose

706
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,020
And you see not a bit

707
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,460
You may tell stories

708
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,420
But the odors you emit

709
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,580
We are stardust

710
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,760
We are amino acid-like forms

711
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,680
Out of an interstellar dust cloud

712
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,060
We were born

713
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,920
We are part of the same

714
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,440
Galactic living family

715
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,320
We are part of the same

716
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,220
Galactic living family

717
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,500
Could these saucers be some kind of a secret weapon of ours?

718
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,300
No.

719
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
If they were,

720
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,400
Air Materiel Command would be free.

721
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,900
If these are not your first to know,

722
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,780
How about a device from a foreign country?

723
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,060
We know they're not.

724
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,760
Not anymore.

725
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,580
What is your opinion, Colonel?

726
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,980
I don't have any opinion, Al.

727
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,840
Line three.

728
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,300
Colonel Goddard's on the phone.

729
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,600
He's got a hot UFO report.

730
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,060
I want you to listen in on him.

731
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,400
OK Colonel, shoot!

732
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,180
こと açça vai reforçar aqui?

733
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,260
You're a4 застрелок

734
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:21,380
Hamidky tip arose a instant farm

735
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Realize what?

736
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,860
A port virus. A port virus.

737
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,280
Inceptible fragments are still uncarried.

738
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,200
Crystal domes and leaving things.

739
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,800
Silent thoughts all the way.

740
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,620
Lying low and clicking trees.

741
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,580
Trying to dodge the military.

742
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,660
In the space race.

743
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,220
While we're happy.

744
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,140
A team panic.

745
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,640
Touchdown on this tiny planet.

746
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,020
Give some nitro.

747
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,120
Maple nattles.

748
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,580
And say nothing ever happens.

749
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,500
Nothing ever happens.

750
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,700
In the space race.

751
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,420
In the space race.

752
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,300
In the space race.

753
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,080
In the space race.

754
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,260
In the space race.

755
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,540
In the space race.

756
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,820
WBC politics and scientists see science tricks.

757
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,700
They're a dose of statistics and nothing's in between for them.

758
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,280
A human problem that leads us far too far.

759
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,040
Our whole society is suffocated to it.

760
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,140
Jon Vazio The

761
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,180
Armageddon

762
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,200
The

763
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,220
prit

764
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,240
The

765
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,260
P

766
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,580
P

767
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:16,620
Dre

768
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,040
Crazy human eyes.

769
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,900
Crazy human eyes.

770
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,520
In the space race.

771
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,500
Space race.

772
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,400
I accompanied intelligence officers on investigations.

773
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:55,700
I witnessed the difficulty in breaking down and gaining the confidence of those who were reluctant to talk about their experiences for fear of personal ridicule and embarrassment.

774
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,580
Others were cooperative.

775
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:03,840
I observed the technique of thorough interrogation used by Blue Book's analysis and investigative staff.

776
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
In almost every case, I heard the same words used to describe the sighting.

777
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,080
These words were...

778
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,560
There I was, having a great time in the backyard, when without warning, I was abducted.

779
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,340
Abducted by aliens.

780
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,900
Warning! Warning! Prepare to be abducted!

781
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:35,180
Congratulations! You have been selected for our cross-breeding program.

782
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,660
To put you at ease, we have recreated the most common spawning locations of your species.

783
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,900
You may choose either the backseat of a Camaro, an airplane bathroom,

784
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,680
a friend's wedding, or the alley behind a porno theater.

785
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,300
I absolutely refuse to go along with this.

786
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,300
But since I have no choice, I'll take the alley.

787
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,180
Hey, wait!

788
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,440
Hey, where am I?

789
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,060
Oh, we're crying out loud.

790
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,080
What are you crying?

791
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,780
Oh, this looks like the alley behind the church we're at this week.

792
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,140
Wow!

793
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,300
Look at that weird thing.

794
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,500
Looks like some sort of machine or something.

795
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,420
Maybe it's a spaceship.

796
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,620
Wait till I tell the rest of the guys.

797
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,720
Hey, Rodney!

798
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,120
Ow!

799
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,540
Hurry up!

800
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,880
What's all the hurry, BB?

801
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,900
Okay.

802
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,340
Meanwhile...

803
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,060
Initiate fertilization procedure.

804
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,240
Oh, you look lovely this evening.

805
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,300
Have you decreased in mass?

806
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,180
I tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques.

807
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,480
Look behind you!

808
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,120
Insemination complete.

809
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:02,920
Really?

810
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,660
That seemed awfully quick.

811
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,660
What are you implying?

812
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,580
Nothing, nothing.

813
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,900
Whoa, wow, look at the time.

814
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,940
I'd love to stay, but I have an early meeting tomorrow.

815
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,280
You're a super girl, though.

816
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,900
I'll call you sometime.

817
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:16,560
Okay.

818
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm gonna go.

819
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,880
Okay.

820
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:18,880


821
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:18,980
I love you.

822
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,220
I'll call you.

823
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,680
Hey, wait!

824
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,560
Kurt watched as the busy alien near Uhura finished ripping apart its victim.

825
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,100
He wondered what was going on in the creature's mind.

826
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,660
According to Uhura, there was a way to find out.

827
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:43,640
He moved closer to the alien who had been disturbed by McCoy's shadow.

828
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,320
Uhura.

829
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:45,900
Uhura?

830
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,280
Can you link my helmet communicator to this one right here?

831
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,940
Uhura brought her board over.

832
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,520
Hi, sir.

833
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,800
Setting the frequencies now.

834
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,920
Go ahead.

835
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,240
Kirk moved to cast his shadow on the creature.

836
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,680
The translator circuits came to life instantly.

837
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,140
Strange life.

838
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,640
Blocked food.

839
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,220
Over here.

840
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,960
Over here.

841
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,360
Strange life.

842
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,580
Strange life.

843
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,720
Blocked food.

844
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,900
Kirk spoke.

845
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,500
Would you like the food to continue?

846
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,300
Yes.

847
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,560
Food.

848
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:25,800
Heat.

849
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,360
Uhura's link worked both ways.

850
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,600
Kirk stepped aside.

851
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,460
Then, after a few moments, he blocked the sun once more.

852
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,600
The creature went into its recitation.

853
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,220
I remember rubbing it on him.

854
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,300
I found it covered in a huge clicking human skin.

855
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:50,300


856
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,740
I didn't know if it was really human

857
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:12,700
modification or the negative patipedia.

858
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:18,660
and then our part of maybe emotional or whatever, you know what I mean, split.

859
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,600
Just take your DNA and go, take what you want and put theirs in.

860
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:25,800
Like that.

861
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,420
Yeah.

862
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,520
That's what they're doing.

863
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,700
And then it also makes me wonder if they're taking all our stuff and screwing us up

864
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,360
and then making us sterile.

865
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,180
Yeah, that's right.

866
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,560
Because it's awful funny that a lot of women,

867
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,880
and after they have this program go on,

868
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,800
then they've got to have this direct abuse and all this trash and with the estrogen and all that.

869
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,800
Did you ever ask them how they thought it was for them,

870
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,140
if it was right for them to come down and just take the parts that they needed and stuff?

871
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,680
I protested.

872
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,540
Give me back my belly fruit!

873
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,200
Then it was just, it's necessary.

874
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,280
It's necessary.

875
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:08,880
So they...

876
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,540
So what?

877
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,300
They're going to do what they want to do regardless of what we think.

878
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,020
It don't matter whether we want them to or not, they're going to do it anyway.

879
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,240
More or less.

880
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,520
In other words, we have no say.

881
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,320
We've got no choice.

882
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:19,900
It's necessary.

883
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,600
But what gives them the right...

884
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,960
You can't stop them.

885
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,600
Exactly.

886
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,640
Yeah, but what gives them the right to do something like this?

887
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,700
Well, the feeling I've got from them is like...

888
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,440
You know, you don't like it.

889
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,280
They're...

890
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,380
They have nothing we can do about it.

891
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,980
As far as they're concerned...

892
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,800
We don't matter.

893
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,180
The survival of them...

894
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,500
Of their race...

895
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,180
Yeah.

896
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,540
Is more important.

897
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,220
Is more important.

898
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,100
And how.

899
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,760
At this point, the crucial issue appears to be whether or not...

900
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,140
A trick!

901
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,080
I see through you now.

902
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,580
There is no such thing as a united federation of planets.

903
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,300
Yes.

904
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,300
It was a low ploy of you, blasphemer, to attempt to fool me into assuming a weaker tactical position.

905
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,920
You are quick, quick, evil monster.

906
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,300
Did you truly think to trick me, me, with such a feeble lie?

907
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,760
This united federation, this tiny fabrication masquerading as an inhabited ship,

908
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,140
is but a decoy manufactured in your own perverted factories.

909
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,260
You will pay for that.

910
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,720
Die, social misfit!

911
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,140
I shall extinguish your noisomeness, imperial vileness!

912
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:51,580
What is your own sense now of the role that these reptilian lizard people are playing in all of this?

913
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,940
Versus these greys with the big black eyes?

914
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,360
At first, when a different kind of pupil came up,

915
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,240
it came up with, well, what people are calling hybrids.

916
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:09,200
For example, in these two children, which are part human and part...

917
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:11,980
...otherworld.

918
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,800
You can see they have a similar vertical pupil.

919
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,860
And this was described by the abductee as being hybrids.

920
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,260
Half human and half something else.

921
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,740
It was a very emotional experience.

922
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,780
You intergalactic hussy! How could you?

923
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,800
Was he better than me?

924
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,860
Mom. Mom?

925
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,180
What's your own personal...

926
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,340
...opinion right now on what the hybrid story is?

927
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,320
Is it real?

928
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,340
Is it something we don't understand?

929
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,080
It's a difficult story to completely understand.

930
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:55,420
Although it's very clear that they are taking samples of eggs and sperm.

931
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,020
And they are doing something with them.

932
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,520
And they are producing odd-looking babies,

933
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,760
which do look half like humans and half like them.

934
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,360
And the detail there is strikingly similar.

935
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,320
The thin hair.

936
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,420
And their large eyes.

937
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,720
But very frail-looking bodies.

938
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,100
Mom! Mom! Mom!

939
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,100
You're not looking in the mirror.

940
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,680
What's the mirror?

941
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,560
That's the big city word for reversifying glass.

942
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,340
Ah.

943
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:23,880
Captain.

944
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,440
We have passed out the phaser range.

945
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,440
Shall I arm the photon torpedoes?

946
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,620
If it can withstand the big bang, Mr. Chekov...

947
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,300
...I don't think there's much we'd be able to do to it.

948
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,420
But Spock disagreed.

949
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,940
It could not have survived the beginning of our universe in that form.

950
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:47,400
As it exists now, it is vulnerable to our weapons.

951
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,760
USA! USA!

952
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,160
No. I have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

953
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,140
Green's friends, as Uriel would say.

954
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,000
Say what? That's what I said.

955
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,080
What is that supposed to mean?

956
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,160
So there you have it, Seekers.

957
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:05,320
A coming global, nay, cosmic apocalypse.

958
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,920
And you have just enough time...

959
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,400
...to write for free information on how the greasier took us out of the Squisher...

960
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,580
...just in time to board the escape vessels of the sex goddesses from Planet X.

961
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,700
Are you lucky or what?

962
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,800
Well, you won't be lucky this July 5th when X-Day roars in...

963
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,100
...if you haven't made your peace with Bob.

964
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:32,260
A good way is to tear off a piece of yourself...

965
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,060
...your wallet's a darn good start...

966
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,740
...and slip that sucker into an envelope...

967
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:44,780
...and send it to Bob at P.O. Box 181417...

968
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:51,120
...Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118...

969
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,120
...to get details on how to get that fool's golden certificate...

970
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,160
...that'll get you out of total incineration...

971
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,040
...or triple your money back.

972
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,080
Oh, what more reason do you need to finally break down and write?

973
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,400
Hey, even I would.

974
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:16,800
Oh, and tonight we had some wonderful helping hands in the mix.

975
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,580
Oh, what did we have?

976
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,180
We had Steve Lawrence singing Out of This World...

977
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,580
...a beautiful subgenius hymn.

978
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,100
There are so many of them when you get down to it.

979
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,060
Oh, and a couple of big chunks of the Tinklers...

980
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,840
...my favorite living room band...

981
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,660
...with two songs...

982
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,120
...Randy...

983
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,260
...that one, I'm not from here, I'm from space...

984
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,800
...oh, how I love that song this time of year...

985
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,520
...and Galactic Living Family.

986
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,980
Oh, yes, and there was a little Donovan with intergalactflaxative in there.

987
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,060
I've always wanted an excuse to play that one.

988
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,160
And then Space Race was by M.I. Sex...

989
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,160
...and then there was some 60s era psychedelia...

990
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,680
...in there by a short live concept band called The Griffin.

991
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,380
Oh, crazy hillbilly abductees from...

992
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,260
...oh, something I taped so long ago I don't even remember where I got it.

993
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:24,300
And tonight we're going to wrap it up with a little John Fogerty...

994
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,100
...with a beautiful song called Sail Away.

995
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,860
And here's hoping we'll all be sailing away on the cosmic breezes...

996
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,140
...to a bright new subgenius hymn...

997
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,660
...that will be playing at the Seacrest tomorrow.

998
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,500
Oh, Seacrest...

999
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,860
...I can taste the slack already.

1000
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,720
Good night.

1001
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,420
Milk, milk, milk, where's the meat?

1002
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,060
And if they were not balloons, I don't know what to think.

1003
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,420
Yeah, yeah.

1004
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,920
Welcome to Sibling, a national park originally documented as a

1005
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:17,920


1006
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,980

1010
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,120


1011
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:49,260
Mama, come look quick. There's light up in the sky. I see the silent ship and it's calling you and I.

1012
00:56:49,900 --> 00:57:03,460
And if you listen close, the reasons all come clear. I'm ready now to go. There's nothing left to fear.

1013
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,600
Well, there's nothing left to fear.

1014
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,180
Leaving all of this pain behind, gonna sail away.

1015
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,220
Letting all of these chains unwind, gonna steal away.

1016
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:35,280
Mama, come look quick. Do I see an open door?

1017
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:42,340
The passageway is lit and it's time to get on board.

1018
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,800
What wonders we will see, what beauty to my eyes.

1019
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:56,740
So come along with me across the rainbow sky.

1020
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,640
Across the rainbow sky.

1021
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,460
Leaving all of this pain behind, gonna sail away.

1022
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,240
Letting all of these chains unwind, gonna fly away.

1023
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:28,100
Making over this troubled mind, gonna walk it once away.

1024
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,380
Leaving all of this doubt behind, gonna sail away.

1025
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:42,540
Mama, come look quick. There's light up in the sky.

1026
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,480
I see the silent ship and it's calling you and I.
