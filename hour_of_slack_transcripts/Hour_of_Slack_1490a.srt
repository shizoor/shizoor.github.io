1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,180
I'm afraid.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,060
Be quiet.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,320
There he is.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,060
Look at his face now, David.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,160
Yes.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,080
I see it.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
It's composed.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,300
It looks human again.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,460
Perhaps we're not meant to tamper with the natural.

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,000
Self-genius.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,100
Powerful.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,780
Quiet.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,120
He's looking this way.

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
It's me, though!

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,920
No!

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,320
The god damn it!

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,940
He's still coming!

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,360
The story of Bob goes back in time to the very beginning of time.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,300
And it's a tale that keeps repeating itself throughout the centuries.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,380
Dr. Darkstriven.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,900
Awesome things happen at Dr. Darkstriven.

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,820
I got engaged at Dr. Darkstriven.

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,220
Wow.

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,700
Really?

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,420
Yep.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,640
Did you really?

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,120
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,440
I lost my virginity at Dr. Darkstriven.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,400
Aww.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,080
I think it was 11X day.

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,040
Aww.

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:12,840
Yeah.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
That was wild.

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,540
Embarrassing.

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,280
Messy.

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,160
It can be.

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,300
I think that was what happened.

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,080
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,920
That's what he told me it was.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,860
That's what Bob said.

41
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,540
Was it the...

42
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,880
Congratulations, Daggy.

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,040
You just lost your virginity.

44
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,720
The other virginity.

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,800
Is that what it was?

46
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,380
Oh.

47
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,900
Oh.

48
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,620
And he left me 50 cents, too.

49
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,900
50 centavos.

50
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Christ, Bob.

51
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,520
Well, that just shows you got something for nothing.

52
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:37,740
Yeah.

53
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,260
And he took away my virginity for only 50 cents.

54
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,000
How about that, ladies and gents?

55
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,320
Oh.

56
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,460
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks?

57
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah.

58
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,360
Yeah.

59
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,720
Yeah.

60
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,300
Yeah.

61
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah.

62
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:54,920
Yeah.

63
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,060
Yeah.

64
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:56,660
Yeah.

65
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,920
Yeah.

66
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,960
Yeah.

67
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


69
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


70
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


71
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:57,960


72
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980

00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


79
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


80
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


81
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


82
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


83
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


84
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


85
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


86
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:57,980


87
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,780
Yeah.

88
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,120
Yeah.

89
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,600
Yeah.

90
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,060
Yeah.

91
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,760
Yeah.

92
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,060
Yeah.

93
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Yeah.

94
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:19,840
Yeah.

95
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:19,840


96
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:19,840


97
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:19,840

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:19,840

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,040
Yeah.

109
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,460
Yeah.

110
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,460


111
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:20,740
Yeah.

114
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,240
Hello? Hello?

115
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,980
Can you get that up a little?

116
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,940
Hey, Bob.

117
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:09,880


118
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,880
Hey, Bob.

119
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,940
Are you alive?

120
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,160
Let's all jump on Bob's back and talk to him.

121
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes!

122
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,460
Hey, Bob.

123
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,300
Hey, Bob.

124
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,320
Hey, Bob.

125
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,220
Hey, Bob.

126
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,860
Turn it up, baby.

127
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,980
Come on, turn it up, Bob.

128
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
Oh

129
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh

130
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,460
Oh

131
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:58,620
Oh

132
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,580
Search for the self

133
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,500
psyche the soul the head and alter ego

134
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:25,140
God loves sheep and nudists there this obscure and obscure use

135
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,920
Oh

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
The best TV Western

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,300
Pardon me say so

138
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh

139
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,020
Love the people you represent to go on a cell right down

140
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,560
While it going was good

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,500
You watch them suffer while you sold your crime

142
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,220
You're a bad excuse for the worst idea you're gonna buy yourself

143
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:47,860
Never going back

144
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,320
What just disappear

145
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,620
Nην

146
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:58,620


147
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:58,800
Oh

148
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Oh

149
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,640
Oh

150
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,980
Well, what's that all about?

151
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,440
It's time for a call to call

152
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be part of this

153
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,460
One thousand billion

154
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,380
Seven one billion pounds

155
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,780
Well, what's that all about?

156
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,220
I think I'm caught in love

157
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,740
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be part of this

158
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,140
I've got the boys of steel

159
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,620
If you'd wake up and feel good

160
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
You have to keep it surreal, likes

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,180
What if I make your leg next to it?

162
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,500
Then I can mess with my barbarians

163
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,440
Take care of my life

164
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,780
I'll call this time you're shoving

165
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,100
I'll put your own bread back up in your oven

166
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,580
Et cetera

167
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,280
Et cetera

168
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,800
In the scheme of things

169
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,960
It doesn't matter

170
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,500
Watch your thing, I don't give a ton

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
To show the way

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,080
To buy the way

173
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,020
Depending on your leaning

174
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,580
To reverse it in their meaning

175
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,040
But your liberty

176
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,780
Is my incarceration

177
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,580
How you doing? What's going on?

178
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,560
It's f*****g

179
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,380
Rock Creek Park

180
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,200

181
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
Self-leveling concrete

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,300
F*****g

183
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,240
With 5-2-1 penalties

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,340
RoboNet Twitter

185
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,120
Our f*****g

186
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
Only nature

187
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
F*****g up in the c**k

188
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,280
Earth, take it off

189
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,420
F*****g, it's by the water

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,180
F*****g, it's by the sea

191
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,740
It's like a treasury socket

192
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,080
But on your own it's Wetter

193
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,660
On your own it's Wetter

194
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,820
On your own it's Wetter

195
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm on my own with my own name

196
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,520
On my own it's Wetter

197
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,160
We're coming after you, dude.

198
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,760
We're coming and we're bringing hell with us.

199
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,580
One thousand billionaires

200
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
and one billion miles of feet.

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,960
Well, what's that all about?

202
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,460
I think I'm copping out.

203
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,900
I don't want to be, I don't want to be part of this.

204
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,740
I don't want to be, I don't want to be part of this.

205
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,300
You guys think I'm crazy.

206
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,500
You think I'm crazy.

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,360
Watch him, Joe.

227
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,660
You know, that's real pretty.

228
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,340
It's real pretty, for sure.

229
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,120
Yeah.

230
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,620
Nope.

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Aren't you gonna smile?

232
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,140
Nope.

233
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,040
Oh, come on.

234
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,560
Please.

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,360
Nope.

236
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,440
Well, sit down, sir.

237
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,700
What's that supposed to mean?

238
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,420
Oh, I think I have time to do just a little bit of credits here.

239
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,400
What's in the background is the Rudy Schwartz project.

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,980
A ditty called Send In Shutwell.

241
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,620
Lemur did the collages that we're hearing tonight.

242
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,200
Except for the one that had music with it.

243
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,840
Obscurum per obscurus.

244
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,640
That was Slackmaster Sarcastra with all the funny bouncy sounds.

245
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,500
The guitar instrumental.

246
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,240
The guitar instrumental at the beginning was the amino acids.

247
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:53,040
And the roll neck sweater song, which is partly in what sounds like Scottish or Irish brogue or something,

248
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,320
is from Pilgrim Speakeasy, a project of Reverend Roger Rogge in the UK somewhere.

249
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,380
Anyway, on with the Rudy Schwartz project.

250
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
We'll be back soon.

251
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,180

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
Thank you.

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,560
Thank you.

261
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,880
Thank you.

262
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,360
Thank you.

263
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,400
Thank you.

264
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,940
Thank you.

265
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,740
Thank you.

266
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,860
Thank you.

267
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,980
Thank you.

268
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,780
Thank you.

269
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,680
Thank you.

270
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,500
Thank you.

271
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,980
Thank you.

272
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,860
Thank you.

273
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,100
Thank you.

274
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,200
Thank you.

275
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,080
Thank you.

276
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,680
Thank you.

277
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,020
Thank you.

278
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,020
It's sort of touching and then after that we'll be funny again.

279
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,220
Okay?

280
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,420
See you on the saucers.

281
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,080
Yep.

282
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,260
guitar solo

283
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,660
Do you see what I see?

284
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,280
Do you see what I see?

285
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:21,580
Do you see what I see?

286
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,400
Is the group all annihilation?

287
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,920
Will we hell today?

288
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,500
Maybe red horizon

289
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,200

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:38,640

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,280
Wonder of blackened day

292
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,840
Wonder of blackened day

293
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,960
Love of murderer

294
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:16,960

299
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,860
Who am I insurance,

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:29,000
Uh, yesterday?

301
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,540
And keep sufferin'

302
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,500
Outwards the Milky Way

303
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,280
Outwards the direction

304
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,420
We are on our way

305
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,880
On the moon we escape vessels

306
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,100
Sex, fantasies and very squid for everyone

307
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,820
Subgenie journey to that distant shore

308
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,200
You've got your money

309
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,780
For a little ride

310
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,040
This is taking us away

311
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,140
To the new bit funny

312
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,100
Say the car's been tied

313
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,280
To the night at the end

314
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,380
Of the old night

315
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,760
To the new bit funny

316
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,140
To the night at the end

317
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,900
To the old night

318
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,400
To the new bit funny

319
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,860
To the new bit funny

320
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,040
To the new bit funny

321
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,200
Thank you.

322
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,640
Yes.

323
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:48,040
With the President riding in a tank with his head just sticking out above the turret, wearing a helmet, a very distinctive appearance for a future Commander-in-Chief to assume the elective office, the highest in his country.

324
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,540
And it's a beautiful spring day. We have wonderful weather. And here is Dr. Philo Drummond.

325
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes, there he is riding his, his, what is this? He's in a tank?

326
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,220
No, it's some kind of military vehicle.

327
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,020
Military vehicle.

328
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,600
Is this what we want?

329
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,820
This may be the brand new Milton Bradley vehicle, which cost taxpayers over $70 trillion.

330
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,540
It's a very small vehicle.

331
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,800
It scares small children and young girls.

332
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,780
His helmet is too small for him.

333
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,280
Yes, I think he sort of grew into it.

334
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,960
He never took it off since his electoral defeat, the first time he ran for President.

335
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,480
I don't know if I can follow him into a war zone.

336
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,300
Well, you may not have to.

337
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,440
Or a war.

338
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:31,800
Zone.

339
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,180
Or not.

340
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,280
Now that we are fighting a five-front war, it's necessary to get even more tanks in production.

341
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,920
It's a war of ideas. It's beyond the front.

342
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,580
So, along with President Dukakis, I and many of the palpitating Americans say, tanks for the memory.

343
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,740
Yes, tanks are a rough side in any man's war, but when they're on your side, well, that's the way to fight it.

344
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,940
We fight a war every day of our lives. A war of me over I.

345
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,140
We've always been at war with East Asia. What's the matter with you?

346
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,260
I'm going to defeat that one so that I can prevail.

347
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:01,840
East Asia.

348
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,480
Is our enemy...

349
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,640
Well, me gives away the secrets.

350
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,020
And we have to sacrifice them.

351
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,600
When it's over, we can build some better buildings and have better food.

352
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,120
Use more water the way we used to in the old days.

353
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm really thirsty. I'm going to get a drink of water.

354
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,360
Sorry.

355
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Where's the clean water around here? Somebody left that dog bowl in the street.

356
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,380
That werewolf piddled.

357
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,840
How are we going to get a drink of water?

358
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,900
Well, you can't.

359
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,560
And that wolf piddled.

360
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,260
I think it just flew out there. I don't think an alien actually came along and pushed it over.

361
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,940
Use this desalination purification tablet.

362
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,320
First of all, it's been identified.

363
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,700
Which show is this, you guys?

364
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,460
The Denning Puddle of Puddle.

365
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,940
Which show? I'm confused.

366
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,980
I can't tell.

367
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,760
Which show is this? Is this the show with...

368
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,540
Is this that Lonesome Cowboy Dave show?

369
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,960
Is it Deuteronomy 69712-5233?

370
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,320
Is it not in...

371
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,840
Is this the winning lotto number?

372
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,060
No, that was the cage number back at old Reformatory 6 where I spent my early days.

373
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,780
Well, it was actually the ward number.

374
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,220
The Halcyon.

375
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,700
I don't want to talk about that. I'm sorry.

376
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,820
I don't want to talk about anything.

377
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,460
We can change the subject then.

378
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
Oh yeah, you had something to talk about.

379
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
Oh yeah.

380
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,580
The...

381
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,500
The...

382
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,560
We heard that...

383
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,380
Don't tell Mikey Alcandor about all of our women because he's going to steal them all away from us.

384
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,420
I guess...

385
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,540
Well, from you guys because I am one of those women so...

386
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,840
So, you know...

387
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,780
You're talking about Michael Alcandor, the crazy guy?

388
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,240
Yeah.

389
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,800
Invades the subgenius IRS channel?

390
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,140
Yeah, he's going to steal all the women...

391
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,740
He said.

392
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,240
Yeah.

393
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,620
But he found out that there's really attractive women and I don't...

394
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,720
You're going to steal the male monkeys.

395
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,260
I don't even think he knows about the new girl yet either.

396
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,900
I don't even think that he knows about Reverend Cinnamon.

397
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,760
She's really new.

398
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
She's really nude, too.

399
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,920
I saw some pictures of her.

400
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,820
She is jaw-dropping.

401
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,160
Yeah.

402
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,000
I don't know.

403
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,480
Maybe we shouldn't put her on the sub-site.

404
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,680
She's like Susie's friend, Julie Newmar.

405
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,140
Yeah.

406
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,140
She might be too pretty to break the sub-site.

407
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,580
Julie Newmar is an antiquated reference to a movie star, isn't it?

408
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,080
Yeah.

409
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,980
Yeah.

410
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,960
Too Wong Fu.

411
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,120
Yeah, sure.

412
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,840
She's Susie the Flusie's best friend.

413
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,260
For real?

414
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,880
No, not at all.

415
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,260
Just the opposite, in fact.

416
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
But that's why I said that.

417
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,220
It's okay, though, Dave.

418
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,960
I think it's okay.

419
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:48,960
Well, it's not bosom buddies anyway, because Susie the Flusie has a pair of tarantulas on her, like a little...

420
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,860
She's been posting pictures of herself.

421
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,220
Yeah, with the bosom and everything.

422
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,240
I remember.

423
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,020
It's the big, brilliant freeze of 2012.

424
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,620
I remember her face.

425
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,640
Remember those sub-genius girl calendars?

426
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,480
And we even had beefcake calendars.

427
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,640
That was before your time, baby.

428
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,800
It was before my time.

429
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,460
There were like five years' worth of them.

430
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,220
I want to see the beefcake calendars.

431
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,220
I'm in the beefcake calendar, believe it or not.

432
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,760
Wait, never mind.

433
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,840
I don't want to see it then.

434
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
I was a lot skinnier then.

435
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,460
And I'm in disguise.

436
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,600
Yes.

437
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,460
Sorry.

438
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,000
As a male human being.

439
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,260
Were you in it, Dave?

440
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,480
No.

441
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:29,980
No.

442
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,660
No, Dave.

443
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,360
I was in the reptile section a few months afterwards.

444
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,740
And they thought it was going to go with the big G, you know.

445
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:46,560
I'm trying to find background music to play, but it looks like my themes from SF fantasy and horror is missing.

446
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,180
He's frantically searching through CDs.

447
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,740
Yeah, real professional here.

448
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,820
I'll put on this one labeled Monsters.

449
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,220
We've used that a lot.

450
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,640
Also, he left his hat sitting over here.

451
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,540
Right next to me.

452
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,080
And I'm pretty sure if I put the hat on, I will get some sort of magic powers.

453
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,100
Or I'll start seeing Bob everywhere.

454
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,280
And I don't know if I'm ready for that.

455
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,140
No, most likely you'd start seeing little white snowflakes all over your shoulders whenever you wear black clothes.

456
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,700
That is weird.

457
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,240
Okay, now I really don't want to put it on.

458
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,720
I had a dream that Bob was like a pizza delivery guy.

459
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,560
And the pizzas were like plastic and stuff like that.

460
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,480
They weren't real pizzas.

461
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,000
But he delivered them and collected money anyway and stuff.

462
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,320
And it was snowing like this radioactive snow.

463
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,340
It's synchronistic, isn't it?

464
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,500
Was it the iodine?

465
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,120
1-3-1.

466
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,220
1-3-1 snow?

467
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,320
Oh, yeah.

468
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,780
That's my favorite pizza topping.

469
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,160
You guys get a lot of that in Ashtabula, right?

470
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,760
Well, I think you're getting a lot of it where you are since the tides have been corrected by the Ubermensch.

471
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,180
Oh, okay.

472
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,620
That would explain the why.

473
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,200
I think you're getting the right spots all over me, I guess.

474
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,540
Hey, we had the big WCSB Halloween masquerade ball last night.

475
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:06,700
I know.

476
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,040
You all got naked.

477
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
I wasn't invited.

478
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,120
And there was a picture of a chicken on the roof.

479
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,260
You were invited.

480
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,840
Dave, you're always invited.

481
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,620
You have a perma-invitation.

482
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,340
Just like the perma-wave in my brain.

483
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,420
Yeah.

484
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,540
Like the perma-later in your brain.

485
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,220
Perma-wave.

486
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,880
The perma-later.

487
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,020
The perma-later.

488
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,620
The perma-later.

489
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,780
Perma-later.

490
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,280
Perma-later.

491
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,640
How come that's funny?

492
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,660
I forgot what a perma-later was.

493
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,460
You know what a perambulist is, don't you?

494
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,560
No.

495
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,520
Yeah, sure, sure.

496
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,700
Perambula.

497
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,540
Does anybody know what a perambula is?

498
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,680
No, Mr. Dave.

499
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,380
It's a baby buggy from the 1800s.

500
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,000
They call them perambula ears.

501
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,940
Oh, right.

502
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,360
Okay.

503
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, to perambulate was sort of like to drive around.

504
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,620
When cars were first invented, they would say, let us go out and perambulate.

505
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,380
Is that going to be on the test, Professor Dave?

506
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,560
Unfortunately, there will be no test this year.

507
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:16,100
There will be an in-class function in which all will be forced to participate.

508
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,080
There will be no...

509
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,120
I have something to brag about, and I can't wait.

510
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,400
For my 61st birthday, I moshed.

511
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,880
I moshed at the WCSB party last night when the last band was playing.

512
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:43,980
I put on my gladiator monster hunting outfit, which is real and has a real hard metal shield on it with a big dob's head in the center.

513
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,280
And I went down there, and Princess Wee and I were dancing around near the mosh pit.

514
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,560
And the moshing youths were eyeballing that big dob's head shield I was carrying.

515
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,560
And we all kind of realized...

516
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,300
I realized all at once that I would be the perfect thing to smash into at high speed.

517
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,820
And they were very polite, violent moshers, and they would make eye contact with me and make sure I was ready for them.

518
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,400
And then they'd come slamming into the shield.

519
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,700
And in fact, knock me down once or twice.

520
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,220
Uh-huh.

521
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,840
Wow.

522
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:22,460
But I was real proud of myself and had to brag because I had moshed with the youth.

523
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,500
And see, moshing wasn't even invented when I was of concert going.

524
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,240
Oh, you foolish liar.

525
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,440
That's not true.

526
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,320
Well, they didn't know about it...

527
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,040
You couldn't even dance if you wanted to.

528
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,860
They didn't know of it in Dallas until after people in the Northeast had been doing it for five or six years.

529
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,180
Yeah, I've been wearing these big Dr. Martin's boots and clobbering each other in front of stages.

530
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,720
That's all it is.

531
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,720
Well, I've seen it a lot more violent than at this one.

532
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,520
They were really well behaved.

533
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,920
It's the late 70s resurrection.

534
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,540
It's the early 80s resurrection.

535
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,780
It seems like a defeats purpose to be so well behaved.

536
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,940
And you performed there just as you would have when you were 30, 50, 20 years late.

537
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,280
No, I was a dad in the 80s.

538
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,000
I couldn't go moshing around.

539
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,180
Well, you had no thyroid gland.

540
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,880
Children your age should never go out without the right clothing.

541
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,420
I was a baby in the 80s, so I didn't mosh at all.

542
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,580
And you're still a babe now.

543
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,580
She's my Reverend Baby.

544
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:25,780
Yes.

545
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,680
I asked my mother if she knew what moshing was.

546
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,000
And she said, yeah, that's when they swan dive off the stage.

547
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,420
And the people in the audience carry them all around.

548
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,360
And I said, well, it's kind of like that.

549
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,980
That's a related thing.

550
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
And it also means eating, right?

551
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,600
Mosh.

552
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,140
No, that's not moshing.

553
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,360
I get confused between the mosh and the mosh.

554
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,380
I meant to nosh last night.

555
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,660
And found myself being tossed around by youths.

556
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah.

557
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,200
That's what you should be doing on your 60th birthday is noshing.

558
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,180
You were noshing later.

559
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,000
Speaking of the stage dive thing, there was, oh, God, what show?

560
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,160
It's the band Ace of Spades.

561
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
You guys know the band?

562
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,260
No, I know nothing.

563
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,680
Yes, you do.

564
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,940
Oh, my God.

565
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
My brain just went blank.

566
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,800
I know Ace of Spades.

567
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,100
I just can't think of the name of the band.

568
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,300
The Ace of Spades.

569
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,480
I've only heard the Duke of Uke ever.

570
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:19,680
Ace of Spades.

571
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,200
Yeah, I know.

572
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,780
The Duke of Uke performs that at X Days.

573
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,200
Oh, my gosh.

574
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
That's the only version I've ever heard.

575
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,740
How am I not remembering?

576
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,020
Anyway, they were playing.

577
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,200
That one band.

578
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,760
And somebody climbed up the monitors and stage dove, and they immediately put their

579
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,660
instruments down and stopped playing and just walked off the stage.

580
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,700
Wow.

581
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,260
That is good.

582
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,380
So they don't like it so much anymore.

583
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,140
Wow.

584
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:39,900
I guess.

585
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,060
I had a similar experience where, an actual experience where I got later fired from a

586
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,300
band for stuff like these.

587
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,740
I used to drink a lot when I was playing and stuff.

588
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,560
And so I did an Iggy dive off the stage.

589
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,020
And there was a table right below me pretty far.

590
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,720
And they had amassed all their beer bottles in the middle of the table with some sort

591
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,380
of anal little punk rock deal or something.

592
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,200
And I could see myself as I fell off and was like,

593
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:08,740
Motorhead.

594
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,580
It was Motorhead.

595
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,340
It was Motorhead.

596
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,260
I don't know what it is about being on the radio that makes me forget every band name

597
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,320
that I've ever heard.

598
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,560
Oh, it was Motorhead.

599
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,660
Motorhead.

600
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,280
Yeah.

601
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,900
Also, speaking of which, you should-

602
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,380
I think I've heard bands just in time to save my life from being impaled on the beer bottles.

603
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,800
That was really her-

604
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,060
Heathen's the Hawkwind thing.

605
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,780
Beer bottles are hard to fall on.

606
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:28,840
Oh, right.

607
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:28,840


608
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,000
Now that we're talking about bands-

609
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,440
We have to talk about an election.

610
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,860
And it's not the scary one that's even scarier than Halloween.

611
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,460
It's a-

612
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,240
It's scary enough.

613
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,060
It's more of a petition.

614
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,900
Our friend Reverend Heathen-

615
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,180
Yes.

616
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,580
Had pointed out, had noticed that the band Hawkwind was not mentioned in the Rock and

617
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,500
Roll Hall of Fame.

618
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,360
And he thought it was high time that they get mentioned.

619
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,660
And I do too.

620
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,740
I've never-

621
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:51,960
We agree.

622
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
I don't actually have any of their albums.

623
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,240
Just agree.

624
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,360
But-

625
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,740
I agree.

626
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,080
Thank you, Dave.

627
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,040
He started a petition at moveon.org.

628
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,580
And I'm going to give you the tinyearl.com code for anyone who wants to get the band

629
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:12,380
Hawkwind on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

630
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,860
Got that pencil ready?

631
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,100
Got that pencil ready, friends.

632
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,640
That tinyearl is tinyearl.com.

633
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:19,640


634
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,700
That's T-I-N-Y-U-R-L.com.

635
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,280
Slash, and then here's the hard part.

636
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,140
McKay-Fackle.

637
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:36,780
Which is spelled M-K-8-F-A-Q-L.

638
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,360
McKay-Fackle.

639
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,480
No, maybe it's a one instead of an L. I'm not sure.

640
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,720
M-K-8-F-A-Q-L.

641
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,820
It sounds like a mind controller.

642
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,440
It's got M-K there.

643
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:48,920
And either L or one.

644
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,620
It's a mind controller.

645
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,900
M-K-L for experiment.

646
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,760
I like M-K-9.

647
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,640
That was a really good Mortal Kombat game.

648
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,800
Is the link found on subgenius.com?

649
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,140
That was also a CIA mind control experiment.

650
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,060
M-K-9?

651
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,580
No, I played so many hours of that game, though.

652
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,980
Anything with M-K in front of it.

653
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,700
I know, but that's why you're mind controlled.

654
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,060
Anything with M-K in front of it will have a digital future and minimal prosperity.

655
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:11,780
Darn it.

656
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,060
And an expanded forehead.

657
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:13,960
Daggum it.

658
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,340
Really, really, really, really big, like, donkey ears.

659
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,640
Consorn it?

660
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,500
Nonsense!

661
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,300
Stuff and nonsense.

662
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,160
Tarnation.

663
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,160
Who called the greatest librettist of the 20th century, Pinocchio, a hoax in the doddler?

664
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,220
Or, um, what did you say?

665
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,020
I don't know.

666
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,400
I don't know what you said.

667
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,600
What?

668
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:35,600


669
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,100
She's making fun of Pinocchio, man.

670
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,720
I wouldn't do that.

671
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,080
I'm a hardcore Disney fan.

672
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,460
Monstro is my favorite.

673
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,360
I stand by it.

674
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,880
Pinocchio is a really scary movie.

675
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,320
I don't know.

676
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,320


677
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,320


678
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,320


679
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,320


680
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,320


681
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,420
It wasn't the one that traumatized me.

682
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,340
That was Snow White.

683
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,000
But Pinocchio has that.

684
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,660
Yeah, that traumatized me.

685
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,680
The kids start smoking cigars and cough themselves into donkeys.

686
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,120
Yes.

687
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,460
And that's like a, don't go to that movie on acid kids.

688
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:07,900
Oh, no.

689
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:17,460
What's way worse than that is the pink elephants in Dumbo are, it's horrifying.

690
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,040
Even to a sober person.

691
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,760
Yeah, you feel trapped.

692
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,580
Yeah, it's pretty actually unbelievable how, I forgot how intense it was, but I think it

693
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,900
scared me as a child because I had no idea why it was happening.

694
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,360
You didn't know what the DTs were or hallucinations or anything?

695
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,380
Well, like I vaguely understood the drinking, but I just didn't understand why they were

696
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:47,160
spending like seven minutes of the movie on a really weird tripped out thing like that.

697
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,380
Okay.

698
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:47,540
Yeah.

699
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,220
All these things are variables.

700
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,580
I mean, they make sense, but they are.

701
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,980
No, you are.

702
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,860
No, you are.

703
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,280
No.

704
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,720
You are.

705
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,720
No, you are.

706
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,380
No, you're kids be quiet back there.

707
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,660
I'm going to dump you out.

708
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,220
I don't like something that I need.

709
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,180
Turn around, go home.

710
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,060
You want to go to Disneyland or you want to keep fighting?

711
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,820
I want to go to, you don't promise those things idly.

712
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,620
I'm not going to play.

713
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,440
You're going to play.

714
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


715
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


716
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


717
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


718
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


719
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


720
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


721
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,440


722
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,520
Well, Dr. Sinister just wandered in, too.

724
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,580
It was a malignant odor.

725
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,440
I could smell it.

726
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,080
I want to hear it.

727
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,540
Because my show is called Sinesthesia, my voice has a very particular smell.

728
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,520
It has kind of a synthetic, a lacritude built on three common elements.

729
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,080
Nice color, too.

730
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,220
Pink oil?

731
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,800
Definitely, definitely part of it.

732
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:45,960
Pink oil?

733
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,640
Not stink oil, snake oil.

734
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,660
He said pink oil.

735
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,120
Is that what they're selling these days?

736
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,500
Yeah, we should be pink oil salesmen.

737
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,880
We should sell pink oil to the pinks.

738
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,040
It's think oil.

739
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,560
Or press the oil from the pinks.

740
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:02,680
Yeah.

741
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:12,320
Some listeners may not understand that pink, the term pink is a derogatory term for normal people used by subgeniuses who like to think they're abnormal.

742
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,540
How do we get ambergris from them, though?

743
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,120
From the pinks?

744
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,260
Yeah.

745
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,660
You have to go to that one particular part of the ocean where they swim the most, and then it'll actually just wash up on shore after.

746
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,840
No, that's diapers.

747
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,940
Yeah, that weird brown foam.

748
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:27,600
Yep.

749
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,100
That's what the diapers created, that weird brown foam.

750
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:32,920
No.

751
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,060
I'm sorry.

752
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,900
That was a joke.

753
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,660
There it is.

754
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,020
Fully placed, just like that rocket ship through your nostrils.

755
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,880
Rocket away.

756
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,280
Rocket away.

757
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,240
We can't rocket away until we get home.

758
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,580
No.

759
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,300
And then we'll probably blow up on the launch pad.

760
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,140
Most of them do.

761
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:06,500
For those of you who don't know what the reference in Spanish is meaning, he's saying that he's in a secret laboratory where he's living right now in his home.

762
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:12,940
He has a number of the very sterile monkeys that he plays with and conducts experiments.

763
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,300
So he's going to have a lot.

764
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,580
He's going to have a lot of fun when he rockets away.

765
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,280
You like ponies?

766
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,960
You like monkeys?

767
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,420
Maybe I use too many monkeys.

768
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh, well.

769
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,240
I've just been thinking about being one for a long time.

770
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,380
One monkey don't stop no show.

771
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,760
You've kind of had monkeys on the mind this evening, Dave.

772
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,400
You've mentioned monkeys several times.

773
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:34,920
Yeah, I've been wanting to be one.

774
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,160
I thought, like, what a beautiful life, you know.

775
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:44,320
They just come around and grab fruits and berries and coconuts and things like that and have sex all over the place.

776
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,120
Did you know this?

777
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,180
They found.

778
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,380
Monkeys have little factories where they make where they sharp.

779
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,420
They'll get together and find a sharpening place and sharpen sticks.

780
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,860
And after a while, the little utensils they make, it starts to look like a factory because, you know.

781
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,160
There are those monkeys that actually cook.

782
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,600
You're talking about the U.S. House of Representatives.

783
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,380
The monkeys that cook.

784
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:17,040
I mean, it's very primitive cooking, obviously, but they get like the they get like the big whatever they eat.

785
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,660
And they peel like the skins off of it and they leave it sitting in the sun for about a week.

786
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:28,560
And then they have these little holes that are bore into rocks and they put these big things or some kind of nut into into the little hole in the rock.

787
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,700
And then they sit there and smash it with a bigger rock or a rock that they can hold.

788
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,100
And that's how that's how they eat.

789
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,740
That's what they do.

790
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,520
This is like a whole cooking process to this whole thing.

791
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,040
And the kids watch them do it and sit there and like try to practice and learn.

792
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,700
It's, you know.

793
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,840
Are you talking about monkeys of a specific?

794
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,340
Kind.

795
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,080
I think they're actually chimps.

796
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,560
I was pretty sure they were monkeys.

797
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,620
I didn't think they were apes.

798
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,580
The question is, do they let it ferment and then get drunk on it?

799
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,580
That's that's the mark of intelligence.

800
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,620
That's what apes do.

801
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:11,100
That's why bees were attacking us in October, because it seems like even bees have discovered fermenting fruit at harvest time in these climes.

802
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,480
You find bees get real aggressive and bite and sting you and so forth.

803
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,680
You know what?

804
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,420
I'm referring to.

805
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,460
At Autumn Fires, we found out what happens to a bee if you give it church air.

806
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,260
Really?

807
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:25,620
Yeah.

808
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,820
Nitrous oxide?

809
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,840
Laughing gas?

810
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,460
I don't know what that is, but I know church air.

811
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,840
Church air.

812
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:31,640
Right.

813
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,100
You inflicted that on a poor bee.

814
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:35,700
Did it laugh?

815
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,060
Did it fall over and laugh?

816
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,400
Did it go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah?

817
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,860
It got really slow and its little antlers just drooped down.

818
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:44,900
Oh.

819
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,900
And it got.

820
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,560
It's antennae.

821
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,200
It was having a bad.

822
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,240
It was having a bad trip.

823
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:51,440
A bad church air trip.

824
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,180
A bad church air trip.

825
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,220
No more church air please.

826
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,320
Don't stone the bees unless they ask you.

827
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,120
Unfair.

828
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,440
Remember those giant bees.

829
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,480
No, more church air.

830
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,060
We need only enough oxygen to provide ignition for the.

831
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,340
To fill the pews.

832
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,700
If you know what they mean, pee you.

833
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,760
We had passion flowers at the last place that we lived and there were these giant bees as big as your thumb.

834
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:16,820
They were huge.

835
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,960
And they would get so drunk on the passion flower.

836
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,960
What Ev?

837
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,680
That they would kind of fall asleep.

838
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,420
Do you remember that?

839
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:26,860
They would be.

840
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,120
They would be like sitting on the passion flower and they'd be just like.

841
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,700
Princess, we the cool kids now don't say what Ev.

842
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,640
They just say Ev.

843
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,760
I invented that.

844
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,120
That's how I know how cool it is.

845
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,520
No, we're already down to the.

846
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:39,940
Ev.

847
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,420
The.

848
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,120
We're just.

849
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,640
I don't know.

850
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,240
The, the.

851
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,700
It's already been supplanted but.

852
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,420
Yeah.

853
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,920
That's the internet age for you.

854
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,800
Just like a retarded Canadian.

855
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,700
Hey, that's not very nice.

856
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,220
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

857
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:55,800
They try.

858
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,100
Whatever.

859
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,720
Whatever.

860
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,180
Whatever.

861
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:58,900
Whatever.

862
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,100
Whatever.

863
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:00,860
Whatever.

864
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,780
Whatever.

865
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:01,880
Whatever.

866
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:01,880


867
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:01,880


868
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:01,880


869
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:01,880


870
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,500
Sorry to attack Canadians again as usual.

871
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,840
I love Canada.

872
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,080
It's a wonderful place.

873
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,520
Why don't you marry it?

874
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,800
I want to marry it.

875
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,920
I do.

876
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,720
You should.

877
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,380
I want to dress up like a rugged Mountie and storm my way over the bridge.

878
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
And the church is subgenius.

879
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,600
Make my way to the nearest bar and say,

880
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,980
Milton Snod, you're under arrest in the name of the Queen.

881
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:34,280
You hear a dog bark, and I pull out an AK-47 and shoot myself.

882
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,460
Oh, don't do that.

883
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,540
Well, you know, the Mounties are just like everybody else.

884
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,000
They need affection, eyebrow medicine sometimes.

885
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,280
I got it.

886
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,920
You got to pet their little heads for at least like 15 minutes a day.

887
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,980
You tell them they look pretty.

888
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,220
Eyebrow medicine?

889
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,040
Okay, they're called the Mounties.

890
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,560
Who is mounting them?

891
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,900
If they're the Mounties, there's someone who is the Mounteur.

892
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,520
Who is doing the mounting?

893
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,800
Actually, you see, you got that mixed up.

894
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:08,100
Okay, they're called Mounties in English because they're mounted, but in French, they're called

895
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,560
the Moontaires because they're the ones doing the mounting.

896
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,500
Ah.

897
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,520
If they were French, they would be Mountie.

898
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,340
If they were French.

899
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,400


900
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:15,400


901
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:15,600
They're mounted.

902
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,000
Call Les Moontaires.

903
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,920
Maybe I'm spelling Mountie wrong.

904
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,120
I mean Quebec.

905
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,600
There's no I in Mountie.

906
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,420
Actually, if you're my Mountie.

907
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,220
Yes, watch your poetic license, too.

908
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,160
That's the reason why we can't break this loop right now.

909
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,560
So you might as well just start singing the freaking song and get it over with.

910
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,200
Hey, I've got...

911
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,400
I have to bring up a really hard...

912
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,220
I've got a horrible subject.

913
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,080
Uh-oh.

914
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,040
Oh, okay.

915
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,200
And not everyone will agree with me, but I have to tell the subgeniuses not to vote in

916
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,460
the election that's coming at this time.

917
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,240
It won't be coming for those who listen to it on the internet, but in two days is November

918
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,600
4th, big midterm elections.

919
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:08,280
And I'm telling the subgeniuses not to go out and vote because being subgeniuses, they'll

920
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,940
disobey me and actually vote.

921
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,300
Because I'll say that.

922
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,000
I only say this every couple of years.

923
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,320
I only say this every couple of years, friends.

924
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:21,560
But when you don't vote, you're voting twice for someone who would like to lynch you real

925
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,060
slowly and then see you accidentally die.

926
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,000
Do you want me to read that disclaimer behind you before you continue any further?

927
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,180
No, I'm not going to tell them.

928
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,380
Portions of the following broadcast may be found objectable to members of the listening

929
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:34,760
audience.

930
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,500
Therefore, WCSB advises listener discretion.

931
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,420
There we go.

932
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,100
You're safe.

933
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,420
Go.

934
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,080
We won't tell you who to vote for as long as it's not Republicans.

935
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,760
No, no.

936
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,880
We really won't tell you who to vote for.

937
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,680
But I sure won't vote for any Republicans.

938
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,460
Jesus.

939
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,580
I'm terrified.

940
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,060
It's scarier than Halloween.

941
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,880
But I've got to be ready to bend over and take it.

942
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,220
The lynch mobs will be on their way because I already...

943
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,560
Princess, we and I did some bad things.

944
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:12,320
We read Yahoo comments posted by right-wingers in doofus voices.

945
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,100
They're going to get you.

946
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,940
That really...

947
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,460
That really upset some of the...

948
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,020
Oh, what's the polite term?

949
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,980
Right-tards who didn't think that subgenius libtards should do things like that.

950
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:30,240
But we were just reading their own words, albeit in a somewhat doofus series.

951
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,880
The hard part was coming up with enough variety on the doofus voices.

952
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,160
I mean, how many different southern accents, Texas accents, can I do, for instance?

953
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,960
Only about ten.

954
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,640
And there's ten billion doofuses out there.

955
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,260
Ten billion.

956
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


957
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:47,260


958
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:53,360
It's kind of like dark matter, you know, something like whatever percentage of the matter in the universe we can't detect at all.

959
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,060
It's, you know, talking about the dark doofuses.

960
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:55,780
Like, we can't...

961
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:58,900
Ten billion of them, you know, even though we can only count about seven billion people.

962
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,200
That means we can detect less than half the human population.

963
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:03,800
Yeah.

964
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,480
That's terrifying.

965
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,760
It makes it perfectly...

966
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,420
It is.

967
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,640
It's scientifically valid.

968
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,580
And it's stone-sure enough, too.

969
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:10,800
It's not.

970
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,780
Well, some people think that voting just validates this crooked...

971
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,400
...system.

972
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,820
But what it was, I think it was Palmer Vreede said something recently on his Facebook world,

973
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,020
along the lines of, yeah, six million Jews were going,

974
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,220
what difference does it make who you vote for?

975
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,100
Both sides are exactly the same.

976
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,680
That was a rather horrifying way of putting it.

977
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:39,280
But, you know, there were a lot of people in Nazi Germany going,

978
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,540
well, this will pass.

979
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,720
This is going to blow over.

980
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,920
Nobody's that crazy.

981
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,340
Including the Jews.

982
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,820
Yeah, especially.

983
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,340
There were many who did not take him seriously and thought it was all rhetoric.

984
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:49,840
Right.

985
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,040
But rhetoric is going to kill us all because that's all it is, is a bunch of crap rhetoric.

986
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,260
They just tell us a bunch of stuff.

987
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,980
Yeah, but it gets the emotional people really more emotional.

988
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,700
I get really tired of both sides calling the other side the Nazis.

989
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,800
Everyone wants...

990
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,000
Well, the sleeper are the ones that are putting me to sleep.

991
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,660
Well, what is your fascist state, darling?

992
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,980
I must say, there's no way...

993
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,080
There's no way around that politically, scientifically speaking,

994
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:22,640
because you have the emergence of the corporate state and socialism for the rich,

995
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,160
and that's called fascism.

996
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,380
Now, you know what's fascism?

997
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,120
I know someone, and I'm not going to name them,

998
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,280
I'm not going to say by name,

999
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,660
that lives in San Francisco who gave out carrots on Halloween,

1000
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:35,680
and that's fascist.

1001
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,660
No kidding, man.

1002
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,540
If I was a kid, I'd be going, what a fascist.

1003
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,940
But they're orange, like a pumpkin.

1004
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,500
Yeah, but they're not candy.

1005
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,360
That's the point.

1006
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,080
I want candy corn.

1007
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,520
I want the wax.

1008
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,440
Mom gives you damn carrots.

1009
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,500
I want the candle wax.

1010
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,180
Give me the candle wax and sugar.

1011
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,660
They're sweet, though, like candy.

1012
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,120
Carrots are sweet.

1013
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,460
Like candy.

1014
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:55,920
No.

1015
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,340
It sounded like mommy.

1016
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,620
You're talking about that good-looking woman spy in San Francisco, right?

1017
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,500
No, that wasn't good-looking.

1018
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:03,780
That spy woman.

1019
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,680
I know who it is.

1020
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,640
No, it's Reverend Cinnamon.

1021
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,620
She's the one that gave out the carrots.

1022
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,520
I know it is.

1023
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:10,460
I know.

1024
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,680
Oh, well, if she does it, that's okay, because she's so good-looking.

1025
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,760
I wish she'd bring some white, though.

1026
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,620
Oh, is that for Dave Everton saying, that's a very shallow way to view reality?

1027
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:28,960
It just completely and totally turns me off to hear such insipidity and such shallow,

1028
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,560
shallow, shallowness.

1029
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:37,740
Well, then it shouldn't bother you that we're soon going to have to turn this radio station off.

1030
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,520
Well, no, no, just this show.

1031
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,120
Actually, just this show.

1032
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,300
That wouldn't even bother me at this point.

1033
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,400
But, yes, I understand.

1034
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,940
Man, Dave should tell you, Stan.

1035
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,860
Oh, yeah, The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1036
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,260
That's it.

1037
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:58,780
And subgenius.com has everything on it that you would need to know, although you might

1038
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,220
have trouble finding it.

1039
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,820
Some people seem to find it hard to navigate.

1040
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,920
It seems rather automatic to me.

1041
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,880
My hint is look at the words at the top of the page, and if you don't see the one you're

1042
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,420
looking for, try scrolling down the page.

1043
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:19,400
A lot of subgeniuses, by definition, don't go to that much effort.

1044
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,040
You know, the scrolling down, or even lowering the eyes a few inches.

1045
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,680
They wear funny 60s suits.

1046
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,540
I'm sorry.

1047
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,980
Well, anyway, we do have to sort of go or something pretty soon here.

1048
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,200
And then what comes up?

1049
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,060
Oh, the next show.

1050
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,620
Time to deliver plastic pizzas in the radioactive snow.

1051
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,780
Get out and vote.

1052
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,480
Vote.

1053
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,500
That's Bob's job.

1054
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,460
You told us that earlier tonight, Dave.

1055
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,340
Yeah, he said he was going to vote for all of us, too, and he didn't, because I checked

1056
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,420
the absentee ballots for a certain friend of mine.

1057
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,960
Vote for Bob!

1058
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,820
He always lies, and he's always right.

1059
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,520
Oh, man.

1060
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,640
If you could start a religion or something based on that idea, I mean, just think of

1061
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:08,800
it.

1062
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,620
If only.

1063
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,520
Because of the religious power you would have.

1064
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,480
It's not a religion.

1065
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,500
It's a difficult.

1066
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,380
Okay, okay.

1067
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,920
If you could start a cult like that, think of the Rick you would have been saving that

1068
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,180
one.

1069
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,120
It's the Diffie cult that puts the duh in fundamentalism.

1070
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:27,940
Right.

1071
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,420
How about a Tardo club based on what was it you said?

1072
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,080
That one thing.

1073
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,780
That one thing.

1074
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,540
But it's the end.

1075
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,900
And if you could even start a, like, make a Bible out of that or a cram or something,

1076
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,760
that would be really smooth.

1077
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,920
Oh, it's downloadable on Wikipedia or the internet or someplace already.

1078
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,360
Okay, Dave, we have to cut to the news now.

1079
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,600
Thank you, Baby Bear, for being here.

1080
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,820
By the way, Baby Bear wants to come have lunch with you and Ashtabula on her travels.

1081
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,960
Yeah, can I do that, Dave?

1082
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,280
It might be possible.

1083
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,080
We'll give you a call soon.

1084
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,000
Maybe in five minutes.

1085
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,760
Maybe in tomorrow.

1086
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,340
But something will happen.

1087
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:18,540
Anyway, friends, thank you.

1088
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:19,860
Praise Bob.

1089
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,060
And now this.

1090
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,960
From NPR News in Washington, I'm now in effect.

1091
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,300
298 people gathered to collect chickens more than two weeks ago.

1092
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,320
For now, they're working on recovering 80 chickens in an ambush near the PR site.

1093
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,560
Critics say that's a social network such as FaceNerf and TwitBook.

1094
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,480
209,000.2% who addressed the recent surge of 6.1%.

00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,080
Including many illegal percents.

1096

U.S. cell officers made a travesty in great stock due in part to X down in windmills.

1097
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,720
The Fed invested in Zeddy Cup victims from things during core weak measures.

1098
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,120
Dow was 16469.12.

1099
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,180
This is PR News.

1100
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,320
I've been to an election night party before.

1101
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,620
I got to go to the Sherrod Brown victory rally this fall at Public Hall.

1102
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,700
It was pretty fun.

1103
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,140
At my age, it's hard to get an election.

What's that?

00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,340
Free elections.

Uh huh.

1111
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:33,720
Oh yeah, you can get in a lot of trouble for walking around with your election freely.

1113
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,480
Even worse, wearing it on your sleeve.
