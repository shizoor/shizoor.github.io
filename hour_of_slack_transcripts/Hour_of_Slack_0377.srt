1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,460
Oh yes, friends, and Jim Morrison howls very, very drunkenly in the background as Jimi Hendrix

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,940
and Johnny Winter try to bring you this new Hour of Slack opening.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,780
Ah, lovely opening for the Hour of Slack.

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:41,260
For unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving

5
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,440
nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,860
Titus 1.15.

7
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:59,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

8
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,060
Bob?

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,800
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,240
We will control the vertical.

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,340
Wake up, little boy.

12
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,920
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reigns in your subconscious mind.

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:52,920


14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:52,920


15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:52,920


16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,300
The soul genius Hour of Slack.

00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,620
Watch.

18
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,200
With ten in a row favorites of Yesterday and today.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,340
The Best Mix Lifestyle Series.

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,580
Bob is my guy

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,340
Just as sure as birds will fly

22
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,600
And flowers wither and die

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,200
Bob is my guy

24
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,200
So sweet and shy

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,120
His kind of love you cannot buy

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Knowing his love

27
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,540
I wouldn't try

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,400
Bob is my guy

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,280
When he looks up at me

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,340
With his baby eyes

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,600
Thrills my soul

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
Just as sure as birds will fly

33
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,060
Just knocks me cold

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,580
I just can't realize

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,540
That Bob is my guy

36
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,900
When he is near

37
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,100
I hear the sigh

38
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,420
Our love will never die

39
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,300
Bob is my guy

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Bob is my guy

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,340
Ah, yes, dear friends,

42
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,700
a slight departure

43
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,560
from our usual heavy metal

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,800
techno style of Bob songs.

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,080
Joe Ligon's here.

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,960
The song Bob is my guy.

47
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,320
Just knocks me cold

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,300
I just can't realize

49
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,300


50
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,300


51
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,300


52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,500
realize

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,020
that

54
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,980
Bob

55
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,200
is my

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,920
guy

57
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,220
when he is near

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
I

59
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,580
hear the sigh

60
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,380
our love

61
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,760
will

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,040
never die

63
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,260
Bob

64
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,880
is my guy

65
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Bob

66
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,220
is

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,940
my

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
guy

69
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,640
oh praise Bob

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,180
beautiful singing by Connie

71
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:17,500
there

72
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
oh give me

73
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,180
16,000 shares

74
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,300
1, 2, 3

75
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,020
the stock market closes at 3pm

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,740
and you're trying to control

77
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,620
the price of gold with your

78
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:32,820
mind

79
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,160
but sometimes even cabal

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,840
controllers lose control

81
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,320
that's why

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,920
Fruit of the Illuminati is the

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,020
secret of the secret

84
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,600
masters

85
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,100
that's right, each pair of Fruit of the Illuminati is mysteriously

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,040
shrouded in a comfy, non-chafing

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,060
occult coverting, they never itch

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,180
and if intense concentration loosens

89
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,080
your lower chakra, the absorbent

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,000
left-handed pad gives and takes

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,040
away, so whether it's a hit on an

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,300
aging politician or a goofy social control

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,700
experiment go for it break wind without breaking silence with vert of the illuminati underwear

94
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,520
the secret of the secret master look for the eye and the pyramid on the label

95
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:20,400
what if all of the books that you read in school are a lie you better look at the real truth the

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,800
soviets have taken that technology and they have what they call cosmo spheres that are floating

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,040
about this planet using the technique of transmitting energy without wires and they use

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,460
it from their bases in Siberia Kevin you're not a believer are you Kevin well I think that's all

99
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,140
documented from the National Enquirer no it's not it's documented from other library books and

100
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,420
actually if you really want to get into that technology you call it and we'll get to and you

101
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,780
start theorizing about the possibilities of this goes because if you sit down and say this can't

102
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,660
be then again you're going to get into the real world and you're going to get into the real world

103
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:55,780
and you're going to get into the real world and you're going to get into the real world and you're

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,160
going to get into the real world and you're going to get into the real world and you're going to

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,640
God you don't know what's going on okay hi there I'd like to ask George earlier in the program he

106
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,360
said something about the earth being actually designed for 500 million people and that by the

107
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,160
year 2000 with the New World Order or whatever that was that we were going to get back or they

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,440
were going to get back to having 500 million people on here why then has the planet ever

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,780
been allowed to support like four billion earth people

110
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,400
five billion six and a half billion because of their free will we were given the laws of God and

111
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,260
the creation and we and we chose not to abide by him we said oh I'm not going to buy that I'm not

112
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:45,520
going to buy into that trip I'm going to leave myself this man died on the cross 2 000 years ago

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,500
for my sin so I can go ahead and sin and that's exactly what we're talking about that's only one

114
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,520
area or the money changes the bankers said how can I get all these people to bring the

115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,220
money to me I'm going to control the world and that's what it's been all the way around and

116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:10,320
that's what it's been all the way around dear friends well our sermon tonight is from chapter 11

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:22,720
the birth of the true butants which leads us into the subject eventually of original sex

118
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,120
the mating practices

119
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:34,680
among the Yetis of mutantis as well as advice on finding and keeping your true Yeti mate

120
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:46,500
oh yes and here's a a charming creation myth this story is told by the zhugarians of Tibet

121
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,960
the descendants of the original Yetis the true Adam of the Bible created by gods and

122
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,580
the

123
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:11,400
giants in the Earth who found it great mutantis in Antiquitum the motherland of man

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,300
foreign

125
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,440
at first there was no universe

126
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:33,400
Only Gbrogfran, who straddled the backs of four gigantic multi-dimensional elephants,

127
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:43,620
who stood on the back of an even more gigantic toad, which in turn was standing atop another toad,

128
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,120
and below that it was toads all the way down.

129
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,480
But these were composed of nothing.

130
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:04,920
Approximately 100 billion years ago, when Gbrogfran first made something from the all-inclusive nothing,

131
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,460
the early universe was composed entirely of cosmic fire and cosmic ice.

132
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,480
These primordial opposites were formed into huge balls,

133
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,680
by the Great Dung Beetle, and rolled against each other.

134
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,580
As the two elements clashed, explosions produced the aether,

135
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:41,280
some of which the Great Dung Beetle gathered together and painstakingly rolled up into all the tiny atoms of the universe.

136
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,240
Then it rolled all the atoms together to form stars and planets.

137
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,100
The Great Dung Beetle was the first to form a star.

138
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,860
The Great Dung Beetle chose certain of the planets,

139
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,500
and rolled certain ingredients together on them,

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,840
turning the planets into females and their atmospheres into males.

141
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,720
Our planet was one of these.

142
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:14,480
The sky was a shell of pure ice, 20 miles thick, that sheltered the world from deadly cosmic rays.

143
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,780
In those days,

144
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,520
the Earth was one pure lake, covered with bulrushes.

145
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,780
But the sky was lonely.

146
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,880
And so it came down upon the Earth and mated with her,

147
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,700
producing life, all the plants and all the animals.

148
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,220
Meanwhile, there was a great battle in space between Gbrogfran and the Neather Bob.

149
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,520
Gbrogfran killed the Neather Bob,

150
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:52,780
and made the Great Dung Beetle to roll together his blood and feces to form the first man.

151
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,780
Then he made Wo-Man out of rattlesnakes and tarantulas.

152
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,540
Both of them were giants, covered with beautiful hair,

153
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,740
not at all like men and women of today.

154
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,880
And they could live for a million years.

155
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,860
Meanwhile, the Great Dung Beetle had made Man and Wo-Man

156
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,720
as two separate, completely different creatures at first,

157
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,380
able to procreate without sex, by budding.

158
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,460
But Gbrogfran saw them and felt pity,

159
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,560
and made them come together.

160
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,140
And when the root of Man-Man was sunk into the crevasse of Wo-Man-Woman,

161
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,820
that was the Tree of Knowledge.

162
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,700
When the New People had produced many children and grandchildren,

163
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,560
and there were villages,

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,600
they began to fight each other all the time.

165
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,280
In those days there were many Elder Gods or Drotars,

166
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,440
and they liked to come to Earth,

167
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,660
to watch the Earth people with amusement.

168
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,600
One of the gods, Odin,

169
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,680
came to Earth and made love to an Earth Woman,

170
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,160
who bore him a beloved son,

171
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,460
Pipe-Maker the Beautiful,

172
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,380
the First Bob.

173
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,380
His kindly and jocular spirit brought joy to the gods,

174
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,520
and he was not warlike.

175
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,060
But as always, one of the Drotars was false and hated him.

176
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,760
This was Negi, or Loki, or Azathoth,

177
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,820
the personification of extreme mischievousness.

178
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,580
Negi gave drugged wine to the near-sighted goddess Dame Slack,

179
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
and seduced her,

180
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,100
and used the heat from her orgasm

181
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,080
to melt the shield of cosmic ice that protected the Earth

182
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,480
from deadly cosmic rays.

183
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,120
These rays came down and affected the elder wife of the chief Pipe-Maker,

184
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,920
and to the fear and wonder of the people,

185
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,240
she gave birth to four little monsters.

186
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,440
They were Woman-Man and Man-Woman,

187
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,300
and New Man-Man and New Woman-Woman,

188
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,080
which is why there are four sexes today.

189
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,960
The elders said,

190
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,800
These strange children will bring great misfortune.

191
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,700
It would be better to kill them right now for the sake of the tribe.

192
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,780
The mother refused,

193
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,160
and said the children would grow up all right.

194
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,780
But they didn't.

195
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,840
The small monsters grew fast and became subgeniuses.

196
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
They hurt others.

197
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,300
They upset huts.

198
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,880
They befouled people's food.

199
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,220
A wise man who could see things in his mind which had not yet happened said,

200
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,340
Kill these strange bad things before they kill you.

201
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,440
The four bad children ran away,

202
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,340
but the tribe took chief Pipe-Maker

203
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,180
and hanged him to a tree for nine days and nights

204
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,100
and pierced him with a spear.

205
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,760
But he lived,

206
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,360
and thus learned wisdom and the secrets of the runes.

207
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,820
But the melting of the shield of ice had caused a great flood,

208
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,860
and the first Bob used his new magic to make a huge boat

209
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,800
over ten thousand meters long so that he could put his family in it

210
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,440
and the innocent animals

211
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,600
and save them from the deluge.

212
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,560
When the flood came,

213
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,700
the boat sailed away.

214
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,620
But some of the animals caused trouble to the first Bob's family,

215
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,900
and he threw them off the boat.

216
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,140
These were the great land squids

217
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,680
and the face-raping bats and other vermin.

218
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,140
But they lived,

219
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,820
because they swam or flew to Mount Ararat where it was dry.

220
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,260
And then,

221
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,420
as the boat rocked upon the shore,

222
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,240
the dinosaurs,

223
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,440
such as the great Ultrasaurus,

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,740
began vomiting.

225
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:18,060
And the first Bob decided there was not room for the dinosaurs either,

226
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,500
and he pushed them off the boat to drown.

227
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,560
Aids mosquito,

228
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,380
thermonuclear weapon mite,

229
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,120
concept neuron,

230
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,560
and the others had not evolved at that time.

231
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,480
But when the dinosaurs were dead,

232
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,820
the first Bob was so sad that he became drunk and fell asleep uncovered in his bunk.

233
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,780
Negi crept into the first Bob's room while he was asleep,

234
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,180
and when Negi saw his nakedness,

235
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:57,200
he became so jealous that he slew the first Bob and ran away.

236
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,720
The First Bob

237
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,000
With the death of the first Bob,

238
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,340
the gods lost all interest in humanity.

239
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,100
Light and joy had vanished from their hearts at the death of this Bob.

240
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,160
They established the Mysteries and the Cover-Up

241
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,160
in order to later bring about the resurrection of Bob at some future date

242
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,500
when they could join him into one with the Anti-Bob at the time intersection.

243
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,680
And then,

244
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,620
the Earth was swept into darkness

245
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,620
and possessed by strange chaotic beings

246
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,980
with incredible monsters who came from outside the universe.

247
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,380
The people fell down and worshipped these things and forms.

248
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,120
The flames came and slew the forms which were two and four faced.

249
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,900
They fought the goat men and the dog-headed men

250
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,100
and those with fish bodies.

251
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,600
They took huge she-and-dog

252
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,280
and animals unto them.

253
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,640
They begat them,

254
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,380
dumb races,

255
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,800
monsters they bred.

256
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,740
Then the great waters came

257
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,600
and the people were mixed with these monsters.

258
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,540
And when the waters receded,

259
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
there were cities of beast men

260
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,580
and no one knew of slack anymore.

261
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,740
For the universe remained one.

262
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,140
Well friends,

263
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,500
have we today,

264
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,400
among all of our

265
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,500
sects and religions,

266
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,500
any creation story that is more pure and simple than that one?

267
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,100
You know, every human culture has its creation myth.

268
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,540
It's the Garden of Eden.

269
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,060
Fall from Grace.

270
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
And Great Deluge.

271
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,220
All of them are packs of lies.

272
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,580
But all are,

273
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,180
based on functional events.

274
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,080
Which only,

275
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,980
Only Dobbs' revealed word can give an accurate picture.

276
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,540
We no longer need to rely on silly superstitions.

277
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,360
The forbidden sciences can explain everything in purely scientific terms.

278
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,520
Who needs God when there's DNA?

279
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,840
Pain and pleasure may be dramatic byproducts of this endless battle that life is,

280
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,100
but the process has only one purpose,

281
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,060
to selectively find the best genetic coding as defined according to that moment of time,

282
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,840
and to project it forward into the future.

283
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,380
We are nothing more than gelatinous bags of delivery mechanism for that code.

284
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,360
The code has its own agenda, which we can never understand.

285
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,420
We're a handy vehicle for it to travel on through aeons of time and through many interesting permutations.

286
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,340
For the more complex the code, the closer it is to the one true DNA code.

287
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,760
To kill time, the vehicle, us, keeps trying to come up with explanations for what we're doing,

288
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,440
fantasies about why we might be important.

289
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,460
But that's just a diversion for the robot chassis.

290
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,960
The code itself doesn't care, and has infinite patience.

291
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,340
We are only animals.

292
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,820
But we are...

293
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,320
We are the most dangerous animal, the Tyrannosaurus of our age.

294
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,180
We can kill more other species than any other creature.

295
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,120
However, the smaller ones, the viruses and bugs, can evolve faster.

296
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,780
Our environment automatically seeks to out-evolve us,

297
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,900
and our stiffest competition remains these lowliest of all God's creatures.

298
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,780
The AIDS virus, for instance, our current biggest threat 500 years ago, it was bubonic plague.

299
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,920
But our technology can probably keep up with those.

300
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,980
Just barely.

301
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,920
The real problem is...

302
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,580
Can our technology keep up with itself?

303
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,200
Can it save us from its own poisons?

304
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,840
No, we're no luddites.

305
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,100
Going back to the caves is not the answer to the world's problems.

306
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,160
It's a personal escape, sure, but only as long as the pinks don't want those caves for condo sites.

307
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,180
Why, technology could bring us the heaven on earth depicted in Jehovah's Witness magazines,

308
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
like the Watchtower.

309
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,460
If we use it with slackful intent.

310
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,640
We don't want to revert to the Stone Age, but we also don't want to abandon the Stone Age.

311
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,520
We must drag it with us into the high-tech future, or we will lose all perspective on our prime mission,

312
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,560
which is to flourish and multiply.

313
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,420
That's why it's important for us to study history, to know our own past,

314
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,680
and to be able to recognize and respond to the calls of our innermost natures.

315
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,340
Reliable to forget?

316
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,560
Then our innards do not cry out for work or TV.

317
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,260
Most of the time, they cry out for only three things.

318
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,160
Sleep, food, and sex.

319
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,700
The first two are almost always easily available.

320
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:20,760
But thanks to all of our rival religions, however, sex, really good sex, is much harder to come by.

321
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,760
Sister Mary said,

322
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,260
Mary Squared preaches that this is an ugly religion,

323
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,000
we pick our noses,

324
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,840
we pyroflatulate,

325
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,060
and sex is messy.

326
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,520
And friends, we praise the messy sex,

327
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
we admit to the messy sex,

328
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,120
we consider any religion without the messy sex to be a bad religion.

329
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,900
But what, you may wonder, does the messy sex have to do with Earth's prehistory and the yetis of Mutantis?

330
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,120
It has everything to do with everything.

331
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:02,720
The sense of wallowing pig lust is the necessary main motivating factor for us meat byproducts of the DNA code.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,320
It is a squirting universe, or more fairly, a squirting or oozing universe, depending on whether the observer is male or female.

333
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,160
The conspiracy is wrong.

334
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:21,500
The meaning of life lies not in happiness or money or knowledge or to great religious texts or even in reproduction,

335
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,540
although that is the purpose of life.

336
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,800
The meaning of life is the squirting or oozing.

337
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,060
It is that simple.

338
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,480
Not the baby making, just the selfish immediate gratification.

339
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,520
Not the eating, but the tasting.

340
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,320
If you're truthful with yourself, you'll admit that everything you do is done to make you feel better.

341
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,740
Even if self-sacrifice is your thing, you're still doing it only because it makes you feel good.

342
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,500
You just happen to be a sick fetishist.

343
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,200
Self-interest is the only motivation.

344
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,240
And unless you're a junkie or a religious nut or some other form of pervert,

345
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,580
you'll agree that the most self-pleasing sensation in the world is the moment of squirt or ooze.

346
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,640
If it wasn't for that and all the surrogate squirts like music, power, and prayer,

347
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,560
men and women would not put up with each other and life would cease.

348
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,860
This may disappoint some of you who are looking for a more elevated,

349
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,500
a highfalutin,

350
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,140
meaning to life,

351
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,820
but honestly, isn't that enough?

352
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,540
If it's not enough, then that's probably because you haven't had the full gospel squirt or ooze.

353
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,340
And that's, unfortunately, pretty likely because the conspiracy has watered down our bloodline

354
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:47,100
and hence our capacity for the full slack experience since our creation in Mutantus in 80 million B.C.

355
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,480
The only way to give you a sense of how things work is to go to the internet.

356
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,400
And, no, this whole stuff!

357
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,180
To Value

358
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,680
Google

359
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,700
of slack. There's no longer a speed limit. We may go as fast as we'd like, but we have to pay Bob

360
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:24,360
a toll, though. It cost Bob, the first upright Bob and his monks and monsters, a mighty pile

361
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,860
to build that highway. And this is the story of that highway.

362
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:45,860
Around 80 million B.C., near the close of what we call the Cretaceous era, the exists

363
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:53,160
came from space and placed on Earth among the dinosaurs those mighty men of the Bible,

364
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:04,980
the true covenant men of antiquity. The ones who lived 999 years, the Yetis. A Yeti, of

365
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,660
course, is only a little old.

366
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,660


367
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,660


368
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,660


369
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,500
convenient term, their original name for themselves would be literally impossible for us to pronounce

370
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,260
or spell because part of their language was telepathic and part was body language. Yeti

371
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,620
is what the Tibetans of the Himalayas call them, and we find it more dignified than the

372
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,340
English words Bigfoot or Native American name Sasquatch. Certainly it beats the denigrating

373
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,660
phrase Abominable Snow Person or the dry scientific name based on ancient bone fragments Gigantopithecus.

374
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,880
Aside from the Tibetan Yeti, all the other names denote subhuman animals. No doubt the

375
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,740
Yetis find that amusing and ironic. A Yeti is to a human what a human is to a chimpanzee,

376
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:59,620
nay a dog, nay a flea, a very flea. The Bigfoots and Abominable Snowmen, so called, seen by

377
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,640
tourists in wilderness areas are modern remnants of those Yeti who ascended the few last years

378
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:05,640


379
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,980
of the world. They left behind the wandering, shamed Yetis, those who still commingle with

380
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,780
humans. They suddenly appear as if from thin air, walk around to see what's going on and

381
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,980
scare humans and fart, and then they dematerialize, leaving no evidence but a tabloid headline.

382
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,080
There are little pockets of them throughout the world, but they retain the Yeti superintelligence,

383
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,860
ability to fly, capability of invisibility, etc., so there's no way to capture them. No

384
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,180
human can see them.

385
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,340
unless they want him or her to see them.

386
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,040
These are the sad yetis left behind after the Ascension.

387
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,580
They're waiting to elevate themselves to a higher plane.

388
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
Most have moved on,

389
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,140
so they no longer have to appear on Earth for supplies at all.

390
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,360
They were around for millions of years,

391
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,240
but when they realized the humans were becoming a cancer,

392
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,460
they transmogrified to the plane next door.

393
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,500
They were the Nephilim of the Bible,

394
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,260
the patriarchs, the mighty men of yore,

395
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,940
giants of great stature who commingled with the daughters of men.

396
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,360
That's Genesis. Look it up.

397
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,040
They walked among the dinosaurs,

398
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:23,020
and they bred dinosaurs like we breed chihuahuas and basset hounds.

399
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,960
What they don't tell you in conspiracy school

400
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,420
is that some of these Neanderthal skeletons are recent.

401
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,480
That is, some date from last year.

402
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,800
And that Piltdown Man is not a hoax,

403
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,760
but a recent genetic failure that had to be hidden from the press and mainstream scientists.

404
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
These skeletons were the truth known,

405
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,260
would be sure proof of ongoing interbreeding between humans and yetis,

406
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,700
and of the savage genocide of yetinsen half-breeds by the conspiracy.

407
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,480
Surprisingly enough,

408
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,240
some of the best physical evidence of our yeti past was provided by a fundamentalist Christian,

409
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,480
the great scientist,

410
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,460
Dr. Bao,

411
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,840
at Creation Evidences Museum in Glen Rose, Texas.

412
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,380
There, in the Paluxy River,

413
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:17,140
were found gigantic hominid footprints in the same strata alongside those of dinosaurs.

414
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,720
Likewise, paleontologists from Dobstown have found fossilized space helmets in Malaysia

415
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,040
dating from the same period as the great extinction that killed the great reptiles.

416
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,200
The unthinkably ancient scrolls and Atlantean artifacts

417
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
being excavated,

418
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,060
from the caves around the Black Sea,

419
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,920
the Dead Sea,

420
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,040
the Sargasso Sea,

421
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,280
and the Bermuda Triangle,

422
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,640
all of these increase our understanding of the pre-deluge world,

423
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,120
which we call Antiquitum.

424
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,420
Ah, yes, friends,

425
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,760
we'll have to continue the sermon shortly,

426
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,580
shortly indeed,

427
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,960
after these brief messages.

428
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,760
From the other side.

429
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,400
Ah, yes.

430
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,820
I think you should go too!

431
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,940
Goodbye!

432
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm amused when parks are caked with sounds of solid and hung of meat,

433
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,260
though the Parker sweat blinks from his tongue is tending to me.

434
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,940
I wanna join Islamic Jihad,

435
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,400
I just want to kill for God,

436
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,600
praising Allah is the life for me.

437
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,100
Load a car with dynamite and drive into a sitting arm without any brakes,

438
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,900
nothing could be better than impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake.

439
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,080
Pack grenades and cattle prods,

440
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,100
let's go out and kill for God,

441
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,320
I can hear Mohammed calling me!

442
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,600
Oh, now I think more of you subgeniuses should have that sort of attitude.

443
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,240
That was a little bit of Rudy Schwartz Project,

444
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,280
Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project,

445
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,580
Kill for God, I can't play that whole song, it's got too many cuss words.

446
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,940
Uh...

447
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,660
And before that, some of Lonesome Cowboy Dave's show on WCSB in Cleveland,

448
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,460
at which...

449
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,360
...

450
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,200
...

451
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,220
...

452
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,880
...

453
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:47,880


454
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:47,880


455
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:47,880


456
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:47,880


457
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,660
Come on everyone, join the fun,

458
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,840
we've got thinking on the run,

459
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,800
the Earth is circled by the sun,

460
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,480
Creation Science Polka!

461
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,240
Science classes in our schools,

462
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,080
taught by superstitious fools,

463
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,200
Jerry Falwell sets the rules,

464
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,800
Creation Science Polka!

465
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:19,280
The universe was fabricated in six literal days,

466
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:27,440
the humans and the dinosaurs shared a condo in L.A.

467
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,820
Carpets and candles,

468
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,080
dating makes us cringe,

469
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,080
we're the right wing lunatic fringe,

470
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,200
Jesus died for our sins,

471
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,900
Creation Science Polka!

472
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,340
...

473
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,440
...

474
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,240
...

475
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,660
...

476
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,220
Metamorphosis Cranium!

477
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,760
Captain Captain Scorpius had a dry first born,

478
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:29,780
so he discovered a

479
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:29,780


480
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,880
The Bible says the Earth is only 6,000 years old.

481
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,780
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coal.

482
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
Come on, everyone, join the fun.

483
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,360
Ignorance has almost won.

484
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,340
Get geology from a nun.

485
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,120
Creation science polka.

486
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,560
Take your children out of school.

487
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,700
Homestead dogma is so cruel.

488
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,800
Prop them up.

489
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,920
Watch them drool.

490
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,440
Creation science polka.

491
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,340
To many understand,

492
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,400
there are many things going on,

493
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,780
and in our consciousness,

494
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,500
it's hard to look at us because we think we're it.

495
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,920
Okay, what's going to happen to the other 6 billion people of the year 2000, or somewhere around that?

496
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,340
Well, first of all, a third of the planet has been ordered, executed by the AIDS virus.

497
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,020
It was created in a laboratory in the United States,

498
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,980
given to the World Health Organization by the smallpox vaccinations,

499
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,540
and given to the gay population by the hepatitis B study.

500
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,340
Okay.

501
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,120
That's to be used.

502
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,540
35 to 40% of the planet.

503
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,780
They're going to start a war probably within the next three months in the Middle East,

504
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,940
and that's going to spread to the United States and Canada.

505
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,440
Just to get ready, just so you know, it's what is planned for us.

506
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:50,900
By the way, they're going to have this Avianculosis program going on.

507
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


508
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


509
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


510
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


511
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


512
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


513
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


514
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


515
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


516
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


517
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


518
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


519
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


520
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


521
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


522
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


523
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:50,900


524
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,480
People, a scum, you men and he sucks!

525
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,640
So you care about your nivet?

526
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,040
Ow.

527
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,680
Buh.

528
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,200
Do you think you're tough?

529
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,500
Snot deep in your heart.

530
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,420
You know you're not.

531
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,700
You are just like the next guy.

532
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,100
Buh.

533
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,460
You can't face it.

534
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,200
Just like you and the crap you spew in your high-minded tripe makes me wanna puke.

535
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,060
Think about you what you think about me.

536
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
I'm king of the scum because that's all I can see.

537
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,560
But I love you anyway.

538
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,560
Ba-do-do-do-do.

539
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,800
Ba-do-do-do-do.

540
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Ba-do-do-do-do.

541
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,080
Ba-do-do-do-do.

542
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,220
Ba-do-do-do-do.

543
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,800
Ba-do-do-do-do.

544
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,000
Ba-do-do-do-do.

545
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
Ba-do-do-do-do.

546
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,240
Ba-do-do-do-do awa wa-awa brigade.

547

552

¶¶

553
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,780
Oh, just lovely.

554
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,980
Some Rudy Schwartz project there.

555
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,500
Lovely Rudy Schwartz project from his tape,

556
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
Moslem Beach Party.

557
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,960
People are scum.

558
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,760
Prior to that, some sort of talk show tape

559
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,160
that Nick Nolan sent us from Canada

560
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,420
about the war on AIDS and so forth.

561
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,040
Ranting there from the...

562
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,200
the new Revelation X book,

563
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,340
which I'm the only one who has a copy of it,

564
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,540
and I don't even have all of it yet.

565
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,180
With music in the background.

566
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,180
A lot of that...

567
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,260
Some of that music was Doctors for Bob

568
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,380
from instrumentals they did for the Arise video,

569
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,800
and some of it is St. Jay Condom

570
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,200
doing instrumentals

571
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,020
and miscellaneous.

572
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,040
There was that Fruit of the Illuminati,

573
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,120
commercial is, of course,

574
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,360
by Brain Rot Theatre

575
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,800
up in Cleveland,

576
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,260
and, uh...

577
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

578
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,720
Yes, we will be talking about the, uh...

579
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,080
the history of the Yetis.

580
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,300
It's, uh...

581
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,640
Now, some may consider this dry,

582
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,180
scientific or rather, uh...

583
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,420
religious philosophy,

584
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,640
but that's not really...

585
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,340
I mean...

586
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,780
Uh-huh.

587
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,040
Uh-huh.

588
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,280
But you see, the most compelling evidence

589
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,020
for the glory,

590
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,800
the glory that was antiquitum,

591
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,060
is the Great Road.

592
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,980
Now, this is something you won't be hearing about

593
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,560
in controlled media, friends,

594
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,960
but seismic radar techniques

595
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,660
have recently revealed

596
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,660
so far beneath the planet's surface

597
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,740
that continental drift didn't even affect it.

598
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,280
A globe-spanning,

599
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,420
gigantic road,

600
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,140
or a ribbon around the Earth,

601
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,260
made of solid stone.

602
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,420
It's thousands of meters wide,

603
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,600
hundreds thick,

604
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,920
and it encircles the planet horizontally

605
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,340
around the equator

606
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,000
and vertically around the poles.

607
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
The mobile oil geologists who discovered this thing

608
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
originally thought it might be a tremendous wall

609
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,440
that had flopped over on its side

610
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,260
until they found the cyclopean dome,

611
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,640
and the traffic lights at the two intersections,

612
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,920
which are beneath the jungles of Equatorial Ecuador

613
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,100
and an ocean trench off the southern coast of Malaysia.

614
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,580
It was obviously constructed by a very advanced civilization

615
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,200
with intricately constructed interlocking joints and hinges

616
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,660
allowing this huge road to swell and contract

617
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,700
with the breathing of the Earth.

618
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,260
But the most astounding thing, however,

619
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,240
is that it preemptively,

620
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,460
pre-dates not only the dinosaurs,

621
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,180
but even the vertebrates,

622
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,940
and yet it seems to be inscribed over its entire length

623
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,900
with gigantic designs

624
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,500
of some weird Thulean occult significance.

625
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,840
As yet the seismographs reveal only tantalizing hints

626
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,160
of these pictures, hieroglyphs,

627
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:43,940
or whatever they are.

628
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,080
Was God an astronaut, friends?

629
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,600
No.

630
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,560
But Bob tells us that this structure

631
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,220
is part of a grid system built by the Elder Gods,

632
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,880
the Old Ones,

633
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,620
using various power centers and ley lines under the Earth

634
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,300
to generate power for their psychic technology.

635
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,080
After the Elder Gods went into self-imposed hibernation

636
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,480
following their dream wars,

637
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,580
yet another race occupied the Earth,

638
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
the Daeros,

639
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,020
or supersonic Nazi Hell creatures from beneath the Hollow Earth.

640
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,120
And under these robot demons, the Daeros,

641
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,160
the grid system malfunctions constantly,

642
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,880
causing space-time warps here and there around the planet.

643
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,380
Both the Daeros from the caverns beneath us,

644
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,420
and the UFO-riding Grays from the star Sirius,

645
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,320
take advantage of these space-time portals,

646
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,580
not only to broadcast their power,

647
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


648
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


649
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


650
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


651
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


652
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


653
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


654
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


655
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


656
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


657
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


658
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


659
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


660
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


661
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


662
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


663
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:47,580


664
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,120
their insidious mind-controlled silent radio rays,

665
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,920
into the minds of innocent humans and subgeniuses,

666
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,040
but to in fact physically materialize and carry out abductions.

667
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,080
Now how does Bob know all this about our earthly past?

668
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,600
Bob is able to read the stones of the gods.

669
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,800
You see, the Elder Gods' grid system had terminals

670
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,000
at various points on the Earth's surface,

671
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,340
power spots,

672
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,920
where the Earth's etheric output was the strongest.

673
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,420
These terminals,

674
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,540
vortices,

675
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,340
and geomagnetic anomalies

676
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,800
are the sites of the great stone constructions of the past.

677
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,680
Mysterious gateways to the Twilight Zone,

678
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,800
such as the Gate of the Sun at Tiwanaku in Bolivia,

679
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,940
the Pyramid of Cheops at Giza,

680
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,080
Peru's Nazca Plain in Sasasquasuan,

681
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,920
Stonehenge,

682
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,040
Mount Shasta,

683
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,080
Baalbek in Lebanon,

684
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,320
Mount Rushmore,

685
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:54,880
Palenque of the Mayans,

686
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,660
Tunguska in Siberia,

687
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,880
the Bermuda Triangle,

688
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,200
Sodom and Gomorrah,

689
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,480
Mount Sinai.

690
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,040
These stones at these sites, friends,

691
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,800
are the calling cards of the gods,

692
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,360
or more accurately,

693
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,080
part of the data banks of the gods.

694
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,380
There are messages in the stones,

695
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,060
and Bob's mind is able to read them.

696
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,140
He can read them by touching his head to them.

697
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,260
It's hard to explain to a technologically minded person

698
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,360
because we're talking about the ultimate technology,

699
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,300
which is magic.

700
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,760
And these stones are what we might call massive hologram storage devices,

701
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,180
recorders and sensor devices,

702
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:38,040
which store nearby human soul and experience emanations

703
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,400
in a WOM-exist matrix by which it is,

704
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,760
because it is an etherically operating form of computer,

705
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,820
cannot be measured by our sciences.

706
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:27,800

00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,140
In between, space between

719
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,900
The special ones who wait for me

720
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,060
I'm not awake and I'm not asleep

721
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,860
In between, space between

722
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,340
The special ones who wait for me

723
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,780
Now I know your skin is green

724
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,340
Fly me away on shiny wings

725
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,660
Show me things I've never seen

726
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,100
Show me what the future brings

727
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,360
Those space things

728
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,340
Show me what the future brings

729
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,080
Laugh at counting sheep

730
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,500
I just want sweet dreams

731
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,020
Let me go to sleep

732
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,880
Just for you

733
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,140
Laugh at counting sheep

734
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,180
Laugh at counting sheep

735
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,620
Laugh at counting sheep

736
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,340
Laugh at counting sheep

737
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,260
Laugh at counting sheep

738
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,660
Laugh at counting sheep

739
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,340
Laugh at counting sheep

740
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,360
Laugh at counting sheep

741
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:06,940
Laugh at counting sheep

742
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,520
Laugh at counting sheep

743
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,300
Laugh at counting sheep

744
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:21,400
Those space things laugh at counting sheep

745
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,800
I just want sweet dreams

746
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,300
Let me go to sleep

747
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,980
I used to be afraid to sleep

748
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,840
To wake up in some crazy dream

749
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,140
Now I know it's all the same

750
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,540
The blood won't keep and the blood won't take

751
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,060
The blood won't keep and the blood won't take

752
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,400
Oh, dear friends, a little cloaking device there

753
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,900
The ultimate Klingons from Berlin

754
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,240
The subgeniuses in Germany

755
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:48,000
Ah, friends, you know, Bob has used these focusing devices

756
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,260
like the great stones of the grid system

757
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,540
and the off-planet reflector stations

758
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,440
such as Phobos and Marduk, the invisible twelfth planet

759
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,660
between Mars and Jupiter, and the Ark of the Covenant,

760
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,780
Thor's hammer, and of course his pipe.

761
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,180
He has used these to obtain hidden knowledge

762
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,580
of our cosmic past and our future destiny,

763
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,120
knowledge which conspiracy scientists cannot or will not accept.

764
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,240
For instance, did you know that plate tectonics is a lie, a black lie?

765
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,860
There was no Gondwana land where all the continents were originally one.

766
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,200
What actually happens is that the land and water area of the Earth

767
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,560
periodically trade places.

768
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:39,140
The land masses sink deep into the ground and the oceanic areas pop up,

769
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,280
dumping the ocean into what had been land, and the ocean is now a place of rest.

770
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,280


771
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,280


772
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,280


773
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:42,280


774
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,140
It's like a continental seesaw, a cyclical breathing of our Earth.

775
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,440
It hasn't happened for many millions of years,

776
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,880
and it's probably due for another switchover soon.

777
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,260
Antiquitum, then, exactly resembled our present Earth,

778
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,800
only with the land masses and the seas reversed.

779
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,960
The huge central continent where now lies the vast Pacific Ocean,

780
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,400
was called Tarnatia,

781
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,500
and the great city-state of the Yetis was Mutantis,

782
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,560
the perfect, stable, climate-controlled Eden

783
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,700
built by the Exus as their test tube, their lab,

784
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,220
in which to forge the perfect first Bob,

785
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,220
the immortal leader of the mighty Mutantians,

786
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,720
and a direct descendant of the gods.

787
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,560
Here,

788
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:48,160
the Exus would let the Yetis flourish and farm their own lesser creations,

789
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,200
the humans.

790
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,580
You know what I really like best about Thanksgiving and Christmas?

791
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,920
What's that, son?

792
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,400
Well, the way you break down and...

793
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,280
You're one of us.

794
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,240
You know, Dad, you're a doggone human when you break down.

795
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,180
Am I?

796
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,040
Indeed.

797
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,040
Sure.

798
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,980
At times like this, I feel like I could talk to you about anything,

799
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,860
and you'd understand.

800
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,180
Yes, yes.

801
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,920
And at other times, you can't?

802
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,920
Oh, well, I guess it's only natural.

803
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,820
You're busy and all that.

804
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,000
But...

805
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,840
But...

806
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,460
Well, I do get a you're-way-over-there-and-I'm-way-over-here feeling.

807
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,560
I see, son.

808
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,540
But not today.

809
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,180
I-I-I-It's swell.

810
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,400
Uh, Jack?

811
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,740
Yeah?

812
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,400
You mentioned that you felt as though you could talk to me about anything.

813
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,420
Y-Yeah, sure.

814
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:50,800
Heh.

815
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,700
Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?

816
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,120
Uh, n-uh, no.

817
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,000
N-uh, I don't think so.

818
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:58,500
Not...

819
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,620
Not particularly.

820
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,000
There isn't?

821
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,560
Uh, n-no.

822
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:03,940
Yes?

823
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:04,980
Yes?

824
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,740
Dad?

825
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,180
Eh?

826
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,600
You're a clean-minded person.

827
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:09,940
What?

828
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:10,880
I mean...

829
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,020
Well, I-I-I'm a smart little kid.

830
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,420
Uh, well, I, I try to be, but-but what gave you that idea?

831
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,100
Well-well, you never say anything off color and-and you never seem to notice implications

832
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,880
or-or get double meanings in words.

833
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,420
I have other things to think about.

834
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,420
But-but have you always been that way?

835
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,500
It's all right to say, keep a clean, healthy mind.

836
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,100
It's quite different to practice it.

837
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,700
Uh-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h.

838
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,600
It bothers you, son?

839
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,480
Well, I-I don't think I'm different from most people, but...

840
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,040
Well, I-I don't like it.

841
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,860
I-I don't want to have thoughts that would make me ashamed.

842
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:40,860


843
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:40,860


844
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,520
ashamed if someone found out?

845
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,440
Yes, yes.

846
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,120
Me?

847
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,860
Yes.

848
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:50,240
I mean, should I be able to control my mind if I want to?

849
00:54:53,460 --> 00:55:00,120
Dear son, well, partner, you are now a 16, and in my book that means you are no longer

850
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,580
a child.

851
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,640
You are a man.

852
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,540
You will get your driver's license, and you will drive your own car down the road that

853
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,960
lies before us, the road of life.

854
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,780
It's very much like the road from Paella to San Clameron.

855
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:18,840
Somewhere along the way, you may come across an overturned orange truck or a divot in the

856
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,860
road, and you may not know exactly what to do or even how to do it and why.

857
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,500
When that happens, I advise you not to do anything.

858
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:33,240
Sit on the side of the road and eat an orange, and then, when you have finally made up your

859
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,520
mind, spit out the pits and do it.

860
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,540
If there's a mountain in the way, go through it.

861
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,020
I'll buy you a new car.

862
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,880
Sometimes you will make it, and sometimes not.

863
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,900
We all do.

864
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,540
Nobody bets 500.

865
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,660
Even if you do, that means you are wrong half the time.

866
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,740
But don't worry about it.

867
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,540
I know a good doctor.

868
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,080
So drive, son.

869
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,220
Drive and drive hard and drive and fast and straight.

870
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,220
And even though the road is lined with pratfalls, you will make it.

871
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,820
And although the angels hiding behind billboards may hand you a ticket, remember the man upstairs

872
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,940
is always looking for you.

873
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,760
He's got a man out for you, ready to give you a helping hand.

874
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,440
His name is Judge Nunez, District Court 3.

875
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,040
Good luck, son.

876
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,220
Love that.

877
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:24,640
Oh, and Mr. Jubilee, will you send a copy of that to the judge, Mr. Bendefend at Carl's

878
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,140
Car Leasing?

879
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,620
Sure.

880
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,400
And one to Dr. Reineck at the medicinal tar pits.

881
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:28,880
Sure.

882
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,360
And by the way, what are you doing for lunch?

883
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,320
I have to do something.

884
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,640
I'm going to the bar, quickly ask if you would

885
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:56,840
rent me the guy who has an old bicycle.

886
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,720
Very good businessknown for a million.

887
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:58,720


888
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,520
I've we туда tha new bicycle.

889
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,240
Thank you so much.

890
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:01,240


891
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,360
I want to go anytime.

892
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,400
No a wild angations.

893
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,240
Daddy, I wanna meet a child.

894
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,880
Nothing will stop them!

895
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,880
I'll be your boy

896
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,940
I'll be your boy

897
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,300
I'll be your boy

898
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,180
I'll be your boy

899
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,380
I'll be your boy

900
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,380


901
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,040
I'll be your boy

902
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,160
I'll be your boy

903
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,940
Come on, come on

904
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,360
Get to my corner

905
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,260
And take a side

906
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,000
I guess you recognize me

907
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
From the poor life of the little boy

908
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,100
I mean

909
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,080
With very nice

910
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,120
iPad use of experience and praise

911
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,120
And I always use

912
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,200
The safest call, waitress, man

913
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,800
I Tapi I.

914
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,000
bare a side

915
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000


916
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000


917
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000


918
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,000


919
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,040
I swear by you

920
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,200
I know that in this sea

921
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:26,240
you're calling me

922
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,280
But if you don't

923
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:28,540
Drive me round

924
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:31,000
I completed

925
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,960
Just in time

926
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:33,960


927
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,980
Now we're getting

928
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,380
I'm very glad, one cloudy April day.

929
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:47,240
I'm very glad, in love we will stay.

930
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,260
Till our thoughts of blood and madness ease,

931
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,580
my rocket's flash.

932
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,300
I'm very glad.

933
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,500
Oh, the poor woman.

934
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,640
Well friends, what we have been listening to,

935
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,820
Rudy Schwartz Project from Austin, doing the music.

936
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,760
Creation Science Polka is from a CD.

937
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,440
But Coathanger Man and I Married Bob,

938
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,840
I think are from cassette tapes.

939
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,820
Salmon Dave is the name of that particular Rudy Schwartz Project tape.

940
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,560
Some of the background music.

941
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,580
The music behind the ranting was by Arnold Mathis

942
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,520
from his cassette Avenue of the Gods.

943
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,680
And you also heard some very rare old fire sign theater

944
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,940
from L.A. in the early 70s.

945
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,560
We have a lot of old fire sign theater to slowly but surely dribble out

946
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,160
here on the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

947
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:05,540
And if you want more information about, well, the teachings of this church,

948
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,500
there are books.

949
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,540
And other things.

950
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,300
Tapes available.

951
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,380
But you'll have to write us for the free information packet.

952
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,180
I'm going to give you that sacred post office box number to write to.

953
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:26,520
Just address that letter to Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

954
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,160
Dallas, Texas 75214.

955
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,340
Once again,

956
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,500
Box 140306,

957
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,880
Dallas, Texas 75214.

958
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,140
Praise Bob!

959
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,340
And I'm getting out of here.

960
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,520
I about had it.

961
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,140
Well, what did you have?

962
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,000
What did you have?

963
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:56,680
I don't even know.

964
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:57,440
Oh, okay.

965
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,000
There's nothing now.

966
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:05,480
You are listening to radio station KNON 89.3, Dallas, Fort Worth, the voice of the people.

967
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


968
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


969
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


970
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


971
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


972
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


973
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


974
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


975
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


976
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


977
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


978
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


979
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


980
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


981
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


982
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


983
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


984
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


985
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:05,480


986
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,660
I'm your host, Paul Wilson.

987
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:13,260
And for the next, well, two hours anyway, you'll be listening to the finest and maybe

988
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,960
not so fine, but at least it's entertaining, in Celtic music.

989
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,480
And, but first, he said, looking at the log, we have to do an announcement.

990
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:25,840
.

991
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,000
.

992
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,180
.

993
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:26,760
.

994
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:26,980
.

995
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,060
.

996
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,300
.

997
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:27,560
you
