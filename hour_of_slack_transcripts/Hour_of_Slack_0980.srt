00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
If they can't not see the humor of it, then let them mount up upon themselves.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,500
Amen.

The Self Genius Hour of Slack

4
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,880
I will tell you what to do.

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,260
I will tell you what to think.

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,520
I will tell you what to be.

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,860
And you will like it.

8
00:00:59,300 --> 00:00:59,980
You want to go to the bathroom?

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,540
I'm not safe.

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:11,760
Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is...

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,020
The Self Genius Hour of Slack

12
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,740
But a thing like this could absolutely give me a trauma.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,900
Dad, does it ever get better?

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,480
Well, the fact of the matter is that it gets an awful lot worse before it gets better.

15
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,080
Really?

16
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,680
Yeah.

17
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,760
Oh, here's the microphone.

18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,120
All we have to do is plug it in.

19
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,960
Thanks very much, Bob.

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,820
Now go ahead. Say something right into the mic.

21
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,980
Ah, yes, dear friends.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,020
Praise Bob!

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,760
Oh, God.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,780
Oh, God.

25
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,500
Oh, God.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,520
Oh, God.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:52,520


28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,540
Oh, God.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,600


30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:56,600


31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,220
Oh, God.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh, God.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,960
Oh, God.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh, God.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:09,940
Oh, God.

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,260
Oh, God.

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh, God.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, God.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh, God.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,480


43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,480


44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,480


45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,500
Oh, God.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,500


47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:20,740
Oh, God.

48
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,760
Oh, God.

49
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,800
Oh, God.

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,940
Oh, God.

51
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,720
Oh, God.

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,180
Oh, God.

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,760
with L. Ron Hubbard.

54
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,320
He'll be speaking to you

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,480
about Bob.

56
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,960
About J.R. Bob Dobbs.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,900
Which you should all know a lot about.

58
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:40,500
Uh,

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,160
teach about slack.

60
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,840
And, uh,

61
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,320
you should give him all your money.

62
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,760
In return,

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,000
in return,

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,240
in return,

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,180
he'll give you slack.

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,640
In return,

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
in return.

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,980
Brothers and

69
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,560
sisters,

70
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,280
we must

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,380
confront ourselves.

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
We know

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
that all men and women

74
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,980
are created good.

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,900
We must understand

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,160
that we are not

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,860
why you have gone bad.

78
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,080
You cannot play

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,500
chickens with your line.

80
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,000
Jumping around like an old world

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,100
wind. Wrapping your

82
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,160
dishes and plates

83
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,040
and then unpacking them and placing them

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,020
back on the shelf.

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,320
This is not the way

86
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,020
the Jehovah One has designed

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,960
you to act.

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,020
Unless you are willing

89
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,900
to admit that you are a norm.

90
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,880
A pink boy.

91
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,040
A nini. A twig.

92
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,840
A turkey.

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:01,840


94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:01,840


95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,180
Only then can you decide

96
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,660
where your path

97
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,940
shall lead you.

98
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,820
But we know inherently

99
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,060
that we are all created good

100
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,320
by Jehovah One.

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,900
Some of you have such bad luck

102
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,320
sometimes in your life

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
that you couldn't hang yourself

104
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,480
with your own necktie.

105
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,540
This is when you should look to Bob.

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,260
When you look to Jehovah One

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,060
and say,

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,640
Bob,

109
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,140
come into my heart.

110
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,620
And you shall see one set of footprints in the sand.

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:42,580
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you $5.99 to carry you to the nearest taxi.

112
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,560
Praise Bob and his divine ways.

113
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:56,660
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin, a baby inside of a twin inside of a woman's belly.

114
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,520
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be.

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,340
You got to raise up above this wiggly world and grab the hand of Bob.

116
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,120
Praise him and all that flows from Bob.

117
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,180
Usually we start off our sermons and devivals and gatherings with a solemn togetherness moment

118
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,500
of,

119
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,200
NOISE!

120
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,440
And we're going to do that again.

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,880
But at this time I don't want to make a bunch of noise for Bob Dobbs, my guru,

122
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,680
because he's kind of deaf anyway and not paying much attention, like most real gods.

123
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,080
But those who couldn't be here themselves, because I guess the angels needed him for something else.

124
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,480
So friends, let's have a moment of noise for those who had to join Bob and the aliens early,

125
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,580
specifically our old friend, Reverend Steve Checkey.

126
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,300
Praise Steve!

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:07,240
And finally one last moment of noise for us, for hanging in there ourselves and putting up with our own idiocy.

128
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Praise Bob!

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,280
Reward yourself for your own slack with more slack.

130
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:24,560
Now I will now explain for those of you who have no earthly idea what the Church of the Subgenius is.

131
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,640
There's not a perfect picture of Bob.

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,240
There's a little bit of Bob up there, but it'll come around.

133
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
So here's the cool Bob.

134
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
You've seen his face.

135
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:41,120
Some of you may hate him and some may love him and some have sexual obsessions with Bob.

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,500
Boys, don't feel bad.

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,340
It's not really queer if it's Bob, okay?

138
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
It's a religious thing.

139
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,640
It's a religious love.

140
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,100
So what does this Church of the Subgenius offer?

141
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,900
Well, the same thing as all the other religions offer.

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:06,440
Lofty words, high sounding concepts, feelings, pablum, and lies.

143
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,060
Friends, Bob held a gun to our head and said,

144
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,380
Start selling and start lying!

145
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,940
Basically, J.R. Bob Dobbs, the grinning, bedotted figurehead of our church,

146
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,660
was a salesman with almost mystic sales ability,

147
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,360
who in 1953, he underwent his immaculation.

148
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,200
The alien space god Jehovah One from some corporate sin galaxy,

149
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,180
this creature which masqueraded as the one true patriarchal god,

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,740
successfully, for thousands of years,

151
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,340
he came down and he revealed to J.R. Bob Dobbs

152
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,740
that there was a conspiracy of normal people

153
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,060
robbing away the slack of all the weirdos, abnormals, disbelievers,

154
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,180
or those who will believe anything,

155
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
which I think includes some of you.

156
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,900
And he predicted that the end of the world was coming.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,280
Soon. About five years ago, in fact.

158
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,440
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m.,

159
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
the aliens from Planet X, or Exus we call them,

160
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,160
would come down and rupture up the subgeniuses.

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,460
That was called the rupture.

162
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,400
We figured there wouldn't be too many subgeniuses awake at 7 o'clock on a Sunday morning,

163
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,660
which was a good time to have their cars unmanned.

164
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,580
But, um, well...

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,300
And Bob preaches slack.

166
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,900
Now, the slack part turned out to be real,

167
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,280
and the conspiracy is obviously real,

168
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
and we're still kind of waiting for the saucers.

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,960
But, by gobs, we wait with faith!

170
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,780
And, well, actually, we feel kind of silly every July 5th.

171
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,820
Well, two weeks ago, we were all standing right out there.

172
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,780
Saucers didn't show up.

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,600
But, you know, Bob said,

174
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,600
don't just eat that hamburger, eat the hell out of it.

175
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,420
And he said, when you're...

176
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,900
Don't just feel silly waiting for the saucers,

177
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,540
feel silly the hell out of it!

178
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,820
So it's not... I don't actually mind so much the fact

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,360
that I don't every year get, for $30,

180
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't get to destroy everyone I ever hated

181
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,180
and have my own escape planet and all that stuff Bob promised.

182
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
What really bugs me is,

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,920
I just hate to think of the Discordians laughing at us again each year.

184
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,700
Oh, well.

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,620
And he told Bob, you must found your church,

186
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,380
not on a solid rock like the Christians have,

187
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,980
or anybody else,

188
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,360
but on a shifting sandy beach of hypocrisy,

189
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,360
of lies and bullshit!

190
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,440
Because in the midst of that lies and bullshit,

191
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,760
when we admit that,

192
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,460
that's how you know we're the only ones telling the truth.

193
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,980
Now isn't that sad?

194
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,120
Damn.

195
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,240
But, that's Bob for you.

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,020
It's the real thing, in a strange way, you know.

197
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,120
Some people have gods that they have to give lip service to.

198
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,120
They feel like, oh, God expects them to pray at a certain time,

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,440
do various ridiculous things for them,

200
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,760
which is fine, that's all great.

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,460
Bob does not care about any of that.

202
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,960
He's not especially jealous.

203
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,000
He's not interested in your praying to him.

204
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,480
He won't listen to it.

205
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,740
And he can't forgive your sins.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,840
He's not as well connected or related as some other messiahs and personal saviors.

207
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,240
So, he doesn't care about your sins.

208
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,380
He won't forgive them.

209
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,320
He's not interested in your sins,

210
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,440
unless you've invented some new ones that we haven't heard yet.

211
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:45,900
No!

212
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,420
Bob comes and comes again and again and again,

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,780
not to forgive your sins, but to justify your sins,

214
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,540
to rationalize your sins.

215
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,380
Because, you know, really,

216
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
do you need forgiveness?

217
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,280
Do you really feel like you've done something so bad that you need some god to forgive you?

218
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,820
Well, no!

219
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,040
You need an excuse!

220
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,300
Bob brings that excuse.

221
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,020
Available at BAT for only $30.

222
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,360
So, okay, $20.

223
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,700
I really want to understand,

224
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,500
and then all my readers could understand, too.

225
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,860
I am not a man.

226
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,700
I began as one.

227
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,480
But each being that I change makes me more than a man.

228
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,340
Do you want to know what I am?

229
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,020
More than anything,

230
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,660
I was afraid to ask.

231
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,700
I am the Bob,

232
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,620
and you call me insane.

233
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,740
You are privy to a great becoming.

234
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,300
And you recognize nothing.

235
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,920
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

236
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,380
It is in your nature to do one thing correctly.

237
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,900
Before me, you rightly tremble.

238
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,940
But fear is not what you owe me, Mr. Sting.

239
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,920
You owe me...

240
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,740
SWEAT!

241
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,980
I am the Bob,

242
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,500
and you call me insane.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,720
I am the Bob,

244
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,700
and you call me insane.

245
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,700


246
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,160
Bob?

247
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:31,680


248
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,120


249
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,980
Bob?

250
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,620
Bob?

251
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,140
Bob?

252
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,340
Bob?

253
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,740
Bob?

254
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,740


255
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,760
Bob?

256
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,860
shouldn't give him the goods they need.

257
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:54,860


258
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,680
If ye've praised Bob,

259
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,600
lovelyfe take out thy raincoat.

260
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,720
And ne referee,

261
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:06,000
No, you really don't, because he, as Slackmaster, he will take all your slack.

262
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
And he will come out of your toilet.

263
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,800
He will take all your slack and come out of your toilet.

264
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,300
Of the distant echoing weirdos.

265
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,060
Speaking of echoing weirdos, friends, we hooked three new ones for tonight's show.

266
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:38,420
We were just now hearing some free radio patipo from Amsterdam with Pope Mickey Finn, Pope Phil Monty, and Lord Getty, plus some Texans.

267
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:51,120
But right at the beginning of this hour of Slack number 980, we heard the Gregorian version of Let Them Mount Up Upon Themselves by Third Nostril.

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,040
We'll hear that again at the end of the show.

269
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,140
Reverend Artemia Salina did the new titles.

270
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,900
The first new titles.

271
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,240
And Mr. Fernandez and Andy Lee Murr did the next titles.

272
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,600
And many more collages and to come.

273
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:14,160
We found accidentally and changed a clip by Throat Culture about a so-called Reverend L. Ron Hubbard.

274
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,340
I guess they're rogue subgeni or something.

275
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:25,680
And that amazing, smooth, jazzy, all praise Bob, was by Reverend Raymond Lafferty.

276
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,020
New discovery by the Mystic Knights of Bob Doves.

277
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,560
See also upstartradio.com.

278
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:44,620
The preaching by yours, truly Reverend Ivan Stang, was first from the revival at Starwood at 2004.

279
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,960
And then from the Amsterdam revival in Holenheadland.

280
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,900
The organ music was on Le Murr's old organ.

281
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,720
And now we come to...

282
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,960
Reverend Artemia Salina's rendition of Dance of the Dobbsheads.

283
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,920
Dance of the Dobbsheads.

284
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,500
Billy Allen Antwick plays bishop.

285
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,420
apron

286
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,560
периods

287
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,560


288
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:45,560


289
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:54,040
Kathwe ''cor lira''

290
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,760
plains

291
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
peat

292
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,460
We just got the Reverend Mickey Finn calling in.

293
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,020
And you've got to get, got to get on the beat.

294
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,500
Down and turned into a half tone.

295
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,840
We don't think that one is a photograph.

296
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,400
It's very difficult.

297
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,280
By the time that one was made, it was very hard to photograph Bob.

298
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,340
His aura prevented his modeling career.

299
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,520
I hear that he actually used to melt cameras.

300
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,060
Well, it's more like his face would appear blurred,

301
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,540
like in that horror movie, The Ring.

302
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,220
It always looked that way in photographs

303
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,500
after a certain phase of enlightenment that Bob reached.

304
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,440
All right.

305
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,880
So that he, although in his youth,

306
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,640
as he was becoming a holy man,

307
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,460
you see him modeled for many, many advertisements,

308
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,500
Dobbs hats, different hammocks,

309
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,260
automatic lawnmowers that would mow your lawn while you smoked.

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,520
Pipes.

311
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,020
Pipes and abs that you see in old magazines.

312
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
But then after about 1963, 1964,

313
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,780
you don't see Bob in anything except hand-drawn caricature.

314
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,820
So this is why there is a great trade

315
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,660
in finding here to for unfound photographs of Bob

316
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,540
and unseen advertisements.

317
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,040
Right.

318
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,040
Virgin Dobbs heads go for millions in Saudi Arabia and Japan.

319
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,660
If you can find a Dobbs head that hasn't been copied,

320
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,620
those things are worth more than gold or cancer cures.

321
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,740
So that's clearly what we're looking out for.

322
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,860
So this is an appeal to how many people we're reaching.

323
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,720
If you have hidden away, check your attic,

324
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,660
ancient,

325
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,680
and you find Bob in there,

326
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,240
then you could be onto a huge ton of cash.

327
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,880
Now, if it's just an ordinary Dobbs head that's obviously has been re has

328
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,620
reproduced thousands of times,

329
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,600
but that's what we call a mattress back.

330
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,580
It's like an old whore that's just been used forever.

331
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,860
We're talking your untouched,

332
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,560
unselly,

333
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,080
pure portraits of Bob.

334
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,760
Once it has not been copied.

335
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,140
If you find those,

336
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,640
send them to us.

337
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:50,640


338
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:50,640


339
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:50,640


340
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:50,640


341
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,140
Send them to the church of the subgenius.

342
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,640
That's Bob at post office box 181417.

343
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,600
That's box 181417.

344
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,520
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

345
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,540
Accept no substitutes.

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,860
This is new information for the address, everybody.

347
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,580
You may have old addresses written down.

348
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,760
This now supersedes them.

349
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:18,640
Well, we overcame the Branch Dalasians and the Branch Austinian collectives.

350
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,040
And those people were false pretenders to the scribeship, the Dobbs head.

351
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,340
And we're looking for real pretenders.

352
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,300
We need real pretenders, man.

353
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,740
Great pretenders.

354
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,680
We're looking for people who like to hate.

355
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,120
And we seem to find them with great ease as well.

356
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,480
And there's more and more of them these days.

357
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,820
Sit down, Bob.

358
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,340
I'm not happy, Bob.

359
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,740
Not happy.

360
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
Ask me why.

361
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,640
Okay.

362
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,620
Okay.

363
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:48,880
Why?

364
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,500
Why what?

365
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,720
Be specific, Bob.

366
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,940
Why are you unhappy?

367
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,400
Your customers make me unhappy.

368
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,400
They're experts.

369
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,680
Experts, Bob.

370
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,320
Exploiting every loophole.

371
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,740
Dodging every obstacle.

372
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,060
They're penetrating the bureaucracy.

373
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,900
Did I do something illegal?

374
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,740
No.

375
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers?

376
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,640
The law requires that I answer no.

377
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,280
We're supposed to help people.

378
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,780
We're supposed to help our people.

379
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,980
Starting with our stockholders, Bob.

380
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,620
Who's helping them out, huh?

381
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,620
You know, Bob, a company...

382
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,540
Is like an enormous clock.

383
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,340
Is like an enormous clo...

384
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes, precisely.

385
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,460
It only works if all the little cogs mesh together.

386
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,040
Now, a clock needs to be clean, well lubricated, and wound tight.

387
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,080
The best clocks have jewel movements.

388
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,420
Cogs that fit.

389
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,000
That cooperate by design.

390
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,240
I'm being metaphorical, Bob.

391
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,580
You know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

392
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Bob?

393
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,300
Bob?

394
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,020
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

395
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,820
That man out there.

396
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,640
He needs help.

397
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,940
Do not change the subject, Bob!

398
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,660
We're discussing your actions!

399
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,820
He is getting mugged!

400
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,120
Well, let's hope we don't cover him!

401
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,660
I'll be right back.

402
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,500
Stop right now, or you're fired!

403
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,540
Jesus loves you.

404
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,760
Buizh valt zizizh.

405
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,900
Jesus loves you.

406
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,060
Buizh valt zizizh.

407
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:09,820
Gentlemen!

408
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,620
The Navy Department has today asked me to give ship owners this message.

409
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,560
The Shadow, Lamont Cranston, and the Master of the Ships, are now in the service of

410
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,560


411
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,560


412
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,560


413
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:16,560


414
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,140
a master of other people's wealth, devotes his life to protecting the guilty and punishing

415
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,100
other people's minds.

416
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,860
Ladies and gentlemen, before the curtain goes up on the Shadow's latest exciting adventure,

417
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
let me say this.

418
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,860
I know that every one of you owns a tire that will give you the greatest skids and blowouts.

419
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,520
Well I'm going to tell you about a new kind of wet, slippery tire.

420
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,520
There is extra tie speed blowouts, and that means you'll get the quickest non-stop skids

421
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,420
you've ever seen.

422
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,980
Believe me.

423
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,000
There's nothing like skids and blowouts to make you feel before it's too late.

424
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,520
Is it any wonder this new tire is called the excitingest thing on wheels?

425
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,880
And you'd like to get that tire without paying, wouldn't you?

426
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Never heard it.

427
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,300
Well I have heard tell that, um, Bob's Pipe itself is a censoring beer, and that possibly

428
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,600
Bob's Pipe is the one who's making all the decisions.

429
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,980
That's exac- that is, uh, exactly what's behind the big rift in the church.

430
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,860
That's why we had to, uh,

431
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:15,960


432
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:23,600
eliminate, the old fashioned way, the Austonian and, uh, Dalatian clenches, and the, the branch

433
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,740
Clevelandians now, or as we call it, DNA level C. That's Cleveland backwards.

434
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,300
Uh, we are now in control of the church.

435
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,940
This, uh, we don't want any doubt as to where you're, you, to send your money.

436
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,080
Those other post offices are closed down.

437
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,760
They're, they're, that's it.

438
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,940
But, uh, Jesus sold them, basically, is what happens.

439
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,100
Uh.

440
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,960
But is, but is Bob smoking the Pipe?

441
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:45,960


442
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,200
Or is, as I have heard tell, is the Pipe smoking Bob?

443
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:58,320
Well, as, as Reverend Skro pointed out, Bob is generating himself, regenerating himself

444
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,420
from the smoke of the Pipe.

445
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,080
The Pipe, you never see the cloud of smoke dissipate.

446
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,700
It sort of hovers around him all the time.

447
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:15,280
Well, he is ever reconstituting from the smoke that he has exhaled, from inhaling the burning,

448
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,960
the ever-burning smoke.

449
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:15,960


450
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,360
The, ever-burning frop in the Pipe.

451
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,780
Because you've noticed Bob never loads that Pipe.

452
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,360
You've never seen it go out, you've never seen it away from his mouth for long.

453
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,260
You've never seen him, you've probably never seen him actually speak in several years.

454
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,540
Oh, well it seems to have been quiet for a while now.

455
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
I don't hear, I don't.

456
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,320
But, then again, were I to hear his pure, unadulterated voice, then surely my ears would

457
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,440
shatter and my brain would run out of the ear holes.

458
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,380
Well, that was the problem with, uh, people who tried to channel Bob.

459
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,940
They, you could only get one or two people to channel, uh, Bob.

460
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:45,940


461
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:52,340
words out of each bobby that trying to channel bob's words before they would pretty much their

462
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,880
brain would burn out like an old flash bulb so that you we had to line volunteers up 40 or 50

463
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,360
in a row and go down the line with the tape recorder and each would channel a few words of

464
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,740
bob's sentence which often you know he meanders a lot so it gets off off the subject yeah and

465
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,380
starts telling you a joke in the middle and so getting the main end of the world pronouncements

466
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,580
out of him were worried it cost a lot of a lot of Bobby's not lives they're still alive they're in

467
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:34,400
the distance they they helped farm they helped but till the front of the fields and in Dobbs town in

468
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,460
our jungle mechanic encampment in Malaysia which is still open the one in Bolivia closed

469
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,720
down and the one in the middle of the world closed down and the one in the middle of the world closed

470
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,620
down the one in Brazil closed down but the Malaysian Dobbs town is still open and the

471
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,380
Cleveland mega fence temple Lodge certainly is open though its doors are not open to everybody

472
00:24:52,380 --> 00:25:01,700
we call it the slacker mansion by the way after the great forest st. Forrest Ackerman's home those

473
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:10,640
those monster fans who might be listening out there I just programmed you you will be

474
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:22,780

475
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,160

You can't hide from God and a pussy

490
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,300
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

because he's stupider than you are.

492
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,580
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

493
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,960
because he's got more black and white little dots

494
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,220
in his face than you do.

495
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,320
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

496
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,620
because his face has been mimeographed

497
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,760
and put up in more places than yours has.

498
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,040
You can't hide from God.

499
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,640
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

500
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,140
because more people worship him than worship you.

501
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,800
You can't hide from Dobbs

502
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,180
because he's stupider than you are.

503
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,180
Who the hell is somebody?

504
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,560
You can't run from your own legs.

505
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,740
How are you going to run from your own legs?

506
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,940
Because if you run from your own legs,

507
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,320
where are you going to run from them with?

508
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,420
If you use them to run from them with,

509
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,980
where are you going to run away from?

510
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
You can't run from your own legs.

511
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,200
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

512
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,340
because he's stupider than you.

513
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,440
You can't hide from God

514
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,600
because he's bigger than you.

515
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,980
He's bigger than all reality.

516
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,120
He's bigger than all infinity.

517
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,480
Help me, somebody.

518
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,740
She ain't got no legs.

519
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,040
Pull the lever down and go.

520
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,200
My legs are on fire.

521
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:00,800
I need some help.

522
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,240
Pray stop.

523
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,040
You can't swallow your own throat.

524
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,040
How are you going to swallow your own throat?

525
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,380
Because if you use your own throat

526
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,380
to swallow it with,

527
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,380
where are you going to swallow?

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,480
If you swallow your own throat,

529
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,340
where are you going to use to swallow it with?

530
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,800
You can't swallow your own throat.

531
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,200
You can't run from your own legs.

532
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,060
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

533
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
because he's stupider than you are.

534
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
You can't hide from God

535
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,660
because he's bigger than you.

536
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,920
He's bigger than all infinity.

537
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,880
Help me, somebody.

538
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,700
She ain't got no legs.

539
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,180
Pull the lever down and go.

540
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,900
My legs are on fire.

541
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,400
I need some help.

542
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,200
Pray stop.

543
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,340
You can't digest your own stomach.

544
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,340
How are you going to digest your own stomach?

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,740
There's not a man or woman in this auditorium tonight

546
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,560
who can digest their own stomach.

547
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
You can't digest your own stomach.

548
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,280
You can't swallow your own throat.

549
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,320
You can't run from your own legs.

550
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,300
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

551
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,340
because he's stupider than you.

552
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,820
You can't hide from God

553
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,920
because he's bigger than you.

554
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,020
He's bigger than all reality.

555
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,300
Help me, somebody.

556
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,240
Pull the lever down and go.

557
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,380
My legs are on fire.

558
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,500
I need some help.

559
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,080
I need some help.

560
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,880
Pray stop.

561
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,180
You can't wet water.

562
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,760
Water's already as wet as it can possibly get.

563
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,680
You can pour water on water,

564
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,180
but you're just going to have more water.

565
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,460
You can't wet water.

566
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,280
You can't digest your own stomach.

567
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,640
You can't swallow.

568
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,520
You can't swallow your own throat.

569
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,620
You can't run from your own legs.

570
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,140
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

571
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,300
because he's stupider than you.

572
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,600
You can't hide from God

573
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,560
because he's bigger than you.

574
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,700
He's bigger than all reality.

575
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,500
Help me, somebody.

576
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,700
Pull the lever down and go.

577
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,140
My legs are on fire.

578
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,880
I need some help.

579
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,460
I need some help.

580
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,620
Pray stop.

581
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,860
You can't wash soap.

582
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,900
How are you going to wash soap?

583
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,980
You're going to try to cut it in half

584
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,400
and rub the two ends together.

585
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,160
You can't wash soap.

586
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
You're going to try to throw it in the washing machine.

587
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,920
You're going to try to slide it through a car wash.

588
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,100
You can't wash soap.

589
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,740
You can't wet water.

590
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,620
You can't digest your own stomach.

591
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,760
You can't swallow your own throat.

592
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,560
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

593
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,680
because he's stupider than you.

594
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,480
You can't hide from God

595
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,700
because he's bigger than you.

596
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,880
He's bigger than all reality.

597
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,120
Help me, somebody.

598
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,580
Pull the lever down and go.

599
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,580
My legs are on fire.

600
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,320
I need some help.

601
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:38,760
I need some help.

602
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,400
Pray stop.

603
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,060
You can't burn fire.

604
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,520
It's already on fire.

605
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,920
How are you going to burn fire?

606
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,560
You can't burn fire.

607
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,460
You can't wash soap.

608
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,740
You can't wet water.

609
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
You can't digest your own stomach.

610
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,920
You can't swallow your own throat.

611
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,360
You can't run from your own legs.

612
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,160
You cannot hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs

613
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,580
because he's stupider than you.

614
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,940
You can't hide from God

615
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,020
because he's bigger than you.

616
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,280
Bigger than all reality.

617
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:09,920
Need...

618
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Help me somebody.

619
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,040
She ain't got no legs.

620
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,580
Pull the lever down and go.

621
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,940
My legs are on fire.

622
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,560
I need some help.

623
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,460
You can't pee your own dick.

624
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,660
How are you going to pee your own dick?

625
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,860
too big to fit out of that little bitty hole. You can't pee your own dick. You can't burn

626
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:48,480
fire. You can't wash soap. You cannot wet water. You cannot digest your own stomach.

627
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:54,360
You can't swallow your own throat. You cannot run from your own legs. You cannot hide from

628
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,540
this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, because he's stupider than you. You can't hide from God because

629
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:04,980
he's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality. Help me, somebody. She ain't got no

630
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,080
legs. Pull the lever and down you go. Preacher, my legs are on fire. Need some help? Need

631
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,440
some help? Praise God.

632
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:27,940
Preacher, my legs are on fire. Keep those dollars rolling.

633
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,720
You can't hide from God. Help me, somebody. Help me, somebody. Can I get a witness? You

634
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,520
can't hide from God. Need some help? Need some help? Praise God. My legs are on fire.

635
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,520
If you got some balls, you can come to me. Preacher, my legs are on fire.

636
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:23,720
You can't hide from God. You can't hide from your own hiding place. Your old hiding place

637
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,520
is where you're hiding from. Your old hiding place is going to be where your feet are going

638
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


639
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


640
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


641
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


642
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


643
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:28,520


644
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,380
gonna see you. So how you gonna hide from your own hiding place? You can't hide from your own

645
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:49,520
hiding place. You can't burn fire. You can't pee your own dick. You can't wash soap. You can't wet

646
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,560
water. You cannot digest your own stomach. You can't swallow your own throat. You cannot run

647
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:01,040
from your own legs. You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupid and you are. You can't hide from God

648
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,080
because he's bigger than you. He's bigger than all infinity. Help me somebody. She ain't got no legs.

649
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,680
Pull the lever. Down you go. Preacher, my legs are on fire. Need some help. Need some help. Praise Dobbs.

650
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:24,040
Preacher, my legs are on fire. Preacher, my legs are on fire.

651
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:36,480
Can I get a witness? Help me somebody. Help me somebody. My legs are on fire.

652
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,520
Preacher!

653
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,880
Preacher!

654
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,400
Hey,

655
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:02,320
Doctors for Bob, friends, did that song, Can't Hide from God. A real oldie, early 1980s,

656
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:10,120
Pope Sternodocs, Pope Snavely, Saint Snavely Eklund, Reverend Martin Big Smoke Pitts,

657
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,900
Linda Pitts, and Reverend Jean Splice on guitar, and Janer Hyperclete, dear friends. But now,

658
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,040
let us return to Radio Patapo in Amsterdam and learn what it sounds like when a radio,

659
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,540
mic, and radio are connected.

660
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,920
The microphone is inserted up into the nasal sinus of Reverend Eror.

661
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,220
That face looks even funnier than it sounds.

662
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
It's just eternal.

663
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,460
Remind me not to touch my mouth.

664
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,180
I'm not too close to this microphone.

665
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,260
Keep a nice distance, sir. From a healthy distance.

666
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,100
Friend, what does it feel like to have a nostril against your very ear hole?

667
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,120
Which nostril?

668
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,480
Would it be the left nostril, the right nostril, or the third nostril?

669
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,260
Ah, the famous third nostril. The nostril of enlightenment.

670
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,760
Like the third eye, but really more sensitive.

671
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,280
Yeah.

672
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:33,540
I'm not sure if I'm able to discern different wavelengths, the auric and the ozonic wavelengths.

673
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,020
You can sniff your way to just your perfect true yeti mate.

674
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,600
Sniff your victory.

675
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,920
You can sniff your way to victory, my friends. To love, to true love. You can sniff out your

676
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,800
true yeti mate if you can just open that third nostril. Don't follow those false gurus with

677
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,320
their third eye bullshit.

678
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:52,860
Bullshit.

679
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,780
Bullshit.

680
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:03,920
But the joy of the third nostril is that things that you've only seen with your sight, when exposed to the third nostril, you find a suddenly astringent and deadly poison.

681
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:12,580
Things that have otherwise looked completely safe. There are many things you can sniff out with your third nostril. It's very much like the John Carpenter film, They Live.

682
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,640
All you need is the right pair of sunglasses and the messages come through to you.

683
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,400
Marry and reproduce.

684
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,500
Marry, reproduce, obey, obey.

685
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,880
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

686
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:38,180
And many subgenii leave messages for each other at the bottom of street lights, etc. They spray out something from their third nostril and leave messages for other subgenii who may walk past.

687
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:47,040
I saw a lot of little stains on the street as I walked down the road that I thought might be messages or how do you say, pee mail.

688
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,940
Pee mail. Trail. Trail.

689
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,640
That's how we follow Bob.

690
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,360
And those stains don't come off either.

691
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,840
Also, we have had...

692
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,660
Don't get your mouth too close to that.

693
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,180
No, I've just realized that and I can see matter in the microphone.

694
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,200
It doesn't matter.

695
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,600
Oh, it doesn't matter much, but it is matter. It's matter of a sort.

696
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,640
But we've received messages from Bob in many stray shapes and forms.

697
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:18,560
When you walk down the street and you find audio tape chewed up around the wheel of a bicycle, if you take that audio tape home and thread it through a tape and play it, sacred information.

698
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,440
It's a bizarre thing.

699
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
That is so true. That has happened to me too. That's a really good example of that.

700
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,420
When you find audio tape and it's long string on the road, never leave it there. It is there for you.

701
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:33,680
Got it!

702
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,580
And if you see a $20 bill on the street...

703
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,120
Don't leave that.

704
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:44,200
Well, pick it up, but don't rush home looking guiltily over your shoulder.

705
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,960
Look around for the torn open bag dropped by the bank robber.

706
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,420
Don't be a sap. Be like Bob.

707
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,360
Where there's one $20 bill, there's another and another and another littering the ground.

708
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,900
But so many, they pick up that $20 bill and go,

709
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:10,120
Well, God damn, I just discovered me a $20 bill on the ground. Bob must love me. I'm going to go spend this on whiskey and wild women.

710
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,380
Well, friend, you can go ahead and do that.

711
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,940
But if you would just look behind that mound over there, you'd see that dead bank robber with his whole bag of litter.

712
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,580
And you'd have that good stuff if you'd just be a subgenius and live in discernment.

713
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,440
You had to use the spirit of greed and of lust for slack, of something for nothing.

714
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,860
You have to believe that something for nothing can come your way.

715
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,080
And even if it doesn't, if you believe it, you'll think it did.

716
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,340
That's the miracle of religion. That's summed to that.

717
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,760
Praise Bob. Sold it. I smoked it. That settles it.

718
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,740
Praise Bob!

719
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,360
Kill Bob.

720
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,540
Of course, we all know that a man without a religion is like a fish without a bicycle.

721
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,580
What if Bob were one of us?

722
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,200
What if Bob were one of us?

723
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,180
Just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home.

724
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,280
What if Bob was just a string hanging out of your nose?

725
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,120
Yeah, what if Bob was just a dingleberry stuck to the back of your butt?

726
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,860
You know, what if? We have to... It's something to think about late at night.

727
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,280
I've got drugs.

728
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,720
Seriously.

729
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,400
How does the guy who drives the snowplough get to work?

730
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,740
It's one of those things. It's a Zen koan.

731
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,440
What if Bob was a poodle?

732
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,700
What if Bob was a cat who lost his tail?

733
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,480
Bob? Pazapoo? Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?

734
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,680
You're currently listening to Radio Pazapoo, 7-9.2 FM.

735
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,400
You want to know more about this stuff we've been cramming out here?

736
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,460
Go to www.subgenius.com.

737
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,780
Subgenius.com.

738
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,140
Subgenius.com.

739
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,140


740
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:54,940
No.

741
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:04,740
It's just subgenius.com and that's spelled S-U-B-E-N-I-U-S.

742
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,460
I've been typing in subgenius all this time. Is that not the right thing to do?

743
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,920
That's the other website.

744
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,460
It's actually a well-known fact that all religious fanatics and religious nuts

745
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,440
first actually came to the United States.

746
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,940
They came through Holland before they went to the New World.

747
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,360
Really?

748
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,600
Yes. The Pilgrim Fathers stopped off in Leiden, for example.

749
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,820
Did they? Did they really?

750
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,660
They did.

751
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,080
They didn't tell us that.

752
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,200
No, of course not. The conspiracy doesn't want to let you know.

753
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,120
No, no.

754
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,080
They went from England and they first went to Holland in order to get their shit sorted out.

755
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:45,080
So they stayed over here and, well, apparently something happened and then they went off to the United...

756
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,500
Well, not... No, it wasn't the United States yet.

757
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,640
It was the colonies.

758
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,500
The New World. What a marvelous place.

759
00:41:52,940 --> 00:42:00,500
You know, it was full of giant woolly rhinoceroses and cave bears the size of this room.

760
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,560
And a giant elk that's the size of elephants.

761
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,340
And saber-toothed tigers.

762
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,920
Yeah. But those creatures were all wiped out by noble man.

763
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,020
Yes, as man arrived in the New World.

764
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:23,840
Long before Columbus, long before even Lee Ferrickson, long before Alley Hoop,

765
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:30,540
there, man came across and wiped out every competing mammal larger than himself.

766
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,460
Just as he had done in Australia and every other isolated place in the planet.

767
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,240
As soon as they got there, it was a mass...

768
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,200
Well, that was actually when the mass extinction started that's still going on.

769
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,140
We're working on it, friends. We're all doing our best.

770
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,960
I'll have... I'll order... Waiter, bring me another one of them chimpanzee sandwiches, would you?

771
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,980
Bring me another chocolate.

772
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,080
I understand that in Belgium you can actually get chimpanzee meat in some restaurants.

773
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,400
Is that bushmeat?

774
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,240
I don't know. I don't know.

775
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,780
Well, in the US, that's what I think.

776
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,320
They do describe the wilder, more exotic meats as bushmeat.

777
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,440
And he's certainly wild and exotic.

778
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,280
Exotic to you, man.

779
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,240
Bushmeat jerk.

780
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,340
In these primitive prehistoric times, was it the land without the subgenius influence?

781
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,540
Was it the land without the...

782
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,940
I mean, I understand that he came to the fore in the 50s,

783
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,460
but surely there was an influence before that.

784
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,020
For I've heard of the Yeti lineage involved.

785
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,400
Well, the Yeti, of course, there were great kingdoms in the Himalayas in Tibet,

786
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,740
the land now known as Tibet, Tibet.

787
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,980
The vast, the forbidden city, the early, the first Dobstown, and so forth.

788
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,640
And of course, the Native Americans have the legends of the pipe,

789
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,000
the great pipe that was brought to them by the white buffalo woman,

790
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,600
Onni, who came and brought the pipe, the knowledge of the pipe.

791
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,900
By the way, the stone that the pipe is made from,

792
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,960
is formed from the blood of the brilliance of the Prussian kings,

793
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,900
who were destroyed in the first cataclysmic flood of Dobst-Velikovsky biblical history.

794
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,780
So it's a kind of fossil.

795
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,800
Right, it's a fossilized blood of kings, humans, early humans,

796
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:33,440
killed by Jehovah One in order for subgenius Indians to make pipes.

797
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,720
Really cool pipes.

798
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Those are cool stone pipes.

799
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,640
Nothing like the pipes I've seen today in Amsterdam.

800
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,200
Nay, but just as impressive in their own way.

801
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,280
Oh, and we have seen many.

802
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,900
God almighty have I seen some impressive pipes.

803
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,300
Pipes that you would never dream of trying to bring home through customs,

804
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,780
but you can look at them and think, oh.

805
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,840
Pipes that they'll bust you just for having pictures of,

806
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,040
just for having seen.

807
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,480
If they can prove that you saw the artwork,

808
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,160
just the artwork on the pipe,

809
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,420
that alone is, in the United States right now,

810
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,300
you can get, you won't do hard time,

811
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,880
but you might have to go to one of those little,

812
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,880
country club prisons.

813
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,300
It's like a dormant, school dormitory.

814
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,700
Can we read the video?

815
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,320
Well, they, yeah.

816
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,380
Just a little lesson, little reminder.

817
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,440
Just a little reminder.

818
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,060
Just folks camp.

819
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,700
Yeah, the down home camps.

820
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,380
Just folks camps, they call them.

821
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,360
Today is the birthday of the rest of your life.

822
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,180
Getting used to it.

823
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,400
From PR News in Washington,

824
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,580
I'm working with joy for as long as six months.

825
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,000
The University of Basketball Arena has declared invalid

826
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,760
the results of last weekend's roadside bombing north of Philadelphia

827
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,280
and police say two volunteers working on behalf of turnpike workers

828
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,880
between Philadelphia and the site of a significant Pennsylvania turnpike

829
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,620
from Venezuela.

830
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,680
For PR News, I'm in time for Sunday's basketball game.

831
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
President Bush closed off southern New Jersey.

832
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,180
Drivers are passing through.

833
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,380
Going to and fro.

834
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,080
This is PR News.

835
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,080
This is exciting.

836
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,180
This is something menaosty.

837
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,420
All those quotes,

838
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,660
too much is better than none,

839
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,180
pulled a rule over your own eyes.

840
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,780
When did you guys get the phone data?

841
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,100
I mean, there's stories going around about a big brown paper bag,

842
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,500
bits of napkin and bits of...

843
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,140
No, Bob would write,

844
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,160
he'd be spouting at parties or business meetings or whatever.

845
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,660
And his certain holy utterances would just ring through everyone's memory.

846
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,220
And there'd always be someone sober enough to write it down.

847
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,540
And sometimes Bob did, but usually it was some associate of his.

848
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,080
And these things have their way of finding their way to us,

849
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,160
to we who have devoted our lives to categorizing.

850
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,720
We're like the monks.

851
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,140
We're like the monks.

852
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,160
We're like monks who shuffle endlessly through these mile-long corridors

853
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,620
of file cabinets and computer disks,

854
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,180
endlessly cataloging and recataloging every known utterance of the Dobbs.

855
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,520
We know where he was almost every day of his life,

856
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,840
but there are a few blackout periods where we don't know where Bob was.

857
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,460
But aside from that, our monks have managed to piece together

858
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,460
most of the life of Dobbs as we've so far up to a certain point.

859
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,540
He's unfortunately vanished a couple of years ago

860
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,700
during the Senate subcommittee investigation.

861
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,540
Of course, we expect to hear from him soon.

862
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:56,660
He apparently also ran around in Europe at the end of the Second World War.

863
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,640
Yes, yes.

864
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:05,640
Bob was very involved in the ending of the Second World War, actually, as well.

865
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,160
You know, he throttled Hitler with his own bare hands in the bunker.

866
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,560
That's a little-known fact.

867
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,700
But it was J.R. Bob Dobbs who dug his way in with an entrenching tool.

868
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,500
He hated it. It was the only thing Bob ever hated.

869
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,700
He loves all things except Nazis and chickens, actually.

870
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,660
He doesn't like chickens.

871
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,980
As sex partners.

872
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,740
He eats chicken, but he doesn't like chickens as sex partners.

873
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,600
And he hated Nazis.

874
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,860
So he was very patriotic during World War II.

875
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,720
And he actually dug into the bunker and killed Hitler with his bare hands.

876
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,480
That's bullshit!

877
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,900
It's true.

878
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,400
And then after that, he hunted for treasure in Holland

879
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:54,700
with a mysterious Dutch scientist whose name I never can remember.

880
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,280
He's still alive.

881
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,300
There's some recordings, in fact, of really old recordings of these guys

882
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,140
talking about their adventures with Bob after World War II.

883
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,960
I see. Actually, I didn't...

884
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,260
It was mostly right after the war ended.

885
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,020
It involved searching for the chalice of ultimate slack

886
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,140
amid the rubble of some city.

887
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,180
I can't remember which.

888
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,920
Some... Yes, it was a tragic, bloody...

889
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,400
It's time to burn your history books.

890
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,120
It's all lies.

891
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,340
The Nazis won World War II.

892
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,520
It's an epic story.

893
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,480
Sure, the fall of Berlin was a major setback for them.

894
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,060
The SS had to regroup.

895
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,200
But many of them got lucrative posts in the CIA and the U.S. Department of Defense.

896
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,920
From there, they opened up a line of connections through South America,

897
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,420
starting with the United Fruit Company in 1953.

898
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,460
The war against communism gave them a bargaining chip with their captors.

899
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,660
They became the bad boys who did the dirty work of stopping the red tide down south.

900
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,420
Good old expatriate Nazis staging military coups to replace reds with fascist-style dictatorships.

901
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:21,160
Each country, each travesty was another test tube for a new generation of fascists to study.

902
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,560
And study they did.

903
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,720
Panzers, Tigers, V-2 rockets just weren't enough.

904
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,360
So they learned to take governments from within.

905
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,180
They learned to undermine.

906
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,880
The Odessa, or whatever it transformed into, had plenty of friends on the inside.

907
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,920
It took an act of Congress to stop Henry Ford and Prescott Bush from trading with the Third Reich.

908
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,760
The Fuhrer was gone, but they had plenty of time to renew old friendships while they were retired

909
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,780
in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, or wherever.

910
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,060
It's been a long war, and I'm sure they are happy to see it finally coming to an end.

911
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,560
So go ahead, toss your history books onto the pyre.

912
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,780
There's nothing like a good old book burning.

913
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,380
It'll prepare you for the new world order better than anything else.

914
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:18,020
But, uh, people hear the word subgenius, and they jump to conclusions and think,

915
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,400
oh, they must think they're almost like a genius, real smart.

916
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,340
Well, technically, you know, a subgenius can include anything under a genius.

917
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,400
That, really, most of us probably qualify.

918
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,700
Oh, and you have to have the 20 euro.

919
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,960
But, uh, that helps to qualify.

920
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,860
If you spend that much money, you're going to be a genius.

921
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:36,860


922
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,400
So, uh, if you're going to be a genius, you're going to have to watch on us,

923
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,100
and we know that you're not a genius.

924
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,540
And we'll welcome you with open arms.

925
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,120
But you'll notice that we really, we attract very different kinds of people,

926
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,420
and that's the whole idea.

927
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:53,400
You'll see young and old and nice looking and really pretty bad looking,

928
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,300
and, uh, kind of clever and lots of really stupid ones.

929
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,860
And, friends, it's because we believe that the conspiracy of the normal humans

930
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,020
has misdefined the concept of intelligence.

931
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,380
It's not really the intelligence that counts,

932
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,320
but the sense, common sense, sense of humor,

933
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,660
and dollars and cents.

934
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,740
Oh, yes, dear friends.

935
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:26,600
But, you see, Bob is not this brilliant religious leader

936
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,240
like, uh, Billy Graham or somebody like that.

937
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,660
He, no, he's not smart.

938
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,840
He's something much more important.

939
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,480
He's smart.

940
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,840
He's lucky.

941
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,920
Yes, because if you think about it,

942
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,460
when was the last time brains got you laid?

943
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,440
No.

944
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,320
When they say get lucky, they mean it.

945
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:52,460
So Bob is, is, is, he's, uh, he's an idiot, really, by conspiracy standards.

946
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,860
He's, uh, has very little in his head.

947
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,300
As Reverend Onan Kanabite said,

948
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,480
Bob has two brains, left and right.

949
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,820
And in his left hand,

950
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,420
in his left brain, nothing is right.

951
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,720
And in his right brain, there's nothing left.

952
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,540
But, but, but somehow he makes a million dollars

953
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,280
every time he screws up.

954
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,940
And he screws up constantly.

955
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,000
Uh, that's because Bob is the very,

956
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,800
just happens to be, by luck,

957
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,860
the very fulcrum of the luck plane of the entire universe.

958
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,320
What Bob wants to happen,

959
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,040
just by coincidence,

960
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,860
happens to be what's going to happen anyway.

961
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,240
This is because Bob has the wisdom of,

962
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,940
of, uh, he's ripped off the wisdom of every Zen master.

963
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,320
Bob has a special path that he teaches,

964
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,840
the path of least resistance, dear friends.

965
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,620
And that is the way we find our way to slack.

966
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,000
So most of us merely stumble onto it,

967
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,560
if, if we do so at all.

968
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,880
It's kind of, uh, defeats the purpose to work towards slack.

969
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,020
But yet, here we are.

970
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:03,960
Here we end up working.

971
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,540
And it's Sunday night.

972
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,420
Some of you have to get up and go to work tomorrow.

973
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,180
Now sometimes that's good.

974
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,600
You like your job.

975
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,060
You're a lucky one.

976
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,440
I like my job.

977
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,540
I get to go to bars and tempt sinners away from the devil.

978
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,320
That's not bad.

979
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,760
But, uh, you know, there's this,

980
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,620
everybody somehow has found it,

981
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,900
has, I believe that we've all been tricked

982
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,360
by the conspiracy into thinking it's normal

983
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,400
to go and do this job you might not like so much,

984
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,940
just to have enough money to pay the rent.

985
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,480
And we call, we say that that is because of the conspiracy.

986
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,000
And many people say,

987
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,300
oh, I know about the conspiracy.

988
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,780
I'm real hip to that.

989
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,360
But the conspiracy that killed Kennedy,

990
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,080
the conspiracy that hides the UFOs in the, uh,

991
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,540
Air Force bases,

992
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,600
or the conspiracy to re-elect George Bush.

993
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,000
Well,

994
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,260
or the fashion conspiracy, you know,

995
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,980
where the,

996
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,060
where the,

997
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,080
some, some, uh,

998
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:05,680
bum,

999
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,580
bodiless corporation somewhere decides

1000
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,680
what constitutes a pretty woman each year.

1001
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,920
And, uh, tries to sell you on that concept of false slack.

1002
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,560
Friends,

1003
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,420
that's part of the conspiracy.

1004
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,880
But the big conspiracy we're talking about

1005
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,060
is the conspiracy that doesn't even know

1006
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,520
that it is a conspiracy.

1007
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,660
The conspiracy of the normal people.

1008
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,500
They don't even think about it.

1009
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,620
They automatically dislike everything different.

1010
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:42,260
The subgeniuses are the species that at least are interested in everything different.

1011
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,080
Sometimes you find out that the,

1012
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,980
the path least followed is that way because it's a shitty path.

1013
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:49,700
Uh,

1014
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:50,980
but, uh,

1015
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,460
we want to try it anyway,

1016
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,320
goddammit,

1017
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,260
just to be ornery if for no other reason.

1018
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
Yes, she loves shoes.

1019
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,900
Is this guy boring you?

1020
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,960
Why don't you come and talk to me?

1021
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,660
I'm from a different planet.

1022
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:08,840
And you can see him at the Detroit Revival, dear friends,

1023
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,460
March 19th at the Magic Stick in Detroit.

1024
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,280
That's March 19th in Detroit with the amino acids,

1025
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
which is who you've been hearing in the background,

1026
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,820
uh, this whole show on my credits.

1027
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:25,500
You also, uh, playing will be Mann and the Christ Punchers

1028
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,520
and many more.

1029
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,400
Uh, also, uh, preaching,

1030
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,920
by Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

1031
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,740
and yours truly,

1032
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,540
and many more.

1033
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,180
Uh, prepare also, friends, for text day,

1034
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,020
May 7th outside of Austin,

1035
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,200
uh, at a camp,

1036
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,040
just like the Brushwood camp,

1037
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,140
where we'll hold X Day itself on July 30th through July 5th.

1038
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,540
For more, see www.subgenius.com.

1039
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:57,340
Or, friends, you can write to Bob at Post Office Box 181417.

1040
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:07,060
That's Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1041
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,760
Uh, that is the address of Subgenius Foundation.

1042
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:16,420
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1043
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,980
www.subgenius.com.

1044
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,580
And praise Bob!

1045
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,440
Anyway, like I say, we, we, uh, make fun of all the other, uh, religions,

1046
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,940
but our cult of the subgenius has actually not been doing all that great ourselves.

1047
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,020
We had, uh, our seventh X Day two weeks ago, waiting for the saucers.

1048
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,100
And, w- thanks to the great woodbusters of Brushwood,

1049
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,080
who also build the bonfire for this,

1050
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,160
they built a giant Dobbs icon.

1051
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,960
We have a kind of a, uh, an altered cross with a pipe on it.

1052
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,420
They built it out of wood.

1053
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,820
And every year, the drug users of the subgenius church watch that thing burn

1054
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:13,380
and speculate on the meaning of what parts of the, you know, fall off and burn first.

1055
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,820
Well, this time, the whole icon, almost instantly,

1056
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:21,200
instead of stalwartly taking forever to burn,

1057
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,080
the thing, uh, slowly limped and flopped.

1058
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:32,740
And dropped in about five minutes, like an old, limp, flaccid icon.

1059
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,580
And meanwhile, meanwhile, what's on television?

1060
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,680
The Bob N. Zeit commercials.

1061
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:44,100
What the hell? If, if, if you're not familiar with them,

1062
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,920
it's a very obvious ripoff of J.R. Bob Dobbs, only without the, the pipe.

1063
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,080
And it's an, it's commercials for erectile dysfunction.

1064
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,020
Medicine.

1065
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,940
It's like a poor man's Viagra.

1066
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,500
The conspiracy stole Bob so they could get hard.

1067
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,340
Leaving the original church in a limp, flaccid condition.

1068
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:14,340
But, friends, J.R. Bob Dobbs puts the scent in incentive.

1069
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:19,560
He puts the Richard in ridiculous, and he puts the pipe in your mouth.

1070
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,540
Praise Bob.

1071
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,020
So, um,

1072
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,840
If they catch not see the humor of it,

1073
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,400
Then let them mount up upon themselves.

1074
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:35,800
Amen.

1075
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,280
You have to believe that something for nothing can come your way.

1076
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,540
And it, even if it doesn't, if you believe it, you'll think it did.

1077
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,240
That's the miracle of religion.

1078
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,120
And joy to all people.

1079
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,760
Pardon my gesprochen Polish into English.

1080
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:55,900
I'm Tom Jemimowski.

1081
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1082
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1083
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1084
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1085
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1086
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:55,900


1087
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:55,880
