1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Oh, not necessarily beautiful, but you take turns.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,000
Not necessarily stunning, but beautiful.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,340
I love you.

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,660
I love you.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,880
I love you.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
Oh, what you just heard, dear friends, that was a compliment.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,040
Actually, I've got a lot more of that.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,940
A friend of mine sent me a tape that's every James Brown scream edited together in one tape.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,720
I've got to imagine that.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,580
Yeah, okay, here.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,540
I've got to do that.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,260
Let me see.

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,540
It's at hand, all queued up.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,380
This is it, friends.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:58,660
This is every James Brown scream from every James Brown record ever put together all at once.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
When you push your cat eyes.

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,460
Man, that's not it.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,320
That ain't it.

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,480
No, it's on side two.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:07,840
Here it is.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,160
Here it is.

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,620
Yeah, this is it.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
I can tell by the hiss.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,760
It's coming up.

25
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,100
What you gonna play now?

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,160
Bobby?

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,460
I don't know.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,900
I don't know.

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,060
I don't know.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
They can't go.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't know.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,780
I don't know.

33
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,360
I don't know.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,280
I don't know.

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,140


36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,820
I don't know.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't know.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,840
Is that wild or what?

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,460
Yes, and praise Bob.

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,080
This is wild.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,260
Gando here at 90.9 FM

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,340
with every screen that James Brown ever had.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah.

44
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,480
Bob, love you.

45
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:49,820
Woo!

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:50,980
Yeah.

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,780
Bob, love you.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,100
Woo!

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,220
Yeah.

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:53,980
Bob, love you.

51
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,200
Woo!

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,640
4.30 in the morning, time for show.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,200
Live show for you now.

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,300
...itself as an infant.

55
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,260
How come always scary on show,

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
says Doug Smith of Dallas, Texas?

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,820
Well, it's actually been some time

58
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,940
since Gary has been on the show, Doug.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,960
We've tried to get him to come in,

60
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,220
but he always has to go out smurfing

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,960
through the solar system on his windsurfboard.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,640
His solar windsurfer is a 40-foot long...

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,240
Hey, strap in.

64
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,580
...sail...

65
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,900
...show...

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,480
...was about to take off.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,080
...to about two and a half miles in wind.

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,580
...magnetic power.

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,260
Bob?

70
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,340
Oh, my God, the pilot's dead.

71
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,420
He's been dead for over ten years.

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,480
The pilot and the pilot's boy.

73
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,260
They both were coming fast.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
Dear God in heaven,

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,380
it was a joy that dead men could not blast.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
Aboard to the...

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,100
Mm-hmm.

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,600
I saw...

79
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Hey, Hal, wake up.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I heard his voice.

81
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:53,860
What?

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,580
Come on.

83
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,040
Okay, we're going to take off in a little while,

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,140
so you want to read the paper?

85
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,420
He singeth loud his godly hymn,

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,940
the music he makes in the wood.

87
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,240
Yes, Puzzle F. Good lives in that wood.

88
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,960
This is K-N-O-N,

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,820
90.9 Dallas, Texas.

90
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
This is K-N-O-N,

91
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,640
90.9 Dallas, Texas.

92
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,800
That's 90.9 F-N-O-N.

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,940
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,200
Gosh.

96
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,140
Welcome.

97
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,640
Welcome.

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Welcome.

99
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,120


100
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,260
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,040
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenus.

102
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,240
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,960
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

104
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,960
and only in the city of

105
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,360
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of slark.

106
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:48,440
Oh, yes, dear friends.

107
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,760
Oh, yes, it's scary on the show again tonight.

108
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,540
It's scary because I'm not so well prepared.

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
The conspiracy got me again.

110
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,420
But that's okay, folks.

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,920
Because, as it says in...

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Isaiah 28, 7, 8...

113
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,460
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink.

114
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,700
They are swallowed up with wine.

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,020
They are out of the way through strong drink.

116
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
They err in vision.

117
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
They stumble in judgment.

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,580
For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,860
And there is no place clean.

120
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,060
Yes.

121
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,140
Shut that baby up in there.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,780
Babies, they get into all the subgenius shows.

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,700
Not just in Texas.

124
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,400
Anyway, folks, we're still on the subject this week.

125
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,980
We're continuing our sermon on...

126
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,560
Well, this is our anti-drug show.

127
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,940
Of course, we're fairly selective about which...

128
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
To be anti with.

129
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,140
But, you know, the official church position on drugs, friends,

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,300
is that they don't show you a real world.

131
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,640
They don't expand your mind.

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,680
They only get you high.

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,020
And if you think you experienced a mystical state on, say, OLSD,

134
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,120
you were wrong.

135
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,760
You were merely drunk as a lord, dear friend.

136
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,380
So we're doing everything in our power to put a stop

137
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,700
to the recent false subgenius fad of gut blowout parties.

138
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,420
There went one just then.

139
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,100
These reckless kids are risking their souls, friends,

140
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,120
taking these green joyjackers and bowel lifters and screamers and laughters

141
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,220
and floppers and floaters and all those other unsanctified street drugs.

142
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,980
This is false slack, friends.

143
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,200
There's only one way to do it.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,680
There's only one way to do it.

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:25,740
There's only one way to do it.

146
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,460
There's only one mind rel...

147
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:27,720
Ooh!

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,820
There goes...

149
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,640
There's a gut blowout party, friends.

150
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,600
Listen to that in the background.

151
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,100
That was the latest doc stock.

152
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,340
It's the doctors preparing the prescriptions.

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,260
There's only one of these mind relinquishing substances

154
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,880
that you should even consider putting the gobble on, dear friends,

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,420
and that's the sacred Tibetan herb, haba-frop-zipulops,

156
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,040
which is not a drug.

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,300
Now, you know, you don't have to take the frop.

158
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,760
You can quit if you want to go sane,

159
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,940
if you want to keep your so-called senses,

160
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,420
but, you know, how can we know the goddess of heaven seen on this slide

161
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,900
lest we have, for comparison, vomited into the porcelain bowls of hell?

162
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,860
For, although the great inebriant of Tibet provides only an illusory vision of time control,

163
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,500
yet such a glimpse fortifies the subgenius,

164
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,280
and he follows the taste of that artificial life.

165
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,220
He is a daintless explorer of fake horizons,

166
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,000
for, of all the sacraments,

167
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,520
frop does not wear off.

168
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
We like you and should ignore you,

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,980
but instead,

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,680
we're going to take you to the temple.

171
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,620
Oh, God, it hurts.

172
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
My headaches come back.

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,820
Oh!

174
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh!

175
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,260
Oh!

176
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,540
Oh!

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000


178
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,360
If these headaches keep up,

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
fuck, I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

180
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,920
I'll go in the medicine fish hole if I have to.

181
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,940
Oh.

182
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,040
Do you have any aspirin?

183
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,800
There can be no such thing as a safe pleasure drug.

184
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,080
Uh, even if it had no harmful physical side effects,

185
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,400
it still would have, uh, it would still be overused

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,460
by some people who cannot get pleasure in other ways.

187
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,280
That's what's so sad.

188
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,460
Oh, I know smoking cigarettes cause cancer, but I can't stop.

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,260
But if them same folks told you smoking cigarettes in your office,

190
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,180
your automobile would corrode your engine,

191
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,600
it would be no more smoking in the car.

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,420
Now, that's kind of sad.

193
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
Because they've manipulated us

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,480
to the extent that these educational institutions

195
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
ain't nothing but tricks.

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,880
I don't know you.

197
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,220
Why?

198
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,640
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

199
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
You mean he's hooked on it?

200
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,240
He's hooked. He's got a chicken on his back.

201
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,980
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

202
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,100
Ha ha ha ha ha.

203
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,280
As far back as educated men have recorded their history,

204
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,020
veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

205
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,140
rents in the fabric of man's awareness.

206
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,460
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind

207
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,000
lies the next vision, the next key to his infinite capacity.

208
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,580
There's reason to believe that incessant stimulation

209
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,200
of the reward or pleasure centers of the brain

210
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,980
will lead to a resetting of the pleasure threshold

211
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,180
so that ordinary enjoyable things no longer stimulate that area,

212
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,100
or if they do, they aren't effective,

213
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,860
and one can't enjoy ordinary life

214
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,820
so that all one has left are the chemicals.

215
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,220
If we keep using drugs the way they are,

216
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
we're going to go down the chemical dumper.

217
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,200
Well, you look puzzled, Peter.

218
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,740
Other than you're still plain Peter Wayne.

219
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,260
But don't worry.

220
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,940
It'll all be crystal clear as soon as you cross the...

221
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,320
Consciousness expanding.

222
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,600
Properly induced C.E. will give a subject full awareness

223
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,420
of capabilities never known before.

224
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,640
And doses have been somewhat shorter for me the last time or two.

225
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,980
If you can hear me now,

226
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,840
you'd better listen to my warning.

227
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,640
Warning, warning...

228
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,680
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack

229
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,600
to see how they did hang.

230
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,400
And I'm sure you've heard of the C.E.

231
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:17,400


232
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,620
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.

233
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,540
I couldn't ignite a thing.

234
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,680
There was no shard, no bone, no twig.

235
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,780
I brought my comic book collection.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,940
What's about this big, yeah?

237
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,860
Frop without slack is like slack without frop.

238
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,760
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

239
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,720
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock.

240
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,120
But all that food was stale.

241
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,980
Thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck.

242
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,920
Forgot he was in jail.

243
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Ended up killing a porcupine

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,880
just to see if I could smoke his rhyme.

245
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,100
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

246
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,880
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

247
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,700
Yeah, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

248
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,880
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,880
I don't know what I am going to do.

250
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,920
I just know that this here trip ain't through.

251
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

252
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,120
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

253
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,160
Oh, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

254
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,700
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

255
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,240
Yeah, frop without slack is like slack without frop.

256
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,140
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

257
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,200
Oh, stay away from that.

258
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,160
Frop without slack is like slack without frop.

259
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,200
But where the hell else am I going to cop?

260
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,780
No way.

261
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

262
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,340
I want to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

263
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:33,060
It's going to be Russell Crowe, WBD Rivera back in the 80's women and a head Continuing the

264
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,440
S http://www.b-l-j.支持-my-lifeaccuracy.csh

265
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,740
Frop without slack, dear friends.

266
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,760
The users of drugs, drugs dear friends, on the other hand are placing themselves in grave danger.

267
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,700
They can never get as truly fried as they want to be.

268
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,560
They got to take one on top of the other.

269
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,180
Sometimes they take so many that when they forget one or two, they later get mad at themselves for it.

270
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,400
So to keep mentally levitating, they always need more.

271
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Sooner or later, they burn out and become too slacked to react.

272
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:22,160
As they say, the brain tunnels through which they once excavated and blasted with such drunken zeal begin to cave in.

273
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,880
The abuser wakes up one day impaired, his muscles feel ravaged, his nerves nullified.

274
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,660
There is a hollowness inside, but a hot hollowness.

275
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,960
And discomfort mounts to panic as he realizes

276
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,380
he's not alone.

277
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,000
He's annihilated one brain cell too many.

278
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:48,240
His teeth grind, his cells shrivel, yet seem to scream for more when there is none.

279
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,380
His skin exudes bitter greases from every pore as if he were getting a long overdue oil change.

280
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,280
Everything's clammy and numb to the touch.

281
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,540
His eternal itch gasps and convulses with the amputation nausea of something missing.

282
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,220
The electric blue?

283
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,080
The blue of his brain becomes tacky and stiffens.

284
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:22,960
The snot-like shock fluid in which the brain once cozily floated has drained away and the dried husk of grey matter slams against the rough cranial walls with every movement of the head.

285
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,580
The gyroscopes inside the ears' balance tubes wobble crazily and the world is no end up.

286
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,020
The floor lurches and shifts its steepness and changes its slant right under his feet.

287
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,900
If he lays down, he suffers the slow ovals, the bed seeming to spin very slowly end over end through space.

288
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:53,040
He goes to the bathroom to expel the bad water, but his urine smells burnt and leaks out in a weak radioactive dribble.

289
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,920
He looks in the mirror.

290
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:05,300
His skin is Krishna blue in pallor and he worries that the quiet interior shattering noises he hears are the sounds of his blood crystallizing.

291
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:19,860
His heart starts to dry hump the back of his throat in hysteria, for he knows that to die on drugs is to doom his soul to eternal earthbound wandering in a purgatory where the liquor stores are all closed.

292
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:30,240
If the nental eye is intoxicated, the very soul is intoxicated, when the body dies, it doesn't know it's dead and so never heads for heaven.

293
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,680
Laying on the floor, glowing feebly in the dark,

294
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,960
the wretch moans out the drug user's lament.

295
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
I can't decipher anything.

296
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,860
Put me where you want me.

297
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,040
Give me rubber blankets.

298
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:57,520
Eventually his cohorts show up and give him succor in the form of more and the wheel starts rolling again.

299
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,940
The conspiracy encourages blatantly.

300
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,820
A useless, empty pattern of social drug abuse in its slaves.

301
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:18,980
The anti-reality sleep drugs like alcohol and downers are legal pretty much while the wake up drugs are only available.

302
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,800
You can tell which ones they'd rather you take.

303
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,740
But dear friends, we're not just talking about all that stuff tonight.

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,420
It's also coming up near Halloween.

305
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,380
So we got a sort of a monster and drugs show.

306
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:59,140
That's right, drug monsters and I've got for you this little moment of Elvira herself talking about Bob.

307
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,520
Actually, we ought to go to this cart.

308
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,520
We'll play the cart first.

309
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,240
When we come back.

310
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,860
Elvira for Bob.

311
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,660
K-N-O-N-I-F-M

312
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,980
Man, that's right.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,040
In Dallas, Fort Worth, the only station with real rock and roll music is K-N-O-N-9.9-F-M.

314
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,580
The voice of the people, the station that knows no equal.

315
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,800
Monday night, 7 till 9 p.m.

316
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,220
We got it.

317
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,820
We got Elmo, Latex and Kelly doing From the Hip.

318
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,520
Tuesday night, 7 till 9 p.m.

319
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,320
We got Tim Hibbs, Brave New Radio at 11 to midnight on Tuesdays.

320
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,400
We got Jeff Webb with music from the Vital Hour, a different artist spotlight every week.

321
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,160
Wednesday night, 7 till 9 p.m.

322
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,760
Charlie Dutton, Park and Owl with Who Cares?

323
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,380
And Wednesday night, 11 p.m. till 2 a.m.

324
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,280
It's Jeff Bliles with Life is Hard.

325
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,100
Thursday night, 7 till 9 p.m.

326
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,640
Jeff Webb again with Offbeat Music.

327
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,820
Friday night, 7 till 9 p.m.

328
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,980
We got Kenny and Paul with Underground.

329
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,980
And 1 to 4 a.m. late Friday night.

330
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,360
We got Audrey and Anatomic with Radio Lobotomy.

331
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,040
Saturday afternoon, 2 till 5 p.m.

332
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,640
We got Brad Sigler doing Dig That Groove.

333
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,940
Saturday night, 9 to midnight.

334
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,280
We got Shaggy's Pajama Party.

335
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,340
And Saturday midnight till 4 a.m.

336
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,120
The best in heavy metal and hardcore punk is Roddy Moore's Harsh Realm.

337
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,400
That's right, right here.

338
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:30,880
Can't win.

339
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,080
94.9 FM is the only place in Dallas-Fort Worth for the real thing.

340
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,020
Rock and roll.

341
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,920
KNON, the only station on planet Earth.

342
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,880
And here, just as promised, is Reverend Ann Leonard.

343
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,640
I mean, Elvira.

344
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,900
Yes, whoo-ree, Bob. It's little old me, Bob.

345
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,600
That gal with the set that you won't soon forget.

346
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,980
And I ain't talking about your basic trinitron.

347
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,360
That gal with the set you won't soon forget.

348
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,620
Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.

349
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,060
And welcome to another edition of...

350
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,760
But it's a subgenre greater than this three-hour effect.

351
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,540
With these old divans down there.

352
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,640
But, uh, let me see.

353
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,900
If my daddy was a shabby and my mammy was a shammy,

354
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,900
I wonder if I'll end up becoming something weird.

355
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,920
You won't become one of us.

356
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,220
I won't? Oh, gee.

357
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,400
But I wanted to, Vinnie.

358
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,160
I've never felt like I belonged in my life.

359
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
I mean, I've always been on the outside looking in.

360
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,220
Just, just the big nose pressed up against the window of life.

361
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
You wanna know something?

362
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,440
I was even turned down for membership in the Book of the Month Club.

363
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,060
Mom.

364
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,800
It is this control of the circuitry,

365
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,600
this ability to send phantom signals to real bodies through their remembered images,

366
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,200
this ability to send phantom signals to real bodies through their remembered images,

367
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,460
this ability to send phantom signals to real bodies through their remembered images,

368
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,760
there's a pin stuck in a doll that gives hell its power on Earth.

369
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,940
hell its power on Earth.

370
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,140
Hell is not a place,

371
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,420
Hell is not a place,

372
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,560
but a system for disrupting the plans of God.

373
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,960
She thinks you can cure the world by kindness and rules,

374
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,840
but it's too small.

375
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,760
The lord's prayer on a pinhead.

376
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,160
Some make rules, some obey,

377
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,120
but the rules are for the fools is what I say.

378
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,160
That's what makes me sick.

379
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,820
I wear the wrong clothes.

380
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,360
I see the wrong things.

381
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,260
You know I can't dance, but my feet are much too wide.

382
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,980
You think you set the trends.

383
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,520
You wear your head to stripes.

384
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,100
Your clothes are out of sight.

385
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,260
Your house is modern, really kitsch.

386
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,260
You got some macho in your way, young bitch.

387
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,260
I see them going to work.

388
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,840
I see them doing sweet.

389
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,320
I see them on TV.

390
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,120
I see them laughing dry.

391
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
I'm on the outside.

392
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,280
I'm on the outside.

393
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,880
I'm on the outside.

394
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,140
Look around you.

395
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,060
Look all around you.

396
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,200
The rude clerks in stores that hate their job and take it out on you.

397
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:15,480
The thing about the normals is that they conceptualize themselves to be hot sinus effluvia on silver platters,

398
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,940
but in reality reveal themselves to be cold mucus incrustation on a paper plate.

399
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,460
Oh, Will, what are you going to do?

400
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,220
If I ain't being rejected, I'm being ejected.

401
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,100
All right?

402
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,840
Let's see that finger of yours, a quiver, and ready to punch that eject button.

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,280
Well, before you do, let me tell you about...

404
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,520
Bob?

405
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:43,080
We shall retrieve their short-circuited carcasses and prepare them for permanent dysfunction.

406
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,860
All right, let's do it.

407
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,420
Activate interlock.

408
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
Dynatherms connected.

409
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,040
Infracells up.

410
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,340
Mega thrusters are go.

411
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,220
Let's go.

412
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,600
Voltron Force.

413
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,160
7-D ec athletic th报 do dat capacity.

414
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,320
If anyone dies while you are kept in your fall-out room, move your body to another room

415
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,980
in the h Yes,

416
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,820
the last day of my residence.

418
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Tell your body your address and cover in your Level S fiberglass, sheet or blanket.

419
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,880
Dark for me and light el Sրibto Bly to be Active Chongunorewupe Dimwularnos

420
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,280
However, you will not в

421
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,180
the house before dispatch,

422
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,740
for more than five days.

423
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,080
And if it is safe to go outside,

424
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,840
then you should bury the body for the time being in a trench

425
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,520
or cover it with earth and mark the spot of the burial.

426
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,200
In these early stages, the symptoms of radiation sickness

427
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,620
and the symptoms of panic are identical.

428
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,940
Oh, my God.

429
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,500
What a horrible death.

430
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,600
It won't kill him. It couldn't.

431
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,340
What do you mean? It's got to kill him, Professor.

432
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,100
The other night at the reactor.

433
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,500
Didn't you sense it? The beast has a purpose.

434
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,220
Thirty years ago, Godzilla appeared for the first time.

435
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,620
Before that, he was only a legend.

436
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,180
Godzilla is a warning. A warning to every one of us.

437
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,900
When mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born.

438
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,880
I'm just trying to...

439
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,020
send him home.

440
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,200
Attention.

441
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,780
Attention.

442
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,880
Nuclear attack warning. Condition red.

443
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,160
Detonation 25 minutes.

444
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,860
Take emergency precautions.

445
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,260
Professor.

446
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:58,980
Attention.

447
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,000
All personnel.

448
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,020
Nature has a way sometimes of reminding man of just how small he is.

449
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,080
She occasionally throws up the terrible offsprings of our pride and carelessness

450
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,100
to remind us of how puny we really are in the face of a tornado,

451
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,020
an earthquake,

452
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,140
or a Godzilla.

453
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,640
The reckless ambitions of man are often dwarfed

454
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,160
by their own.

455
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,300
They are dangerous consequences.

456
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:39,440
For now, Godzilla, that strangely innocent and tragic monster, has gone to Earth.

457
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:49,040
Whether he returns or not, or is never again seen by human eyes, the things he has taught

458
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,100
us remain.

459
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,540
The End

460
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:53,540


461
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,320
The End

462
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
The End

463
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,160


464
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,160


465
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,240


466
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,880
monster club if we do not boast amongst our membership a single member of the human race

467
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:20,680
what can he do in the past 60 years humes have exterminated over 150 million of their own kind

468
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,400
no effort has been spared to reach this astronomical figure and the methods that

469
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,680
they have used must demand our unstinted admiration you know humes began with certain

470
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:42,100
very serious disadvantages but these they overcame with wonderful ingenuity not having a fang or a

471
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:50,540
claw or even a whistle worth talking about they invented guns and tanks and bombs and airplanes

472
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:57,300
and extermination camps and poison gas and daggers and swords and bayonets and

473
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:06,180
booby traps and atomic bombs and flying missiles submarines warships aircraft carriers and motor

474
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:15,780
cars they have even perfected a process whereby they can spread a lethal disease on any part of

475
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:23,100
this planet not to say anything about nuclear power oh during their short history you know

476
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,540
humes have subjected other humes to death by

477
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:37,960
burning hanging decapitation strangulation electrocution shooting drowning crushing wrecking

478
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:47,100
disemboweling and other methods far far too revolting for the delicate stomachs of this

479
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:56,440
august descent i never realized he was so talented we don't like to boast i

480
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,160
going to try today

481
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,320
all right

482
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,480
and the immediately the

483
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,800
just now

484
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
we're douche tied up

485
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,520
i'm going to just breath in

486
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,320
shong

487
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,920
gal

488
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,360
throw

489
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,480
a

490
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:23,480


491
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,640
a

492
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,320
one

493
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,280
Are you interested in the strange and the unusual?

494
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,700
Are you curious by the baffling and the bizarre?

495
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:52,240
If so, you will tune in Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m. for Radio Soiree.

496
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,440
All right, allow me to introduce myself.

497
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,060
I am the Martian Neon Creature, your masterful controller for those two hours which you cannot escape.

498
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,520
And you will listen to Radio Soiree Thursdays at midnight until 2 a.m.

499
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,680
or come under the sudden threat of instant vaporization.

500
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,520
You have been warned.

501
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,360
When you leave this room, the effect will continue.

502
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,100
Inside of your own mind.

503
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,180
Inside of your own soul.

504
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,080
Go, go, go, go.

505
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,560
Perhaps the stew bums understand the sacrament of the wine best.

506
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,760
Best?

507
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:21,760


508
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,620
It's outside the church, in the street, that one truly feels the touch.

509
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,880
They're drinking the real blood of Jesus, friends, or the blood of Bob or whoever,

510
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
out of those green Thunderbird bottles.

511
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,180
Bob was not beaten up in vain.

512
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,940
His blood became the muscatel, the mad dog, the night train that those boys ride.

513
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,540
It's supposed to...

514
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:50,920
It...

515
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,120
It...

516
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,220
It...

517
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:52,220


518
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,460
It does what religion is supposed to do.

519
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,580
It makes them feel so good.

520
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,240
Ah, yes.

521
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:19,900
It is the pink, suburban, respectable alcoholic who has no excuse and, verily, no hope.

522
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,220
Well, perhaps there is one thing.

523
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,980
There is one thing that can bring them from their closet of opiated, self-hating secrecy.

524
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,380
Perhaps if they turned to the Frop Lords of Tibet.

525
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:41,280
Yes, we most pious arch-popes condone violently the most frequent possible indulgence unto

526
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:48,560
intoxication and beyond of the revered and despised grief-easer of the mountains, the

527
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,000
warrior against pain, the healing herb.

528
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,120
Habifrop.

529
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,980
Zipulops.

530
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:00,860
Whether taken as smoked liquid food or as Bob's pills, trademark, it, above all the

531
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,720
other medicinal substances, spells relief.

532
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,020
From the hearty young stalks protruding from the Himalayan snow to the white frop dust that

533
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,280
settles on the rim of Bob's pipe.

534
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,600
It's the closest thing to the untainted essence of Odin on Earth.

535
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,980
How else can we regard that which produces in the devoted user?

536
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,920
Such superhuman clarity of insight?

537
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,300
Such sensory hyper-anesthesia?

538
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,220
Such total loss of judgment which yet is profound wisdom?

539
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:41,000
Such placid ecstasy and blessed repose which in short is the only shortcut to the realization

540
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,140
of the Dob's state.

541
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,420
The Exists planted our beloved Frop on Earth near the close of the age of dinosaurs.

542
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:58,420
Bob tells us it may well be Jehovah One's main instrument for evolution on this planet,

543
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,960
having very possibly been the device which brought down the great reptiles, allowing

544
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,940
us mammals to take their place as large destroyers.

545
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:12,860
And yet, also, Frop is that which will, with Bob's guidance, likewise complete the usurpation

546
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,180
as dominant species of the humans by the subgenius hordes.

547
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Frop's detractors.

548
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,120
Mostly alcoholics.

549
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,400
And people who are not.

550
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,780
Potheads.

551
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Scream that it is a physically addictive vampire root from whose siren embrace no man can tug

552
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,200
free.

553
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
We shout, Hallelujah!

554
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,940
Praise Bob, of course it is.

555
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,900
And is the Lord himself one bit less habit-forming?

556
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,880
Habit Frop Zipulops teaches us ultimately that all is one that up is down.

557
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,960
It allows us to converse with trees and to see prophetic and accurate visions of the

558
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
future in our shoes.

559
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,520
Our album covers in the strange reflections on our toasters.

560
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,680
An ascetic Frop master in Tibet or Dobbs Town can with diligent consumption finally lose

561
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,780
all interest in everything, achieving the paranurvanic state closest to Bob himself.

562
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,840
Accidental erasure, that plane on which the luck oceans are most effortlessly surfed and

563
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,980
by which the densely overgrown path of least-known.

564
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:19,980


565
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:19,980


566
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,420
The least resistance is trimmed for safe travel.

567
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,440
It virtually negates the curse of memory that stumbling block to perfection and it makes

568
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,340
this state as easily attainable to a distracted harried American as to a Tibetan llama or

569
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,020
Mexican Brujo.

570
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,780
Apart from all that-

571
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:04,780


572
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,420
Home Department journalists have agreedilen pro Mid-Tahea Martial Law.

573
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,920
House of Friends and brothers, P tenants in Pine Island, TKZ Jim cousins, and others serve

574
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,080
the lubSo that Jimismus, Tom S. Moore's mother ofеб

575
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,120
Nape fly over Warren divided sistema, that toutes lesbble.

576
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,980
What about Cohen's relationship to sentiment?

577
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:19,980


578
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
Everything is fine

579
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,440
You got your good things

580
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,860
I've got mine

581
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,420
In heaven

582
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,960
Everything is fine

583
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,060
In heaven

584
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,840
Everything is fine

585
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,140
In heaven

586
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,460
Everything is fine

587
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,700
You got your good things

588
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,060
I've got mine

589
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,740
Arrow inhibitor cells

590
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,900
My equilibrium

591
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,240
Destabilized

592
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,500
The young man, I was full of life and imagination and ideas

593
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,300
Now I know it's all just an illusion

594
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,060
And you, you think your mission is so very important

595
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
To me it means nothing

596
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,560
I really don't care if you win or lose

597
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,840
It's what our free society is founded on

598
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,360
You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?

599
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,220
I said you think...

600
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,920
They give a damn about their bills in Russia

601
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,020
They don't pay bills in Russia, it's all free

602
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,200
Huh?

603
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,580
No, ain't no commie

604
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,760
You better not be, I don't want no commies in my car

605
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,360
No Christians either

606
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,740
A lot of people don't realize what's really going on

607
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,820
They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidents and things

608
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,660
They don't realize that theirs is like

609
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,300
A lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything

610
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,220
Give me an example of that

611
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,160
I'll show you what I mean

612
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,380
Suppose you're thinking about a plate of shrimp

613
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,780
Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp, or plate of shrimp

614
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,080
Out of the blue, no explanation

615
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,740
No point in looking for one either

616
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,660
It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness

617
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,980
You eat a lot of acid, Miller?

618
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
Back in the hippie days?

619
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,180
Might give you another instance

620
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,060
You know the way everybody is into weirdness right now?

621
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,220
No...

622
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,220


623
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,220


624
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,220


625
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:45,220


626
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:54,660
Books in all the supermarkets about commuter triangles, UFOs, how the Mayans invented television, that kind of thing?

627
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,080
I don't read them books.

628
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,340
Well, the way I see it, it's exactly the same.

629
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine.

630
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,340
People get so hung up on specifics, they miss out on seeing the whole thing.

631
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,000
Take South America, for example.

632
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:18,500
In South America, thousands of people go missing every year.

633
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,340
Nobody knows where they go.

634
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,760
It's just like disappear.

635
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,100
But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something.

636
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,780
There had to be a time when there was no people, right?

637
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,360
Yeah, I guess.

638
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,680
Well, where did all these people come from?

639
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,520
Hmm?

640
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,700
I'll tell you where.

641
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,380
The future.

642
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,180
Where did all these people disappear to?

643
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,620
Hmm?

644
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:49,980
The past.

645
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,800
That's right.

646
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,440
And how'd they get there?

647
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,080
Flying saucers.

648
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,320
Which are really...

649
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,600
Yeah, you got it.

650
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,240
Time machines.

651
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

652
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,840
But that's the way religion is.

653
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,480
It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

654
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,600
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime

655
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,840
was the first man to pick up a stick and hit his brother.

656
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,960
Offer void.

657
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,160
We've been programmed.

658
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,780
Offer void. We're prohibited.

659
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,100
This is the very beginning.

660
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,940
Our slack was taken away the moment we entered this world-weary treadmill.

661
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,820
And we've been running like little rats through a maze.

662
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,640
And the only way you can get away from that is to deprogram.

663
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,520
Edit your own memory.

664
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,880
Take those bad memories.

665
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,240
Take those horrible training regimens that you were subjected to as a youth.

666
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,040
Flush them down the toilet as you excremeditate.

667
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,720
Let me ask you.

668
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:51,980
Yes, sister.

669
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,740
Let me ask you.

670
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,300
Yes, sister.

671
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,740
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

672
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,320
I ate my guinea pigs.

673
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,140
I grew them and I ate them.

674
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,400
That's dick crazed, Bob.

675
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:01,740
They were food.

676
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,360
I'm a carnivore.

677
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,740
I can't help them right now.

678
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,880
My kids need slack poop.

679
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,760
Those are so difficult to live with.

680
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,380
Doctor, doctor, here.

681
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,860
You know, I'm a little bit scared.

682
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:12,860


683
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:12,960
I think I'm going to get my son.

684
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,020
How are you?

685
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,500
So, uh, I was walking, I was, I was walking down the beach.

686
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,200
Trying to get to my woody where I had my, had my son's coat and my buds was gold.

687
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,180
I was going to get high and get real drunk.

688
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,020
Lay in the sand.

689
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,980
With my beach buddy.

690
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,880
With my, my beach buddy.

691
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,860
I took, I took a side, I, I took a side of the beach.

692
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,860


693
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,860


694
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,860


695
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,860


696
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:42,860


697
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:52,000
of my eye, I saw the ultimate wave, the super wave. It was the most stoked out stud wave

698
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:01,680
in all reality. It was 900 feet tall. And on the backside of reality too, I saw a black

699
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:11,580
hole right in the middle of it. A vortex. I was ready to shoot through that black hole.

700
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,660
And my molecules rearranged. I'm gonna hang five as I shoot through the black hole of

701
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:26,460
the vortex of the super wave. The most god awful wave in reality. On the backside of

702
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,520
reality. The front side and the left and the right side.

703
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,100
Oh, two.

704
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,220
I was fixing to cut out.

705
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,820
And then.

706
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,280
And then.

707
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,300
A giant.

708
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,720
It was Whatchamacallit.

709
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,760
It was one of those Whatchamacallits.

710
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:27,740
It was like a vortex funnel sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean. I was getting

711
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:41,840
sucked down. And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, it felt pretty good. It felt

712
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,660
pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

713
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,600
But God, I hate to admit it. But God, I hate to admit it. Whew. It felt pretty good. But

714
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,880
I hate to admit it.

715
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,740
Moving on down on the backside of reality. My battle with my son. Riding the wave and stoking

716
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,740
on my fine thing.

717
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,740
I'm gonna get you.

718
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,600
And I'm gonna get you.

719
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,100
Moving on down to the backside of reality. Riding on my fine thing and stoking on my fine

720
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,440
thing.

721
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,080
Ooh.

722
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,400
Ooh.

723
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,680
Ooh.

724
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,280
I don't know where you are at.

725
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm your son.

726
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,540
Mm-hmm.

727
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,240
Look!

728
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,060
I'm your son.

729
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:38,440
I am your son.

730
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,280
I am your child.

731
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


732
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


733
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


734
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


735
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


736
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


737
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


738
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:40,360


739
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,560
Moncho can really play the drums.

740
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,700
He was stuck down in this group thing.

741
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,160
He was laying down on the back side of reality on those tracks.

742
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,000
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?

743
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,120
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

744
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,720
We play it every week.

745
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,820
It goes back to our acid days.

746
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,160
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

747
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,860
The Swingin' Love Courses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

748
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,220
Yeah, we don't really like to brag about it.

749
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,420
We don't really advocate the use of magic quantities of LSD.

750
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,040
But I thought that you condoned contracted consciousness.

751
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,820
We condone contracted consciousness.

752
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,060
Yeah.

753
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,660
Expanded consciousness.

754
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,600
Well, so some of your music actually has been LSD influenced.

755
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,740
What is the similarity here?

756
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,480
I'm reminded of the 60s garage band.

757
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,640
Just like LSD.

758
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:56,320
Lollipop sugar donuts.

759
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,140
Mushroom mountains appearing from the sky.

760
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:05,000
Keep an eye on high doses of sugar.

761
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,040
And we called it LSD just to cut it in two.

762
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,260
And you would have visions.

763
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,300
What happened was this nebulous cloud.

764
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,240
Back side of reality.

765
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,520
This big old giant nebulous cloud would fly over.

766
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,080
You would actually drive the curl into the back, into the vortex.

767
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,400
Right.

768
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,160
Just like the mountain.

769
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,400
Oh, this is my favorite.

770
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,900
This is beautiful.

771
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,580
This is great break dance music.

772
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,960
I saw that when you had that whole football field full of break dancers.

773
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,020
You had the Australian trumps.

774
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:36,660
I saw that.

775
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,300
Crazy practically.

776
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,900
We had over 750 break dancers didn't work.

777
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,660
Breakdancers would start early, or I hope not.

778
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,880
But shooting was ridiculous.

779
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:47,940
Yes.

780
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,760
Des Iz

781
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,320
With frap,

782
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:13,380
Bob gives his most insanely courageous warriors, the Brotherhood of Bob, brief glimpses of the

783
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:20,780
before life, the pleasure dimension foretold by the prophet Janer. And it fortifies them in their

784
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:27,980
acts of terminal mercy. It steals the nerves and frees the wills of his chosen instruments of death

785
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,520
and eternal slack. Slack squad missionary Poonflang Damarung spoke lovingly of it in

786
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:42,560
Economicon 714 before his immortal last mission in a testimonial to his Lord Bob's ways.

787
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:50,200
Yes, Poonflang said, Bob shares of his own pipe with us before each foray into the belly of the

788
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:58,000
beast. It gives us the knowledge of our true will and how it is juxtaposed with Bob's. We all grip

789
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,060
each other by the shoulders and sidle together in a great circle as we chant together between

790
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,440
the holy dosages.

791
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:12,020
The dizzying frop fumes combine with the endless rhythmical repetitions to create a living vortex

792
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:19,300
power of unspeakable ecstasy. Kill, kill for the love of killing. Kill for the love of Kali. Kill,

793
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:26,600
kill for fun. Kill to be free. Kill like a man to make America great. While alcohol wantonly

794
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:32,580
destroys brain tissue, sloughing it off to be passed in the morning as the wasted dead ravages

795
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,220
of wine.

796
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:42,020
The frop does not kill brain cells, nay nay, but mutates them, causes them to multiply faster.

797
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:51,080
Each succeeding generation is of course stronger than those before it. Man made booze, Bob made

798
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,900
frop. Who do you trust?

799
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:01,840
Frop enables one to see with the eyes closed. This is known as the unblinking stare of the

800
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,480
over-lid.

801
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,020
Through it, one may pass through the gates of the frop lord into the frop city of the

802
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,360
soul.

803
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,700
Once the seeker has reached bardo 18 of the 18th hole of hanger 18 of Zombo Fropland, he

804
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,920
may think the same thought over and over and over and over and over and yet never care,

805
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,500
never feel boredom.

806
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:25,940
The frop entered through the forehead and exited through the upper back of the neck.

807
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,180
The possessing demon was exercised instantly and the president, if not his brain or the

808
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,460
governor's, was set free.

809
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:32,720
The frop is the only one who can be saved.

810
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,580
This, my friends, is frop.

811
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,160
But whether you're a frop head or not, the true subgenius forces the body to stand upright

812
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,440
where it can see further.

813
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,700
He shows authority over the drug fiend which houses the brain.

814
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,080
Our rightful place has been usurped by our own bodies and we want to see the man in charge.

815
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,060
And it's Bob!

816
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,680
Bob is the true mind storm, my friends.

817
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,440
The god of frop.

818
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,420
The godly lobe explosion in your skull.

819
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,080
Who needs dope?

820
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,060
You never come down from the high of Bob.

821
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,080
Bob is the drug, friends.

822
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,280
The conspiracy is the real drug that drugs you, that makes you want to go to sleep or

823
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,580
to kick ass for no reason.

824
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,140
Bob is the drug that makes you kick ass where it counts.

825
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,620
The drug of remembering who you are.

826
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,040
The drug that wakes you up.

827
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,420
The drug that makes you die.

828
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,160
The drug that makes you see or leaves you be.

829
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,320
Praise Bob!

830
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,700
Help me somebody.

831
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,940
She ain't got no legs.

832
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,100
My legs are on fire.

833
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,820
Pull the lever, down you go.

this is a song by the Dogmatics called

867

Why Must I Be a Teenager on Drugs?

868
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,100
Been a useless banana head all of my days.

869
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,940
Been my life in a drug and game cave.

870
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,180
Pick my head and eat all the bugs.

871
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,680
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

872
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,540
Why must I be a teenager on drugs?

873
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,940
If I don't cut the shit, it's black and sick.

874
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,060
I'm gonna spend my life doing PCP.

875

876

00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,740
Don't get no results, I'm gonna go wait.

887
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm gonna get my money back.

888
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,300
I'm gonna get my money back.

889
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,940
I'm gonna get my money back.

890
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,800
Hey, let me tell you about my new coat.

891
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,400
X-line, mate.

892
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:13,940
Maybe two bucks.

893
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,980
These vicious junkies and...

894
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,000
Bob loves you.

895
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,060
Bob loves you.

896
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,160
Bob loves you.

897
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,160
Bob loves you.

898
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,920
Bob loves you.

899
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,080
Bob loves you.

900
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,980
Bob loves you.

901
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,560
Bob loves you.

902
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,440
Bob loves you.

903
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:35,800
Bob loves you.

904
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,300
Bob loves you.

905
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,120
Bob loves you.

906
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,300


907
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,260
Bob loves you.

908
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,280
Bob loves you.

909
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,560
Bob loves you.

910
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,560


911
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,580
Bob loves you.

912
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:39,580


913
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:39,580


914
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:39,700
Bob loves you.

915
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,700


916
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,880
Bob loves you.

917
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,240
Bob loves you.

918
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,240


919
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,340
Bob loves you.

920
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,340
Bob loves you.

921
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,440
Bob loves you.

922
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:42,780
Bob loves you.

923
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,220
God loves you.

924
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:15,460
And if you can just get your mind together

925
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,580
Then come on across to me

926
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,040
We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sunrise

927
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,980
From the bottom of the sea

928
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,660
But first, are you experienced?

929
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
Or have you ever been experienced?

930
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,800
Well, I have

931
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,500
ligt's keep it tubes

932
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,520
Your eyes are cheers

933
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,660
And only your eyes listen

934
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,240
Well, I have

935
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,860
While I listen

936
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,600
Your olhos are

937
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,020
Your eyes are

938
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,460
I can see...

939
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,020
Here lipstick?

940
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,020


941
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,380
And you can just get to mind each other

942
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,240
And come along with me

943
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,260
No hand to watch the sunrise

944
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,020
From the bottom of the sea

945
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,560
But girl, girl, are you on the next field?

946
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,120
Well, have you ever been an explorer?

947
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:13,800
Well, have you ever been an explorer?

948
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,460
A light from the sky settled over them trees

949
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,460
It left this wire in my head that customized me

950
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,600
The wire in my head, it advises me

951
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,200
Better living through bio-circuitry

952
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,900
The wire in my head has found me new friends

953
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:17,080
We meet at the airport where the old freeway ends

954
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,180
And we lay down our lives for the power it sends

955
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:32,120
I got a wire in my head and so do my friends

956
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,060
The wire, a big business opportunity

957
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,820
The wire benefits me financially

958
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:55,000
The wire in my head gets me good deals

959
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:02,080
I drive a real solid car and I eat fancy meals

960
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,680
You can bet I'd kill any sucker who squeals

961
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,880
I got a wire in my head and I like how it feels

962
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:25,100
I got a wire for your head and I'd install it for free

963
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,380
Better living through surgery

964
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,260
I got a wire in my head

965
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,840
I got a wire in my head and I like how it feels

966
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:44,920
I got a wire in my head and I like how it feels

967
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,120
Squeal and you're dead

968
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:50,540
Squeal and you're dead

969
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,660
Squeal and you're dead

970
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,480
Squeal and you're dead

971
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:56,480


972
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,720
Squeal and you're dead

973
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,840
Squeal and you're dead

974
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,480
Squeal and you're dead

975
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:06,480


976
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,020
Oh yes dear friends that was Wire Head Conspiracy

977
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:14,500
by Reverend Buck Naked

978
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,540
and that's on Paris Records

979
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,440
Yes Paris Records presents

980
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,720
presents Made Up in Texas, Wirehead Conspiracy.

981
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,760
You can pick that one up here and there.

982
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,720
Oh, yes, dear friends.

983
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,820
You know, time is running out.

984
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,840
It's so sad that time has to run out on the hour of slack.

985
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,860
You only get that hour of slack a week, and it is a shame.

986
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,520
But Ron Lindsey will be up next with Soul Oldie, so stay tuned.

987
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:58,520
Now, I didn't get time this week to play part three of the subgenius, quote, anti-drug special, unquote, which is the incredible.

988
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,500
It's actually a replay of hour of slack number six.

989
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:08,840
We'll be playing the replay of the best section of hour of slack number six starring G. Gordon Gordon.

990
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,500
As we discuss the preparation and use of normal slack.

991
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,420
As a consciousness contraction device.

992
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,840
Oh, yes.

993
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,240
I was supposed to read.

994
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,760
Somebody's trying to get in down there.

995
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,020
So I was supposed to read a public service announcement about the showing of true stories.

996
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,880
David Byrne's movie.

997
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,200
But I was also instructed not to do slander and libel.

998
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,100
So I'd better not talk about David Byrne because I'm sure that's what it would turn into.

999
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,500
You can ask my good friend.

1000
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,520
Puzzling evidence.

1001
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,280
Just why?

1002
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,160
But we won't go into that anymore.

1003
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:58,600
So, friends, if you need to write to Bob to have your soul saved to get some slack.

1004
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,080
Why?

1005
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,780
That number.

1006
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,000
Get that pen ready.

1007
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,560
Write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1008
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,560
Dallas, Texas.

1009
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,780
Not necessary.

1010
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,060
Beautiful.

1011
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,840
But you take to me.

1012
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:20,940


1013
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,040
Yeah.

1014
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,220
I

1015
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:26,680
love you.

1016
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:26,900
.
