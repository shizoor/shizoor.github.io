1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm close to being brought under control.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,780
The past is bleak since four.

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:20,520
In South Dakota, firefighters say prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, called symptomatic of reluctance to join in global ecstasy, gained one point.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,940
They're ready to explain that claim of information situation investigation.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,600
The White House says this is PR News.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,260
PR News, Washington.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:37,120
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has canceled South America for eight days after state lawmakers failed to break Pennsylvania.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,140
Congressional Democrats are set to resume PR News in Washington.

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,320
PR News.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,100
This is Bob speaking to you from the central control room.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,260
There we go.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,580
Now an incredible story of the world's most powerful...

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:57,940
...beyond.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,840
I woke up with the sun in my eyes and I saw a figure moving.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,340
Do you want all this trash?

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,520
What trash?

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,680
These papers in your pockets and a note.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,740
What does it say?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,840
I'm not surprised you can't read this morning. I'm surprised you're breathing this morning.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,920
No, no, please Marge.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,960
All right. It says...

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,300
The Self Genius Power of Splash.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,400
Now, darling, you mustn't be depressed. It's not your fault.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,180
The world doesn't understand creative artists anymore.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,760
But what will we tell the children, dear?

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,100
Say, would you like to have a drink?

27
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,720
But first, hear this.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
Wheaties presents...

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,320
X-Day.

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,540
X-Day.

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,660
Exciting half hour.

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,780
I'm thinking of a girl, very attractive too.

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,540
A young girl with, a young girl with at least a high school diploma.

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,760
She'll never regret it. And neither will you.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,660
X-Day.

36
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,520
Keep an appointment with doom.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh, Henry, what is it this time?

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,820
Oh, some more of that flying sphere nonsense.

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,100
Six inch, six inch.

40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,960
Henry, your staff?

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

42
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,500
The world of adult reality.

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,460
That's funny.

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,280
Oh, Henry.

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,720
X-Day.

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,280
We'll continue in just a moment.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,340
Here is the champion.

48
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,220
Now, young man, will you tell us what you do for a living?

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,820
I pitch.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,320
You what?

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,640
Pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch.

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,020
I pitch.

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,960
Oh, yes, yes, I see.

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,020
What is your name, young man?

55
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,640
I'm Bob. And you know it as well as I do.

56
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,640
Sure I do, Bob. It's good to see you.

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Tell me, Bob, how long have you been eating Wheaties?

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,300
Oh, about 20 years, give or take a couple.

59
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,920
What's so strange about that? Milk and fruit.

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,980
You're right as rain, Bob.

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,060
No champ ever said a truer word about Bob.

62
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,360
Breakfast of champions.

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,120
No respect.

64
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,100
First the dog, now this.

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,600
A little six inch, a little six inch.

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:45,940
Well?

67
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,320
Hello, hello. I'll wait for you in the rear.

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,340
Shut up, shut up. Must be going out of my mind.

69
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,240
Must be going out of my mind.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,940
Shut up, shut up.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,580
I'm having hallucinations. I've got to get out of here.

72
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,900
We have weapons of destruction.

73
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,640
My people will have prepared something quite shocking.

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,180
Poor chap is obviously suffering from delusion.

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,300
Well, he's not the only one in Washington today.

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,180
You know, we've been getting a whole string of crack-ups lately.

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,940
Bigwigs blowing their tops under pressure.

78
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,780
Say, say, say, say.

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,360
Feel good all morning long.

80
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,260
Officially, weird force from government laboratory.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,460
Control.

82
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,900
Yes, wild travel to another planet may seem highly imaginative to us today.

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,180
In the year 2000,

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,320
it may be commonplace.

85
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
Watch out, we're going crash!

86
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,260
What is it, buddy? What is it, buddy?

87
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,380
Well, that's strange.

88
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
Border patrol. Border patrol.

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,300
1938. 1938.

90
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,400
1938.

91
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,900
500 years.

92
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,920
To be my own great-grandfather.

93
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,560
Look into that instrument.

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Look into it.

95
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,240
Men robbed of all willpower.

96
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,020
It was stupidity. It was stupidity.

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,740
A means of radio.

98
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,600
What was that?

99
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,620
I don't know.

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
Hand me that gun.

101
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,760
Give it to me.

102
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,060
Why, yes, we came here to make a treaty.

103
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,620
It would be useless to explain to me.

104
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,440
I am only a soldier acting under order.

105
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,620
Is it true that you are revolutionary?

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
That in this age of science,

107
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,860
we cannot hope to isolate ourselves from the rest of the universe.

108
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,980
May I look, sir?

109
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, why, of course.

110
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,080
Get through the telebi.

111
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,100
This is incredible.

112
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,360
I don't understand.

113
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,360
Oh, I see.

114
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,640
Let me speak to the leader.

115
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,640
Calling the leader.

116
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,280
Calling the leader.

117
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,180
I didn't understand.

118
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,980
When Miss Helm is in place,

119
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,700
you'll never thank her or speak again.

120
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,840
Man the ray gun.

121
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,040
Don't try to switch.

122
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
I can fix that.

123
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,620
Okay, buddy.

124
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,980
You can come out any time you want now.

125
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,460
There's no time to lose.

126
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
What does this mean?

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,020
Now!

128
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,680
Now!

129
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,700
The police decide to use the clean room.

130
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,520
Most of these people probably won't live to see the end of this tape.

131
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,900
Never, never, never.

132
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,160
Never, never.

133
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,740
No, never.

134
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,760
Never, never, never.

135
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,640
Never again.

136
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,260
Never again.

137
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,680
Never.

138
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


139
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


143
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


147
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


148
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


149
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:53,680


150
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,000
You're reaching right now, Bob.

151
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,720
I've been down to the church, standing in the dark, watching Douglas.

152
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,600
Priests have their knives.

153
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,460
Too late!

154
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes! It's the curse!

155
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,740
This is too much.

156
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,560
I, a doctor, a man of science, have no right to...

157
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,380
This is too much.

158
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:08,840
This is too much.

159
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,520
This is too much.

160
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,980
I hope they come back.

161
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,920
That was last year.

162
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,120
I waited a long time and I'm still here.

163
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,280
I know the people in Sherman and Buffalo and Cleveland.

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,540
I said, are you Michigan fucks?

165
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,840
I'd rather like your stomach.

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm a fucker.

167
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,880
Mr. Harold.

168
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,020
I love you, Mr. Harold.

169
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
Short lived experience.

170
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,500
Too many people crowded on the same vessel.

171
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Too many people crying out the same things.

172
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,540
This isn't the way I had it planned.

173
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,780
This isn't what I paid my money for.

174
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm not ready to take a shower.

175
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,820
I'm not ready to...

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,260
This isn't it.

177
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
This is what I paid for in my shit quelque chose à faire.

178
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,200


179
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,200


180
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,220


181
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,220


182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,400
But I thought it was a good idea to leave it like that.

183
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,880
So I said sure, gotta Inform Song, Time has слишком late.

184
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,820
I got it.

185
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:15,860
I got it.

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,060
Keep that up.

187
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,600
So now it's X-Day in 2017

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,900
Stang is long in the tooth but clean and mean

189
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,740
He counts his money while the fools come and go

190
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,820
Expecting an apocalypse

191
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,500
guitar solo

192
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,680
guitar solo

193
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
guitar solo

194
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,060
guitar solo

195
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,160
guitar solo

196
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,760
guitar solo

197
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,680
guitar solo

198
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,380
guitar solo

199
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,380


200
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,380


201
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,380


202
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,380


203
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,360
And I look back

204
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,020
So fondly I might add

205
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,360
All the friends I made, the acquaintance I might have had

206
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
I wonder if there's something missing, maybe it's part of my life

207
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,440
Maybe it's part of my brain

208
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,100
They been doing a lot of digging, probing

209
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,580
They say it's to keep me sane

210
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
They wonder if I

211
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,920
Packed up my gear

212
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,960
And if I stuck my toothbrush in my bag of beer

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,100
And if I have everything ready

214
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,080
So there's no drip drip stains

215
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,560
When I start bleeding all over this fucking place again

216
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,540
guitar solo

217
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,740
guitar solo

218
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,040
guitar solo

219
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,100
guitar solo

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
guitar solo

221
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,680
guitar solo

222
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,840
guitar solo

223
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,240
guitar solo

224
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,940
guitar solo

225
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,680
guitar solo

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,680


227
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,680


228
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:08,840
guitar solo

229
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,080
guitar solo

230
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,080


231
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
recommends

232
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:22,560
Thank you.

233
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,240
We just made that up.

234
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,680
And that's why we was the last band,

235
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,880
because we sucked them off,

236
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,120
but we could make songs up as we go along.

237
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,260
Anybody like to have a theme they like to have expressed?

238
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,120
Uh, yeah, I've got a theme for you, dear friends.

239
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,460
A Lonesome Cowboy Dave really did make that up on the spot.

240
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,860
So did the rest of the band.

241
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,660
I ain't kidding you.

242
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,920
That was Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band

243
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,360
live at 10X Day, recorded about a week ago,

244
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,540
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave singing.

245
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,820
And I expect him to call in any minute.

246
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,840
Reverend Angry Larry on bass guitar,

247
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
making it up as he goes along.

248
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,180
He's also playing in the background,

249
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,500
with Senator Thompson Speck on drums,

250
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,140
in this Amino Acids live at X Day,

251
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,840
which is running behind me.

252
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,120
And with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

253
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,660
there was also the beautiful Princess Wee

254
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,220
on flute and vocals.

255
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,440
Well, no, I guess she wasn't on vocals on that one.

256
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,520
We got surprisingly good recordings of some of the bands,

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,120
and some of the bands were surprisingly good at 10X Day.

258
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,440
Oh, before that song, we heard some old Media Barrage cuts,

259
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,180
but also new titles, intro, and X Day collages

260
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,520
by Leemur, Fernando Nendi Leemur, and...

261
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,680
Norell Preff.

262
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,940
I have to keep my eye on the phone button here.

263
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,540
In case Dave calls, I'm all by myself, friends.

264
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,980
But that's okay, because I can use a little bit of privacy

265
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,440
after 10X Day, yes, the 10th annual Migration.

266
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,020
And to the breeding grounds of the subgeniuses.

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,180
And the subgeniuses bred true.

268
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,840
That's about all they did.

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,700
They bred true.

270
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,460
They did a lot of breeding and mating.

271
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,300
We saw many new relationships flare up.

272
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,360
That's always so romantic.

273
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,240
But the X's, the men from Planet X

274
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,520
that we were expecting to come and rescue us

275
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
from outer space for 30 bucks,

276
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,860
well, they were a no-show.

277
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,460
It's happened before.

278
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,700
Sigh.

279
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,440
Sigh.

280
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,440


281
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,440


282
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,440


283
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,460
And I just came into the studio tonight

284
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,300
because there is lots of news,

285
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,000
although most of it's not very urgent now,

286
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,080
now that the X's didn't come.

287
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,820
Although, you know, they always take part of...

288
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,840
They didn't take us up into the saucers,

289
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
but they take parts of us.

290
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,820
They took a lot out of me this time.

291
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,480
They always do.

292
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,780
This time they took more of my hearing

293
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,820
and more memories.

294
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
Although they left me...

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,100
They left me with some new horrible memories

296
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,660
that I wish I could get rid of.

297
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,500
The worst is the memory of what Reverend Magdalene lost.

298
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
She actually lost the most

299
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,360
because, friends, I hate to inform you,

300
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,420
if you're familiar with the subgenius child custody case,

301
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,340
Reverend Magdalene lost in the appellate court

302
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,000
that was announced last Friday.

303
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,400
The three new judges gave...

304
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,120
her ex full custody of the kid.

305
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,320
And the main reason is because

306
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,400
she had pictures of Bob around her house.

307
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Friends, you...

308
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,760
Who's next?

309
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,720
Alfred E. Newman?

310
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Is it going to be to where you aren't a fit parent

311
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,960
if you have pictures of Alfred E. Newman around?

312
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,840
Because, you know, that mad magazine that he represents

313
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,580
makes fun of serious subjects like, you know, the president.

314
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,040
And I guess the subgenius material

315
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,200
makes serious fun of false prophets.

316
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,980
But there's a lot of people that love their false prophets

317
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,860
and they don't want any child raised by a skeptical person

318
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,060
or something.

319
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,320
Or a fun-loving person, I guess.

320
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,740
I don't know.

321
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,780
We learn more about how that guy has managed

322
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,300
to get away with so much.

323
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,540
The ex.

324
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,360
And I was sickened.

325
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,260
It's really...

326
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,420
pretty horrifying.

327
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,600
But there was good news from Ex Day,

328
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,200
number 10,

329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,740
because we recorded three or four hours of Slack

330
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,460
with Dr. Howell, our special guest,

331
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,160
and with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

332
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,900
and Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
who showed up at Ex Day,

334
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,280
and various other artistes

335
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,500
who got up on Tarzan's radio station on stage.

336
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,460
And you'll be hearing those shows pretty much uncut

337
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,700
as well as Ask Dr. Howell in the coming weeks.

338
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,380
But what I was going to play tonight,

339
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,820
especially if Dave doesn't call,

340
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,840
is music from Ex Day.

341
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,360
Sometimes the recordings are a bit rough,

342
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,060
and sometimes you can almost tell

343
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,320
that they're making it up as they go along.

344
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,300
Ironically, subgeniuses are better

345
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,380
at making us jamming improvisationally

346
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,700
than playing something they supposedly have rehearsed,

347
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,580
as Lonesome Cowboy Dave's set certainly proved.

348
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,560
But you see, here's the way it works.

349
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,520
In Dobbstown, when you're a young subgenius student

350
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,920
and you're recruited and you go off to Dobbstown in Malaysia,

351
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,260
the overmen teach you how to function under panic situations.

352
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,040
You are taught to make up songs or poems or rants,

353
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
and they have to be good, on the spot,

354
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,240
while you're being used, shall we say,

355
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,560
by the overmen.

356
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,140
By overmen or high priests.

357
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
And you have to be funny or die.

358
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,580
And you have to be sort of hitting the note,

359
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,180
even though you don't know what note the next guy's going to give.

360
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,200
You are taught to have this sort of intuition.

361
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,020
And we'll be playing some examples of that

362
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,240
from Five-Fisted Tales of Connie,

363
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,580
which is the Ex Day jam band.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Oh, I think I see the phone.

365
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,920
Now let's see what happens if I start...

366
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll start to push...

367
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,180
I'll push buttons here.

368
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,200
Do we hear any...

369
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,460
Any at all?

370
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,480
I knew there was a Dave out there.

371
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,560
An aimless Dave.

372
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,900
I've been pointing it, but I can't find the target.

373
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
The Daves of our lives.

374
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,600
I'm glad you made it.

375
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,640
I kind of made it.

376
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,060
I was just thinking about something.

377
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,380
You know your Reverend Angry Larry there of the aminic acids?

378
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,440
Yeah, heard in the background.

379
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,200
Oh.

380
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,940
Well, he's kind of tuning up, but that's okay.

381
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,940
I'm psychic.

382
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,580
Yeah.

383
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:41,900
It's...

384
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,380
Yeah.

385
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,020
Does that name come from the restructuring of the Stooges?

386
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,840
Reverend Angry Larry?

387
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,360
Yeah.

388
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,240
No.

389
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,980
He has explained to me that all the people question him

390
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,100
because, you know, to look at him,

391
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,440
he doesn't look very angry most of the time.

392
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,360
And he doesn't look like Larry either, you know.

393
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:58,800
No.

394
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,220
But he is rather...

395
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,380
The whole amino acids thing is very Stooge-oriented and inspired.

396
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,340
But he says he lets his anger loose when he gets on stage,

397
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,360
when he plays that game.

398
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,020
He's a good guitarist.

399
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,860
He's a good guitarist.

400
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:13,860


401
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,780
I barely made it...

402
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,100
I was just wondering who plays the maudlin's overly sympathetic,

403
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,700
caring, loving maul?

404
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,340
And who plays the introspective Curly?

405
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:34,340
Oh, I don't know because the amino acids changed personnel

406
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,780
and you can't tell because of their insectile faces.

407
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,980
You know what I'm saying?

408
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,540
So I can't answer your question.

409
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,340
But I think...

410
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,380
I think it may be Johnny Depp on the theremin now.

411
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,620
And what's that actress's name?

412
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,720
Scarlett O'Hara?

413
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,780
No, Scarlett Johansson.

414
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,440
Oh, yeah.

415
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,000
On the bass.

416
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,000
On the bass.

417
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,440
Yeah.

418
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,920
Senator Thompson Speck is always on drums.

419
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,680
I think that's how it's working.

420
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,000
He's pounding away.

421
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah.

422
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,400
So, yeah, I barely made it into the station myself, Dave.

423
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,100
My car is sort of like yours.

424
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,800
A last minute decision?

425
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,960
It's a good thing that was all downhill from Cleveland Heights to the station.

426
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,940
Let me put it that way.

427
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,380
You rolled in a barrel.

428
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,880
Yeah, I don't know how I'm going to get back.

429
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh, you're saying your car was arguing with you like Angry Larry?

430
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,680
Yeah.

431
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,780
Yeah, but we'll fix it.

432
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,540
Princess We couldn't be here because she's busy planting starwood,

433
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,340
which starts up in a couple of weeks.

434
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,380
And we both are very densely involved in that self-same thing.

435
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,380
What would you call that?

436
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:53,700
A love in, a knowledge out, health out, sickness in, a cool out, man.

437
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,300
Yeah.

438
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,380
No, that's not what you call it at all.

439
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,980
You call it a total and complete nervous mental breakdown.

440
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,380
Starwood?

441
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,120
Yeah.

442
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,660
Well, for some people, maybe.

443
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,760
For me, it's relaxation after the nervous breakdown of running X day.

444
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,320
And the disappointment, of course, is not having the saucers pick us up.

445
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,860
You know, I saw them, as usual.

446
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,740
I saw hundreds.

447
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,660
And every time I point, subgeniuses just did not seem to be concerned

448
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,280
that there were alien craft hovering above the place.

449
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,200
Well, that happened last year.

450
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,000
We didn't see the spaceships until we looked at the video almost a year later.

451
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,020
Yeah, but they're always there.

452
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,360
And I'm always pointing them out to people.

453
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,060
And they go, you know.

454
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh, you see them.

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,320
Sure, you.

456
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,460
Well, they're obvious.

457
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,620
Maybe you.

458
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,180
Anyone should see them.

459
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,320
Some of us subgeniuses are mayhem.

460
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,500
They're made to where we can't see the UFOs.

461
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,780
And I'm one of those.

462
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,960
With a third nostril, you should be able at least to smell their presence.

463
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,780
And sometimes the presents are stinky indeed.

464
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,820
Like I say, I always look at the video.

465
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,900
And that's when I finally see them.

466
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,120
A creature, an ocular creature, an eyeball man.

467
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,520
I've got to put that on YouTube.

468
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,840
There's a bunch of, I have footage of an X, of a flying saucer.

469
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,600
Well, a light in the sky over Brushwood last year.

470
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,720
And there are YouTube videos.

471
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,600
Videos now of this X-Day that Mr.

472
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,340
Mr.

473
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Sistar put up.

474
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,000
If you're a YouTube.

475
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,160
You saw one also then, right?

476
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
If you're a YouTube-y kind of guy.

477
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,420
No, these weren't videos of X-Days.

478
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,560
These were videos of, I mean, of saucers.

479
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,460
This was of breastages and bands, which is really what I guess when it comes down to,

480
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,900
that's what the festival's all about.

481
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,920
When Bob doesn't arrive and the saucers don't arrive, what else is there but bands and breastages and food?

482
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,020
Did you ever think that?

483
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,900
That perhaps Bob might have been lied to back in the day?

484
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,800
And that he doesn't recognize that there are aliens among us who are screwing up sound systems

485
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,200
or causing electrical problems near the tub spa?

486
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,680
Well, we know all that.

487
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,260
Or the toilets to overflow and begin arguing with the natives?

488
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,640
That's standard procedure.

489
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,880
That's the way it's always been.

490
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Those aren't aliens.

491
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
Those are gremlins, Dave.

492
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,280
No, but the aliens...

493
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Or demons from hell.

494
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,180
Well...

495
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,900
But it's not...

496
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,680
I kept my aliens from outer space.

497
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,120
Are you superstitious or something?

498
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,540
Well, I'm asking you...

499
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:16,880
They're just...

500
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,740
It's Satan-inspired imps, dude.

501
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,280
That's all.

502
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,360
God, some people believe anything.

503
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm saying that the Xs are alien-inspired demonic imps.

504
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,460
And they know, but they come there, and they're not really there to pick people up.

505
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,540
They're there to personally destroy them, either psychically, psychologically, emotionally, physically.

506
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,940
Well, they did me in pretty well.

507
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,220
And you're not looking so good yourself.

508
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,780
So I'd say they're getting...

509
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,360
They're getting our health.

510
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,560
Parts of our wallets.

511
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,780
They're sucking our health.

512
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,280
They're stealing our identities.

513
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,220
I don't even know if this is really me talking.

514
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,460
For all I know, I'm mind-controlled by some puppet master alien thing.

515
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,080
Yeah.

516
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,860
You may have indeed gone through the whole mill three or four times, and you may have just a vestige of a personality left, and you think it's still you.

517
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:09,900
Meanwhile, you're going to the wrong bus stops, talking to the wrong people at the wrong stores, and, you know, claiming to know them, and you don't.

518
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,480
Well, that's the fear.

519
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,380
Every X-Day.

520
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:22,420
That, in fact, the world has ended, but we're in such deep denial that we're still walking through the rubble thinking we're walking to the bus stop.

521
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:34,860
And we're sitting in a destroyed office building at a destroyed desk, thinking we're in our nice air-conditioned office and desk.

522
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,840
Now, to me, that makes more sense than the Upanishads.

523
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,600
That makes more sense than the Vedas or the Bible.

524
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
That makes more sense than the Holy Quran.

525
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,280
That's not saying much today.

526
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,940
That makes more sense than any holy book ever written or spoke or thought of.

527
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,800
Yeah.

528
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,860
Yeah, that's really—wow, gosh, I'm real impressed.

529
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,140
It makes more sense than those holy books.

530
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,480
No, it clicks.

531
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
It clicks.

532
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,640
It makes everything snap together so neatly.

533
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:11,760
Well, I don't feel like I'm on my escape vessel, and since we didn't get the saucers or X-Day, we tend to sit around reliving the next best thing, which is the drill for X-Day.

534
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


535
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


536
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


537
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


538
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


539
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


540
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


541
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:11,760


542
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:18,000
Soaking in the photos and the audio and the video, which you guys can all see on alt.slack or YouTube.

543
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,620
If you have an internet.

544
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:31,000
Some of them are so flaccid, the day's activities consisting entirely of watching the replays of the replays of the replays of the reenactments.

545
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,700
Well, that's essentially what I do, but I'm the person who sells the replays of the reenactments.

546
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,220
Yeah.

547
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,240
I have a vested interest.

548
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,740
And there's some cute galleys.

549
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,020
There's some cute galleys there.

550
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,720
You know, that keeps my interest up.

551
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,400
It makes you in a lot better mood when you have to sit at a swag table at 93 degrees.

552
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,640
No, I mean, we do make other people do that, but soon we've turned over a new leaf.

553
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,180
We're going to make everybody sit in the swag shack in the 90-degree heat from now on.

554
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,160
Yeah, and then everybody will have to wear the missionary hats and assume the missionary pose.

555
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,720
Oh, they do that anyway, but they don't want to work while they're doing it, see?

556
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,320
And we're going to make everybody who comes to X-Day work for an hour instead of having—

557
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,740
Poor old me.

558
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,120
Poor old me.

559
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,900
We're going to make everybody who comes to X-Day work for an hour instead of having—

560
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:13,900


561
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,440
We're going to make everybody who comes to X-Day work for 99 hours straight and no overtime.

562
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,480
Actually, I got repaid wonderfully in slack and presence and good recordings, actually, afterwards.

563
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,780
But once again, the recordings are not of human beings.

564
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,300
The recordings are of—

565
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,400
Bonobos.

566
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,520
There was Bonobo Convergence.

567
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,080
In fact, I have a killer instrumental by them coming up that I don't want to talk over.

568
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,300
Mm-hmm.

569
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,720
And probably—

570
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:49,660
Probably in about 15 minutes, I'm going to cut you off so that we can go back and listen to you singing on your songs.

571
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,400
And also so we can hear Reverend Pisces.

572
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,540
She and the Five-Fisted Tales of Connie cranked out a whole lot of automatic songs.

573
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:00,960
Well, okay.

574
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,040
How about if I just call you back in three or four hours?

575
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,520
No, no.

576
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,400
Let's not do that.

577
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,060
Let's just give it another 15 minutes, and that'll give me another 15 minutes at the end, and we'll be timed out.

578
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,860
Because time control is what it's all about, and yet that's somehow—

579
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,620
Did you notice everything at X-Day Festival happened backwards from the schedule?

580
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,520
Oh, of course I did.

581
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:31,360
That was the first thing I noticed, that the X-Day actual drill itself had been completed when I first got there on Monday morning.

582
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,820
First we cleaned up.

583
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,880
Then we made the mess.

584
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,160
Then we unpacked.

585
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,520
And yet somehow it all works.

586
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,420
Well—

587
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,600
There was some sort of integral flow involved in the whole thing,

588
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,700
but anybody who has the ability to stay way outside the fence and look down on them like an observational eye capsule thing

589
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,700
could understand that things were quickly, quickly, quickly going backwards.

590
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,220
And I don't know.

591
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,820
Right.

592
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,520
People would go to the bathroom, and then they would eat.

593
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,880
Well, I noticed people's—the size of their heads actually changed during, you know, different times in the day.

594
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,320
And I think when you're going linearly forward,

595
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,460
when you're going forward in time, in a linear, linear, linear, linear, linear direction,

596
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,060
you can't begin to tell—you can't notice, you don't notice that people's heads expand and contract throughout the day.

597
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,200
But in backwards time, you can.

598
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,060
I think little kids can see it.

599
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,140
Because their heads kind of go up and down.

600
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,120
When they first wake up, their heads are kind of small, and they swell during the day.

601
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,200
The babies, you know, the ones with the soft heads up to about, what, 16 or so?

602
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,180
Yeah, the ones born with pipes in.

603
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,500
Yeah.

604
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,280
And they have mouths as an aperture connected to the macular organ.

605
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,980
Well, did you see all the kids mating out there this year, though?

606
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,820
Some of them missed the mark and mated with animals.

607
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,260
But it was, you know, pretty successful, I think, for most of the X days in the past,

608
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,740
where we had mass mismatings and mismatchings.

609
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,600
That's true, because we spent one X day just doing divorces and counseling.

610
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
And crying people apart who hated each other.

611
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,760
We're actually having sexual things.

612
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,960
Well, that's probably what will happen next.

613
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,700
On 11 X day, we'll be counseling all the kids that became lovers at this X day.

614
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,760
And there really were some.

615
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,680
Did you know?

616
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
I don't know about the old people.

617
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,020
I don't know if the old people scored.

618
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,560
I was just wondering if you did counsel any of the grandchildren of the early subgena A.

619
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,280
Yes, I have, in fact.

620
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,780
Because it's hard for many of them.

621
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,380
It's hard for many of them to take with their brains oozing out like that.

622
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:49,760
And learning that they've lived in a cult, inside a cult for generations.

623
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,560
And it's all based on a lie or at least a false paradigm.

624
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,340
Well, they rebel, of course.

625
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,980
The kids that are raised by subgenius parents, first they go to a subgenius survivor's meeting

626
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,540
and find out that they've been abused by being shown photos of a smiling man with a face.

627
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,640
And told to chant.

628
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,780
His name for 24 hours straight.

629
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,200
Or lied to.

630
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,080
We don't call them lies.

631
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,100
We call it liturgy.

632
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,460
It's the doctrine.

633
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,280
It's the lies.

634
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:20,920
What do you mean?

635
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,020
It's the teachings of Bob.

636
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,740
From year to year.

637
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:32,960
And those darn damn things never coming and helping us out as they were planned and intended to.

638
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
It's depressing.

639
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,840
I don't know.

640
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,560
Well, I got over it myself a long time ago.

641
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,720
Of course you would.

642
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,500
You make my hands over 50 to these people with false doctrines.

643
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,560
Well, it's true.

644
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,000
Poor old Dr. Legume in 1998.

645
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,640
He came up to me after the festival was over going,

646
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,660
it's going to be kind of sad to hear that the church is going to close down now.

647
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,420
I said, what the hell are you talking about?

648
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,680
We're just now starting to make a buck off this thing.

649
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,300
What do you mean close down?

650
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,420
He goes, well, I had a vision on mushrooms.

651
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,420
Oh, God.

652
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,060
Yeah.

653
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,560
I think that was a.

654
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,280
Vision of somebody else's.

655
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,320
That's the problem with having a vision on mushrooms.

656
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,720
You may co-opt someone else's vision and view it as your own.

657
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,880
I thought I was going to the bathroom most of the time I was performing.

658
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,180
I thought I had gone up.

659
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,320
Dave, you were actually going to the bathroom and performing.

660
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,200
I thought that was part of your act.

661
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,200
I thought that was performance art or something.

662
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,180
There was no.

663
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,120
You mean.

664
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,760
Yeah.

665
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:36,920
Didn't you.

666
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,620
I was really.

667
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,560
Why don't you ever wonder about the.

668
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,680
The stains and the wet.

669
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,200
And the.

670
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,240
The little.

671
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,700
Things dropping out of your.

672
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,440
No.

673
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,040
Trousers.

674
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:47,980
No, no.

675
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,000
When it happens, I.

676
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,360
It usually takes a while for me to kind of reform.

677
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,020
I figured you rehearsed that.

678
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,380
The current dimension.

679
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,660
Because you always let go right at the end of a song like.

680
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,440
Ta-da.

681
00:31:59,640 --> 00:31:59,980
Ah.

682
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,780
And then it's all just runs out.

683
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,340
I thought that was like, how does he have that much control?

684
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,640
How can he let it out exactly on the beat like that?

685
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,820
I had no idea.

686
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,600
It's like one.

687
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,560
When the crescendo is happening, you see the stain start and then spread.

688
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,080
And then when it gets real big.

689
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:15,540
Oh, man.

690
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,500
The very last drum beat.

691
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,080
And then these little eggs start.

692
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,600
You start shaking those little things out of your trousers.

693
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,020
Well.

694
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,700
It's weird.

695
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,460
Buddy, I could apologize to or do I.

696
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,720
I mean, you know, since I.

697
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
No, we don't pray in this church.

698
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:28,740
Huh?

699
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,940
We don't pray and apologize to this in this church.

700
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,540
But I mean.

701
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,420
Because, you know, who knows who might be listening.

702
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,940
To be there for it.

703
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,420
You know what I mean?

704
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,340
Well, you can look at the video.

705
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,720
You can look at the video someday.

706
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,560
When we transfer them to those hand crank projectors like you insist on.

707
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,700
I thought I had that all taken care of, man.

708
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,700
I mean, I really did.

709
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,320
I thought I knew where I was at each individual moment.

710
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,080
I thought I knew where I was.

711
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,020
Everybody does it.

712
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,700
Brushwood at X day.

713
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,780
But then every 30 seconds, they find out they were wrong now, don't they?

714
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,300
That accounts for the blurs.

715
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,040
Yeah.

716
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,400
Suddenly, you're one minute.

717
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,560
You're at Doc Frop's camp.

718
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,480
Fropping up.

719
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,420
Talking to Doc Frop.

720
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,420
And then the blur happens.

721
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,280
And you think you're still there.

722
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,140
But you.

723
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:15,560
You blink and you realize, oh, no, I'm in that orgy tent cabin thing that those New Yorkers set up.

724
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,460
And then, you know, then you're somewhere else.

725
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,020
There was an orgy camp this year.

726
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,500
Oh.

727
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,900
Oh, that was just a joke, Dave.

728
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,560
No, I was just kidding.

729
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,000
Well, you said you'd tell me if there was.

730
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,320
Oh, yeah.

731
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,340
Of course we would.

732
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,440
You know we would, Dave.

733
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
If there was a big orgy camp.

734
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Well, it's not like.

735
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,100
It's not like we would deliberately.

736
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,020
Not tell you just for.

737
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,860
Well, it's not like.

738
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,740
Because of the stains or anything like that.

739
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,300
No, no.

740
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,940
Of course, man.

741
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,940
No, it just didn't happen.

742
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,360
I guess they were lazy this year.

743
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,660
I guess they weren't feeling.

744
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,580
There was, you know, the kids, of course, the under 40s.

745
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,760
Were had some sort of a get together.

746
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,460
Yeah.

747
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,160
So you're saying that it wasn't because of the offensive shifting and phasing back and forth.

748
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,420
That I wasn't invited.

749
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,260
There wasn't anything for you to be disinvited.

750
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:09,740
I did today.

751
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
If I, you know, and it wasn't any fun anyway.

752
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,340
Well, I noticed there are a lot of people walking around with big, juicy Chateaubriand

753
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:22,000
steaks in their hands and large, big, huge drafts of large lager, herring, beers.

754
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,320
Well, they went out and got those separately.

755
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,700
Those weren't like handed out to just everybody.

756
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,200
Yeah.

757
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,080
Except you.

758
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,560
Yeah, sure.

759
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,300
Yeah.

760
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,080
I noticed.

761
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,840
Yeah, not you.

762
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
Not you, Dave.

763
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,740
I'd walk down the path and like a brightly lit little town.

764
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,460
And.

765
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,100
And I'd get a few feet in front of a place.

766
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,020
And suddenly the gate would.

767
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:42,560
Like nobody was around.

768
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,000
Yeah.

769
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,760
And the gate would slam shut just as you were walking up.

770
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,400
Well, Dave, I wouldn't take it personally.

771
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,500
You know, there's like a limited space at some of those orgy camps.

772
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,020
That's all.

773
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,760
And the listeners are going, yeah, I bet it's really just a sausage fest.

774
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,200
And believe me.

775
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,640
Sausage fest.

776
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,800
Well, that's the term that our jealous friends have accused us of.

777
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:16,420
I've actually heard a high, high mistress over mistress Salatia was griping that it was in fact a taco fest.

778
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:30,120
And it was all young girls and old guys who were too tired and and and busy with their endless spouting and jabbering and religious stuff to, you know, take the job with the chicks.

779
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:30,680
Yeah.

780
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,940
Whose sausages actually come to resemble tacos?

781
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,880
So it's like three girls.

782
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,640
Well, there's also the trannies.

783
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,740
Which we have plenty of at any X day.

784
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,820
And it's becoming increasingly hard to tell, of course, because they get more practice all the time.

785
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,300
It was.

786
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,640
I was very confused by one transmission.

787
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,620
And I actually walked.

788
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,120
I, you know, wanted to look a little closer at this beautiful woman.

789
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,840
And then I got close enough to look at the beautiful woman.

790
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,920
And I found it was a rather.

791
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,780
Hey, Dave, keep talking.

792
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,880
Keep talking.

793
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,040
Just because I have to go let some robber into the station.

794
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,700
So I'm going to leave the amino acids on the background.

795
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,480
And you this show is yours, baby, for 30 seconds.

796
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,020
See you.

797
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,580
OK.

798
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,400
OK.

799
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:37,480
Well, my reminiscences, my my recollections of X day, probably the fondest one I have was the the spanking weapon party where three of the elderly males were led to the surface of the ballroom, the the shiny surface there and were spanked by other slightly less elderly members.

800
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,260
And then there was the mass extinction, which I also liked.

801
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,340
And there were different little giveaways.

802
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,780
Dave, what did you tell them?

803
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,520
Huh?

804
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,420
Well, I'm back.

805
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,820
What did you tell them?

806
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,180
Mass spanking and then the mass extinction.

807
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,740
Oh, but I didn't.

808
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,180
Well, I'm going to have a tape of this, so I'll know what you said.

809
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,540
Huh?

810
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,140
I have a tape of this.

811
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,200
I'll know what you said.

812
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,780
Well, it wasn't very quick or erudite or cool or smart.

813
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,660
No, it wasn't true or good.

814
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,120
Well, it was true, though.

815
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,520
Huh?

816
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,260
In the eye of your beholder.

817
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:18,500
And I don't know what you're beholding right now, but I'd like to be holding that nice, nice reverend I saw.

818
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,320
Could you cook in those pancakes?

819
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,700
Yeah, she looked like a pancake.

820
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,660
Could you describe her?

821
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,440
Oh, I didn't tell the listeners about the miracle pancake.

822
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,940
There really was one.

823
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,780
There's always a pancake kook off.

824
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,580
And the pan kooks were sitting there just cooking.

825
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,680
I guess they were down towards the last pancake.

826
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,860
And they poured the last little not quite enough batter in.

827
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,600
And it dribbled a bit over to one side on the bottom left.

828
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,760
And they went ahead and cooked it up.

829
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:54,260
And by gobs, if that pancake cooked by Reverend V and Reverend Annie did not look like a silhouette of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

830
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,600
It certainly did.

831
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:01,160
Now, some people talk about a taco with a Jesus on it or a damn fence post with the mayor on it.

832
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,540
But this was a—every day.

833
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,740
We've had a next-day Dobbs-headed burger.

834
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,600
We had a Dobbs-head appear on a burger.

835
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,160
But this time it was a pan kook.

836
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,940
And these items were all genuinely—they were all bona fide and all certified.

837
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,660
It was not done as an artwork.

838
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:22,720
It appeared spontaneously, like animalcules appear in a closed jar.

839
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,920
And the state health department come by and examined them.

840
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,440
And found that they were indeed the articles that they had claimed that they had made.

841
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,760
And we went from there.

842
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,060
And—

843
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,720
Uh-huh.

844
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


845
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


846
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


847
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


848
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


849
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


850
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


851
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:35,720


852
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,480
Just as history.

853
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,740
I mean, I don't know what I mean at this point.

854
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,740
And I flunked history.

855
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,360
Did you?

856
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,840
Yeah.

857
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,520
Yeah.

858
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,940
I was thinking about, you know.

859
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,680
The future.

860
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:47,640
Bob.

861
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,420
Oh, really?

862
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:48,840
Yeah.

863
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,480
Even at an early age?

864
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:50,920
Yeah.

865
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,740
If you know Bob, you don't need to know the future because—or history.

866
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,560
Because Bob is the past and the future.

867
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,820
Well, once again—

868
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,460
Not to be confused with the future.

869
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,720
With this next day in mind, I would say that's also—

870
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,100
So alive.

871
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,160
And that Bob has no more an idea of what's going to happen in the future than anyone.

872
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,160
The amino acids I heard in the background.

873
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,340
Well, the albinos are probably your best source of information for what's really going on

874
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,280
in the Church of the Subhaniauts.

875
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,620
But there are some drawbacks in following their liturgical path.

876
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,300
It consists of exploded eardrums, damaged testicles.

877
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,140
And—

878
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,300
Did you know the story—

879
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,400
If you have both, it might get more like damaged testiclee.

880
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,040
Damos.

881
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,340
For some people.

882
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,540
On the other hand, though, there's so many peni.

883
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,180
It just doesn't make sense in the world of the Church of the Subgenius because it's the opposite of everything.

884
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,560
It's like Bizarro World.

885
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,400
It is.

886
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,060
It is a lot like Bizarro World.

887
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,120
I notice anti-characters and anti-humans throughout the whole celebration.

888
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,440
The people who claim to be—

889
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,120
Me Bizarro Subgenius.

890
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,080
Me hate slaps.

891
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,520
Me hate slaps.

892
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,480
What happened to the justice system in the state of New York?

893
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,900
Is there something wrong there?

894
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,760
It was taken over by the Justice League of America, which was a DC comic book invention and totally fictitious.

895
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,980
And that's where we're at.

896
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,860
That's why Magdalene lost her case.

897
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,120
Although, here's the other part of the news, friends.

898
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,660
Her fancy lawyer ain't giving up.

899
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,520
He claims he's never lost a case.

900
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,020
And he's not going to let this go down.

901
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,480
Well, he shouldn't.

902
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,740
Even though he did land in Bizarro World, he should not.

903
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,900
It is Bizarro World.

904
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,760
It is Bizarro World.

905
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,140
Everything's upside down.

906
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,480
You know, the weather—

907
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:59,740
Everybody talks about the weather being crazy, but this was a true sentence spake in all sincerity by Doc Frop before he went back to Texas from northern Ohio.

908
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,680
And he said, and I quote,

909
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,720
I can't get way—

910
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,020
I can't wait to get back—

911
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:15,640
to get out of hot, dry Cleveland and get back to cool, wet North Texas.

912
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,120
Yes.

913
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,220
So, you know, what has this world come to?

914
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,160
Even in travelogues, they used to tell you that the worst time to go to Texas was in the summer.

915
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,060
And that nobody did anything in the summer but groan and complain or sit in the air conditioning.

916
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,040
And that life was fun in fall.

917
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,280
And life was fun.

918
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,640
And winter.

919
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,080
And winter and spring.

920
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,440
But as soon as summer arrived, people pretty much died.

921
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:54,240
Yeah, but see, now with global whatever is happening, global feedback, we get this situation where it becomes freezing cold in the Sahara Desert and blistering hot at the North Pole.

922
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,580
And then the next day it switches back.

923
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,580
And gas is $100,000 an ounce.

924
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,120
Well—

925
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,580
More expensive than marijuana.

926
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,160
Or gold.

927
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,080
Then who?

928
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,120
Actually, I think gold is a little bit cheaper than both of those now.

929
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,880
And diamonds, well, you can find them anywhere.

930
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:23,340
Did you know that you can create diamonds from cereals, from common household items, from cereals from your supermarket?

931
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,500
Did you know that?

932
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,180
No.

933
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:26,900
Well—

934
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,240
Did you read that on the internet?

935
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,320
Well, no.

936
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,700
I heard that you could make diamonds—

937
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,040
You could make diamonds from pretty much anything under enough pressure.

938
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,260
So I suppose—

939
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,800
You saw that on a Superman show, didn't you?

940
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,180
You didn't have to have an awful lot of grape nuts and maybe put them on the surface of the sun, but you could still make diamonds.

941
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,460
Yeah, you can eventually.

942
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,840
That's the thing that the religionists sometimes don't understand is the long time frame it takes to turn your grape nuts into diamonds.

943
00:42:54,120 --> 00:43:03,600
It's not like grape nuts evolve into diamonds overnight because some super intelligent designer crushes them in his hands to give them to—

944
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,100
Well, in their—

945
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:10,300
It's because—it's because—in great, vast epochs of time.

946
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,280
That's in their view, in their worldview.

947
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:22,780
You go through various incarnations, and your grape nuts become more diamond-like, adamantine, and hard as you pass through each celebratory act of existing.

948
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:32,280
And by the time you reach the final curtain and you turn to do your cryptographs to the audience that has left a long time ago,

949
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,580
you really—

950
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,060
You realize that's all you are.

951
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,000
It's prefabricated cereal for the gods or some other being that's—oh, dang, I'm sorry.

952
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,780
Oh, all that dirty talk is getting me hot, man.

953
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,440
Oh, well—

954
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,800
Whenever you and Hal start talking about that dirty talk, that kind of hot, hot philosophical talk, I get worked up.

955
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,700
Well, I go up and down.

956
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,140
I start crying, and then I get aroused, and I don't know.

957
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,600
It's a confusing subject for me.

958
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,180
Well, we've got 15 minutes left in this hour of Slack, which is number 1,108.

959
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,060
Oh, you lie.

960
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,520
No, that's true.

961
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,280
Oh, okay.

962
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,200
That's what I have.

963
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,540
I do lie, and that's what time it is and what show it is.

964
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,840
And I wanted to play some of these other little bits and pieces from the—

965
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,160
Well, at least we got to get to the subgenius anthem, which I cut half of out so everybody will think it was played perfectly.

966
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,460
You can't even hear the cuts.

967
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,660
I can't wait for Pisces to hear what I did to her Connie rap.

968
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,320
She screwed that up terribly.

969
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,560
And then I fixed her screw-ups, but then I went and screwed it up.

970
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,000
I fixed it up by over-modulating the mic.

971
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,840
But you can't tell she screwed up.

972
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,900
That's the important thing.

973
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,820
Did you get my hot jam, my made-up song against Stan?

974
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,880
Yeah, we played that at the beginning, the Nameless X Day song.

975
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,560
Did you get any calls from any producers or any record label?

976
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,900
No, you're the only person who called.

977
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:50,620
Oh, okay.

978
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:56,060
And I'm not even going to take your call anymore, so I'm about to fade you out and turn this other stuff back on.

979
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,480
Are you fading me right now at this moment?

980
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:57,940
You're fading me?

981
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,280
Oh, I guess I might as well.

982
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,220
Well, wait a minute.

983
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:00,740
What?

984
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,120
Wait a minute.

985
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,340
You're actually fading me out?

986
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,520
Well, yeah, I'm fading you out right now as we're talking.

987
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:06,660
What?

988
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,100
Can I still hear you?

989
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,380
Can you still hear me?

990
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,740
Only now, but I'm going to fade you out now, okay?

991
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,960
Okay, now you're really...

992
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,580
What?

993
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,700
Wait, wait, please don't, please don't.

994
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,340
Stop, stop, please.

995
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:15,780
You keep...

996
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,500
I keep not...

997
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,720
I don't get it.

998
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,320
That Dave, what a character.

999
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,080
Actually, Dave got a Bobby Award as Best Human Cartoon.

1000
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,060
Look, I pushed the drop button and Dave dropped right out.

1001
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,520
Okay, I'm going to go back to the...

1002
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,480
This.

1003
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,280
Truth is fiction.

1004
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,560
This is Be Orbit, Be Not.

1005
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,460
Giuseppe DiMai of Naples possessed $106,

1006
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,220
twice as rich as the richest cunt in the world,

1007
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,720
Be Orbit, Be Not.

1008
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,760
In Massachusetts, there is a lake called Chargong Amog.

1009
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,060
It contained walled-up entrances, trap doors, and stairways leading nowhere.

1010
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,040
Be Orbit, Be Not.

1011
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,240
The entire Dutch fleet has long been noted for its powers of voluntarily leaving the failing streams

1012
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,400
and proceeding over dry land toward some spot where its unerring instinct tells it that water is yet to be found.

1013
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,560
They sometimes cover a distance of a mile or more and can live for a week out of water.

1014
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,300
Be Orbit, Be Not.

1015
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,000
Be Not.

1016
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,520
Be Not.

1017
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,920
Be Not.

1018
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,240
Be Not.

1019
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,240


1020
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:27,520
Be Not.

1021
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:27,940
Be Not.

1022
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,240
Be Not.

1023
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,160
Be Not.

1024
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,040
Be Not.

1025
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:33,540
Be Not.

1026
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1027
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1028
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1029
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1030
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1031
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1032
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1033
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1034
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


1035
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,460
Be Not.

1036
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,320
Be Not.

1037
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,920
Be Not.

1038
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,240
Be Not.

1039
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,420
Be Not.

1040
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:54,420


1041
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:54,420


1042
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:54,420


1043
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,940
Be Not.

1044
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,260
Be Not.

1045
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,280
Be Not.

1046
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,280


1047
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:56,320
Be Not.

1048
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,980
Be Not.

1049
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,520
Be Not.

1050
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,140
Be Not.

1051
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:00,820
Be Not.

1052
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,820
Thank you.

1053
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,120
Thank you.

1054
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,220
Thank you.

1055
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,960
Thank you.

1056
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,260
Thank you.

1057
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,900
Thank you.

1058
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,940
Thank you.

1059
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,760
Thank you.

1060
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,780
Here is the earthling.

1061
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,320
Get him.

1062
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:09,680
Where?

1063
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,240
I believe I know.

1064
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,480
Yes, I'm quite sure I know.

1065
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
Yes, I believe I do.

1066
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,440
He is clever, the earthling called Honeyburn.

1067
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,400
He's fast and he's experienced.

1068
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,320
I wonder if they got that guy yet.

1069
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,680
We'll have to do it quickly.

1070
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,180
Earthling.

1071
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,760
Earthling.

1072
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,640
Earthling.

1073
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,040
Earthling.

1074
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,680
1,700.

1075
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,380
Whoa.

1076
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,620
Yes, indeedy.

1077
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,560
I'm surprised he didn't say 13013.

1078
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,500
That last cut there was cut in and cut up by Fernand and Andy Lee Murr.

1079
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:08,360
And the version, that amazing version of Powerhouse that I played just before that

1080
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,780
was Bonobo Convergence live at X-Day.

1081
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,500
Yes, believe it or not, we actually have not just the amino acids,

1082
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:23,660
but other good bands there besides Lonesome Cowboy Dave and others.

1083
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,280
And, yeah, that was Bonobo Convergence with that old hit Powerhouse.

1084
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,220
And I'm going to skip ahead.

1085
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:38,020
I had other things, but I really want to play,

1086
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,700
we'll go back to Lonesome Cowboy Dave live at X-Day,

1087
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,520
a very short version of Subgenius Anthem,

1088
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,840
followed by Priestess Pisces Connie rap,

1089
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,420
which is rather different, you'll see, from what we usually do.

1090
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,660
And let me make sure I get everything just exactly right.

1091
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,020
Because we wouldn't want to screw anything up.

1092
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,180
Okay, you've stayed for the Subgenius Anthem, which is the end of this jam so far.

1093
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,500
Oh, we'll stand hand in hand

1094
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,160
When the trumpet calls X-Day

1095
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,260
In a brother and sister band

1096
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,000
While they blow the world away

1097
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,220
We shall have paradise

1098
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,180
Subgenie of the world unite

1099
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,920
Alien sex every night

1100
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,660
Subgenie of the world unite

1101
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:01,660

When you sit there and jam for a while, making up words as you go along,

1156
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,700
and I'm trying to remember the words that I was trying to remember to do this.

1157
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,620
And yet, somehow she does.

1158
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:14,060
There was like an hour of making up songs, which we'll get to in future shows.
