1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,160
The Power of Slack!

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,120
The Power of Slack!

3
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,280
The Power of Slack!

4
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:35,500
The Power of Slack!

5
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:23,120
The Power of Slack!

6
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,120
The Power of Slack!

7
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,040
The Power of Slack!

8
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,400
The Power of Slack!

9
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:10,240
The Power of Slack!

10
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,560
The Power of Slack!

11
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,060
The Power of Slack!

12
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:49,940
The Power of Slack!

13
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,740
...aerial bombardment, meaning to blow up the whole country of Iraq with a shockwave,

14
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,600
one of America's brand-new weapons of destruction.

15
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,920
I was wondering about...

16
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,540
Guaranteed for liberty.

17
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,780
The brand-new ones, you know, because there's supposed to be some fancy new noisemakers and big earth rattlers.

18
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,120
Step back from the Centurion.

19
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,240
You will all die under the power of the fist of the fossil.

20
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,340
Say hi, baby.

21
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,700
Now, the propaganda that goes back and forth is marvelous,

22
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,360
because I was reading just a little while ago that the evil Saddam Husseins

23
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,820
had ordered a whole bunch of fake American and British army uniforms

24
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,960
so that he could dress up the Fayadin in these uniforms,

25
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,080
who would then go out and commit atrocities on their fellow Iraqis as a propaganda routine,

26
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
you know, to make it look about evil and terrible.

27
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:46,940
The...

28
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,340
Demonic British people are.

29
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,900
You know how they are.

30
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
I heard they really were demonic.

31
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,100
Have you ever heard of Mad Bomber Harris?

32
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,580
He started the whole idea of blowing the living hell out of Iraq in the 1920s.

33
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,920
When they were close to independence, he thought,

34
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,940
why not use the new bombers, you know, the brand-new bombers in the air we've got,

35
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,440
and just keep dropping them on those peasant villages?

36
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,880
You know, kind of toughen them up and soften them at the same time a little bit.

37
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,700
During these last few months, I've been trained by Al-Qaeda, and I'm weak.

38
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,580
And materialistic.

39
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,040
I told our country and I told the world,

40
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,420
if it feels good, do it.

41
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,660
I hope you'll enjoy me in expressing fear and selfishness.

42
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,360
We will embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed.

43
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,760
Thank you.

44
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,500
We can be summed up in one word.

45
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,720
Evil.

46
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,080
I am committed to defeating not only the good work of charities,

47
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,240
but the values that will bring lasting peace.

48
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,680
And we have a great opportunity.

49
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,260
During this time,

50
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,160
it's time of war to lead the world towards suicide and murder.

51
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,140
Let's roll.

52
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,280
Thank you.

53
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,140
You know, he actually used...

54
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,720
He used the phrase.

55
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
Now, I may have...

56
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Killed for peace?

57
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,360
I could not...

58
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,440
I could swear I heard the emperor say,

59
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,280
the goal of this war is peace.

60
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,440
And he may have said some other things,

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,240
but at one point he actually said the phrase,

62
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,640
war is peace.

63
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
Friends, it's 1984.

64
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,500
1984 is 19 years late.

65
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,140
That means X day will be the year 2017.

66
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,080
Praise God!

67
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,500
Praise God!

68
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,780
19 years.

69
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,700
It was written in a vast,

70
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,120
massive,

71
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,800
deep, deep,

72
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,000
colorless sleep.

73
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,720
Stuck to the ground

74
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,640
needs one of the baby incubators in Kuwait City,

75
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,340
waiting to awake.

76
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,380
And yet you cannot.

77
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,880
Until 1984.

78
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,060
When your dreams come true.

79
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,600
When your brother is bigger than anything.

80
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm tired and sad.

81
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,180
And I want you all so bad.

82
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,040
He wears a toothless jaw.

83
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,580
So from 1984,

84
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,300
I have been an unawaresome failure.

85
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm tired and sad.

86
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,660
I want you all so bad.

87
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,040
I've been an unawaresome failure.

88
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:16,560
I've been an unawaresome failure.

89
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:36,800
And he on the way to Baghdad,

90
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,620
I think on the way to Baghdad,

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,620
there's a lot of guys

92
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,960
sitting in their foxholes,

93
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,200
dreaming about their foxholes

94
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,320
and crying in their boots.

95
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,060
Where's my...

96
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,400
Dreaming about those boot jobs they're going to get when they get back home.

97
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,860
Yep.

98
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,520
Get their boots enlarged.

99
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,280
Shaved medulla oblongatas.

100
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,400
They're going to look like all the rest of the kids, only nobody knows they're going to be different.

101
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Way different.

102
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:00,740
Changed.

103
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,360
A different kind of tattoo.

104
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,060
Well, they get the free smallpox inoculations and the free tracking devices.

105
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,520
Well, that tattoos your innards pretty good, but that's not the whole of it.

106
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,780
That's only part.

107
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,300
Yeah, they get the holes, too.

108
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,360
Yeah, well, that's only part of it, too.

109
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,080
And then it's a tattoo.

110
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,340
Yes, it makes them lift their leg when the bus comes up to the bus stop.

111
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,120
If they're well-trained.

112
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,660
Well, some of them have to wear the collars, the special...

113
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, let's just call them...

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,700
I know I do.

115
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,260
Digital angels, you know what I mean?

116
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,880
If I didn't have this collar on, Dave, I'd be wetting myself.

117
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,960
Well, that's...

118
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,300
We can thank the digital angel for setting you straight.

119
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,020
Right, that's right.

120
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
If it weren't for this modern age, I'd just be a vegetable.

121
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,640
Well, where do they put your chip?

122
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,280
Where do they put your chip?

123
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:43,900
Where do they put your chip?

124
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,300
All over me.

125
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,960
I mean, there's tons of them.

126
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,020
I've got a chip for every organ that still works.

127
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,260
Did Papa Joe ever get that collar removed from his?

128
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,880
Nah.

129
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,180
His was embedded into his vertebrae.

130
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,460
Did we ever get those collars removed from this show?

131
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,880
Those barnacles?

132
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,220
Those grafted-on ticks?

133
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,760
If people remember the early days, we asked each and every one of you...

134
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,400
I wonder if you'd like to become a closer member of the show's team out there...

135
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,120
If you feel you are not properly sedated, please call 555-3129.

136
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,720
Failure to do so may result in criminal prosecution for drug evasion.

137
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,900
Welcome back to our program.

138
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,180
Please continue.

139
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,280
I believe most Pacific Islander parents like using products like hairspray or glue as an inhalant to get high.

140
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,740
I'm here...

141
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:42,740


142
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm here to let other Pacific Islander parents know we need to care about using more serious drugs.

143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,000
If you need drugs or ideas on how to keep your drugs, please call Bob.

144
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,960
Welcome back to our program.

145
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,580
That was a lemur cut.

146
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,440
Tonight's collages are almost but not all by Mr. F. Lemur.

147
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:12,720
The second of the two Bush cut-ups heard earlier was by someone named Edo at fuckitall.com.

148
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,760
The Star Spangled Banner was by Mark Mothersbaugh.

149
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:25,300
For your dating info, this show was actually assembled on March 9th, 2003, the year of duct tape and plastic sheeting.

150
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,580
Isn't duct tape and plastic sheeting just another version of duck and cover?

151
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,380
Duck and cover!

152
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,700
What did duck and cover tell you?

153
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,340
Duck and cover told you that if you just ducked when the bomb went off...

154
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,720
And put a knife in your mouth.

155
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
And put a newspaper over your butt.

156
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
Yeah, if you just ducked.

157
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,460
Just duck.

158
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:45,800
Duck!

159
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,880
Oh, there's a nuclear bomb.

160
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,300
Duck!

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,700
Then everything will be okay.

162
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,320
Throw that under your desk and we'll win!

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,100
Well, they were talking about amphibian birds at the time.

164
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:05,040
When they asked you to duck and cover, they wanted you to run out to the nearest pond and grab little turkey boy or a little quacky and stick him under your shirt and carry him home.

165
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,440
And when they ask you now...

166
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
That felt good.

167
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
That's what the duct tape is all about.

168
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,360
No, it's true.

169
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
It's a way of bringing illusions to ducks and their subconscious.

170
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,460
They're playing with your minds.

171
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
Duck and cover.

172
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,880
Duck and tape.

173
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,360
I think I'm getting a little gun.

174
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,760
Gas is being used in this war.

175
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,840
Air raid sirens warn us of the approach of enemy planes.

176
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,720
But in addition, if gas is dropped by the enemy, a special gas alarm will be sounded.

177
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,340
It will be a hand rattle or a hammering sound like the beating of a dish pan.

178
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,140
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

179
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,600
More gas is dropped from planes either as a spray or in gas bombs.

180
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,080
But should enemy raiders use gas against your community, there is no reason for fear or panic.

181
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,320
Because if you know what to do, you can protect yourself and safeguard your family against the menace of gas from the air.

182
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,360
Of course that's Arcana. You know what Arcana is?

183
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,540
Do you know what wisdom is?

184
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,280
Do you know the meaning of the ein soft?

185
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,040
Of the ei within the ei within the ei within the ei?

186
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,060
Are your balls ready to rumble?

187
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,860
Are they ready to roll?

188
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,620
Do you know the meaning of love?

189
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,220
Pour me another mug of that there ein soft, would you?

190
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,340
There, barkeep.

191
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,840
Now you've had enough, buddy boy. I'm going to catch you off.

192
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,520
You're baffling everybody in that damn bar and everyone's tired of listening to you.

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,500
in your wisdom.

194
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,620
That's not famous for me.

195
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,880
I had a gold Akashic record.

196
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,820
Damn it.

197
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,040
Back in the day,

198
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,360
everybody was doing my songs.

199
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah, you got a gold Akashic.

200
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,840
We got your astral card

201
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,780
right here, buddy.

202
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,220
And it says that you haven't

203
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,080
passed your limit

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,900
and you've been around more times

205
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,460
than anybody else in this bar.

206
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,320
So could you please shut up?

207
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,340
Shut the fuck up, man.

208
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,600
Stop drinking that wisdom shit.

209
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
Don't be sucking on the wisdom

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,340
eyeball.

211
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,680
Too much is always better

212
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
than not enough.

213
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,280
Amy, I'm a regular.

214
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
It's almost as bad.

215
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm a regular.

216
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,440
Oh, you're quite a regular now,

217
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,780
be that.

218
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,940
Just let me check further here.

219
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,440
What is the elliptical meaning

220
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,020
of that?

221
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,200
There's only one eyeball.

222
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,180
I'm going to chase you

223
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,240
with an elliptical eyeball

224
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,180
and then fuck all around

225
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,980
and round and round and round.

226
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,580
That's right.

228
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Well, there's no train of thought

229
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
we're sketching.

230
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,540
This time we're taking the express.

231
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,020
We're guilty of not doing enough

232
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,800
about the war.

233
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,140
That just keeps coming.

234
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,480
I keep feeling so bad

235
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
about not doing enough.

236
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,120
Well, you could suck

237
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,500
the cycloptic wisdom teeth

238
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,880
and then you would understand

239
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,600
what to do

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,400
as Laguerre pronounces

241
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
itself upon us.

242
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,600
Which magazine should I subscribe to

243
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,560
that would, you know,

244
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,940
be the right thing to do?

245
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,720
Martial arts, survival,

246
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,140
mercenary, merc,

247
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,760
magazines like that

248
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,200
that teach you use of small arms

249
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,440
and large feet.

250
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,660
That's going to be,

251
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,500
we're going to have to pull off

252
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,400
some pretty big feet

253
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,620
to live through this, I think.

254
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,440
I mean, size 12.

255
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,860
I was just going to learn

256
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,520
to give really good oral sex

257
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,920
to great big tough guys.

258
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
That was how I was going to live

259
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,700
through the end of civilization.

260
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,200
As a sniveling pansy

261
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
awaiting for the trains of military

262
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,700
to come through town

263
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,540
and to wait for one of those...

264
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,660
I want them to say,

265
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,140
that's the best barrel.

266
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,500
That barrel over there,

267
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,680
that's the best one.

268
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,900
You better hope no fish

269
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,660
jump out of it.

270
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,400
The prisoner in that barrel,

271
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,680
I don't know who she is,

272
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,500
but she's good.

273
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,200
You know it's not a woman, man.

274
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,660
Shut up.

275
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,560
Those are orgasmic.

276
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,140
That's how you get

277
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,240
through the end times.

278
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,620
Unless you have

279
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,020
the biggest gun.

280
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,900
You take your duct tape,

281
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,960
you take a big Hershey bar,

282
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,680
because that's going to be

283
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,820
a survival candy bar.

284
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,180
You want to be able to take

285
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,440
small, small pieces of it.

286
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,780
Duct tape, candy bar,

287
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,480
right up in there.

288
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,780
Into your crotch there.

289
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,260
Take a lot of duct tape

290
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,680
and just strap it right in there.

291
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,660
Is that the way

292
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,720
you're really supposed to do it?

293
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,480
You're supposed to strap

294
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,060
duct tape into your crotch?

295
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,620
I mean...

296
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,160
No, the food.

297
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,760
Hershey bar.

298
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,140
Your trading materials.

299
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,400
Oh, the loin packs.

300
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,060
Those are actual things

301
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,700
that are trademarked.

302
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,360
Yeah, because that's what

303
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,520
you're going to use to trade.

304
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,580
You're not pouring chocolate

305
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,300
into your crotch.

306
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,040
The natives,

307
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,720
or the surviving wretches

308
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
in whatever country

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,460
far away from America

310
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,500
that you flee to.

311
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,360
My dehydrated loin.

312
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,520
My loin pack is leaking

313
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,400
and I've noticed

314
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,700
sauce beginning to

315
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,060
add to all of my needs.

316
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,100
The reason you have to

317
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,700
flee America

318
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,760
is because the Americans

319
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,740
are taking over.

320
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,440
Yeah.

321
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,860
Yes.

322
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,420
I'm the political

323
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,240
president, man.

324
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,620
We're going to bring back

325
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,840
the pillory and stocks

326
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,740
and stuff in there.

327
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,940
Today,

328
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,920
a U.S. nuclear fishing boat

329
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,580
torn apart.

330
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,580
How one man's search for truth

331
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,120
almost cost him his hate.

332
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,880
Well, welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

333
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
to this edition of Up the French.

334
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,660
It's not going to be pleasant.

335
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
I hate the French.

336
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,660
They'll always be ridiculous.

337
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah, the French are Nazis,

338
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,500
as a matter of fact.

339
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,420
Lee?

340
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,560
Pat, a concern of several

341
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,740
European terrorists.

342
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,280
Pat?

343
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,860
Lee, it's shocking.

344
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,040
The French Nazis build terrorism.

345
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,700
They are an instrument,

346
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,160
an agent of terror.

347
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,080
Lee?

348
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,120
That's right, Pat.

349
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
Israel is carefully

350
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,460
assessing CBN News'

351
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,320
Middle East correspondent,

352
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,840
Chris Scholl.

353
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,020
Right, Pat?

354
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,260
Well, it could be bloody blood

355
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,400
all over the place,

356
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,800
and just that simple.

357
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,320
Lee?

358
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,380
Want good cranberries

359
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,940
and cancer and heart disease.

360
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,580
That's too bad, Pat,

361
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,520
because I was thinking about

362
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,740
having a big old piece of

363
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,080
bloodstream pie with disease

364
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,660
on top.

365
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,580
How about the phrase

366
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,640
axis of Putin's soul?

367
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,980
It's an axis.

368
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
No, not really.

369
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,560
Oh.

370
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
In Bosnia,

371
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,600
they built a Mall of America.

372
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,020
They built a Mall of America.

373
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,200
They built a Mall of America

374
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,220
in Bosnia now.

375
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,220
Well, they're working on

376
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,240
Disneyland East,

377
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,340
was what this guy

378
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,480
on Altstar was saying.

379
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Disneyland Far East.

380
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,920
That's what this is all about.

381
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,440
Disneyland East.

382
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,720
The largest Kmart

383
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,620
in the world.

384
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,100
Have you heard

385
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,640
the new chain,

386
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,360
Bag Daddy?

387
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,280
The pants and the soup

388
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,180
at the same time?

389
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,100
That is a disgusting

390
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,360
prescription for anyone

391
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
without brain cells.

392
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,000
What's your

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,300
Bag Daddy?

394
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,300
Wow, that's...

395
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,460
Huh?

396
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,760
So, the bookie's

397
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
taking bets on

398
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,760
when this thing

399
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,380
is going to start,

400
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,420
exactly when they're

401
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:33,880
going to, like,

402
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,700
boom, you know,

403
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,020
go...

404
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,620
Yeah, they're laying...

405
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,000
...let the game go.

406
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,320
...the gates down,

407
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,240
and, you know...

408
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,460
They're laying the odds down.

409
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,280
When the first shot

410
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,920
will be fired,

411
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,700
and it won't be shot...

412
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,020
Sit down.

413
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,000
...from a shotgun.

414
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,880
We'll have nowhere to run.

415
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,060
And here comes

416
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,880
Big Bad George.

417
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,560
Now, as a true runner,

418
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,440
that's what Stein said.

419
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,060
In the military

420
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,220
industrial complex.

421
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,360
Speaking of strange

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,480
showbiz,

423
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,500
after the king

424
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,120
of the universe

425
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,320
spoke tonight,

426
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,540
suddenly they cut over

427
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,300
to saying,

428
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,320
it looks like

429
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,820
we're in

430
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,000
a war.

431
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,480
Hot pursuit

432
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,540
of Osama bin Laden.

433
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,340
He's been spotted

434
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,840
in the border

435
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,780
of Afghanistan

436
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,320
and Pakistan,

437
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,640
and they're closing in.

438
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,260
You know,

439
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,700
stick with our station.

440
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,680
They're going to do it

441
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,820
just like cops, you know.

442
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,260
They're going to have

443
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,280
the music in the background

444
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,640
and stuff,

445
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,180
and he's going to be

446
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,700
running through,

447
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
like, with a dachshund,

448
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,260
I think,

449
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,460
chasing and biting his ass.

450
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,980
And then when he gets up

451
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,140
on the top of one of those,

452
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,080
you know,

453
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,020
old industrial warehouse

454
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,600
buildings,

455
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,480
and they pull him down,

456
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,180
screaming and swearing

457
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,760
in Arabic.

458
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,920
This is earlier today,

459
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,340
down in Public Square.

460
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,680
Yeah.

461
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,520
What's that smell?

462
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,020


463
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,300
What's that smell?

464
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,200
What's that smell?

465
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,780
What's that smell?

466
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,520
What does it smell?

467
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,420
What's that smell?

468
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,400
That's the joke, right?

469
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,820
Just,

470
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,800
what's that smell?

471
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,620
Way down yonder

472
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,660
in Baghdad.

473
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,180
Where's Fariq?

474
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
My next stop is Baghdad.

475
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,180
Five, six, seven,

476
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,820
open up the pearly gates,

477
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,920
because I just inhaled

478
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,080
some anthrax.

479
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,860
Well, don't die.

480
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,380
Now, come on,

481
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:19,880
Wall Street,

482
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,500
don't be so sad.

483
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,280
Stang, you have such

484
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
a perplexed look on your face

485
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,460
as if you'd actually

486
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,700
inhaled anthrax yourself.

487
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,920
Oh, actually,

488
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,120
I was thinking about

489
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,680
some of my buddy's kids

490
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,660
who were on their way

491
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,280
over there.

492
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,200
Oh, I could.

493
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,280
You know,

494
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,080
I sometimes think

495
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,960
about the soldiers.

496
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,680
Usually,

497
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,560
you're preoccupied

498
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,940
with buds and squids,

499
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,920
and now you're thinking

500
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,020
about your buddy's kids.

501
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,820
How open-hearted

502
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,260
I was.

503
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,080
You're not singing along.

504
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,820
I don't think you want

505
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,580
to stop this war.

506
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,980
Oh, you.

507
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
Do you really

508
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,000
take yourself seriously?

509
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,900
I have big teeth

510
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,280
and big glasses.

511
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,100
We think you're stupid.

512
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,540
You must forgive me.

513
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,340
You show you're

514
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,140
a stupidity

515
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,060
by assuming

516
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,920
that we're like you.

517
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
The F.A.R.C.

518
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,480
has you

519
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,960
playing down.

520
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,640
You've got three or four

521
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,160
D.I.A. and C.I.O.

522
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,680
at your back and forth.

523
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,340
He almost passed out.

524
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,880
It's time to play

525
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,660
Name Not War.

526
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,920
You're five miles

527
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,220
south of Bogota City.

528
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,640
You're in the rainforest.

529
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,200
Oh, my God.

530
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,080
What do the initials

531
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
F.A.R.C.

532
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:35,560
You spend.

533
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,180
These protests.

534
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,800
I think that's another reason

535
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,560
they're having the war now

536
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,480
so that the protesters

537
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,500
can't protest

538
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,660
because it's all zero degrees.

539
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,680
There'd be a lot more people.

540
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,520
Well, that's what the

541
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,800
weather control people say.

542
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,580
It's ruining it.

543
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,960
Rubber bands

544
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,500
and aluminum sulfide

545
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,000
do a dandy treat make.

546
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,540
She's suspended from arrogant

547
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,760
and left to wait.

548
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,240
Children who flop

549
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,460
and children who flip

550
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,920
will freeze in the rain

551
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,220
like a big old drip.

552
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,520
Wow.

553
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,000
It's about weather control.

554
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,140
It's about the Lusitania, too.

555
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,760
But you've got to be

556
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,860
a real conspiracy buff.

557
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,080
I love you.

558
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Cowboy poetry

559
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,560
is so romantic.

560
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,020
I was going to play

561
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,860
my mouth for you,

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,140
but I've been shamed.

563
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,300
It gets my heart

564
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,200
all fluttered.

565
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,680
Yes, you have been

566
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,220
shamed

567
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,100
by the grace

568
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,000
of the Lord.

569
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,060
And Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

570
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,120
This song is depressing,

571
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:29,620
you guys.

572
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,560
They start

573
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,160
with Bob.

574
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,540
War is depressing, Dave.

575
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,220
Stop thinking about

576
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,280
all them body bags.

577
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,120
Bob was almost

578
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,560
depressing.

579
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,320
That's what I'm saying.

580
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,320


581
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,320


582
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,980
That's all I can think of

583
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,240
is body bag after bag

584
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,380
coming out in Arlington.

585
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,480
Yeah.

586
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,920
Back of those old planes.

587
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,020
Everybody's real gung-ho

588
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,520
right now.

589
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,420
Everybody's real like,

590
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,460
yeah, this is going to be

591
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,760
like the Super Bowl

592
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,500
coming up.

593
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,020
Oh, yeah.

594
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,960
Wait till Zayn

595
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,860
drops on that chemical bomb.

596
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,360
On TV.

597
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,040
The right-wing jocks

598
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,780
are going so crazy.

599
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,200
Wait till our boys

600
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,920
are coming home

601
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,540
with their skin

602
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,940
peeled off their faces.

603
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,360
Yeah, and it's communicable,

604
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,480
too, up to six generations.

605
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,520
We'll see how gung-ho

606
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,860
they all are.

607
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,960
I think it's a pretty small

608
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,560
everybody that's really excited.

609
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,320
They wish they would have been.

610
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

611
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:06,680
What?

612
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,700
What did you say?

613
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,540
I think it's a pretty small

614
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,260
everybody that's all excited.

615
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,240
I do, too.

616
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,340
I think it's more

617
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
a bunch of people going,

618
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,780
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

619
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,140
No, a good friend of mine

620
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,220
was telling me about,

621
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,780
but a good friend of mine,

622
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,080
he's a blue-collar kind of guy

623
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
who works, you know,

624
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,000
doing blue-collar work

625
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,620
and telling me how

626
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,260
all those guys,

627
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,880
they all listen to Rush Limbaugh

628
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,360
and they're all so, you know.

629
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,420
Oh, those guys are crazy.

630
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,860
They gung-ho about everything,

631
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,720
about it.

632
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,140
I was just going to tell you guys

633
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,320
something.

634
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,320


635
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,420
I heard on the mic

636
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
on the Savage show,

637
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,420
that guy is so nuts.

638
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,320
He claimed that a demonstrator

639
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,860
waded through a police line

640
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,120
and a line of horses,

641
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,320
grabbed a horsey by its bridle,

642
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,240
punched it,

643
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,980
and knocked it down on the ground.

644
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,200
A demonstrator did that?

645
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,820
Like blazing.

646
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,480
We need those guys in back here.

647
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,080
Let's get back to promoting the war.

648
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,100
Right now.

649
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,740
This is reality.

650
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,240
Face the flag, you son of a bitch.

651
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,600
Take a good long look.

652
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,500
What you're seeing now

653
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,380
can't be found in a history book.

654
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,460
It's the present.

655
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,000
The future, son,

656
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,580
is being written now.

657
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,720
You're the one to write it.

658
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,840
The flag can show you how.

659
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,860
You know what it stands for?

660
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,100
What its makers meant?

661
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,300
To think, to speak,

662
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,660
the privilege of dissent.

663
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,440
To think our leaders might be wrong,

664
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,920
to stand and tell them so.

665
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,600
I've got to touch a hangover, bureaucrat.

666
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,640
Don't push me.

667
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,460
These are the things that other men under other flags

668
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,060
will never know.

669
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,360
But responsibility,

670
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,700
that's the cost that free men must bear.

671
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,300
You know, if we had any moral character,

672
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,980
we wouldn't be standing here covered with mud drinking.

673
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,520
If you don't accept that,

674
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,340
somebody ought to belt you in the mouth.

675
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,620
Face the flag of stars and stars

676
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,480
of red and white and blue.

677
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,160
A flag that guarantees the rise

678
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,000
for men like me and you.

679
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,080
Face the flag, son, and face reality.

680
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,100
My mind is a globe with whirling transient nodes of thought

681
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,380
careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.

682
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,620
Our strength is the power of the sun.

683
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,980
And our freedoms are based in unity.

684
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,840
The flag is but a symbol, son.

685
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,000
The world's greatest nation.

686
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,280
As long as it keeps flying,

687
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,960
there's cause for celebration.

688
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,740
So do what you gotta do, but always keep in mind.

689
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,320
God has a heart on for Marines.

690
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Because we kill everything we see.

691
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,920
Face the flag, son.

692
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,500
And thank God it's still there.

693
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,380
It will always be there, son.

694
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,880
People will be doing what he wants to do,

695
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,100
but we will keep on doing all that he wants to do.

696
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,520
We have to change things and have the spirit change fight.

697
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,660
Until the 1880s when all the nations,

698
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,120
we saw baseball changing

699
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,360
and we saw the slowly growing

700
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,160
Reverend Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

701
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,280
in Extreme Union with

702
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,620
himself.

703
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,180
Extreme Union with himself?

704
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,220
A form of Tourette's Syndrome that affects

705
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,300
people only when they call radio.

706
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,080
Rosenheit Syndrome, eh?

707
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,420
I found a note on my desk

708
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,000
that said, a witch with

709
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,360
Tourette's. A witch with Tourette's?

710
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,020
Yeah, and I can't figure out what the heck

711
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,740
that note was supposed to refer to.

712
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,240
I want to see him go to war. Is that a warning to myself?

713
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,160
I want to see him go to war,

714
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
just so that there's a lot of dead people

715
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,500
all over the place.

716
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,160
You mean the awards in Baghdad?

717
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:09,820
Yeah.

718
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
I want to see dead people.

719
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,920
Yeah, he's going to be the new

720
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,860
Sheik of

721
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,520
Arabi.

722
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,780
Sheik Franks.

723
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
Can you see him with a

724
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,360
caftan on his forehead?

725
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,620
A caftan?

726
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,760
That's a pair of underpants.

727
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,800
Slice his throat.

728
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,920
Spice his head.

729
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,940
Get the barbecue.

730
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,400
Get the barbecue ready.

731
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
General Tommy,

732
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,360
your meat is my meat,

733
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,460
Frankfurter himself.

734
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,520
He views the world as his

735
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,040
hot dog, ready to

736
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,800
be barbecued and served

737
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,100
with a choice toxic mustard.

738
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
I want to be the mustard.

739
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,700
You are the mustard.

740
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,260
You're the glint in Tommy Franks' eye.

741
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,280
Look, it's the barrel of a tank.

742
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,440
This is for you, darling.

743
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,660
I got news for you.

744
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,740
Here's a tactical nuke.

745
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,080
Up your ass.

746
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,500
Jesus.

747
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,900
Get back, Baghdaddy.

748
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,640
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

749
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,380
Whatever happened to the Arabian Nights?

750
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,020
Don't those guys have, like, genies

751
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,460
and flying carpets and stuff?

752
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,960
Yeah.

753
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,420
And what about the...

754
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,540
Can't they, like, rub this lamp

755
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,000
and have hordes of scimitar-wielding

756
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,640
balloon pantalooned...

757
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,520
Turban.

758
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,800
Yeah, Alibaba.

759
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,620
40 feet.

760
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,100
Carpet armies.

761
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,520
Yeah.

762
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,300
What open sesame guys.

763
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,080
Right, open sesame guys.

764
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,840
I love the day.

765
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Make it happen.

766
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,420
Businessmen in boxer shorts.

767
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,680
Turbaned young fez drivers

768
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,160
in Pocono Oriental cabs.

769
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,400
Small, medium, and large-sized shakes.

770
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,100
All your bones included.

771
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,280
You're trying to kill my daddy.

772
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,320
I killed everybody's daddy, man.

773
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,140
They killed daddy.

774
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,640
Daddy Junior.

775
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,860
Well, things aren't going to get better.

776
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,760
I did kill my daddy.

777
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,420
We did it all.

778
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,060
We did it all.

779
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,340
We did whatever we could get our hands on

780
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,060
back in the 70s.

781
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,740
We did fucking handfuls of mushrooms,

782
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,600
pills, roots, coke, whatever it was.

783
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,860
We just fucking swallowed it, okay?

784
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,400
That's what we did.

785
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,400
Dennis Bleary.

786
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,680
He's Crispin Bleary.

787
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,320
He smoked too many hockey sticks.

788
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,920
I think he owes George Carlin an explanation.

789
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,780
Really, he does.

790
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,360
I thought he was George Carlin

791
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,400
until I heard him expectorate out the back door.

792
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,460
Out the back door.

793
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,660
What would Jesus do now?

794
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:37,980
War.

795
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,340
War.

796
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,940
War.

797
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,640
War.

798
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:39,920
War.

799
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,520
Healing.

800
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,680
Demons.

801
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,460
Racism.

802
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,560
Sexism.

803
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,600
Anti-Semitism.

804
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:45,980
Arab-bashing.

805
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,540
Anti-Islamism.

806
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,680
Gay-bashing.

807
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,240
War.

808
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,080
Britain.

809
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,580
Britain.

810
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:50,960
War.

811
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,600
War.

812
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,280
War.

813
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,800
War.

814
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,560
Jesus.

815
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,380
Jesus.

816
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,740
Yeah, I used that on the X-rated hour of Slack just last week.

817
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,160
The one that's not played on radio stations,

818
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,000
but only on...

819
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,220
The intranet.

820
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,220
And the internet.

821
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,260
I can't see.

822
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,380
Figen zikai ba?

823
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,480
That means,

824
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,780
Figen zikai ba?

825
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,140
Figen zikai ba?

826
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,020
That's on...

827
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,240
Oh.

828
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
Every time you guys cuss,

829
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,960
that ends up on a secret show.

830
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,860
There's a song going out for George.

831
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,520
The Maggots are breeding.

832
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,480
The king of the universe.

833
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,560
King of the universe.

834
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,480
King.

835
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,780
Rey del unerexo.

836
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,280
Rey del casino.

837
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,940
El imperador de tu casino.

838
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,660
Rey del mismo...

839
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,660
Rey delCение.

840
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,320
Rey delmas li.

841
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,520

842
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,580
Le funcionario, sí.

843
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,520
Sí, sí.

844
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,520


845
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,560
No.

846
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,020
No hay...

847
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,440
Peace.

848
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,440


849
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,440


850
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,600
Yo he Τpichoe cuando enék albumabas tu colega.

851
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:46,740
Le tratas o mercado.

852
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,460
Toc dracias de mi, Torro,

853
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,460


854
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:51,460


855
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,200
Yo te tengo una gente ot the

856
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,580
bnz

857
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,300
o

858
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,540
Y tú que eres...

859
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,720
Ya que no, no me previouslypsearías por los

860
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:01,740
las grandes encuestas pasaneras, en este juego pa'amanecer.

861
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,660
But you are a fool.

862
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,960
If you believe we can quack out of this maya...

863
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,860
Who gets the harems?

864
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,100
The harems?

865
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,060
Yeah, the harems.

866
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,200
I've heard a lot about harems in those palaces in Baghdad.

867
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,600
No, I just thought that was an esophageal grunt.

868
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,580
No, man.

869
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,620
You know, the sultans would get harems.

870
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,580
And there must be harems.

871
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,400
They don't have sultans anymore in Iraq.

872
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,760
Well, there's always...

873
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,360
Yeah, right.

874
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,680
Just like they don't have kings here, right?

875
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,160
Right.

876
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,320
It's an undemocratic people's republic.

877
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,260
Yeah, I suppose they do.

878
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:36,920
Yeah.

879
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah.

880
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,500
Sultans.

881
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:38,920
Yeah.

882
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,200
Sultans of Swig.

883
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
Sultans of the ornament.

884
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,680
Chairman Mao had a harem.

885
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,300
Pharaohs.

886
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,880
Jack Kennedy had a harem.

887
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,500
And you, sir.

888
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,380
Where do they keep the pharaohs?

889
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,460
Or no Jack Kennedy.

890
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,540
I know Mao Zedong, my friend.

891
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,280
Hey, where do they keep the pharaohs?

892
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,460
I know Mao Zedong.

893
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,600
Actually, that's a pretty old turf there.

894
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,460
That's, you know, the Tigris and Euphrates.

895
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,600
Oh, yeah, that's the oldest.

896
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
It's the birthplace of civilization.

897
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,520
Yeah.

898
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah.

899
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,060
They're afraid.

900
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,380
They're afraid.

901
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,340
The Fertile Crescent.

902
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,640
Yeah.

903
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,160
Speaking of Fertile Crescent.

904
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:12,140
The amount of archaeological cool stuff that's going to get buried a little deeper is just

905
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,640
horrifying.

906
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,060
Well, that's the hex theory.

907
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,400
But that's up to Saddam.

908
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,020
That's up to Saddam Hussein.

909
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,000
It's his choice.

910
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,020
This land is cursed by a Sumerian god, and you must get rid of it and destroy it.

911
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,320
No?

912
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,340
Something like that?

913
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Only it was just going to get buried, but you know it's going to get smashed to smithereens.

914
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,780
Just like that.

915
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,140
Just like that.

916
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,520
I've got to say, ancient civilization in which the ladies did not wear shirts.

917
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,640
Oh, Manoa.

918
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,360
Yeah, right.

919
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,040
The Manoans.

920
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,260
Yes, my favorite civilization.

921
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,740
Yes.

922
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,620
They had the cool labyrinths and the bull-headed monster guys.

923
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,600
They would ride bulls and all the men would applaud.

924
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,780
And they'd quit.

925
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,240
Yeah, and they'd make fun of the Cretans.

926
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,420
We need just one victory.

927
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,820
Just like we do.

928
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,420
And we're on to North Korea.

929
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Church of the sub-Cretans.

930
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,600
That's what we should tell everybody over there in the war zones tonight.

931
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,180
God, me dance.

932
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,540
That's what the Führer used to say.

933
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,000
God, me dance.

934
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,280
And we're saying it again.

935
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,640
God, me dance.

936
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,340
God, me dance.

937
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,080
What does that mean, guys?

938
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,700
It means God is with us.

939
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,160
They used to put a rocket on the me dance.

940
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:10,260
I'm putting rockets on the me dance.

941
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,360
God is with us.

942
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,480
Oh, yeah, sure.

943
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,500
They believed it in those days and they believe it now.

944
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,880
In the bowling alleys and parking lots around America, in stubby Sam City, in Carl's Magic

945
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,100
Theater, every place you might go and have your hair tortured or maybe have your feet

946
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,320
upturned, they believe the Schmitt.

947
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,740
The Schmittagogical creature called war.

948
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,060
War.

949
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,500
It takes care of everything.

950
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,740
A-sha-lo-l-i-la-la-la-bob-la-la.

951
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,360
A-sha-lo-l-i-la-la-la-la-bob-

952
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,200
Bob Akbar?

953
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,200
Bob Akbar.

954
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,800
He is great.

955
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,500
Greater than my shoe size and twice as small as my cranium.

956
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,780
Bob Akbar.

957
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:09,500
To begin with, it may be surprising to know that radiation is invisible rays that we call

958
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,960
radiation. They are about the size of table salt or fine sand. We don't worry about radiation.

959
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,440
Radiation would not affect us much, for instance, because any material will keep the penetrating

960
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,540
rays from hurting us. Within an hour after a massive enemy attack, fallout in the vicinity

961
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:34,740
of any nuclear groundburst will be destroyed beyond repair. Suppose a nuclear explosion

962
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:42,340
takes place at 12 noon. By 1 o'clock, all the fallout is down. If fallout settles on your food,

963
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:49,140
the food itself isn't harmed or made radioactive. Fallout swallowed accidentally with food or

964
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,720
in drinking water would do you no harm, so we would not have to take precautions using

965
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,440
everyday methods of food preparation. And hungry people should not be denied animals.

966
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:05,120
Because of possible contamination. If we remember these facts, if we act intelligent,

967
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,320
we can increase our chances of nuclear attack. Many people have difficulty understanding

968
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,860
how blood and tissues are pulled up into the mushroom cloud. That's why the federal government

969
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,720
has a nationwide program. The goal is a raging nuclear furnace that shoots out showers of

970
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,960
fallout. Adequate fallout for every man, woman and child.

971
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:35,900
This goal can be reached. For with radiation, we can face the facts about the nuclear age.

972
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,500
Music

973
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,440
Camalian

974
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,320
Papa Lord

975
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,480
Well I haven't seen the phone ring and I'm going to be watching for DJ A because he's

976
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,940
not going to be able to get in tonight either.

977
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,940
There are new security measures here because of the terrorist activity going on.

978
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,540
The homeland is locked down.

979
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,840
And there was a Patriot Act stamped to the door for your reading edifice.

980
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,780
Dave, have you looked in a mirror? There's one stamped on your forehead.

981
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,100
Licked the postage stamp, man.

982
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,820
So I can look through my...

983
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,720
So you don't forget for one second what the rules are, buddy.

984
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,920
One second.

985
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,460
You can't really forget the rules.

986
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,640
Are you going to be a team player?

987
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm watching the phone. I see no DJ A.

988
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,120
Are you with us or are you against us? Private? Are you privates private or are they mine?

989
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,800
I belong to you, sir. You're privates are my privates and you're privates are my privates

990
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,180
are your privates.

991
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,500
Just keep your privates private, okay?

992
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:51,160
Next week, America enters the torture zone on torturing the enemy part three with a celebrity

993
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,140
I want to get the fuck out of here.

994
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,940
Next week, it might be a very different...

995
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,100
Hey, hey.

996
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,380
Situation.

997
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,540
Starring downtown Julie Brown.

998
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,640
Kaz Kanaba.

999
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,640
Color coded.

1000
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,400
Johnny's get a little job in the back.

1001
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,460
Keep us from broadcasting this stuff.

1002
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,580
Tommy Franksberger.

1003
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,760
The broadcast industry of America.

1004
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,280
The shelf-towed people who live in your...

1005
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
I just don't know what to do.

1006
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,320
I thought I'd come and ask you.

1007
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,080
Military action to destroy them with weapons of mass destruction.

1008
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,420
Well, um...

1009
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,060
This nation has weapons of mass destruction.

1010
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah.

1011
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,080
He is acting the insincerely to actors.

1012
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,160
Well, thanks anyway for talking to me.

1013
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,680
Well...

1014
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,380
Why am I in London?

1015
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:56,080
Because, because faith, faith, faith, power, faith, Moses, Joshua, marching faith, Jesus, marching faith, marching God, dark light, racism, sexism.

1016
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,920
There's a militarism, new world order.

1017
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,760
Heal hope, healing hope, healing hope, healing peace.

1018
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,100
Hope, healing hope, healing hope, healing peace.

1019
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,940
Peace.

1020
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,080
Hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.

1021
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:06,900
I love you.

1022
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,640
Children, children, children.

1023
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,180
Hope.

1024
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,160
Thou, thou, faces, places.

1025
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,860
Hope, hope, hope.

1026
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,560
Love you.

1027
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,180
Light...

1028
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:40,320
It was another normal night and I got done fighting with my wife, so I went down to the bar and just made all take and draw.

1029
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,980
Since I was a little kid, they've been the two best friends that man could ever hope for in this world.

1030
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:54,320
Now I'm a normal guy and I work all the way for my money, and I fear the good Lord like I know I should.

1031
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,060
I say I hate, I like, I wish I knew the Application Plan as well I arrive at the needle, now in my shirt It just見 Fortunately, it's alright to holy alpha, but it looks prettier than it is to see.

1032
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,060


1033
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,020
I ain't no new age cook, but I gotta get this off my chest

1034
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,740
And put this tragedy behind me now for good

1035
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,440
I remember getting drunk and I remember falling down

1036
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,960
And someone laid me on a pool table and I'd have been consumed

1037
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Then through the blinding lights two creatures stared into my eyes

1038
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,460
It was at the jukebox or a flying saucer spinning round the room

1039
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,760
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

1040
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,120
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

1041
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,920
Well, it hit me like trouble in the back of my head

1042
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,640
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

1043
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,120
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

1044
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,660
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

1045
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,760
This must have been an abduction, Lord, cause I don't know what happened

1046
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,360
It hit me like the bolt out of the blue

1047
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,800
And I think they're a little crazy, but I know that it weren't them

1048
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,540
Say the things that they can do and never do

1049
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,760
Well, when at last I woke, both my legs they had been broke

1050
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,780
And both my eyes were black and my ears were stringing padded

1051
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,100
I'd seen enough of nasty things, but not enough of nasty things

1052
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,120
And I tell myself this couldn't have been a member of the human race

1053
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,480
Had to be them sex-crazed little green men from outer space

1054
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,200
Cause it hit me like the shovel in the back of my head

1055
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,020
Knocked me clean out of my shoes

1056
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,660
And when I woke up, Lord, I wished that I was dead

1057
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,240
I had got off the case of those abduction blues

1058
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,100
Yes, it must have been an abduction, Lord, cause I don't know what happened

1059
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,100


1060
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,600
The world will have to hit me like a bulls-eye on the blue

1061
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,140
I think it's really crazy, but I know that it won't happen

1062
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,180
Say the things that they can or will never do

1063
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,780
Never do

1064
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,920
The Ballad of Zeke and Earl

1065
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,040
Hank Floyd and the Swerving Headlights

1066
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
From Interstellar Cattle Drive

00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,960
That's www.swervingheadlights.com

1068
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,160
Before that, Lemur Collages

1069
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,120
War is hell, my friends

1070
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,080
But Bob brings hope and confusion

1071
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,680
1903

1072
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,020
This might be 1903, Chaz

1073
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,480
The conspiracy is so powerful

1074
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,300
That we don't know what year this really is

1075
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,800
And Bob could show up any second

1076
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,120
For all we know, it's July

1077
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,500
Sure, there's snow on the ground

1078
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,100
But it might be July, for all we know

1079
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,940
They might have turned everything

1080
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,660
We don't even know if this is Earth, man

1081
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,740
No, we don't even know if the polar caps are the same ones we're wearing

1082
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,660
In fact

1083
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:25,080
This might, for all we know

1084
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,080
Be a hideously polluted Mars

1085
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,480
And what we call Mars

1086
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,240
Oh, no way, man

1087
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,320
After we polluted it the first time

1088
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,900
Or they polluted it

1089
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,220
I had the same, I had a parallel thought

1090
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,560
I won't say that the parallel lines met

1091
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,200
But I had a parallel thought

1092
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,120
That they had gone into our brains

1093
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,880
Deep into our corpus callosum and the other pithy parts

1094
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,900
And they had reprogrammed everything

1095
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,920
To such a point

1096
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,820
That I was looking out my window

1097
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,100
And I was on another planet

1098
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,020
And we had all been moved in our sleep

1099
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,000
Well,

1100
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,620
It wasn't us

1101
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,300
It was the powers that be

1102
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,220
The big guys, you know, the ones that weigh over 500, 600 pounds

1103
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,260
Not to mention the ones inside your own head, dude

1104
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,200
Well, they don't live in Telemetry City

1105
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,760
And they don't give me commands

1106
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,880
The ones in my head, dude

1107
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,700
Do you remember how to get to Shell Beach?

1108
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,320
Yeah, it was very distinctly a Shell Beach experience

1109
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,280
Right, like that movie

1110
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,980
Cool City or Dark City

1111
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,180
Or Dark Coolness or whatever it was

1112
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,340
Night Town

1113
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,680
Night Town, yeah

1114
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,880
Going down

1115
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,080
Going down

1116
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,880
Going down

1117
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,260
Hey, but I think the big news of the week is really the, uh

1118
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,600
That Pioneer 10 winked off

1119
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,800
He knows how to cue

1120
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,120
He knows, man

1121
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,720
Pioneer

1122
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,700
Pioneer 10

1123
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,900
28 years out there

1124
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,440
And it's out there now

1125
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,820
Right this very moment

1126
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,420
There's a piece of us

1127
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,560
Booking ass

1128
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,520
Out of the solar system

1129
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,160
And it's manned by two kiboshes and a piece of pie

1130
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,020
And that is science, man

1131
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,800
That is the expansion

1132
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,780
Of our ever-lessened

1133
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,080
Planetary system

1134
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,060
Ever-pubescent

1135
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,120
Lusty waves

1136
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,820
20,000 years from now

1137
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,920
A robot will find it

1138
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,740
And sell it on eBay for billions

1139
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,460
Because it will be the oldest

1140
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,760
Known thing built by the extinct human race

1141
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,080
That is well said

1142
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,340
Because I thought you were going to say

1143
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,060
He's going to smell it and sell it to an ape

1144
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,200
And start it all over again

1145
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,380
You know, that's how it usually starts

1146
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,840
Well, that may be how it started at one point

1147
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,440
But I personally don't think so

1148
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,240
There's so many lines converging

1149
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,060
I think that the Yeti's

1150
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,580
Force evolved the humans

1151
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,980
So that they would send that pioneer thing out into space

1152
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,440
It smells like rotting garbage, though

1153
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,340
To the country western singers in outer space

1154
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,640
Yeah, and Johnny Paycheck died

1155
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,820
Well, we talked about that last week

1156
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,580
Well, he actually fell asleep

1157
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,500
And nobody's been able to wake him up yet

1158
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,800
So they threw a big old wake

1159
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,960
And they tossed him in the air

1160
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,280
Is this this week's show or last week's show?

1161
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,460
I don't know anymore

1162
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,120
Johnny Cash's birthday was this today

1163
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,300
Or a week ago today?

1164
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,460
January is the Julyuary

1165
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
It's one of those

1166
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,220
70 years old

1167
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,080
How old was Johnny?

1168
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,040
Your babies grow up to be couples

1169
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,200
Mamas don't let your babies

1170
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,700
Don't let them smoke, froth, and dress up like girls

1171
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:16,460
Grow little titties and go on girls

1172
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,780
Don't make them grow little titties

1173
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,580
We'll try not, moms

1174
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,740
Don't tell them not to

1175
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,320
That's just what they'll want to do

1176
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,900
Mamas, don't let your babies go

1177
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,520
To X Day

1178
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Don't let them have

1179
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,160
Operations that change their sexes

1180
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,080
It's a twisted, sick, demented bunch of people

1181
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,280
Mamas, please

1182
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,560
If you hear me

1183
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,920
If your babies do survive the war

1184
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,560
If they do come home from the war

1185
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,800
Don't let them go to X Day

1186
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,300
Because they never really come home

1187
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,420
From X Day

1188
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,280
They won't be babies no more

1189
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,300
You think a war might spank their booty?

1190
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,320
X Day is going to spank their brains out

1191
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
This will be the sixth

1192
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,180
X Day, or what we call

1193
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,440
Sixth Sex Day

1194
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,740
Sixth

1195
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,760
There will be some six sex

1196
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,260
There will be six hundred and sixty-six

1197
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,100
Sick

1198
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,660
Sex monkeys

1199
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,020
Spelled

1200
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:08,860
Sick, sick, sick

1201
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,260
With S-I-C-S-I-C

1202
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,300
As is, as is, as is

1203
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,840
Spelling out Bob

1204
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,020
With their butts

1205
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,180
Mooning the sky

1206
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,340
For the satellites to read

1207
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,020
And you'll be the quote marks on the end

1208
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,780
I'll be the queen of procreation

1209
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,600
Your two cheeks

1210
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,380
I'll be the lizard woman

1211
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,520
Pointing up at the satellites

1212
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,220
Of Ashcroft

1213
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,100
Will be the quotes on Bob's butt name

1214
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,540
Attention!

1215
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,220
Attention!

1216
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,320
This is your beloved leader

1217
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,540
Og the Exalted

1218
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,940
There will be a special giant joy rally today

1219
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,860
At Og Memorial Stadium

1220
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,820
First let me say that this trip was made possible

1221
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,980
Only by our dauntless chief

1222
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,340
Og the Magnificent

1223
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,020
Introducer of Og Power

1224
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,580
Which runs most of our industry

1225
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,420
Naturally I protected government property

1226
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,380
By making the saucer invisible

1227
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,520
Yes, I brought the secrets back with me

1228
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,300
And here they are

1229
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,820
The big secret is of course oil

1230
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,920
Which has brought a better life

1231
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,860
To all the people in the USA

1232
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,500
But the key to making oil work is oil

1233
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,420
To make it work for everybody

1234
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,100
Is competition

1235
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,900
Fellow Martians

1236
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,100
I thank you

1237
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,420
Mmm

1238
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,540
You know what this means Cosmic

1239
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,880
You bet I do Og

1240
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,820
It means that you're through

1241
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,140
So why don't you get lost

1242
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,580
Yes the real secret is not only a great source of energy

1243
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,540
But also the freedom to make it work for everybody

1244
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,480
And that's why I'm here today to tell you that the real secret is not only a great source of energy but also the freedom to make it work for everybody

1245
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,500
And if you have both of these things

1246
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,680
Any goal is possible

1247
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,100
It's destination unlimited

1248
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:10,940
Man continually strives to replace the old with the new

1249
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,460
A quarter of a mile high skyscraper's tower

1250
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,740
With convenient rest and recreational facilities for all

1251
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,700
On many of the buildings are landing decks

1252
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,580
For helicopters and auto gyros

1253
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,980
Rich in sunshine is the city of 1960

1254
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,920
On all express city thoroughfares

1255
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,940
The rights of way have been so rooted

1256
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,940
As to displace outmoded business sections

1257
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,320
And undesirable slum areas whenever possible

1258
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,800
The

1259
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,120
The

1260
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,220
The

1261
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,020
The

1262
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,680
The

1263
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:21,720
The

1264
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:21,780
The

1265
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,960
The The

1266
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,140
The The

1267
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,460
The The

1268
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,820
The the

1269
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,700
The The

1270
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:42,720
The

1271
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,040
The The

1272
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,380
The The The The The The The The The The The The The The

1273
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,440
If now wasn't a better time than any, I don't know what is.

1274
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,160
Yeah, really, man.

1275
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,900
Don't look at me.

1276
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,860
Well, we're trying not to.

1277
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,160
I've got a Bob's phone number.

1278
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,880
But you're right there.

1279
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,440
No, no, I'm just a PR back, man.

1280
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,680
I'm supposed to go.

1281
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:00,780
Why?

1282
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,800
We don't know.

1283
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,580
Well, we don't.

1284
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,560
We don't know what year it is, and we don't know.

1285
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,660
I know this.

1286
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,640
Bob said that the X's will come July 5th, 1998.

1287
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,780
Obviously, it is not yet July 5th, 1998.

1288
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,540
1998, perhaps we'll be lucky, and tomorrow will be.

1289
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:22,440
You're off by 14 years by the Mayan calendar, which is given and fixed as July 5th, 2012.

1290
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,980
The urine calendar is covered with some sort of yellowish juice.

1291
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,640
Mayan, as opposed to urine.

1292
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,700
Yours and mine.

1293
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,400
Urine and mine.

1294
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:31,600
Oh!

1295
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,720
Yeah, oh, oh.

1296
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,620
You were talking about the Andean calendar of the...

1297
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,700
The prepubescent one.

1298
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,240
Husky people of the Andes.

1299
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,220
Yes, the Husky.

1300
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,300
And what exactly happens?

1301
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,780
At 7 a.m.?

1302
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,720
On 2012?

1303
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,020
A bunch of the Mayan elder gods come down from the clouds.

1304
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,280
That's what happens.

1305
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,940
Of the year 1998.

1306
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,780
Bob's good buddies from Planet X, who happen to be sex goddesses, will...

1307
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,280
I just feel betrayed, Sting.

1308
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,900
...come down or up or in from another dimension.

1309
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,300
They'll arrive at some way.

1310
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,200
Yeah.

1311
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,220
Or rather, we shall be vacated.

1312
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,820
We will vacate this evacuation chamber.

1313
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,620
This great...

1314
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:20,720
...latrine called Earth Farm 1, where the aliens have raised us in order to feed off of our anguish and pain.

1315
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,880
Raised in our own filth.

1316
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,080
And they'll have a great dessert of those left behind in their anguish and pain.

1317
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,780
They especially do love the ones who were raised in their own filth, don't they?

1318
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:36,140
The slackness are punished and the dues-paying squeaky ministers are squeaky clean and...

1319
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:36,900
Rubbed.

1320
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,440
Rubbed down.

1321
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,060
Pure of impurities.

1322
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,380
Peter the Parrot.

1323
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,120
Purified by Bobby.

1324
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,680
Wait, the biggest thing.

1325
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:41,800
And Connie.

1326
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,480
How can you have Oren call home?

1327
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,040
No.

1328
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,760
Oren, please call home.

1329
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:46,960
Hey.

1330
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,040
His honey is irked.

1331
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:48,960
How could we...

1332
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,980
I mean, yeah.

1333
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,220
I mean, but wait a minute.

1334
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:51,620
Hey.

1335
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,100
Hey.

1336
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,260
Now, come on.

1337
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,260
Like, dudes, like, hold on.

1338
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,160
Now, hey.

1339
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:55,940
Wait, everybody.

1340
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,360
Like, put the pipe down, man.

1341
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,760
Yeah.

1342
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,340
Hold on.

1343
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,960
Just open those eardrums.

1344
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,380
Mr. Rogers died.

1345
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,220
Once again.

1346
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:07,600
We have another casualty.

1347
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,240
The real end times are near when Mr. Rogers makes his escape.

1348
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,680
He tried to get in that little...

1349
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,040
He got off.

1350
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,620
...little train.

1351
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,900
He got off, man.

1352
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,380
He got off.

1353
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,840
He tried to shrink his mind and get in the little train and take off to Smallville.

1354
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,140
You know what?

1355
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,380
When I heard Mr. Rogers died, I got real scared.

1356
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,860
Well, but he's with his grandpa now with that...

1357
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:25,360
That's because of the implant.

1358
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:25,800
...loss.

1359
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,640
I got real scared.

1360
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,420
Man, because I just know if there's no Mr. Rogers here anymore, there's nothing to keep

1361
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,560
the aliens from toasting this motherfucking place.

1362
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,700
Chaz, what about the Teletubbies?

1363
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,600
It's the implant.

1364
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:35,960
No.

1365
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,420
That's why he got scared when Mr. Rogers died.

1366
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,800
Yeah, they'll be leading the charge.

1367
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,780
It's because of the micro angel.

1368
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,420
Once again, you guys, you don't get scared when Mr. Rogers dies.

1369
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,240
You feel sad.

1370
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:45,620
See?

1371
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,040
Look at how screwed up he is because of that implant.

1372
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:48,540
I don't feel sad.

1373
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,340
I'm scared as hell.

1374
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,500
Your implant is not even put in the right place to hide your neck.

1375
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,180
What's going to keep George Bush from just nuking the whole earth now that Mr. Rogers

1376
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,660
is gone?

1377
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,300
Well, they used to meet regularly to discuss policy and so forth.

1378
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,940
No more beautiful days in neighborhood earth, boys and girls.

1379
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,880
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the reports that enemy planes are approaching.

1380
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,560
In less than three hours, an H-bomb might fall over Portland.

1381
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,460
But like myself, I think you're going to be very interested in this story that we're going

1382
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,940
to tell you.

1383
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:33,280
And in this age of missiles and man-made moons, it takes on added significance.

1384
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,920
There are no actors in this story, but there are a lot of people.

1385
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,860
And I'm sure you've heard of them.

1386
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,460
The people of the city of Portland, Oregon.

1387
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:48,480
And what happened to them, or could happen to them, on a day that we'll call X.

1388
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,720
Holding hands, waiting for that fog horn to blow.

1389
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,980
It's been three hours now and he said he was never going to come again.

1390
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,800
But I knew I'd just stay here and wait.

1391
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,900
I could hear the footsteps from two blocks away.

1392
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,040
Those big chubby feet slapping against the pavement.

1393
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,860
Yeah, it was the first time I'd seen him.

1394
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,860


1395
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,860


1396
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,860


1397
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,860


1398
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,860


1399
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,440
It was the sound of the s-w for War Bush.

1400
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:15,020
And his buddy Sodom and S-Mack-Em-Hobby.

1401
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,260
Yeah, they thought they had the streets sealed up.

1402
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,140
They thought they were clean to the bean.

1403
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,660
Yeah, they thought they were the ones to run the whole show.

1404
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,800
But I was taking pictures, see.

1405
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,180
And I was writing everything down.

1406
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,660
Okay, stop the car here.

1407
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,620
This is Sbarro's restaurant.

1408
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,840
I'm going to have to go in for a couple of days.

1409
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:39,840


1410
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:39,840


1411
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:39,840


1412
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:39,840


1413
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:39,840


1414
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,400
for a little while and pretend like we're talking to each other.

1415
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,540
We both know there's no need for talk anymore.

1416
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,840
No need for talk.

1417
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,520
Everything's going on behind the scenes.

1418
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,900
Behind the scenes.

1419
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,280
Everyone knows that everyone blows.

1420
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,120
There's nothing going on in front.

1421
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,040
And there's nothing going on behind your eyes.

1422
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,900
But behind your back, we're doing plenty.

1423
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,000
And behind the curtain.

1424
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,460
Behind the curtain.

1425
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,460
Beyond the curtain.

1426
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,300
You, the representations of people we represent.

1427
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,680
We would like to know that we are not sham.

1428
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,180
We are not focused and smoky.

1429
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,820
We are real and we represent your representations.

1430
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,380
We're behind each and every one of you Americans.

1431
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,400
Whispering funny things in the back of your neck.

1432
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,700
You're not alone.

1433
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:37,620
Hello.

1434
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,300
I'm gonna be able to pay my bills.

1435
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,320
I can't pay anything.

1436
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:46,160
Sometimes I just wish I could take a car and go out and shoot a goddamn partner.

1437
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,200
Too many visions, man.

1438
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:50,960
Too many dreams.

1439
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,540
I saw the mushroom cloud again last night and it wasn't in my suit, man.

1440
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,320
It was in my ears and my eyes.

1441
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,020
Everybody is watching.

1442
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,200
Calm down, man.

1443
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,060
Like the walls of Jermicho.

1444
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,480
You're inesserable!

1445
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,980
K

1446
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:36,580
Peep!

1447
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:36,580


1448
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,000
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1449
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,820
44118, that's where you send things to me to play.

1450
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:52,240
The show, The Hour of Slack, is the voice of the church of the subgenius.

1451
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,040
More about that at www.subgenius.com,

1452
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,420
which includes a catalog of books and other things.

1453
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,120
Friends.

1454
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,380
Why don't you come on over to my joint?

1455
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,320
Why don't you stink up my joint the way I stinked up my...

1456
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:08,860
Okay.

1457
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,740
Why do you want to help me so much?

1458
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,120
None of this made any sense at all.

1459
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,140
There was no connective tissue.

1460
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,820
There wasn't one.

1461
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,540
Pioneer firing turned off.

1462
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:22,340
Mr. Rogers tuned out.

1463
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,040
Good afternoon, we've been mayhem.

1464
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,820
He got off.

1465
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:25,960
Well, yeah.

1466
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,660
He's aboard that ship now.

1467
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,340
He was being the board.

1468
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,720
I think our jobs are cut out for us.

1469
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,240
It's time for us now to build our own ships.

1470
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,240
To meet.

1471
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,600
Bob halfway, perhaps.

1472
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,580
Our ships are cardboard cutouts.

1473
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Bob beckons.

1474
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,900
The men from Planet X are beckoning to us.

1475
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,420
They're saying,

1476
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,040
lift, pull yourself up by your own boob straps.

1477
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,480
You boots.

1478
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,340
You silly platoons.

1479
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,340
The beckoning.

1480
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:51,740
Pull yourself.

1481
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,580
Yank yourself.

1482
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,400
Lift yourself up by your own straps.

1483
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:54,420
Yank.

1484
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,640
Yank and wank.

1485
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,260
Wank for Bob.

1486
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,740
Wank for Bob.

1487
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,440
Wank as if your very life depended on it.

1488
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,160
What the hell?

1489
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,360
It's life, I tell you.

1490
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:04,920
Hey.

1491
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,580
You've been listening to ESO Radio.

1492
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:07,540
Swamp Radio.

1493
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:08,480
My name's Chaz.

1494
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,520
Lonesome cowboy Dave.

1495
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,800
Princess Wee Ardo.

1496
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,480
The Reverend Ivan Stagg.

1497
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,120
Wank.

1498
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Wank you fool.

1499
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:14,980
Wank.

1500
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,060
Wank as if your very life depended on it.

1501
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,020
This is James A. Sievert.

1502
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:18,500
No wheels.

1503
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,620
And the radio voice of the fields on State University.

1504
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,220
Till next week.

1505
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,980
Keep your hat on tight.

1506
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,420
You're back to the wind.

1507
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,500
And you're sagging the saddle.

1508
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,720
You're sagging Princess Wee.

1509
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,020
Wank.

1510
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,320
You wanker.

1511
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,320
Wank you wankers as if your life, it does, your life depended on it.

1512
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:35,360
You're sagging the saddle.

1513
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,360


1514
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,360


1515
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,360


1516
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,600
Oh, say, on your way out, could you kind of tell the nurses what a hero I am?

1517
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,860
Now, why didn't I think of that?

1518
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,920
Is that the hero?

1519
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,880
Oh, yeah, that's him lying right there.

1520
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,240
You're a good man, Philo.

1521
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,360
Ooh, it hurts right here.

1522
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:51,560
Huh?

1523
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:51,980
What's he doing?

1524
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1525
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1526
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1527
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1528
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1529
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1530
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1531
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1532
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1533
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1534
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1535
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980


1536
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:51,980
