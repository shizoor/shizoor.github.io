1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Now you've turned your record over, and you're all ready for some more sing-time sing-along songs.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:06,560
Bob?

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,540
You could actually save people from death.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,360
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,180
You killed a fly with a fly head.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,040
She killed a human with a human head.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,020
If she murdered, so did you.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,660
I know.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,100
But I was deranged.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,600
Yes, yes.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,320
It could have been the subgenius power of the Force.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,280
I know there are things about the Force that they're not telling me.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,580
Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,800
Even the nature of the dark side.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:12,020
If one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi.

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:19,040
If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force.

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm thinking of my back.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,860
It's either too tight or it's too slack.

19
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,080
99

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,760
That's all it is.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
99

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,760
99

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,580
How much?

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,220
99

25
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,700
99

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,660
99

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,400
How much?

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,500
99

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,000
99

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,140
99

31
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,340
99

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,340


33
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,500
That was Keith Richards with that song, 999.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,020
A little clip of it anyway.

36
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,340
Because, friends, this is Hour of Slack number 9.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,260
999.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,700
And it's a salute to Bob show.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,500
Because 999 is in fact the number of Bob.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,380
Because Bob isn't the Antichrist.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
Bob is the anti-Antichrist.

42
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,560
He's not the Christ.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,480
He's just the one that messes up the Antichrist.

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,340
Not because he's a good guy.

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,220
Just because he's Bob.

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,340
And, friends, there's so much more to this.

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,700
Magic.

48
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,260
In this number of Bob 999.

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,640
Did you know that 2 times 999 equals 1998?

50
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,780
The date the world ends?

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,280
Uh, uh, two weeks from this recording time, in fact.

52
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,920
Did you know that 3 times 666 equals 1998?

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,200
But that 6 times 333 also equals 1998.

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,320
And 333 is the number of the...

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,440
anti-Bob.

56
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
So happy

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
X-Day, friends.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
And so now let's let

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Norrell Preff

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,840
take us now into

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,020
the Bob Hour.

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,500
Join us now for

63
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,580
the Bob Hour coming to you from the campus

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,500
of Bob. Our speaker today is Bob.

65
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,060
The title of his message is

66
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,580
According to the Flesh.

67
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,700
There is much potential in this room.

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,020
I am stark naked.

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,440
Naked according to the flesh.

70
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,800
We are equipped.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,320
We have what we need, young person.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Think about that grace that saw you

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,560
as a spiritual corpse and blew you.

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
When you want to be full-time,

75
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,560
submission is expected.

76
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,060
The scope

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,760
is expansive.

78
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,460
It is going everywhere.

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,460
The blood and the

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,080
gore that we find ourselves in.

81
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,680
The sin, the stain of iniquity.

82
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,240
A mood or an attitude

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,820
of negativism.

84
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,020
I shared a story yesterday with Bob

85
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,000
about his father.

86
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,060
He came up to me and he had this wild-eyed

87
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,820
look in his face and he said,

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
Bob, we'll do a mental exercise.

89
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Live in the context of history.

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,980
History of blood

91
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,260
and gore and violence and sin

92
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,800
dealt the

93
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,940
existence of

94
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,300
human history.

95
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm going higher someday.

96
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,700
What are you going to do about it?

97
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,740
Bob had a large and wonderful head.

98
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,280
I did whatever he needed me to do.

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,940
I gulped and stopped breathing.

100
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,160
I was pregnant.

101
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,080
Because all of our worthless

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,860
financial resources.

103
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,860
I studied the essence of Bob,

104
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,240
which, by the way, is the official name of our Savior,

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,760
according to the flesh.

106
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,840
You've been listening to the Bob Hour,

107
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,700
coming to you from the campus of Bob.

108
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,480
Send a check, send a check, send a check, check, check, check, check.

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,900
Sponsored by Bob.

110
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
What's going to happen to your children?

111
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
What's going to happen to your children

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,680
when this society we've created,

113
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,340
this society we've created,

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,380
air-conditioned,

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,840
air-conditioned,

116
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,620
station wagons with wooden sides,

117
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,240
station wagons with wooden sides,

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,040
cautious indeed,

119
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,620
a retired actor,

120
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:24,780
indeed,

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,660
orange hail,

122
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,680
orange hail,

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,100
orange hail,

124
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
What happens when that collapses?

125
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,980
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

126
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,440
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

127
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,740
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

128
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,380
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

129
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,720
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

130
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

131
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
But until that day,

132
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,080
the power and wisdom of Bob

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,100
can help us break their mind control

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,160
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

135
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,500
Hey!

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,660
Hey!

137
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,280
What's going on here?

138
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,980
Along with Bob,

139
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
the pursuit of slack,

140
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,360
and a conspiracy of pinks,

141
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,520
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

142
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,980
According to church doctrine,

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,940
on July 5th, 1998,

144
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,340
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

145
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,700
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,960
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

147
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,040
They're going to...

148
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,820
They will put us...

149
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,380
They will put us out of our misery

150
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,100
unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand

151
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,480
that there is something on Earth worth saving.

152
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,140
And only the subgenii,

153
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
the dues-paying, book-buying,

154
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,940
receipt-in-the-pocket,

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,140
paid in full to the church subgenii,

156
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,720
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

157
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
The rest of them?

158
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,760
It's a tough world, Jack.

159
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,920
Ten,

160
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,600
nine,

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,320
eight,

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,140
seven,

163
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,880
six,

164
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,400
five,

165
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,660
four,

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,380
three,

167
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,220
two,

168
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,280
one!

169
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,300
Yeah!

170
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,960
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,520
They destroyed the world.

172
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,020
So, what's going on?

173
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,620
Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

174
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,040
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

175
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,660
Martial law is now nationwide.

176
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,800
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

177
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:36,020
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

178
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,720
Bob?

179
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,840
Colorado channel.

180
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,700
This is a class one emergency.

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,740
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

182
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,980
Stay in your homes!

183
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,260
Stay in your homes!

184
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh, my God!

185
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,000
I got exactly what I wanted!

186
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,920
Ha ha ha ha!

187
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,720
Woo!

188
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,120
Woo!

189
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,260
Woo!

190
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,480
How long you been on Borg Bongo, John?

191
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
I mean, Jane.

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,980
About 15 minutes now.

193
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,320
Oh, James, I thought it was 15 years.

194
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,020
I've been on for 15,000 years.

195
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, there's no real time, is there?

196
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,560
No, it's whatever time you want to stay or have or be on.

197
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, my God, it just never ends.

198
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,300
It's like a loop.

199
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,280
It's time to go.

200
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


201
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


202
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


203
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


204
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


205
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


206
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


207
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


208
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


209
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,280


210
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,620
I've been to theuest place in my life.

211
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,560
My name's James Van praise as probably the most old lutce said in the damn tv show isn't

212
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,820
There's nothing like the face of Bob.

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,720
about.

214
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm.

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,260


216
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,260


217
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,260


218
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,260


219
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,600
There's nothing like it you'll ever see.

220
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,140
A face as happy as it can be.

221
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,440
There's nothing like the face of a...

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,700
Bob.

223
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,840
The great American...

224
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,280
Bob.

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,620
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

226
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,740
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

227
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,620
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

228
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,200
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,660
as those which were first called flying saucers

230
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,860
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals

231
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,160
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity.

232
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,120
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories

233
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,020
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people.

234
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,200
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

235
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,160
Suddenly everything went black.

236
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,440
And I...

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,400
I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room

238
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,720
where nobody was listening to me.

239
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,420
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone

240
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,140
and not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights

241
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,820
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair

242
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,020
and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

243
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,900
with lights flashing off rhythmically.

244
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,740
And it was a small man with a swollen head and hideously deformed eyes

245
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,180
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

246
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,420
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

247
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,740
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,160
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

249
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,500
And they didn't say anything.

250
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,460
They just kept flashing those lights at me

251
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,060
and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

252
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
And the man with the funny head, the leader,

253
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,260
the man with the strange grin and the pipe...

254
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,160
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church?

255
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,320
And where's your wallet?

256
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
The DC9 pushing the buttons.

257
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah.

258
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,720
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up,

259
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,140
but it wasn't really a dream until I saw these...

260
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,440
sacred nasal positions.

261
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,120
And suddenly it all came back to me.

262
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,780
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

263
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,400
when they put me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me

264
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,140
and made me talk and talk and talk and talk.

265
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,380
Well, it's only an hour and a half tonight, mister.

266
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,920
And talk because you only paid for an hour and a half.

267
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Is it possible to learn this power?

268
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,260
Not from a Jedi.

269
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,780
It's a dream.

270
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,420
It's a dream.

271
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,400
It's a dream.

272
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Bob's only got getting back home on his mind now.

273
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,340
Hi, Bob!

274
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,500
Right, Bob?

275
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,800
Bob?

276
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,040
Bob?

277
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I came as a visitor, not an invader.

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
I must get back to my ship, see if I can repair it.

279
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,660
And then I must leave.

280
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,080
No, wait.

281
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,860
What harm is there in hearing them out?

282
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,980
Other than being a salesman, what does Bob do for a living?

283
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,800
Other than being a salesman?

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,500
Bob is not on Route 80 with a bag full of brushes on his head.

285
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Who has met Bob?

286
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,360
He seemed extremely paranoid. He believed in conspiracies.

287
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,940
He came on like a Nazi. I was afraid of him.

288
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,600
Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you.

289
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
We've come a long way in 5,000 years.

290
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,860
But you're still of the same nature.

291
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,780
I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand,

292
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,720
and bring you back again.

293
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,720
I can give life or death.

294
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,740
What else does mankind demand of its gods?

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,200
Mankind has no need for gods.

296
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,480
We find the one quite adequate.

297
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,700
We shall not debate, mortal.

298
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,640
No, we shall not.

299
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,760
For there is but one Bob, and he is Dobbs.

300
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

301
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,900
Friends, we've been hearing testimonials from as recently and as nearby

302
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,500
as Reverend Shane Smirker in Australica,

303
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,380
to as old and near as Dr. G. Gordon Gordon discussing his ride in the UFO

304
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,580
from the old, old subgenius media barrage albums of the 80s.

305
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,080
Friends, we heard some great preaching from Pope David and Meyer.

306
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,020
We heard that great background music by the Amino Acids, which continues.

307
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,280
We heard bits of previous X-Day Live recordings.

308
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,040
But now,

309
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
let's break for music.

310
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,420
I mean, besides this background Amino Acids music.

311
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,440
We'll be hearing from Norrell Preff,

312
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,460
and some Reverend Ed Fred,

313
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,960
and even Dr. Howell.

314
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,100
And we always hear from LeMur constantly.

315
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,120
But first, here is Saint Anne.

316
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
Brains on!

317
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,140
Are we controlled by secret forces?

318
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,020
Do you ever get it?

319
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,860
The feeling that free will is a joke?

320
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,380
Do people think you're strange?

321
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,700
Do you?

322
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,880
Then you may be on the right track.

323
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,180
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

324
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,180
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

325
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,780
Kill me.

326
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,000
Kill me.

327
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,460
And gentle friends,

328
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,280
let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully.

329
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods.

330
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
Bob?

331
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,180
Oh, if you get it like this,

332
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,000
the best pair of tits,

333
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,060
a f***ing kiss all night.

334
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,040
How much?

335
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,320
Nine times.

336
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,660
Well, give it to me.

337
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,380
I'll make it later.

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,800
Nine times.

339
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,700
Got to plug and calculate.

340
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,960
Nine times.

341
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
That don't make sense.

342
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,960
Nine times.

343
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Here comes the dice.

344
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Die, die.

345
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,520
Yeah.

346
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,860
Paris Hogan.

347
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,780
Deep Throat.

348
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,520
Bob Nau.

349
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,180
Word, word, word.

350
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:16,560
Madonna.

351
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,960
Deep, Deep Throat.

352
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,520
Bob Nau.

353
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,340
Deep Throat was a criminal.

354
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,000
Superstar.

355
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,040
The 91-year-old.

356
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,580
Drug-idic.

357
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,600
Elton John will perform.

358
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,460
Deep Throat.

359
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
Seemingly forever.

360
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,660
Deep Throat.

361
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,020
Bob.

362
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,940
That was in the, in the, uh, airport.

363
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,380
In the hall of the pressure at the airport.

364
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,480
Airport in Arizona.

365
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,080
And what the?

366
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
Where we just went boo.

367
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,520
Where we just went boo.

368
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Where we just bumped up to first class simply because we were sub-gum demons.

369
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,740
They said, you know, Bob, man, you need to be in first class.

370
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,280
Here, take this wine.

371
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,100
Take these gifts.

372
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,080
Take this seat that folds all the way back.

373
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,780
And sleep.

374
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,800
Sleep, sleep.

375
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,500
The sleep of the dead.

376
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,200
Drug-induced.

377
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,660
Pulled on a trailer by pilot Chicken John.

378
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,820
They followed the marchers.

379
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,100
Sleep of the dead.

380
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,260
One day before the death of the recent pontiff.

381
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,060
Put on this flyer.

382
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,580
Jacket.

383
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
The first of April, two thousand.

384
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,440
Put on this, this periscope.

385
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,880
And so it was.

386
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,420
I mean the parachute, not the periscope, you idiot.

387
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,960
By crucifixion and taking on.

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,340
Okay, now get ready to jump.

389
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,960
We're gonna be, we're over the area where you will be required to.

390
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,180
Taking on sin in the person's tomb.

391
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,660
Bring back the special tools that we'll need.

392
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,920
And putting it off on the cross.

393
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,800
But on the cross.

394
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,900
All pity the piteous and was rough with the rough ones.

395
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,040
Bless the Lord.

396
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


397
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


398
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


399
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


400
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


401
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


402
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


403
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


404
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


405
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


406
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,040


407
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,240
Bless you.

408
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,740
Wow, what's that?

409
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,460
Bless you.

410
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,240
Alien beings.

411
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:37,800
Bless you.

412
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
The blessings of the gods of Greece.

413
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
Look at that face.

414
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,780
By the gods.

415
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,200
Bless you.

416
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,940
May Zeus bless you.

417
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,880
I do not bow down to gods and demons, to nameless gods.

418
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,140
The son of her.

419
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,600
Zeus the father.

420
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,700
Zeus the father.

421
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,740
Deus pater.

422
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,500
Deus pater.

423
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,600
Pater omniscer.

424
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:57,940


425
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,000
Deus pater.

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,000


427
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,120


428
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,120


429
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,800
Deus pater.

430
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,420
Deus pater.

431
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,980
Deus pater.

432
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,440
Deus pater.

433
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,580
You're put on the bulletproof vest.

434
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,200
We'll need it.

435
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,860
We have to automatically attack the other shows.

436
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
We got a show on before.

437
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm, I'm doing the clean up here.

438
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,540
We left Gods all over the place here!

439
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,460
Chase the one that's burning in here.

440
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,500
There's another one, get him!

441
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,400
They're taking the security officer's handbook.

442
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,080
You're gonna need it!

443
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
That God's coming for ya, he moves!

444
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,060
Blow out the dark pepper spray!

445
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,980
Little Gods, and big Gods, and movie Gods, and book Gods...

446
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
Take the attempinator!

447
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,000
Stop gun!

448
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,340
He's...

449
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,220
The wizard stops time.

450
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,700
There's a little god crawling along the floor here, begging for mercy.

451
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,640
Here, take the survival armory key.

452
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,840
You'll have to get in there after we...

453
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,340
But he could be right outside your door.

454
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,280
Oh, I'd welcome him in.

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
Bob could be lurking outside your home.

456
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,320
Even now.

457
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,720
Bob could be getting closer and closer.

458
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,020
My God.

459
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,460
Suddenly you begin to feel it.

460
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,480
His divine subgenial radiance.

461
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,340
Piercing through the walls like radiation.

462
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,820
Piercing through my wall.

463
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,360
Piercing flesh and bone.

464
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,320
Irradiating.

465
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,040
I can feel the slack emanating off him right now.

466
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,260
Slack so powerful that it renders objects in the material world entirely permeable.

467
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,340
Until they boil over with an atomic crust of free neutrinos.

468
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,720
And cheesy.

469
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,680
Chocolate stuffing.

470
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
Here is the glowing blue purplish effect of Chilenkov's radiation.

471
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,460
Bob melts his way through the door.

472
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,360
You're trapped.

473
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,700
You can't get out the back.

474
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,280
Subgenius protoplasm has frozen the lock.

475
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,380
Ah, that's okay.

476
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,300
I got a trap door up to the attic.

477
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,320
He can't get me.

478
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,320
You've only got seconds before the Bob thing melts its way through the door.

479
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,420
The fire department is on its way, but they can't help.

480
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:54,960
It's okay.

481
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,800
We only get the flap.

482
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,380
I get the stuff in his pipe.

483
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,320
Ha ha ha ha.

484
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,960
Ha ha ha ha.

485
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,420
As far as they're concerned, Bob's just another drug.

486
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,140
Just like heroin or codeine or marijuana.

487
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,480
And, um, praise Bob.

488
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,640
Praise Bob.

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,920
You don't come down from Bob.

490
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,320
You aren't being, when you do a hit of Bob, you ain't gonna come down from it.

491
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,220
You're not gonna wake up the next morning going, oh, I feel horrible.

492
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,420
I better have some more Bob.

493
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,760
No.

494
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,760
I feel terrible.

495
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,100
I've had enough Bob.

496
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,080
I can't have any more Bob.

497
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,220
Bob's giving me too much slack.

498
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,040
Ha ha ha ha.

499
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,140
Too much slack.

500
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,040
Well, one of Bob's pithy phrases was, too much is always better than not enough.

501
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,300
Ha ha ha ha.

502
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,140
And like so many religious slogans, it really sounds good, doesn't it?

503
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,020
Ha ha ha ha.

504
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:51,640
Think how many alcohol overdoses in college students can be blamed on Bob.

505
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,240
Oh, Bob said too much is always better than not enough.

506
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,560
Phew.

507
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Ha ha ha ha.

508
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,920
Phew.

509
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:57,600
Ugh.

510
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,840
There's a second part of that.

511
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,680
There's a slogan, but it's too much of a bring down, and we lopped it off the end.

512
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,980
The second part was, but it's almost as bad.

513
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,260
Ha ha ha.

514
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,380
And that's just like, too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.

515
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,340
Ha ha ha.

516
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,600
That just doesn't do it for you, does it?

517
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,220
Ha ha ha.

518
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,720
No.

519
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,940
There's more like what mom would say.

520
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Well, I found out after years and years and years that mom was right.

521
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,700
Three squares and enough sleep will get you higher than anything.

522
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
And, uh, I wish my mom had taken her own advice.

523
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,140
Ha ha ha.

524
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,680
Three.

525
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,920
Far away.

526
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,560
It's real big around the college.

527
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,480
It appears to be rapidly increasing.

528
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,880
What happened?

529
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,860
I don't know if I can get through 11, possibly.

530
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,200
Here, let me help you.

531
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
Ha ha ha.

532
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,200
Oh, goodness.

533
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,480
Do I have to start over now?

534
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,360
Yes, you do.

535
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,160
Ha ha ha.

536
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,920
Man, that steel sink really echoes that.

537
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,500
And with that said.

538
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,100
Oh.

539
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,880
The smell, I know.

540
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:01,940
Oh.

541
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,120
Good lord.

542
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,080
I got to get to the bathroom.

543
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,380
Oh, that's not good.

544
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,140
All over my shirt.

545
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,780
Oh.

546
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,540
Yes, it is.

547
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,220
My new shirt.

548
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,640
Silly.

549
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,300
Gosh.

550
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,580
And I just put on my new shirt this morning.

551
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,140
Now, channel three doesn't work because it's all clogged up.

552
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh, no.

553
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,580
No, it doesn't.

554
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,940
I was blowing beads, man.

555
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,000
Glove beads.

556
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,380
Barfing chunks.

557
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not necessary to write this down, is it?

558
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,620
I hope you've been writing it down because there'll be a quiz at the end of the show.

559
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,140
Well, I'm sure it'll happen again.

560
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,420
The other DJ will ask you a subterranean question.

561
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,780
It'll be a quiz.

562
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,020
It'll be a really spooky quiz.

563
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,260
It's going to be the image that you don't want to see on TV.

564
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,460
I don't know if I want to use my mind.

565
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,120
Your mind is not your mind.

566
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,940
Your mind is my mind.

567
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,980
My mind is not mine.

568
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,360
My mind.

569
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,220
Its pain is really a liquid crystal display.

570
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,180
Forty years and we're still getting it right.

571
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,140
The Puzzling Evidence Show, the way the truth was meant to be heard.

572
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,800
Well, there's two reasons for that.

573
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,060
One is a secret and the other is a lie.

574
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:16,960
One.

575
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,100
Secret.

576
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,800
B.

577
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,640
A lie.

578
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,460
Big.

579
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,420
C.

580
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,320
A lie.

581
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:23,880
B.

582
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,580
The lie.

583
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,920
I can't.

584
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,120
My mind gets killed.

585
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,140
It's so confusing.

586
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:27,820
A.

587
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,120
Hi.

588
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,460
Hello.

589
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,560
Choice Q3.

590
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,880
Surveillance is a mythanthropic design flaw.

591
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,000
Choice Q4 and down come the pants.

592
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,340
See?

593
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,580
Move.

594
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,280
Stranger.

595
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,700
I think he's stupid.

596
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,320
That's why Clorox has a line of disinfecting products to get rid of kids.

597
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,100
Their lives are hell.

598
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,540
Hey little brothers and sisters.

599
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,140
Why don't you get around?

600
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,800
I've got something important to say to you.

601
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,240
Something I think you need to hear.

602
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,780
Come on now.

603
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,440
Are you sure you got your life together?

604
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,840
You think you're on top of the world.

605
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,180
But reality is about to rear its ugly head, my friends.

606
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Are you ready to face the music?

607
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,440
You're big!

608
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,120
You're big!

609
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,960
We think!

610
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,660
You're big!

611
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,260
You drive that big old SUV.

612
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,560
Draining your wallet into used to be.

613
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,840
You're in a material race you just can't win.

614
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,800
Following society is your greatest sin.

615
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,740
You are destined to fail, my friend.

616
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,220
You're gonna be poor and alone in the end.

617
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,180
You got your treasures, you got your hoard.

618
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,940
But you're only gonna end up broken board.

619
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,340
Come on, friends.

620
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,980
It's time to turn over a new leaf.

621
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,260
Unleash your weakness and get some relief.

622
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,780
Slack is king and nothing else matters.

623
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,360
Don't be pink!

624
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,760
Pull yourself up by your latex undergarments.

625
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,720
Toss away all your commercial influences.

626
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,200
The slack within you can be born again.

627
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,760
Act now.

628
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,880
This is limited time awful.

629
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
Get yours now, while supplies last.

630
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,600
Awful Void in Alaska and Hawaii.

631
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,700
Be sure to consult your doctor about any risk.

632
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


633
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


634
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


635
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


636
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


637
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


638
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


639
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


640
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


641
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,040
that might be associated with slack.

642
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,940
Yeah, I hope you learned something today.

643
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,960
Now I'm going to get myself some slack.

644
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,360
That was Ed Fred, friends.

645
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,360
We also heard from Lemur,

646
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,020
Philo, Hal, and Puzzling,

647
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,580
and some of yours truly, Reverend Stang at Winterstar.

648
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,000
Incidentally, I'll be preaching at the 25th Anniversary Starwood

649
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
in late July.

650
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,840
See subgenius.com for details.

651
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,700
We'll do that on the escape vessels if we have to.

652
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,480
We're going to let Radio Synesthesia do the live parts of the show,

653
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,920
this show, number 999.

654
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,780
The line is a mammoth heart in a little place

655
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,340
You won't get it till it's in your face

656
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
Oh, get me out

657
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,060
Out of deeper red

658
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,160
Don't panic

659
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,920
I swear I want to be

660
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Yeah

661
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,380
A useful member of society

662
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,220
I just need

663
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,600
A little of that old money

664
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
Yeah

665
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,300
Yeah

666
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:25,880


667
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:25,880


668
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,320
Come on, come on

669
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,520
Come on, come on

670
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,680
Come on, come on

671
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,120
Oh, here we go

672
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,120
Come on, come on

673
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,120


674
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,120


675
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,120


676
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,120


677
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,120


678
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,300
Yeah

679
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,320
Mob?

680
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,100
Mob?

681
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,340
Mob?

682
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,680
Well, frankly, I don't think that anybody should feel guilty about what their ancestors did.

683
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,980
You know, we don't regret the past.

684
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,020
We learn from it.

685
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,880
I'm just trying to get out of the fact that when Mom and Dad were the only ones who didn't get hurt,

686
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:55,880


687
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,200
They came back from Jonestown, and they had the guy on a passport.

688
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,720
You know, the only...

689
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,420
You should fart beyond that, you know.

690
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,580
The only regret about the acts of my ancestors that I have

691
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,020
is the fact that they ever conceived me in the first place.

692
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,240
Right, the third act, the denouement, where you come down.

693
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
You know, that's the part that gets us all.

694
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,960
Mom and Dad, well, they were stupid.

695
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,520
Grandpa and Grandma were stupider.

696
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,080
And then somewhere back there, there was like a person

697
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,620
with their brain hanging out of their head.

698
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,860
I hope my kids aren't thinking that very same thing right now.

699
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,300
They probably are, Stank.

700
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,660
They don't want to copulate because it'll look like you.

701
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,660
I've been trying to encourage my son and daughter-in-law to have a kid.

702
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,780
So it'll look like you.

703
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,440
They're the same age I was when I had a kid,

704
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,400
and the age my dad was when he had me,

705
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,640
which was a pretty freakish accident, but let's not go into that.

706
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,460
Well, the party feels better for each family only having one child.

707
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,480
What's wrong with aborting that baby?

708
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,200
Eating it.

709
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,720
If you're hungry.

710
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,500
You know, it's a good late-night snack.

711
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,760
Oh, it's a modest proposal.

712
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:04,360
It is definitely a source of many, many, many essential vitamins and minerals and whatnot.

713
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,380
You could put like a little bit of baby muscle on a trisket.

714
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,220
Oh, yeah, you know, I mean, it's also the most perfect balanced protein you can get,

715
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,740
you know, baby or fetus.

716
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,240
I just say no to kids.

717
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,240
How about this?

718
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,500
How about endovocal cords on hot dogs?

719
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,620
Like instead of a hot dog?

720
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,060
Your parents have told you no.

721
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,040
No, more often.

722
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,740
It could be just the endovocal cord in the bone.

723
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,280
By listening to this show, you have edified.

724
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,740
No mouth, no.

725
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,820
You have practically edified yourself.

726
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
Oh, you scroll forward.

727
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,880
To a state of supreme discipline.

728
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,520
And let us know, is it coming out there or is it just static?

729
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,900
I mean, we're not getting the regular feedback.

730
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,020
All this is possible.

731
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,480
If you are under the O.G.

732
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,840
That would let us know that the...

733
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,320
If I can't hear it.

734
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:52,860
If you are...

735
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
If you are not able to hear...

736
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,980
...then you must have slack.

737
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,920
Just the slack must have...

738
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,360
And it is all about the slack.

739
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,640
That's about right.

740
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,300
Sometimes slack is just a silent radio signal.

741
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,120
Or for the kids.

742
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,560
Or, you know...

743
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,800
No, we're tired of doing it for the kids now.

744
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,340
We're tired.

745
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,720
We're just doing it for the slack.

746
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,740
And the kids just don't get it.

747
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,880
That's the problem these days.

748
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,980
The kids don't appreciate slack.

749
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,260
They don't get the slack.

750
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,860
They don't appreciate it.

751
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,800
They don't understand that their forefathers...

752
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
...their fathers had to die...

753
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,720
on the field of battle to make sure that they get the slack.

754
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,440
Well, they're just kids.

755
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,280
They don't know anything.

756
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,840
But the problem is, you know, they don't teach them anything today.

757
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,200
Yeah, they don't teach them the kids.

758
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,160
Like when I was a kid, slack was part of every classroom agenda.

759
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:43,540
We would come in in the mornings and, you know, well, that's the problem.

760
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,720
Everybody here doesn't get that kind of training anymore.

761
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,180
Knock-kneed, slab-sided, social engineering, egg-sucking liberal.

762
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:57,640
You know, they used to teach us fun because it was a predecessor to slack.

763
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,900
That long-line listener just turned on the radio is what it was.

764
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,060
They couldn't get the good signal on the Internet,

765
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:12,260
so they had to turn on the full spectrum sound of the radio.

766
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
You are the loudest voice.

767
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,840
You have to imagine the show.

768
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,980
You are the loudest voice.

769
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,060
Yeah, you have to imagine what the show sounds like tonight.

770
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,520
Since we're not sure if we're going out over the broadcast airwaves,

771
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:36,520
the ones owned by the public, you, the public, own these airwaves right now

772
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
that we are signaling across.

773
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,460
It's sort of like bumping into.

774
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,220
Airy wave.

775
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,560
They respect those airwave forms.

776
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,260
Because we're going up one side and then simulating a downward.

777
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,160
They respond to attention.

778
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,740
So, what's the second experience that we see in the log and the radio?

779
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:54,740


780
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,100
We do the signal and you help us混 in.

781
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:00,680
Harmonizing audio is like theésus keeper.

782
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
You're in cookie stone, promise me.

783
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920


784
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,640


785
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,640


786
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,640


787
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,840
Now, 구름 vitesse is 100.

788
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:07,840


789
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,280
correctly.

790
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,700
Alljoyance, layer.

791
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm so happy we have a nuclear system out seawater.

792
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,040
Don't do them.

793
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,880
Here it comes.

794
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:20,880


795
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,360
These headphones have moved.

796
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,860
They're bleeding now.

797
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,160
These headphones are bleeding.

798
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,860
Well, they are another sign of the end times when headphones show bleed.

799
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,080
Really?

800
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,040
And audio.

801
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,880
So do you know the people that took the baby from the Body World show?

802
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm still trying to find out.

803
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,500
Was that Sacramento?

804
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,480
What about Trace?

805
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,860
Well, I'll trade you this shiny piece of tinfoil.

806
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,640
Yeah, Leandro.

807
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,200
Trace had one pretty good on the radio.

808
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,220
Okay, so I guess that if...

809
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,000
Now, this isn't a real caller, though.

810
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
This is just a tape.

811
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,200
No, this is a real caller right here.

812
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,120
Sure, that's what the last tape said.

813
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,520
We need to know if it's...

814
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,420
Are you a live real caller or are you a recorded?

815
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:09,860
I'm a live.

816
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,880
But you're a pre-recorded live real caller, right?

817
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,700
I think he's pre-recorded.

818
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
It's not one we know for sure.

819
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,660
He's actually listening to us in real time right now.

820
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,700
Real time.

821
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,900
One, two, three, four minutes.

822
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,300
I know that's a clever mixing technique that our operator, Puzzling Evidence,

823
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:39,400
is probably tricking the audience now into thinking that they're listening to a live show with live callers.

824
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,040
What'd he do?

825
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,020
Pseudo-religion.

826
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,820
There they go again with that.

827
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,760
Pseudo-religion.

828
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,860
Well, they're so hip.

829
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,040
They are sort of a pseudo-religion.

830
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,600
So pop.

831
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:47,680
So with it.

832
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,640
So wacky, crazy, judgmental.

833
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,640
Church of the subgenius.

834
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,860
Imaginary memories, too.

835
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,620
A lot of the newer McDonald products contain, like, synthetic memories.

836
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,220
Like you have a quarter pounder with cheese.

837
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,160
You know, you go with some old standby like that.

838
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,760
Half an hour later, you're thinking of maybe, like, mowing some people down in Baghdad or Fallujah.

839
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,940
I was there.

840
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,480
Damn it.

841
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,700
I remember.

842
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,180
Well, if you've got cow memories, it's usually pretty peaceful up until the very last one.

843
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,380
Well, as you know...

844
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,640
Not if you got mad.

845
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,200
Not...

846
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,660
Not if the memories are coming from the cows that went into the McDonald's burger.

847
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,060
Maybe if you get, like, an Amish burger, the memories would be peaceful, but...

848
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,680
You don't want the memories of the slaughterhouse.

849
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,280
You don't want the memories of the feedlot.

850
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,920
You don't want the memories of the...

851
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,400
But up until then, they're on Valium.

852
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
Not really.

853
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,960
They're on heavy doses of antibiotics and hormones.

854
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,180
I wonder which memory in the other world would be the most salient in your mind would be

855
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,840
all those goopy, happy things you did or the fact that you were being corralled in a place

856
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,460
with about 5,000 other monkeys and people were plugging you right and left.

857
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,940
That might leave a little stain, you know?

858
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,580
Bummer, man.

859
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,140
And that's what we're eating every time we eat a McBuser or a Harvey's or a Deluxe or

860
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,180
any of those things like that.

861
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:11,260
We're eating the excrement of the vegetable kingdom as well as the mineral kingdom and

862
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,080
the fuselage of the animal kingdom.

863
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,540
Hey, man.

864
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,720
And, uh...

865
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,660
Not at the stand.

866
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,060
We're at the ranch.

867
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,760
We raise cows.

868
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,740
Believe me.

869
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,280
They have a very peaceful life.

870
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,480
Oh, yeah.

871
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,600
They go out to pasture and everything, don't they?

872
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:25,780
I bet.

873
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,260
Yeah.

874
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Yeah, that's the way cows, you know, evolve to live.

875
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,600
You know, they have a nice big grassy pasture to stand around in and soak up some sun and

876
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,340
munch on some grass.

877
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,680
Yeah, we've had pure, pure capiprop.

878
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
Did they chew their cud?

879
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,880
Do these cows on your ranch actually chew their cud?

880
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,280
We don't send them to a slaughterhouse.

881
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,500
We strangle them ourselves.

882
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,720
That's the way God intended, you know?

883
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,900
With our own bare hands.

884
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,720
With our own staying strong.

885
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,320
Now, some of the ones, some of the more prized specimens you keep, right, the ones you want

886
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,600
to let die of old age, the one that you got is, you know, remember the one that's named

887
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,340
G. Gordon Gordon?

888
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,360
Right.

889
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,480
The one that saved my life when I was a little boy.

890
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,960
Yeah.

891
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,960
We didn't eat that one until it was like 40 years old.

892
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,180
Gonna talk to my attorney.

893
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,460
Gonna take a little journey.

894
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,900
Too far away.

895
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,460
Down in sub-genius land.

896
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,380
To the city that is Bobstow.

897
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,800
The place that's known as Bobstow.

898
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,440
Gonna take me down.

899
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,720
Down to sub-genius land.

900
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,260
Gonna wash my brain until my pain goes way down there.

901
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,360
Sell all my stuff I've got enough to stay down there.

902
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Way down in southeast Asia.

903
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,620
In the jungles of Malaysia.

904
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,420
Come on with me.

905
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,460
I'll take you by the hand.

906
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,160
Gonna turn my brain to porridge.

907
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,540
When they put my soul in the storage.

908
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,100
When we go down.

909
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,160
Down to sub-genius land.

910
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,720
It's the place I know where the bobbies go when they milk them dry.

911
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,140
Those endless mobs still seeking Dobbs.

912
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,260
Oh, they don't know why.

913
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,320
They don't know why.

914
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
So if you like to gamble.

915
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,480
Come and take a little ramble.

916
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,340
Just step right up and tell me I'm your man.

917
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,960
Gonna be with you in Bobstow.

918
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,260
In the city known as Dobbstow.

919
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,660
Bobstow.

920
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah.

921
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,780
When we all go down.

922
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,920
Down to sub-genius land.

923
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,260
So hop aboard, you little campers.

924
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,480
Crawl into Beelzebub's belly.

925
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,080
And down to sub-genius land you go as the master demon chews you and masticates you.

926
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,600
And you slide down the demonic esophagus to Dobbstown, Malaysia.

927
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,660
Are you eating your arms?

928
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,060
We'll stay and hang.

929
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,300
When the trumpet.

930
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
Calls.

931
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:46,900
X-Day.

932
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,280
In a brother and sister band.

933
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:53,580
When they blow the world away.

934
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,540
We shall have paradise.

935
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,220
Sub-genie of the world unite.

936
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,360
Alien sex every night.

937
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,380
Sub-genie of the world.

938
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,020
Sub-genie of the world.

939
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,020
Sub-genie of the world unite.

940
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,940
weil wir auf프rieren werden....

941
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,220
We shall have paradise.

942
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,620
S�ingteni auf der었어요nheit.

943
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,940
Radiant suks.

944
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,260
Every night.

945
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,100
Pandora's lesson has panicked you.

946
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,300
Castratum snõnai.

947
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,440
Digsea's demais.

948
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,440


949
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,440


950
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,440


951
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,440


952
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,360
The World, Santini of the World, Santini of the World, United!

953
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,020
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, live there, friends, at the Beachland Ballroom,

954
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,360
backed in part by ESO.

955
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,740
We're now around the middle of the show, 999.

956
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,600
Meanwhile, the Berkley Show has lost 10 listeners.

957
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,800
Before the beginning of the show, now we've got the 47 poor listeners.

958
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,580
Those other seven.

959
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,880
Those other seven.

960
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,740
We don't like those other seven listeners anyway.

961
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,580
We're glad they're gone.

962
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,800
We'll be down to the true believers very shortly.

963
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,580
They won't jump the rocket ship as it falls back to Earth.

964
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,080
That's right.

965
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,940
They're going to ride it down in the fullness of its furious, blazing glory.

966
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,420
One of my favorite versions of that in an actual subgenius short story is in Captain Tomorrow.

967
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:41,760
Yeah.

968
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,560
And the people.

969
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:42,560


970
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,100
The T-47 that rules the Earth.

971
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm set for tomorrow.

972
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,020
General Motors said today that it will eliminate PR News.

973
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:58,160
The cuts should save about $2.5 a year and move the world's biggest automaker back toward PR News.

974
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,140
A senior Palestinian official complained to some of Africa's poorest countries.

975
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,660
Stocks 1, 10, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

976
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,700
President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are holding a joint at the White House.

977
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,560
President Bush.

978
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,000
Bush said that Blair has been seeking a deal he hopes to present to PR News in Washington.

979
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,700
Anybody got the, anybody know the scientific name for poison ivy?

980
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
Um, no.

981
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,580
It's also, it's also a homeopathic remedy.

982
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,900
A homopathic remedy.

983
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
Uva scurpus.

984
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:41,700
You know, the great thing about homeopathic remedies is you could poison an entire city water supply with just a few molecules of a poison.

985
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,500
No, you couldn't.

986
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,800
You couldn't.

987
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,560
Yeah, but, you know, where do you find the right homeos to do the job?

988
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,060
Well, you know.

989
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,860
I maintain that it's one of the biggest frauds ever perpetuated in the history of medical science, actually.

990
00:39:53,080 --> 00:40:03,780
Well, think about it, you know, but according to the way homeopathy works, it's almost like the less of a, the greater the dilution, the more powerful the medicine.

991
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,240
So if you just put one or two molecules of, say, cyanide into the city, I mean.

992
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,180
Then everybody will be immune to cyanide poisoning.

993
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:11,900
Oh.

994
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,420
Uh.

995
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,220
No, I don't think it actually works that way.

996
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,500
I don't know.

997
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,960
Like, uh, there's quite a bit of research out there that is, uh, questionable, puzzling, um.

998
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,500
It was kind of invented back when they knew even less about medicine than we do now.

999
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,180
Associative magic.

1000
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,200
You know, like.

1001
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,260
See, like, okay, like homeopathic.

1002
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,820
Homeopathy was invented 200 years ago, about.

1003
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,380
Uh, at a time when they were still using leeches.

1004
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,160
And they kept on finding that leeches kept on, you know, a lot of patients kept on dying when they used these leeches.

1005
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,480
And they didn't understand, like, this is good medicine, right?

1006
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,480


1007
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,480


1008
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,480


1009
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,480


1010
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:42,480


1011
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,240
Yeah, they're not the leeches now.

1012
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,440
But then when they figured out that if you give them a sugar pill, the sugar pill won't kill them the way the leeches might.

1013
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,300
So suddenly they found something that worked better than leeches.

1014
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,220
And they've been doing it ever since.

1015
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,420
Psychotherapy.

1016
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:53,980
No.

1017
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,940
Um.

1018
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,960
Mind control?

1019
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:56,980
Yeah.

1020
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,620
Bad medicine.

1021
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,020
All these things and more.

1022
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,300
Perhaps.

1023
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,140
Come on down to Dr. Sinister's office.

1024
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,160
Lay down on the couch.

1025
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Tell me your problems.

1026
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,840
I'll prescribe you a homeopathic remedy.

1027
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,460
Okay.

1028
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,600
Okay.

1029
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,140


1030
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1031
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1032
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1033
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1034
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1035
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1036
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1037
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1038
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1039
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1040
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1041
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1042
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1043
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1044
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,480


1045
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
I'll give you some oleum serpentus.

1046
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,340
They all have the Latin names, too, so you don't know what they really are.

1047
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:24,080
Because if, like, if you found out that you were paying $5 for a jar of, uh, natrium muriaticum,

1048
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,760
and, like, it didn't even have any natrium muriaticum in it, and you could make it yourself at home for...

1049
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,420
Do you know what natrium muriaticum is?

1050
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,580
Salt.

1051
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:32,740
Salt.

1052
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,880
Oh, yes.

1053
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,680
Uh, somebody called up, uh, to a store once asking for, uh,

1054
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,340
I'm looking for a homeopathic remedy called Diplombum.

1055
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,140
I'm looking for a homeopathic remedy called Diplombum.

1056
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:43,200
I'm looking for a homeopathic remedy called Diplombum.

1057
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,800
And the salesman said, oh, yes, metallic lead.

1058
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,440
Yes, uh, we have some of that right over here.

1059
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
He's like, where would I want to put lead in my body?

1060
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,440
So these people, they take these medicines, they don't even know how they're made or how they're supposed to work.

1061
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,120
And, uh, it's kind of ridiculous.

1062
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,380
Like, once you tell them how it's supposed to work and how they're made, they're like, that can't work.

1063
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,840
And yet, there are people who swear by that stuff.

1064
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,980
Because they believe.

1065
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,540
And if you notice, you notice a lot of, a lot of the complaints that they prescribe these things for are things that would go away on their own in an hour anyway.

1066
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,240
Right.

1067
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,440
Right.

1068
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:12,460
Right.

1069
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:20,040
The injections on all of them are like, you know, dissolve two to four tablets under the tongue once every hour for four hours until symptoms disappear.

1070
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,160
Lay down in bed for 20 minutes and headache will go away.

1071
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,560
Yeah.

1072
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:24,560


1073
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,820
You know, silly stuff like that.

1074
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
Oleum Serpentis.

1075
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,280
That's my favorite.

1076
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:36,700
Well, the ear candling is a good example of, uh, I mean, I saw people absolutely believe in that stuff.

1077
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,780
Well, ear candling can do some things, but not a lot of the things that people claim it can do.

1078
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,060
It's the same thing.

1079
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,020
The only thing is there's no ear attached to it.

1080
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,400
Well, as far as pulling out wax goes, it won't, will not, ear candle will not pull wax out of your ear.

1081
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,780
No.

1082
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,760
It will put wax in your ear.

1083
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,520
It does not care.

1084
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,280
I've tried it before.

1085
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,580
Exactly.

1086
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,320
Those funnels that you have to wear.

1087
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:54,980
Yeah.

1088
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,580
They make, you know, people burn crosses on your yard and they, you know.

1089
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:58,740
Right.

1090
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,980
And it doesn't keep the saucer beams out of your head or the government beams out of your head.

1091
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,460
It doesn't pollute.

1092
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:04,820
It doesn't pollute.

1093
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:11,640
Although, although it can have an effect on the air pressure balances between the head, you know, the ears and the sinus.

1094
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,660
And all that stuff.

1095
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,000
Well, the overall barometric pressure.

1096
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,740
So you can change like the pressure maybe.

1097
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,620
The FDA and the DEA.

1098
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,000
But, you know, you're not going to be pulling out the wax.

1099
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,980
It'll show up at your house later, but.

1100
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:26,040
Although, I can say that it's probably, you know, if you have the evil spirits in your head that cause those voices all the time,

1101
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,520
the ear candle can draw out the evil spirits and burn them up.

1102
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:29,860
Right.

1103
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,180
So you won't hear those voices anymore.

1104
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,600
And you won't get an orgone ear candling.

1105
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:32,880
Ooh.

1106
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,660
Yeah.

1107
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,400
That is especially efficacious.

1108
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,020
Don't even get me started on the orgone.

1109
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:37,820
Yep.

1110
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,660
The Reikian.

1111
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,420
The Reikian candles are.

1112
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,900
They're shaped like little PP, PP, PP32s.

1113
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,120
And they, they can take down flying saucers.

1114
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,580
Yeah.

1115
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,260
They can, they can cause rain.

1116
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,960
They're like rain making machines and flying saucer repellent.

1117
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,680
I bought one of those things to keep flying saucers and ghosts away.

1118
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,080
And I tell you, man, it has worked fantastically.

1119
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,340
Yeah, but you got a really good one, Stang, when you had that stroke of luck and you spent the extra money.

1120
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,200
You know, a lot of people can't afford that kind of thing around their house.

1121
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,340
Yeah, I was, I was lucky to get, I got a really good deal and it came along at a good time.

1122
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:27,300
But, you know, it has kept supernatural beings, really every order of supernatural invasive creature away.

1123
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,080
Well, the ones that aren't that good, you know, seep and leak.

1124
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:41,040
The next thing you know, you think you're living in a good place to live and there's an alien ghost, you know, at your dinner table, you know, saying, you know, the coffee sucks.

1125
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,520
It's a fine.

1126
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,120
It's a fine time for the computer here to start crashing on me when I need to place.

1127
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,260
Okay, here we go.

1128
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm stupid.

1129
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,780
That's why Clorox has a line of products that can make kids sick.

1130
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,400
Yes.

1131
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,780
What is left of Bob's right brain?

1132
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,860
In Bob's right brain, there's nothing left.

1133
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,920
In his left brain, nothing works right.

1134
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,560
So don't depend on him for cosmic wisdom.

1135
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,880
We worship Bob only because he's luckier and better and smarter.

1136
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,940
Well, he's not smarter.

1137
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,120
He's actually just lucky.

1138
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,300
That's why we call it subgenius.

1139
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:31,340
We believe that intelligence has been misdefined by the conspiracy of the normals.

1140
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,100
And they equate it now with book smarts.

1141
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:41,020
Whereas what Bob is talking about is common sense, sense of humor.

1142
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,340
And dollars and cents.

1143
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:51,560
Which reminds me, I have a trunk load of CDs of our radio shows.

1144
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,720
MP3 collections where you can get like 60 radio shows in one disc.

1145
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,300
We've got DVDs.

1146
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,580
And I can do marriages.

1147
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:07,460
If you need just a 24-hour marriage, say you're a young couple or three, four, just you and your hand.

1148
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,200
I don't care what.

1149
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,380
You need to feel absolved for like 24 hours or so.

1150
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,700
You don't want to really get hitched.

1151
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,180
I can take care of that.

1152
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,900
I'm ordained enough.

1153
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,940
And if I'm not, then there's a lot of people living in sin.

1154
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,440
And a lot of people who wasted money on divorces.

1155
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,820
I don't have nearly as many workers around here at the church headquarters as I used to.

1156
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,080
We had to lay.

1157
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:38,280
We had to lay off.

1158
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,500
God, you know, half of the factory staff.

1159
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,940
Bob is a stingy, stingy master.

1160
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,340
I've lost a lot of limousines and mansions.

1161
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,140
Outsourced to Planet X.

1162
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,700
I had to sell old Bessie.

1163
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,660
Those damn exists, they work for peanuts.

1164
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,020
How can we compete for our jobs with exists?

1165
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,620
687-3515.

1166
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,360
Oh, I thought we had another caller.

1167
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,240
They don't believe in the exist aliens.

1168
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,000
They believe in the gray aliens.

1169
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:03,940
Right.

1170
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,000
You know, sure, they're there.

1171
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,320
But those are like, you know.

1172
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,000
I just believe in the off-white ones.

1173
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,480
Those are no-account, worthless bunch of...

1174
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,420
The Manila aliens.

1175
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,700
They're hardly any more advanced than we are.

1176
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,100
Yes?

1177
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,560
I'm kind of new to all this, and I was wondering what Bob's last name is.

1178
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

1179
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,280
His full name is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1180
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,640
Dobbs is his last name.

1181
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,460
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1182
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,920
The J.R. doesn't stand for anything.

1183
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,300
And he has, quote, Bob, unquote, is on his birth certificate.

1184
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,900
People occasionally will say, well, Bob's just made up character, isn't he?

1185
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,900
Would you say that to a Christian?

1186
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,100
Oh, Jesus just made up character, isn't he?

1187
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,200
People just don't, you know, they don't have sensitivity about these things.

1188
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,060
Is the pipe important to Bob?

1189
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,880
Some think that the pipe is the one calling the shots.

1190
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,700
Look at this T-shirt.

1191
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,460
This is a really unusual one.

1192
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,060
I didn't realize this until about...

1193
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,280
an hour ago.

1194
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,840
I was thinking, well, Bob's smoking this brain, right?

1195
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,320
And his brain's on fire.

1196
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,740
There's another way of looking at this.

1197
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:23,040
This brain is sucking Bob's brain through the pipe.

1198
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,940
The fire is up here.

1199
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,280
Bob lit...

1200
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,180
I mean, the brain lit Bob's head up here

1201
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,720
and is smoking his brain through the pipe.

1202
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,540
And you can do that, too.

1203
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,600
The next time you see Bob,

1204
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,160
run up there and put a...

1205
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,240
a lip lock on that big old pipe and suck.

1206
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,800
I know that early in your life

1207
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,020
you took that wrong turn expecting to find the truth.

1208
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,920
And yet, you're still looking.

1209
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,220
You're still looking.

1210
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,880
And somehow, stumbling through the radio dial late at night,

1211
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,600
you come across...

1212
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,140
Wait, you got me.

1213
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:01,960
Oh, no, you lost it.

1214
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,540
The Puzzling Evidence Show.

1215
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,060
And finally, you said to yourself,

1216
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,940
this is what I've been seeking my entire life.

1217
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,300
Of course, if it's a digital tuner, you've been here all along.

1218
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,980
Aficionados of politics find the show obsessive.

1219
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:27,200
Queen Zizi of Z finds the show...

1220
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,040
We don't know what she means by that.

1221
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,920
We're still looking for the translation device.

1222
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,180
But the Bible is a difficult book to interpret.

1223
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,160
It's all Star Trek.

1224
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,380
It contains puzzles and textual variants

1225
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,540
that are just mind-numbing in a...

1226
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,640
Is Hal asleep?

1227
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,120
Yes, he's asleep.

1228
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:49,920
He's disappeared.

1229
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,360
He's completely intangible.

1230
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:51,660
He's just...

1231
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,860
He's discorporate at this point.

1232
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,780
Incorpor-real.

1233
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,220
And we will check and see if there's any life form left.

1234
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:58,920
Oh, damn it.

1235
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,400
I won't wait.

1236
00:49:59,400 --> 00:49:59,860
I can't wait.

1237
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,000
We've driven them down to 35.

1238
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,140
They're the 35 true core listeners.

1239
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,760
The audience elimination experiment is a success.

1240
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,360
This is the way.

1241
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,920
Radio listeners,

1242
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,680
I hear Hal's nose on the microphone.

1243
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:11,960
Hal's nose.

1244
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:14,280
The only thing that's left of Hal is his nose

1245
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,660
stuck to the end of the microphone.

1246
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,460
The rest of his body has completely disintegrated

1247
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,800
into a jelly-like mass at the base of his chair.

1248
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,440
And yet somehow or another,

1249
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,960
it's still jiggling and wiggling like jello.

1250
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:31,080
It is jello.

1251
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,380
Here, try some.

1252
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,000
This is great.

1253
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,860
You're puzzling.

1254
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,700
Try some of this.

1255
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,580
It tastes like fruit.

1256
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,540
It's good.

1257
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,060
I don't know how.

1258
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,140
Oh, man.

1259
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,760
Hal's got us this great.

1260
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,320
It's like what fruit tastes like on Jupiter.

1261
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,040
Man, who would have known Hal had all this jello?

1262
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,320
Who wants to go to Jupiter?

1263
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,600
Thank God we don't have to worry about the fate of Iraq anymore.

1264
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,660
We've got Hal's jello.

1265
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,180
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

1266
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,640
Yes.

1267
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,000
Mmm.

1268
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:09,900
Mmm.

1269
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
This Hal jello is indeed something else.

1270
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,580
Friends, Hal jello and Dr. Philodrum and Slime

1271
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,760
will be at 8X Day,

1272
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,080
as will the amino acids heard in the background,

1273
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,560
and Reverend Susie the Floozy,

1274
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,340
yours truly, Reverend Nikki Death Chick,

1275
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,540
and Dr. Dark's drive-in bad film theater every night.

1276
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,580
And you can, too,

1277
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,900
if you find out, uh, how.

1278
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,520
At subgenius.com, friends.

1279
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,480
It's kind of an adults-only website,

1280
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,220
and it's kind of an adults-only festival.

1281
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
But, but, kids or adults can write to subgenius

1282
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,640
at this number coming up.

1283
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,440
Got that pencil ready?

1284
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:55,840
That's subgenius at P.O. Box 181417,

1285
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,180
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1286
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:06,020
Once again, that's Box 181417,

1287
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,880
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1288
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,900
And, friends,

1289
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:21,160
Lee Murr will now give us the rest of the information.

1290
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,300
One, three, zero, one, three.

1291
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,440
Bob?

1292
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,880
One, three, zero, one, three.

1293
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1294
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1295
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1296
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1297
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1298
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1299
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1300
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1301
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1302
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1303
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1304
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1305
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1306
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1307
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:37,880


1308
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:43,860
Bob?

1309
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,640
Bob?

1310
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,300
Bob?

1311
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,980
Bob's a small guy, physically, I'm pretty convinced.

1312
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:50,460
Uh huh.

1313
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,760
You seen the photographs?

1314
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,720
Are those the autopsy photographs that were rearranged

1315
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,900
to look like choir photographs?

1316
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,760
I never trust an autopsy photo.

1317
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,100
Now, don't get us wrong.

1318
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,780
God loves you.

1319
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,860
God really does love you,

1320
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,840
but Bob, Bob Wants You!

1321
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:07,880
God loves you, Bob.

1322
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1323
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1324
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1325
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1326
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1327
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1328
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1329
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1330
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1331
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1332
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1333
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:07,880


1334
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,680
you but old Bobby, old Bobby wants you

1335
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,400
and he's going to find you friends

1336
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,420
you can't find yourself

1337
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,680
you think you're going to find yourself

1338
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,040
better than Bob can

1339
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,220
are you that prideful

1340
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,860
I tell you what friends

1341
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,480
I'll find myself when they pry me

1342
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,280
out of my cold dead fingers

1343
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,420
so follow

1344
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,720
that pie

1345
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
follow that pie

1346
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,260
pipe-er out of

1347
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,340
Conditch to glorious

1348
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,960
Dobstown friends

1349
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,160
but you can't just talk about it

1350
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,240
like I'm doing up here

1351
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,700
you have to do it, you have to actually do it

1352
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,160
you can't be a chicken shit

1353
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,940
so build your own ship

1354
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,300
and evacuate or vacate

1355
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,040
the evacuation chamber

1356
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,020
god damn it

1357
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,520
this church of the subgenius

1358
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,060
sure it's a joke sometimes

1359
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,400
but why can't it also be the one true religion

1360
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,820
this is the

1361
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,220
divinity school of hard

1362
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,440
knocks my friends

1363
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,980
and it actually is

1364
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,940
as real

1365
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,780
as it gets

1366
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,620
as Dr. Legume said

1367
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,620
we will lead this damn nation

1368
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,240
to damnation

1369
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,540
and as

1370
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,900
Princess We Are Doe said

1371
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,740
we are good

1372
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,480
but we're our own brand of good

1373
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,400
so friends

1374
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,500
in closing

1375
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,340
I want to get off here and get some slack myself

1376
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,680
I have refrained from taking any drugs

1377
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,760
until five minutes from now

1378
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,460
but in closing

1379
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,340
I want to reiterate friends

1380
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,660
when you need slack

1381
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,220
you make your own slack

1382
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,640
make your own slack

1383
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,860
and build your own ship

1384
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,760
Bob Dobbs is not the answer

1385
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,980
and neither is anything else

1386
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,080
you must learn

1387
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,700
to think for yourself

1388
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,720
only Bob can show you how

1389
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,780
and friends

1390
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,160
the last thing

1391
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,880
the most important thing of all

1392
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,520
fuck them if they can't

1393
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,360
take a joke

1394
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,660
and praise Bob

1395
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,920
happy X day

1396
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,860
Bob bless y'all

1397
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,380
if I don't see you no more in this world

1398
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,180
I'll meet you on the next one

1399
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,380
and don't be late

1400
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,360
I cut my finger on a soup can lid

1401
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,980
I got an infection and it spread to my dick

1402
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,940
it swelled up to the size of a human hand

1403
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,980
and then a mouth opened on it

1404
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,080
and this is what it said

1405
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,580
kill the pink boys

1406
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,700
quit your job

1407
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,940
mocks the world

1408
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,340
and praise Bob Dobbs

1409
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,340
we'll build a ship

1410
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,640
and take a trip

1411
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,980
go on go get a pen

1412
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,840
write the coordinates

1413
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,700
three and a half months in my garage

1414
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,460
tearing parts off of old used cars

1415
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,940
my groin at this point was unusually large

1416
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,520
and went occasionally home while smoking cigars

1417
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,860
the project was finished

1418
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,020
the ship would hold twenty

1419
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,640
the power source was anything the crew would think was funny

1420
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,880
we didn't need the slack

1421
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:06,920
we just needed to get the fuck out of here

1422
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1423
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1424
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1425
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1426
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1427
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1428
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1429
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:06,920


1430
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,720
we're blacklist they're hapless

1431
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:10,280
our north proved its worth in escaping the stark fist

1432
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,420
on our way to planet X for sex direct snacks

1433
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:16,140
a prairie squid and every pot of money shot a coney twang

1434
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,960
it's an all-horse hour of bonanza

1435
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,920
it's like a world without Tony Danza

1436
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,800
or fans of the pink shit that hits the charts

1437
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,140
in a world of dead art

1438
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,320
simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

1439
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,480
we take a moment and we pause to reflect

1440
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,240
on the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

1441
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,780
then we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches

1442
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,580
do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

1443
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,280
our fantasy is a reality

1444
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,700
earth's tarnished to dust as planet X are bust for us

1445
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,920
Bob's pipe is lit

1446
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,100
space and time shift

1447
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,060
temporal disturbance

1448
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,920
that causes a slack rift

1449
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,940
and the drop then a hit

1450
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,040
a dimensional split

1451
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,880
severs forever subgeni from pink shit

1452
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,000
Bob walked in a circle

1453
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,760
and steadily exhaled in the smoke

1454
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,840
I can see why the pink boys failed

1455
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,300
two pay-a-days has caused destruction

1456
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,940
second hole of slackless suction

1457
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,440
pay-per-view alien abduction

1458
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,560
functioning on solar energy

1459
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,340
the money should be painted black

1460
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,960
the mate from space that stole your balls

1461
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,380
will soon come back and take it all

1462
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,160
return to slack return to Bob

1463
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,680
repent slack off and quit your job

1464
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,500
or slurp the beastly knob

1465
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,240
concrete

1466
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,840
lick the throbbing vein of slavery

1467
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,440
now you're sleeping like a baby

1468
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,000
but Bob woke me up and said

1469
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,820
get out of dodge

1470
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,400
there's a guy who's dick and top with a UFO in his garage

1471
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,940
I ate some bad ham and I got really sick

1472
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:36,560
and in a puddle of my puke went a

1473
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,560
the puke was most sick

1474
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,660
a mouth did appear

1475
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:40,000
and it beckoned me near

1476
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,560
and it whispered the following words into my ear

1477
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:42,900
it said

1478
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,260
kill the pink boys

1479
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,400
quit your job

1480
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,520
mock the world

1481
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,860
and praise Bob Dobbs

1482
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,060
you'll build a ship

1483
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,160
and take a trip

1484
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,480
go on go get a pen

1485
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,380
write the coordinates

1486
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,280
six and a half months hold up alone

1487
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,820
circuit boards duct tape and turkey bones

1488
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,360
the ship appeared more than disaster prone

1489
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,080
but the vomit assured me that far weirder ships had flown

1490
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,340
the project was finished

1491
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,700
the ship would hold twenty

1492
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,560
the power source would be gone

1493
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1494
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1495
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1496
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1497
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1498
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1499
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1500
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:06,560


1501
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,220
the universe was anything the crew would think was funny

1502
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
we didn't need the slack list or hapless

1503
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,720
our murk proved its worth in escaping the star fist

1504
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,060
on our way to planet X for sex that wrecks necks

1505
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,560
the prairie squid and every pot of money shot at Connie Twan

1506
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,500
it's an all-horse hour of bonanza

1507
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,080
it's like a world without Tony Danza

1508
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,340
or fans of the pink shit that hits the charts

1509
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,680
in a world of dead art

1510
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,840
simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

1511
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,020
we take a moment and we pause to reflect

1512
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,620
on the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wreck

1513
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,300
then we laugh like banshees and howl like Comanches

1514
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,100
do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

1515
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,820
our fantasy is a reality

1516
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,760
earth turns to dust it's planet X or bust

1517
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:53,020
planet X or bust

1518
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:59,680
the great classic by the great El Queso All Stars

1519
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,520
praise Bob

1520
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,680
god damn funky

1521
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,420
man it's too tight

1522
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,140
it's too tight

1523
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,240
Bob

1524
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,020
Bob

1525
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,380
Bob

1526
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,700
Bob

1527
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,540
Bob

1528
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:29,660
Bob

1529
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:29,660


1530
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:29,840
Bob
